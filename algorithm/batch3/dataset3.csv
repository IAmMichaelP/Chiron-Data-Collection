https://foodbabe.com/fda-banning-artificial-dyes-from-our-food-watch-my-speech-at-the-hhs/,FDA banning artificial dyes from our food. Watch my speech at the HHS.,0,"I just had the most impactful day in my entire career as a food activist. For so many years, I have said “The FDA is asleep at the wheel”. Now I no longer need to say that. I flew to Washington D.C. on Tuesday to witness HHS Secretary Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary make the historical announcement that they are officially phasing out artificial dyes from all food sold in the country. (2) You can watch the replay of the full HHS event here. From the moment my kids were born, I taught them the truth about artificial food dyes because our government was doing nothing to protect them from these harmful ingredients. The science is there, and has been for over a decade. These dyes are made from petroleum and since 2010 products containing them require a warning label in Europe that states they “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children”. Artificial dyes have also been linked to cancer and disruptions in the immune system. Artificial dyes are one of the most problematic ingredients in the American food supply, and food companies often add them to products that are targeted towards and marketed towards our children. Whether it’s red for Valentine’s Day, or pastel yellow & blue for Easter, or red & green for Christmas, or orange for Halloween…virtually all holiday “treats” are artificially dyed. This is the reason why I’ve struggled with the parties at my children’s school and dreaded the “Holiday Death Aisle” that shows up in stores every season. Now we’re going to live in a world where we no longer have to worry about this. Imagine a world where we have… Birthday cakes that aren’t frosted with petroleum-based dyes contaminated with carcinogens. Breakfast cereals without the fluorescent dyes that harm a child’s ability to focus in school. Dye-Free candy in your child’s Halloween bucket that doesn’t harm their brains. Chips and sports drinks on the soccer field, naturally colored with fruit and vegetable extracts like they use in Europe. Parents across the nation have been tirelessly scouring ingredient labels, trying to avoid artificial dyes in their food and in their children’s food. Now, in 2 years, they’re not going to need to do this anymore. This will help every American out there who doesn’t know the truth about our food… Who is struggling for answers on their children’s health problems when they can be solved with food. Because food is medicine. This is the first step at reducing the amount of toxic ingredients in our food supply and safeguarding American children. Dr. Makary addressed this in his first few weeks at the FDA, which is incredible. I’m very thankful that we now have intellectual honesty coming out of the FDA, focused on looking at the updated science on food additives that American food companies are not using in other countries. The FDA is no longer turning a blind eye, and bowing down to corporate interests. The FDA is no longer asleep at the wheel! They have woken up and are steering us towards a healthier future for our children. This is what propelled me into becoming a food activist. Over 12 years ago, I did an investigation comparing products in Europe with the same products in America. (3) I was shocked and disgusted that companies like Kraft, for example, were creating safer Mac n’ Cheese without artificial dyes in other countries while they sold Americans an inferior version of their product with artificial dyes made from petroleum. I was so angered by the situation that I started my first nationwide petition demanding that Kraft remove the artificial dyes in America. (4) After 365,000 petition signatures, a visit to their headquarters, and a viral grassroots campaign, Kraft removed the artificial dyes. (5) We went on to successfully campaign several other billion-dollar corporations to change including Subway, Anheuser-Busch, and Starbucks. The wins were coming in and food companies were making changes, but it wasn’t coming quick enough. Making matters more difficult, we were confronted with a deluge of industry-funded attacks that stifled our progress. Although I was proud of the work that the “Food Babe Army” was doing, I became increasingly frustrated that our government was turning a blind eye and allowing food companies to poison Americans with ingredients that are either banned or restricted in other countries. This past September I had the opportunity to testify before the U.S. Senate where I displayed the blatant hypocrisy of American food companies selling safer products in Europe and Canada, without artificial dyes and other man-made food additives. (1) I shared the work that everyday citizens and the Food Babe Army have been doing on a grassroots level to force these companies to change over the last 10 years… And then I addressed the elephant in the room. I looked everybody in the eye that day and asked: “Isn’t this something that the people in Washington, our elected politicians, should be doing?” Then in October (6 short months ago!) one thousand of us marched to Kellogg’s headquarters and demanded that they remove the artificial dyes from their cereals like they have done in nearly every other country in the world — Moms, dads, doctors, teachers, and concerned citizens from all over the country stood up for the health of our children, and we were met with a cold corporate slap in the face. (6) We didn’t give up and we stayed loud! I’ve been traveling the country over the last few months with several of my colleagues and fellow activists, including Calley Means and Jason Karp, in support of various state bills to remove artificial dyes from the food sold in schools, and in some instances, in the entire state. Just last month, West Virginia became the first state to ban all artificial dyes from food sold in the state, despite efforts of Big Food lobbyists to dismantle the legislation. All of this has been setting the stage for this at the federal level and now it’s happening! This was the effort of so many amazing activists, nonprofit organizations, documentaries, podcasters, celebrities, authors, health leaders, doctors and everyday citizens who have used their platforms and voices to elevate this to the center stage. I especially want to recognize and thank some incredible allies. Thank you Calley Means for standing by my side and making this happen right along with me. Thank you Jason Karp for bringing me out of “retirement.” Thank you Ryland Englehart for planting this seed. Thank you Zuri Allen, John Roulac, Gary Ruskin, Del Bigtree, Zen Honeycutt, and Max Goldberg for your friendship, support, and expert guidance over the years. Thank you Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) and Environmental Working Group (EWG) for your incredible research and activism. Thank you Lisa Leake who started the Kraft petition with me all those years ago, and Pulin Modi at Change.org. Look at where we are now! I’m so grateful for all of you who marched with me to Kellogg’s last October, some of you traveling across the country to take part in the biggest petition ever asking a food corporation to change. I was blown away by your support and activism Courtney Swan, Alex Clark, Max Goldberg, Ginny Yurich, Dr. Will Cole, Dr. Josh Axe, Iliriana Balaj, Parker Brook, Iman Hasan, Dr. Staci Whitman, Dr. Joel Gator, Zuri Star, Rob Herring, Liana Werner-Gray, State Representative Brad Paquette, and State Senator Jonathan Lindsey. When Kellogg’s told us to get off their lawn, they didn’t fully appreciate the public uproar it would create. And now the reckoning has taken place. Because you made your voice heard…this is now FINALLY being addressed by the FDA. We couldn’t have done this without everyone who signed and shared our petitions over the years, and told everyone to boycott these food corporations who are poisoning us with ingredients they don’t use in other countries. Thank you for being loud and coming together on this issue. Finally, thank you Secretary Kennedy and Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary for your brave leadership in safeguarding our children. It’s not just the dyes. American food companies are knowingly using several ingredients here in this country that they’ve removed abroad due to stricter regulations and to avoid warning labels. This isn’t just about ingredients, this is a moral issue. It is unethical and needs to stop. I am looking forward to seeing every American food company remove ALL risky ingredients from their products that they don’t use in other countries. It’s time to bring this to an end!!! Let’s celebrate this win together Food Babe Army!"
https://foodbabe.com/my-visit-to-the-white-house-exposing-big-food-and-advocating-major-food-chemical-reform/,My Visit To The White House – Exposing Big Food and Advocating Major Food Chemical Reform,0,"Someone needs to pinch me, because I almost can’t believe this is happening… I was invited to speak at the White House this week to advocate for safer food for our children. I was joined by a powerful coalition of moms who all want to get the harmful chemicals out of our food to protect our future generations. To have this opportunity to expose the truth about how Big Food poisons us with ingredients they don’t use overseas was a DREAM COME TRUE. I had my charts with me to show how billion-dollar corporations like PepsiCo, Kellogg’s, Mars, General Mills and Coca-Cola make safer versions of their products to sell in other countries. You could hear gasps in the room as I went through the ingredient comparisons! It was extraordinary to sit there across from the Department Secretaries (HHS, USDA, Education) where this is now a major topic of discussion! I’m so grateful that we now have leaders at the highest levels of government who are making this a top priority and looking to make changes fast. This week really felt like a “pinch me” moment because I can’t believe how far we’ve come in just the past few months… Everything has been moving so fast, but nothing can stop us now. This week I also spoke at the Florida State Capital in support of a bill that will require warning labels on products with artificial dyes, just like they have in Europe. This is our moment! But there is so much work to be done. Most people still don’t know that food corporations have reformulated safer products to sell in Europe. Thank you for continuing to share and for being part of the Food Babe Army!"
https://foodbabe.com/wk-kelloggs-ceo-gary-pilnick-breaks-his-silence-on-poisoning-american-kids-with-artificial-dyes-they-dont-use-overseas-video/,WK Kellogg’s CEO Gary Pilnick breaks his silence on poisoning American kids with artificial dyes they don’t use overseas (VIDEO),0,"WK Kellogg’s CEO Gary Pilnick finally breaks his silence since we delivered over 400,000 petitions to their front door on October 15th. On that day we made history when close to 1,000 of us marched to their headquarters, asking them to remove the artificial dyes and BHT that they don’t use in other countries from their cereals. (1) They ignored us and employees put a sign in the window that said “Get Off My Lawn”. Kellogg’s executives refused to meet with me or any of the fellow activists, health leaders, and elected officials who were there with us that day. (1) Since then, a massive Kellogg’s cereal boycott was started and Froot Loops sales have declined OVER 50% in the last 3 months (according to SPINS data). (2) Our petition and boycott has been splashed all over the media, Good Morning America, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal… and yet Kellogg’s has remained largely silent. Until now… Mr. Pilnick was interviewed at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer & Retail Conference on December 4, 2024, where he was questioned about the massive amounts of news coverage on their use of these artificial dyes in American cereals. (3) When I heard the CEO of Kellogg’s respond to why they use these dyes in America…but not in other countries…my mouth dropped to the floor! If his cockiness and patronizing tone doesn’t make you want to boycott them even harder, I don’t know what will. I am honestly horrified that he sounds proud they are in the news for poisoning American children, while serving so many other countries better and safer ingredients. Kellogg’s company does not deserve one more red cent of our money. Megan Clapp deserves a round of applause for asking the question that no other financial analyst has been brave enough to ask! For them to go on the record saying “the reason why we use colors in our food is because we know it’s safe” without addressing the mountains of research and health experts who say otherwise is irresponsible. They may try to pull the wool over our eyes, but the truth is getting out! And that is because of all of you who are sharing this information and voting with your dollars at the grocery store. Please keep spreading the word. You are all so amazing! #CancelKelloggs"
https://foodbabe.com/general-mills-has-been-put-on-notice-remove-dyes-from-lucky-charms-cinnamon-toast-crunch-and-trix-in-america/,"General Mills has been put on notice: Remove dyes from Lucky Charms, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Trix in America!",0,"Our movement is growing bigger and faster than I could have ever imagined. We are right in the middle of the onslaught on Kellogg’s, however… other companies need to take notice. General Mills, who is also complicit with poisoning Americans with ingredients they don’t use in other countries came out with Trix in Australia (made in joint venture of General Mills and Nestle) that says right on the front of the box that it has “No Artificial Colours”. Meanwhile in America they’re using 3 Artificial Dyes PLUS unidentified additional “color added”…which could be Titanium Dioxide (an ingredient linked to cancer and banned in Europe). Soon after they removed the dyes, General Mills reported that sales “exceeded expectations” with great feedback from customers… But later claimed that people missed the fluorescent-colored Trix and had to put the dyes back. I’d eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch nearly every day when I was a kid and now I come to find out they use the same caramel coloring that we successfully campaigned to get removed from Starbucks drinks back in 2015. There are four different types of caramel color and two of those types (Class III and IV) contain the dangerous substance 4-methylimidazole (4-MeI), which is linked to cancer. You won’t find the type (class) of caramel color on an American ingredient label, although this is required to be labeled in Europe. We reached out to General Mills and they confirmed via email that they use Class 4 in Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which is the most dangerous type: NOTE: At the time I sent them this email, I was unaware that they use class IV caramel color, so this has now been added to my list of major concerns. General Mills said they’ll comply with the new California law banning artificial dyes from schools, but still “working through” questions of how it plans to do that, “which could include reformulating products or removing them from the available options for California schools“. If General Mills is reformulating for California schools, why can’t they do this everywhere? All citizens deserve these safer cereals. I responded for further clarification and will update you here when I learn more. Rumor has it that a school district is removing General Mills from their schools and replacing it with Nature’s Path (an organic brand without artificial dyes or BHT). This would be a huge blow to General Mills and could get the ball rolling in a direction that they can’t pull back from. I really feel like General Mills could position themselves as the leader here, but they don’t have much time to make a decision. The writing is on the wall now about where the regulations are headed. Other states are looking at banning artificial dyes from schools. And with RFK Jr. positioned to head the HHS, he has already gone on the record stating that he is going to ask the cereal companies to remove the dyes. General Mills should step up now, to avoid a PR disaster like what Kellogg’s is currently experiencing. All they need to do is announce their plans for removing artificial dyes and BHT from all of their cereals in America, just like they are doing for school districts in California and as they are doing in other countries. This will encourage other brands to do the same, and they will be seen as the hero. You can contact General Mills here or on their social media channels: Let’s rally together to get the same, safer cereals that General Mills will be producing in California schools. We can do this Food Babe Army!"

(ha ha, I’m joking of course…) I was thrilled to see a respected food policy expert calling out Froot Loops and warning parents everywhere about their awful ingredients. Dr. Darin Detwiler has been advocating for food safety for the last 31 years and counting. He tragically lost his son, Riley, in 1993 to an E.coli infection that he contracted from another child – traced back to Jack In The Box hamburgers. This really propelled him into a life-long career of consulting for the USDA, FDA, and food corporations on how to improve their policies. I knew I needed to get Dr. Detwiler’s take on our Cancel Kellogg’s campaign, and what he really thinks about Kellogg’s selling cereals with safer ingredients in other countries. I contacted him and was so thankful that he agreed to do a live interview with me last night. Some of the most compelling parts of our conversation were: I really hope Kellogg’s was watching… because at one point I asked Dr. Detwiler what he would say to Kellogg’s CEO if he could talk to him. You’ve got to see what he said for yourself… I’m putting out a formal request for anyone who has insider information on Big Food or our Kellogg’s boycott to contact me. You can remain anonymous, but we want to hear from you! Send a “Hot Tip or Whistle-blow” request to me here. Thank you for voting with your dollars by leaving Kellogg’s on the shelf. This is sending the strongest message that Americans don’t want these artificial ingredients in our food!"

Kellogg’s Cereal Heiress Exposes Kellogg’s Froot Loops and says to “BOYCOTT”,0,"Ever since we delivered 400,000 signed petitions to Kellogg’s headquarters asking them to sell us the same safer cereals they sell in other countries, I have been contacted several insiders and whistleblowers who want to help our campaign. I was contacted by Victoria Kellogg, the great great great granddaughter of W.K. Kellogg, the founder of Kellogg’s, who started the business selling Corn Flakes to the public in 1906. Victoria said that she wanted to advocate for our petition asking Kellogg’s to drop artificial food dyes from their cereals in America. When I called her and asked her if she would be willing to do a live interview, she said yes. I never thought a member of the Kellogg’s legacy family would ever want to speak out about their unethical business practices. But she did. And it’s one of the most heroic conversations I have had. I am so impressed by her courage to demand a boycott on Kelloggs, even though it will affect her financially. I also received an email from another relative of W.K. Kellogg, Jeannie Kellogg Keyes. Here’s what she wrote to me: More Kellogg’s insiders and whistleblowers have been contacting me who want to speak out. I’ll be sharing this information with you soon. Save the date: Another live interview on all social media on Nov. 19th at 8pm EST."

When we arrived at their front steps with more than 400,000 signed petitions, we were met with a sign in a high-rise window that said “Get Off My Lawn”. Their executives refused to meet with any of us. Even a Kellogg’s shareholder and elected officials were denied a meeting to discuss why they sell safer versions of their cereals in other countries without artificial dyes or BHT. This is a slap in every American’s face! They do not care about us and they do not care about children. This is why NO ONE should be buying Kellogg’s products. Kellogg’s is Anti-American and does not deserve one more dollar from any citizen. Last year, Kellogg’s split into two separate companies, and sold off all of their other brands like Eggos and Poptarts. Now they mostly just sell cereal. This is important because most Americans don’t know the truth about their food. Not everyone knows that Kellogg’s sells safer cereals in other countries. Not everyone knows that artificial dyes and BHT are linked to cancer and other health risks, especially in children. Schools throughout the country are serving Apple Jacks and Froot Loops full of dyes and BHT to American children for breakfast. It’s a travesty. Kellogg’s could have come out as the hero and done the right thing for American families but instead now they are facing a national boycott. Share this boycott list with your friends and family!

Senate Roundtable,0,"The past couple of days have been some of the most surreal in my life. I had the opportunity to testify at a Senate Roundtable in Washington DC, presenting the truth about the food industry to senators and congressional leadership, hosted by Senator Ron Johnson. I was joined by a coalition of activists, doctors, and health leaders, who all gave empowering and emotional speeches on the sorry state of health in this country and what we need to do to fix it: Robert F.

I also made a BIG announcement about our Kellogg’s petition…and the room gasped! And then they erupted into applause. The American people are ready for change. You don’t want to miss this, because I want you to be involved… We are at a pivotal moment in this country. Americans are sicker than ever. And much of this is due to the alarming amount of harmful chemicals allowed in our food. Tides are changing fast, and this is our chance to save the health of Americans.

https://foodbabe.com/the-insane-ingredients-in-lemonade-homemade-lemonade-recipe/,The insane ingredients in lemonade + Homemade Lemonade Recipe,0,"I recently went to the store and evaluated every lemonade brand I could find…and let me tell you, the ingredients FLOORED me. If you love lemonade as much as I do, it can be super frustrating when you can’t find a single brand without processed ingredients. Lemonade should be made with just lemons, water, and sugar (or honey)… But almost every brand out there (even organic like Santa Cruz Lemonade) contains “Natural Flavors”. You’ll also find flavors added to fast food lemonades like Chipotle’s Organic Lemonade, McDonald’s Lemonade, and Wendy’s “All-Natural” Lemonade. Natural Flavors are used as a way to use fewer lemons, so it is much cheaper to produce. These flavors are NOT natural and are made in a lab. They also can contain dozens of different chemicals, preservatives, and emulsifiers, none of which are labeled. The ingredient list on Minute-Maid Lemonade “Made with Real Lemons” is insane. Sure, there’s some real lemon juice in there, but it’s also full of high fructose corn syrup, artificial preservatives, and artificial dyes! It’s alarming that they add the synthetic preservative sodium benzoate to this, because with this chemical is mixed with vitamin C (naturally found in lemons!) it can produce BENZENE, a known carcinogen. Cans of Minute Maid Zero Sugar have THREE different Artificial Sweeteners linked to cancer: Aspartame, Acesulfame Potassium, and Sucralose. These sweeteners are also linked to weight gain. Although artificial sweeteners have no calories, they have been shown to contribute to weight gain by encouraging sugar cravings. Research finds they stimulate your appetite, increase sugar cravings, and promote fat storage and weight gain. Stay far away from these ingredients! I try to avoid Stevia because it’s linked to fertility issues and endocrine disruption. There is also research showing it may kill good bacteria in the gut. I’d rather have a natural sweetener like honey in my lemonade. CITRIC ACID: Heavily processed preservative and flavoring made from sugar fed to fungus (a GMO black mold, not fruit). It can contribute to a leaky gut, or make it hard to heal from a leaky gut. ASPARTAME: A peer-reviewed study in France found that consuming this artificial sweetener may increase the risk of breast cancer up to 22%. It was originally created in a lab during pharmaceutical development and was found to be sweet on accident when a researcher licked his finger. STEVIA EXTRACT: Linked to reduced fertility, endocrine disruption, and may kill good bacteria in the gut. SOY LECITHIN: Emulsifier likely derived from GMO soybeans and extracted with hexane, a neurotoxin. MALTODEXTRIN: Heavily processed powder, often made from GMO corn. Linked to increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune conditions, gastrointestinal issues – gas and diarrhea. BHA: Shown to be an endocrine disruptor, linked to cancer, causing tumors in animal studies. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies BHA as “possibly carcinogenic to humans“ and it’s been deemed a “reasonably anticipated human carcinogen” by the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, National Toxicology Program. SODIUM BENZOATE: A synthetic preservative that when combined with either ascorbic acid (vitamin C) can produce benzene, a known carcinogen. POTASSIUM SORBATE: This preservative has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer. It has also been shown to induce DNA damage when combined with vitamin C (naturally found in lemonade). It’s made purely with filtered water, lemon juice, and honey – it’s incredibly refreshing and delicious! Thank you for spreading the word!"
https://foodbabe.com/is-there-a-healthy-popsicle-watch-out-for-these-ingredients/,Is there a healthy Popsicle? Watch out for these ingredients!,0,"Our family loves to cool down on hot days with popsicles, but I don’t buy most brands. I even stay away from those ones that say they’re “Made with Real Fruit”, because I’ve found out that it’s a lie. The fruit is so heavily processed and there’s a lot more going on in those frozen pops besides real fruit! I recently investigated every single popsicle at the grocery store, and filmed a quick video to show you what I found. Make sure to watch this before you buy any more popsicles! Almost every brand is packed with so many unhealthy ingredients like tons of added refined sugar, high fructose corn syrup, gums, and fake flavors. Even most organic brands and those “Made With Real Fruit” bars contain added flavors and gums. And if you’re not careful, you might get sabotaged with artificial colors and artificial sweeteners too. HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP: Increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia. JUICE CONCENTRATES: Fruit juice heated into a syrup, which makes it higher in sugar, lower in fiber, and lower in nutrients. Experts say it is similar to high-fructose corn syrup! SUCRALOSE: Artificial sweetener made in a laboratory by reacting sugar with Chlorine. Has been linked to leukemia and related blood cancers in animal studies. ACESULFAME POTASSIUM: Another artificial sweetener that Center for Science in Public Interest says to avoid it because safety testing was inadequate and some research links it to cancer. GUAR GUM: A thickening ingredient which can kill healthy gut bacteria, and disrupt the microbiome. It can lead to bloating and a “bubble gut” feeling in your stomach. CARRAGEENAN: Thickener and emulsifier linked to digestive issues and cancer. ARTIFICIAL COLORS: Dyes derived from petroleum, linked to several health issues, including allergies and hyperactivity in children, which require a warning label in Europe. I will sometimes buy organic frozen treats like JonnyPops or GoodPop. These both contain added natural flavors and gums though, so they are not ideal. My kids love Sweet Nothings Squeezable Smoothies and these are like popsicles to them. These are organic and made with real fruit & veggies, and taste incredible! They also make Dessert Pops, like Chocolate Peanut Butter that are an awesome replacement for Fudge Pops. I recently found out about Chloe’s, which are made with just fruit, sugar, and lemon juice (but they are not organic). You can find these brands in natural food grocery stores. Let me show you how ridiculously easy it is to make delicious frozen treats with fresh fruit and vegetables. It’s as simple as making a smoothie…and you freeze it like a popsicle! These Superfood Pops from my newest cookbook, Food Babe Family, pack a super nutritional punch in each bite. They are seriously HEALTHY popsicles that taste great! And if you know anyone who might be buying popsicles full of crazy processed ingredients, please share this video with them. I wish I knew the truth about these ingredients earlier, especially when it comes to feeding my kids real food."
https://foodbabe.com/brave-mother-calls-out-school-district-for-serving-junk-food-to-kids-video/,Brave mother calls out school district for serving junk food to kids (Video),0,"There’s nothing I love more than watching people use their voices to improve our food, especially the food they are serving our kids in schools. Most schools are serving Kellogg’s Froot Loops full of artificial dyes and sugars, re-heated processed meals laden with refined vegetable oils and refined flours, “reduced fat” Doritos, and even pizza like Domino’s made with awful ingredients. It’s despicable. If I could wave a magic wand and improve the food that schools are serving, I would. Unfortunately, I am not in the position to wipe the slate clean. This is a massive issue and an uphill battle that will require a united movement to make sweeping changes. That’s not to say that there isn’t anything we can do. The best way to make a difference, is to start at the local level, in your own school district. In the introduction of my book Food Babe Family, I tell the story of how I worked to change Pizza Friday’s at my daughter’s school from Domino’s to a local organic pizza place. This wasn’t easy, but I highlighted this story in the book in hopes that it would inspire other parents out there to do the same. “Hello, Vani! I have been enthusiastically following you for some time now. My two daughters absolutely love your mom’s dal recipe – I make it regularly for them and we inhale it! I was very much inspired by your advocacy around the awful school lunches served to kids. I wanted to let you know that I recently spoke to my local school board about the deplorable items on the menus. My words generated a lot of buzz and they are now looking to improve these menus!” – Amanda A. Change in schools is possible and you can make a difference too. Think outside the box when it comes to food being served in your child’s school. Are there any small changes you can make? Are there any specific products that you can get swapped out for a healthier alternative? Anything with artificial colors is a great place to start! You can do what I did, and you can also do what this mother did. Come armed with research and ask directly for what you want. Get other parents involved if you need to. When you work together, you can make a difference even faster. Remember that any changes you spur will not only help your child, but other children at their school too— especially those who rely on cafeteria food for all their lunches and snacks. Thank you to all of you who are making your voices heard! You are inspiring me to keep going."
https://foodbabe.com/you-wont-believe-this-ingredient-label-from-1960s-kelloggs-apple-jacks/,You won’t believe this ingredient label from 1960’s Kellogg’s Apple Jacks,0,"I couldn’t wait to show you this. The other day Kellogg’s posted a picture of original Apple Jacks from the 1960’s on Instagram, which just proves that their cereals are MORE TOXIC than ever. But they contained fewer artificial dyes (AKA certified colors) and NO natural flavors. They were flavored simply with dried apples and cinnamon. The ingredients remained essentially the same for 30 more years…until they drastically changed in the late 1990’s. Studies showed that children would be more drawn to the product and would eat more of it, if it was brighter and more colorful. So, Kellogg’s added in MORE dyes to make the bright green and orange Apple Jacks that we have today. Kellogg’s cereals are now some of the most unhealthy products on the market, and they continue to poison our children with artificial colors, artificial flavors, hydrogenated oils, BHT, and GMO corn, all coated and loaded with refined sugars. These artificial dyes are made from petroleum and are linked to several health issues like ADHD and hyperactivity in children, which require a warning label in Europe. Recent research shows they may also disrupt the immune system. Meanwhile they create healthier versions of their products for other countries, like Apple Jacks colored naturally with turmeric and paprika in Australia, without any BHT. Why don’t they do that here??? They clearly already have the formula. How do we get them to change? Stop buying Kellogg’s Cereal and tell your friends! This is the strongest way to send a message to Kellogg’s headquarters that we don’t want cereals made with GMOs, artificial colors, BHT, and fake flavors. Our petition asking Kellogg’s to remove artificial dyes & BHT (as they do in other countries) has nearly reached 100k signatures! Kellogg’s is surely feeling the heat now. Please share the petition to your social media channels today on Instagram and Facebook. Thank you for continuing to make history with us!"
https://foodbabe.com/dont-let-kelloggs-get-away-with-this-crime-keep-the-pressure-on/,Don’t let Kellogg’s get away with this CRIME! Keep the pressure on.,0,"I was interviewed on TV this week, where I shared the latest on our Kellogg’s petition asking them to remove all artificial dyes and BHT from their cereals. They don’t use these ingredients in other countries, so they already know how to do it. These ingredients are known to cause hyperactivity in children and can even increase the risk of cancer. It maddens me that Kellogg’s knows this, yet fails to do anything about it. Kellogg’s has their shareholders meeting today. Let’s send them a strong message that we are holding them accountable for their actions. We are forming a coalition of activists and health experts who are passionate about this issue, Jason Karp, Calley Means, Jesse Itzler, Dr. Mark Hyman and more. We won’t back down until Kellogg’s does the right thing. The FDA and our regulatory agencies are asleep at the wheel and not doing anything about it, so we are leading this charge. We are SO CLOSE to 100,000 signatures on our petition. Have you signed it yet? Make sure to also share the petition and ask your friends to hop on board. Thank you for making history with us!"
https://foodbabe.com/shake-shacks-ingredients-are-a-mile-long-is-it-really-the-healthier-fast-food/,Shake Shack’s ingredients are a mile long! Is it really the healthier fast food?,0,"Shake Shack announced they’re giving away their antibiotic-free chicken sandwiches for FREE every Sunday this month, which is a pretty brilliant marketing move… taking a jab at Chick-fil-A who just went back to using antibiotics in their chicken. But Wait!! Before you run down to Shake Shack this Sunday to grab your free chicken sandwich, there’s something you need to know. Shake Shack doesn’t publish their ingredient lists online, which makes it difficult to know what you are really eating. I’ve tried to get their ingredients in the past, and they refused to disclose them to me… but now I’m happy to report that I’ve got Shake Shack’s ingredients for their burgers, sandwiches, fries, and shakes in my hot little hands. I hate to pick on one of the few restaurants who are serving antibiotic-free meats, but when I saw Shake Shack’s ingredients, there was no way I could keep them to myself. And let me tell you, I think they should feel ashamed using so many processed ingredients especially with a slogan like “Stand For Something Good”. Shake Shack doesn’t use hormones or antibiotics in their meat, which is great, but don’t assume that means they use good ingredients in their menu items. They say, “Food is at the center of what we do. We’re committed to sourcing real, premium ingredients to deliver menu items our guests crave and can feel good about eating. Guided by our vision of quality and food safety, our culinary team continues to craft high-quality menu items, surprising and delighting guests with innovative recipes.” (1) Is that true? Well, now you can see for yourself: AUTOLYZED YEAST EXTRACT: Shake Shack may not use MSG (monosodium glutamate) but they do use this hidden form of MSG. It is purely used to increase food cravings and irresistibility, so you can’t stop eating. (2) NATURAL FLAVORS: Besides the hidden MSG to get you hooked, Shake Shack uses 5 different “natural flavors” in their chicken sandwich. You’ll find them in their buttermilk and butter, along with natural onion flavor, natural garlic flavor, and capsicum flavoring in their chicken. These natural flavors are proprietary mixtures made in lab, designed to make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. It is very similar to MSG. No wonder their sandwiches taste irresistible! (2) TBHQ: You’ll find this preservative in the fryer oil at Shake Shack. It may harm the immune system and increase the risk of food allergies. (2) DIMETHYLPOLYSILOXANE (aka Silly Putty): This is an anti-foaming ingredient used in the fryers at Shake Shack. Funny that other restaurant fryers seem to work just fine without this ingredient. Besides being the main ingredient in Silly Putty, it was used as a filler fluid in breast implants until it was phased out due to safety concerns. This ingredient was deemed unsafe to put into our bodies, but we are supposed to eat it? (2) DATEM & MONO AND DIGLYCERIDES: Contains trans fat which is correlated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. (3) SOYBEAN OIL: Increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, heart disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. (2) CALCIUM PROPIONATE: This preservative disrupts the metabolism and can promote weight gain. (4) POLYSORBATE 80: An emulsifier linked to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. (5) GUAR GUM & XANTHAN GUM: These emulsifiers can kill beneficial bacteria in your gut and decrease bacterial diversity, which may contribute to an array of chronic inflammatory diseases. (6) It’s quite shocking to see Shake Shack’s ingredients compared to what’s in Chick-fil-A, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s. They use many of the same processed ingredients like calcium propionate, soybean oil, DATEM, mono and diglycerides, and dimethylpolysiloxane (aka Silly Putty). Shake Shake still even uses TBHQ in their fryer oil, which happens to be one of the ingredients that Chick-fil-A removed after I met with them. (7) The ShackBurger has a whopping 73 ingredients. Those “Non-GMO” potato buns are filled with a slew of dough conditioners, preservatives, and emulsifiers. And that Shack Sauce? It’s mostly Canola Oil, which is an unhealthy refined oil linked to inflammation and heart health risks. (2) The sauce is preserved with Potassium Sorbate. This preservative has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer (8) Just like the chicken sandwich, the ShackBurger is packed with 4 different natural flavors to give it that irresistible taste. No wonder they are so popular! While I love that Shake Shack doesn’t use antibiotics or hormones in their beef, there is more to making good food. They really don’t need to use all of these processed ingredients to make a burger. One of their biggest rivals is Five Guys… and neither one is really any healthier than the other. Shake Shack coats their fries in soybean, canola, and cottonseed oils, which are the worst oils on the planet. These oils come from GMO crops and are processed to DEATH with chemical solvents, steamers, neutralizers, de-waxers, bleach and deodorizers. (9) Then they fry them up in refined soybean oil preserved with TBHQ along with the Silly Putty ingredient, Dimethylpolysiloxane. Why not just use potatoes, oil, and salt?? Their grilled cheese sandwich has the same bun and cheese that they use in the ShackBurger, so it’s loaded with the same dough conditioners and preservatives. The base of their shakes is their vanilla custard, which they blend with milk to make their vanilla shake. The custard contains a “stabilizer blend” that consists of some very problematic ingredients: MONO AND DIGLYCERIDES: This ingredient is a hidden source of trans fat, which is detrimental to heart health. (3) CELLULOSE GUM: This thickener & emulsifier is usually made from wood, because it’s cheap. It may alter gut bacteria, increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic syndrome, significant weight gain, and cancer. (2) LOCUST BEAN GUM: Similar to cellulose gum, this can alter gut bacteria and lead to various inflammatory diseases. These gums also often cause bloating and that “bubble gut” feeling in your stomach because they slow down your digestion. (6) CARRAGEENAN: This thickener and emulsifier can cause digestive problems and intestinal inflammation. Tests have found that “food-grade carrageenan” is contaminated with up to 25% of “degraded carrageenan” (the kind not supposed to be used in food and drinks). Degraded carrageenan is classified as a “possible human carcinogen” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. (2) Number one on my wish list would be to stop using all those refined oils (soybean oil, canola oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil) in everything and to switch to a healthier oil like avocado oil in their fryers…without the TBHQ and Silly Putty, of course. Then, they could take that nasty “stabilizer blend” out of their custard and shakes. There is nothing good about filling your famous shakes with unnecessary additives linked to heart disease, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. And what about all of those natural flavors in everything? What would happen if Shake Shack lived up to their promise to use “real, premium ingredients” and actually used real food? It would be INCREDIBLE to see them make these changes, wouldn’t it? Maybe they’ll see this post and agree that it’s time to clean up their food."
https://foodbabe.com/is-this-ingredient-giving-you-a-bubble-gut-watch-out-for-gums-added-to-these-popular-foods-and-drinks/,Is this ingredient giving you a BUBBLE GUT? Watch out for “Gums” added to these popular foods and drinks!,0,"The other day my friend told me that she had been drinking a bottled protein shake every morning, and she suspected that it was making her feel like she had a “bubble gut” a few hours later. You know that feeling when you have to unzip your pants because they feel too tight? When you feel so bloated that you can’t get comfortable? When you just want to put on your stretchy pants and lie on the couch? She asked me to review the ingredients for her…and so I grabbed the bottle and it didn’t take me long to spot the culprit on the ingredient list. Her daily protein shake had THREE different “gums” listed on the label. All of these gums are added to foods to thicken the consistency and as “Emulsifiers” to suspend ingredients evenly throughout the product so it does not separate. Think about what these thickening ingredients are doing inside your GUT and to your digestive system. They sit in your stomach like a glob of thickening goo. This leads to that awful bloated, gassy, “bubble gut” feeling. After they stew in your stomach, some people experience constipation and others get diarrhea. Gums make you feel like crap…literally! If that’s not awful enough… A deep dive study by researchers from the University of Michigan Medical School and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences looked into how we digest (or don’t!) Xanthan Gum. They found that it may alter the gut microbiome. (1, 2) A previous study in 2021, published in Gastroenterology, investigated Carboxymethylcellulose (aka cellulose gum) consumption in humans and found that it “detrimentally” alters intestinal microbiota composition and may contribute to an array of chronic inflammatory diseases. (3, 4) There are multiple studies on guar gum, cellulose gum, and other gums that have found they negatively affect your microbiome. (5, 6, 7) When your microbiome isn’t filled with a rich and diverse composition of bacteria, your health can go downhill very fast. An unhealthy gut can lead to mental disorders like depression, obesity and difficulty in losing weight, nutritional deficiencies, depleted immune system, autoimmune diseases, and gastrointestinal illnesses. (8) If you want good health, you need to keep your microbiome healthy. PERIOD. It’s like a garden, and you need to keep it watered, colorful, and alive! This is why probiotics and fermented foods are so good for you. Sadly, many of the products that gums are found in are daily go-to products like protein shakes, coffee creamers, and non-dairy milks. Want to add some creamer to your morning coffee? GELLAN GUM! Want to whip up a smoothie with almond milk to bring to work? GUAR GUM! Want to grab a quick ready-to-drink protein shake after your workout? XANTHAN GUM! We are being bombarded by gums, and you can barely escape it! I was sick of all of the processed additives, preservatives, flavors, emulsifiers, and gums in my food and drinks, even in products that you’d think would be “healthy” like an organic protein shake! At Truvani our top priority is ingredients. We believe in real food without added chemicals. Products without toxins. Labels without lies. Keep voting with your dollars, and choose brands who don’t take shortcuts with processed ingredients that are shortcutting our health!"
https://foodbabe.com/chick-fil-a-cancels-antibiotic-free-chicken-heres-why-this-is-devastating-for-everyone/,Chick-fil-A cancels antibiotic-free chicken (Here’s why this is devastating for everyone!),0,"It was my birthday last week…but I got the worst present ever. That morning Alex Clark of the Spillover Podcast DM’d me: “Someone sent me this!” Along with a screenshot from Chick-fil-A’s app stating that they are cancelling their “No Antibiotics Ever” standard, and would start selling chicken raised with antibiotics this Spring: As soon as I saw this, I was devastated and disgusted by their horrible decision. People who eat at Chick-fil-A believe they’re eating Antibiotic-Free chicken because they made a huge announcement about this when they made the switch 10 years ago, and it has been a big part of their marketing. (1) I knew the public needed to know about this change ASAP. I didn’t waste a minute. I urgently contacted every major news organization with this information. Then I filmed a quick reel and posted it on my social media. I was doing everything I could to get this news out. A reporter replied back to me and published the news that afternoon. (2) Now the story has been picked up by all major news outlets (Washington Post, NY Times, CNN, ABC, CBS, Fox). It’s everywhere. While I’m happy the word is out about Chick-fil-A’s chicken, it’s driving me crazy that the media isn’t delving into what this change really means. For example… Antibiotics that are “not important to human medicine” aren’t used in humans, so it’s assumed they don’t affect human health. However, this is not the case. (3) The research shows that antibiotics “not important to human medicine” still harm human health. Experts warn these antibiotics may still lead to resistance to other antibiotics that are used by humans: “Resistance genes don’t discriminate”. (4, 5) Overusing ANY antibiotic – whether it’s “important to human medicine”, or not, is promoting resistant bacteria. These antibiotics, such as ionophores, are not subjected to the same regulations as medically-important antibiotics and their impact may be silently devastating to the future of human medicine. (6) The FDA allows antibiotics to be used for: It is very common for chickens to be sick while living in crowded and unsanitary factory farms. (8) Does this mean Chick-fil-A’s chickens will receive antibiotics to prevent diseases living in crowded factory farms that often have sick birds? “Disease prevention” is a real loophole here, and the question is – will Chick-fil-A exploit it? These are the questions we should be asking. While it’s true that I haven’t eaten Chick-fil-A in over a decade because of the horribly processed ingredients they use (over 50 in their sandwich alone!), this change affects us all. Factory farms use 80% of the nations antibiotics, and they have been heavily relied upon and OVERUSED for decades. They were initially given to help farmers grow animals faster and bigger on less food, but now they are widely given to prevent diseases in filthy, crowded farming conditions. (9, 10) This overuse of antibiotics is creating a major health issue. It has caused an emergence of deadly bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics. It’s in our soil, water, air, and food. In other words, if you were to take an antibiotics for an infection, it may not work because it’s resistant to antibiotics. This issue is deeply personal. Several years ago my Dad was infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and was hospitalized as a result. Needless to say, it was one of the most stressful and scary times of my life. Thankfully with good medical care, my Dad survived but the antibiotics he was supposed to be given to treat the infection were deemed useless. This problem is growing. Over 2 million Americans suffer from antibiotic-resistant infections every year, and 35,000 people die. (11) If this continues, they say antibiotics could become useless by 2050, making antibiotic-resistance the leading cause of death. (12) This is insanity! I believe this is one of the most important health issues of our time, and Chick-fil-A going back to antibiotic-raised meat is very harmful to all of us. They agreed! At first they told me it would be nearly impossible, but in early 2014 made the commitment to serve antibiotic-free chicken. When this news hit, I screamed so loud that every neighbor within a mile radius must have heard me. And then tears of joy started rolling down my face. WE DID IT. Or did we?? Now 10 years later, they cancel it overnight and go back to serving the same conventional chicken you’ll find at McDonald’s and other fast food places. Moms Across America tested the food from popular fast food chains in 2023 and 60% of the samples contained the antibiotic Monensin and 40% contained Narasin. (13) They also found Nicarbazin in Chick-fil-A, a contraceptive and anti-parasitic drug that has been prohibited from use. Remember this next time someone tries to tell you that these drugs don’t end up in our food! Last year, Tyson announced they would go back to using antibiotics to raise their chickens. (14) They are a major supplier of restaurants and fast food chains, and reportedly this includes Taco Bell, KFC, McDonald’s, Burger King, Popeyes, and Chick-fil-A. (15) In February of this year, Panera Bread quietly removed all signage from their restaurants that said “No Antibiotics Ever,” “Vegetarian Fed,” “Grass Fed Pasture Raised,” and “Animal Welfare”. Then it was leaked that they loosened their ingredient standards ahead of a planned IPO. Panera now allows the use of antibiotics in their pork (bacon) and turkey. (16) This is what we need to do: Now go out there and share this post to spread the word about Chick-fil-A! Go, Food Babe Army, Go!"
https://foodbabe.com/legal-demand-to-kelloggs-drop-the-artificial-dyes-and-bht-you-dont-use-in-other-countries/,Legal demand to Kellogg’s: Drop the artificial dyes and BHT you don’t use in other countries!,0,"My dear friend and activist Jason Karp launched a major legal campaign on Kellogg’s last week. He hired one of the top lawyers in the country, Alex Spiro, and sent a letter to Kellogg’s demanding that they sell Americans the same cereals they sell in other countries without artificial dyes and BHT: “as a minimum first step, Kellogg must reinstate — and immediately deliver on — its commitment to remove artificial dyes from its products.” Kellogg’s continues selling Americans cereals full of artificial dyes they don’t use in other countries, even after promising in the media nearly 10 YEARS ago that they would be removing them. (1) And most of these cereals target our kids. It’s so unethical! In the letter they ask for a meeting with WK Kellogg’s Board of Directors to discuss the timeline for removing these ingredients and state that they “will not hesitate to hold Kellogg’s leadership accountable”. BOOM!!!! Read the letter from attorney Alex Spiro to Kellogg’s in its entirety here: “Kellogg’s Froot Loops made with ‘harmful additives’ despite vow to remove dyes” – New York Post (3/14/24) “DealBook: Activist investing in the cereal aisle” – The New York Times (3/14/24) I love seeing this information back in the news. People should know about this and demand better. Kellogg’s should not be able to get away with this. But it sure is interesting to see how the FDA defends artificial dyes when you’re challenging a powerful billion dollar food corporation, like Kellogg’s. For example, look at these quotes from the media coverage: The groundbreaking University of Southampton Study in 2007 found a strong link between artificial dye and sodium benzoate consumption in children and hyperactivity. (2) This led the European Food Safety Authority to require all products that contain the “Southampton Six” artificial food dyes (Yellow #6, Quinoline Yellow, Carmoisine, Red #40, Yellow #5, and Ponceau 4R) to carry a warning label that they “may have an effect on activity and attention in children”. (3) Instead, they use fruit and vegetable concentrates to color their cereals. In 2021, the state of California backed Europe’s findings, after conducting a 2-year scientific review of 7 artificial dyes approved by the FDA: “Overall, human studies indicate that synthetic food dyes are associated with adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in children, and that children vary in their sensitivity to synthetic food dyes…current federal levels for safe intake of synthetic food dyes may not sufficiently protect children’s behavioral health. The levels were established by the US Food and Drug Administration decades ago and do not reflect newer research.” (4) Artificial colors have also been shown to affect memory and learning, causing changes to neurotransmitters in the brain! (4) Additional research shows they disrupt the immune system (5) and are laced with carcinogens.(6) Clearly, these dyes come with several scientifically-backed health risks. Who are they covering for? Why are they protecting Big Food brands like Kellogg’s? When you read these articles, call them out for it! I launched my 2nd petition to Kellogg’s in 2019, asking them to keep their promise and dump the dyes. The Food Babe Army went wild sharing this petition and we gathered over 50k signatures in a few months. As I was getting ready to book a flight to take these signed petitions to Kellogg’s headquarters in Michigan, the unexpected happened. The world came to a screeching halt when Covid hit, and this put a big wrench in our plans. But now it’s time. We are going to hit them from every angle, forming a powerful coalition with incredible activists… Jason Karp, Jesse Itzler, Calley Means, and more! Along with YOU and the entire Food Babe Army!!! If you agree it’s time to stop poisoning our children with ingredients that Kellogg’s knows they should not use, especially since they already make safer versions overseas, please do these two things today: I am counting on you to spread the word so Kellogg’s has no choice but to surrender – this has gone on long enough! Go Food Babe Army, Go!!! This is our time."
https://foodbabe.com/health-damaging-plastic-chemicals-found-in-gerber-cheerios-wendys-fast-food-and-more-see-the-list/,"Health-damaging plastic chemicals found in Gerber, Cheerios, Wendy’s fast food, and more (See the list!)",0,"If you need another reason to stop eating ultra-processed packaged products and fast food,, this might be the motivation you need. A breaking new report found that many of the most popular food and drinks sold in grocery stores and in fast food drive-thru’s are laden with hazardous chemicals from plastics that can seriously harm your health over time. (1) It’s not just the ingredients in Wendy’s, Coca-Cola, and Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream that we need to watch out for. There are chemicals in these products that seep in when they come in contact with packaging materials, or the plastic tubing, conveyor belts, and gloves used during food processing. (1) You’ve probably heard about BPA in the lining of canned food, but now many brands have removed BPA and replaced it with other chemicals that are just as bad! Most of the products that Consumer Reports tested still had some levels of BPA in them, but… Phthalates are the most common plasticizers (a chemical that makes plastic flexible and durable). Since they are used so much in food processing and packaging, these chemicals are showing up in our bodies, where they can harm our health over time. Experts say even low levels are harmful to the body, especially since we’re being exposed multiple times a day! No level is considered safe. (2) The most contaminated product they tested is an organic brand – Annie’s Organic Cheesy Ravioli – which had 53,579 ng of phthalates per serving! That was nearly double the amount found in other highly contaminated products. The other major offenders were Wendy’s Crispy Chicken Nuggets, Chicken of the Sea Pink Salmon, Moe’s Southwest Grill Chicken Burrito, Fairlife Core Power High Protein Chocolate Shakes, Del Monte Sliced Peaches, Chipotle Chicken Burrito, and Burger King Whopper With Cheese. Most shocking is what they found in baby food! The levels in baby food weren’t quite as high as other products tested, but babies and children are much more susceptible to the health-damaging effects of these chemicals in our food. Based on this report, it appears that almost every product in a package is contaminated by chemicals used in plastics. The most important thing we can do, is raise awareness about this and ask these companies to test for BPA and phthalates, and to find the source of them in their products so they can get them out! “Supermarket and fast-food chains, as well as food manufacturers, should also be required to take action, and should set specific goals for reducing and eliminating bisphenols and phthalates from all food packaging and processing equipment throughout their supply chains.” – James E. Rogers, PhD, product safety testing at Consumer Reports (1) At home we can do our part too. Eat fresh unpackaged food as much as possible, stop using plastic food containers and bags, and eat at home whenever you can. I like to use stainless steel and glass containers in my kitchen. Go, Food Babe Army! Thank you for spreading the word."
https://foodbabe.com/no-sugar-granola-recipe-perfect-for-a-sugar-detox/,No Sugar Granola Recipe – Perfect for a Sugar Detox,0,"I just baked up a batch of my No Sugar Granola in the oven and can’t wait to dig in. This is one of my favorite recipes on my 7-Day Sugar Detox, which I’m doing this week to get back on track after the holidays! This granola is quick to make and has no sugar or sweeteners in it at all. It has that delicious crunch along with naturally-sweet coconut that makes it a savory and delicious topping for yogurt. I also love to just snack on this granola all by itself. The healthy fats are so satisfying and it takes away any of my sugar cravings! If you have been struggling with sugar cravings lately, you’ve got to make this granola STAT! And for even more help, get my 7-Day Sugar Detox while it’s open this week (more details about that below!) I pretty much stopped buying granola from the store years ago. Most brands taste stale, processed, and overly sweet. After you make your own granola, it’s really hard to go back to the packaged stuff! There is also so much refined sugar added to popular brands of granola like Nature Valley and Love Crunch. You’ll often find several different types of sugar listed on the ingredient list. I truly believe that one of the most insidious ways the food industry poisons us is by filling their products with refined sugar. The food industry knows that sugar is addicting and that sugar makes heavily processed foods taste good, so that’s why they have added it to practically everything! It may seem innocent, but what refined sugar does to the body is scandalous. There is little to no nutritional value in these refined sugars. They have been chemically stripped of their minerals, so when you indulge in these sugars, you get no nutrition and your body becomes more acidic. As these sugars are devoid of minerals, they are acid-forming causing more inflammation. When your body stays in a state of inflammation, you are at a greater risk of developing various chronic diseases ranging from cancer, to heart disease, to digestive disorders. Eating refined sugar is addictive, makes you fat, tired, depressed, age faster, makes your skin dull, weakens immunity and when consumed in excess causes all sorts of diseases… No thanks. This is why I avoid refined sugar whenever possible. That means that when I go shopping I look for refined sugars on the ingredient label (see the list above for some main culprits). This also means that I don’t buy bags of cane sugar to stock in my kitchen pantry. I use natural nutrient-dense sweeteners at home instead such as maple syrup, honey, and coconut sugar. I’m sorry to break the news, but most brands of granola contain at least 2 teaspoons of sugar per serving, and sometimes even more. Even organic brands like Love Crunch and Nature’s Path contain refined cane sugar. Here’s how much sugar you’ll find in one serving (1/2 cup) of your favorite brands: Another reason I stopped buying packaged granola is because it’s usually made with inflammatory refined oils and added flavors. Does your granola contain these ingredients? CANOLA OIL (found in Nature Valley, Post, Great Value, and Kind): Unhealthy refined oil linked to inflammation and heart health risks. SOYBEAN OIL (found in Love Crunch and Nature’s Path): This unhealthy oil is too high in omega-6 fatty acids and increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. NATURAL FLAVORS (found in Love Crunch and Nature Valley Protein Granola): Proprietary mixtures that make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. The ingredients in flavors are not listed, so you are in the dark about what you are eating. I have a healthy granola recipe that I love to make during the holidays, and even though it doesn’t contain any refined sugar it still contains natural sugar from maple syrup and dried fruit. After the holidays are over and I want to get all sweets out of my diet, I love to make my No Sugar Granola from my 7-Day Sugar Detox instead. I created this Sugar Detox Program because I used to be addicted to sugar, and this gives me an easy to follow meal plan with mouthwatering recipes to help me get back on track. Anytime I feel too much sugar creeping into my diet, I follow the plan and it makes me feel amazing. I use it to help myself and want it to help you too! I opened up enrollment this week at a HUGE discount and I’d love to send this program to you: I will show you that you CAN win the battle against sugar. You CAN finally take control of your cravings. And that you CAN enjoy more energy, fewer mood swings, and lose weight. You don’t need to starve yourself. You don’t need to eat processed, pre-packaged “sugar-free” foods. All you need is this simple, step-by-step plan that’s worked for thousands of people. To give you a little taste, I’m sharing this No Sugar Granola recipe from the Sugar Detox Recipe Guide that I’m sure you’ll love as much as I do. To make this granola, you simply mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl and spread it out onto a cookie sheet. Then you bake it at 325 degrees for 12-15 minutes until it’s crunchy and nicely toasted. After it cools, you can store it in a glass jar for up to a week. It makes about 4 cups! Sign up for the 7-Day Sugar Detox before the price goes up on January 15th! I only open up this program once a year, so now’s the time!

https://foodbabe.com/i-quit-eating-sugar-and-look-what-happened-to-my-body-true-story/,I quit eating sugar and look what happened to my body! (True Story),0,"I’m a little embarrassed to admit this. But I want to share a personal story with you because I know it might help you. It was one of the biggest reminders in my life that diet is so powerful, and that we truly are what we eat. Although I eat healthy most of the time, I’ve always loved sweets…(a little too much!) This comes back to bite me every few months if I’m not careful. Especially this time of year when I’m surrounded by so many cookies and candies! A few years back, I completely went off the rails. After I gave birth to my son, I started eating candy every night. And not just one piece. I was binging on ENTIRE BAGS of organic YumEarth Licorice and Giggles (which are like organic Skittles). I began looking forward to my special treat every night after dinner. It became an addiction. Sure, it was “organic” candy, but this is when organic doesn’t matter. Sugar has detrimental effects on the human body, whether it’s organic or not. I wasn’t only sabotaging myself with sugar. I was also ordering take out food often – and even though it was from healthy places – they still use inflammatory vegetable oils to cook their food along with dairy and gluten, which also feeds inflammation in the body. With a new baby, I obviously had a lack of sleep. Couple that with the stress of continuing to work, as I wasn’t able to take a maternity leave. Now I had not one, but two children, while I was running two businesses. This all took a real toll on my body. Allergy season hit me like a ton of bricks. I normally have a few sniffles here and there, but this time I was suffering from eczema breakouts all over my body. Every time my baby would touch me with his little nails on my neck and my face, it would cause an inflammatory break out. I had huge welts on my skin from my chest up. My eczema came back so bad that I couldn’t see through my eyes, they were itchy and red all the time. This made it impossible to do my work – I couldn’t be on camera and didn’t want to take any pictures. I wanted to hide. I felt awful and exhausted! I talked to a doctor about it, and she told me what I was afraid to admit… I needed to change my diet – remove all inflammatory foods like sugar. I knew she was right, but I really didn’t want to. I was sleep deprived, working two jobs, and breastfeeding – which makes you SO HUNGRY. I was told the only other alternative was to go on pharmaceutical steroids (Prednisone) to reduce my eczema and inflammation. But this wasn’t going to solve my issue for good – I needed to address the root cause…which was my sugar addiction. This is when push came to shove. I told myself: I’m the Food Babe. I know what I need to do… I need to stop being weak and take control of my diet. I CAN DO THIS. One night I just did it. I eliminated most dairy, gluten, and sugar from my diet. 20 days later… My candy addiction and symptoms had disappeared! This was the BEST THING I’d done for my health in a long time. I reset my palette. I started having more energy and felt really good. This reminded me why I do what I do.

https://foodbabe.com/candy-cane-cookies-without-artificial-dyes/,Candy Cane Cookies (Without Artificial Dyes!),0,"This time of year is so fun with the kids, but one thing I don’t love are all of the red and green cookies filled with artificial dyes everywhere we go. That’s what makes this new candy cane cookie recipe a lifesaver! These are so fun to make for the holidays and you won’t be poisoning your loved ones with artificial ingredients. As I wrote about in my new book, Food Babe Family, I have zero tolerance for artificial colors in my food or my children’s food. We don’t eat products with artificial colors…ever. This may sound extreme—but there are so many reasons why we shouldn’t be eating them, especially children. Artificial colors… You’ll find them listed on an ingredient label as Red 40, Red 3, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Blue 1. This is why it’s sooo much better to make homemade holiday cookies. But don’t make this mistake… Almost everyone reaches for food colors made by McCormick and Betty Crocker to make their holiday cookies, but this is a BIG MISTAKE. These popular food colors are made with the same artificial dyes that you find in holiday cookies from the store. Plus, they are suspended in a solution made with nasty processed ingredients like carrageenan, propylene glycol, and parabens (endocrine-disrupting chemicals linked to breast cancer and reproductive problems). To make cookies without artificial dyes at home, you’ll need natural food colors. There are natural coloring kits available made from real food like beets, spirulina, and turmeric, such as the Supernatural brand. The red color is simply made with BEETS…how amazing is that?!? You simply make a basic sugar cookie dough and divide it into two portions. Then you add natural red coloring to one half and chill the dough for a couple of hours. This makes the dough really easy to work with, so you can effortlessly roll it into ropes and twist the white and red ropes together to make the twisted candy cane shape. This is super fun to do with the kids and creates great memories! Now you won’t need to buy those processed “ready to bake” Pillsbury cookies full of dyes and other shady ingredients…yay! The cookies bake up perfectly on my favorite 360 Cookware cookie sheets. I use these stainless steel cookie sheets for all of my baking and couldn’t be happier! This is the same brand that makes the non-toxic slow cookers I use in my kitchen. Because I love their products so much, I was able to partner with them for a big discount for the Food Babe Army: I hope you enjoy a batch (or two!) of these candy cane cookies with your family for the holidays. They also would make a great edible gift for someone on your list! Here are more holiday cookie recipes without dyes that my family loves: We also need to keep sharing the truth about artificial colors, because they are EVERYWHERE this time of year. Please share this post to spread the word."
https://foodbabe.com/the-best-pumpkin-spice-cookies-gluten-free-refined-sugar-free/,The BEST Pumpkin Spice Cookies (Gluten Free & Refined Sugar Free!),0,"When I first tasted these I squealed with joy. Wow. These pumpkin spice cookies are perfectly crisp on the edges and soft and chewy on the inside. They are seriously sooo good and perfect for my kiddos. Almost every holiday cookie out there is packed with refined white flour and refined white sugar…but not these babies! I use nutrient-dense oat flour that is gluten-free and sweeten the batch with organic coconut sugar and maple syrup. I recommend using Arrowhead Mills Organic Oat Flour to make this recipe, as this will give you the most consistent result. You can also make your own oat flour with One Degree Sprouted Rolled Oats and blend them into a flour in a blender. If you make your own oat flour it is very important to increase the total amount of oat flour to 1 3/4 cup in the recipe. These are my favorite oats because they are sprouted (making them more nutritious and easier to digest) and certified glyphosate-free. You don’t want no Roundup weed killer in your oats! I often use organic coconut sugar and maple syrup in my baking because these natural sweeteners are unrefined, which means their vitamins and minerals are intact. White sugar is stripped of minerals and has an acidic affect on the body, so I try to avoid that as much as possible. You can take almost any recipe and substitute coconut sugar for the white sugar on a 1:1 ratio! I’m totally obsessed with 360 Cookware* because their products are so high quality, made with stainless steel and free of any harmful coatings such as PFAS, PFOS, PFOA and PTFE. The way they conduct the heat in the oven is great, and I come out with perfect cookies every time. I know these cookie sheets will last me a very long time and I’m so happy to have them in my kitchen! This is a great time to get that cookware you’ve been eyeing at a big discount. I also highly recommend their slow cookers! I hope you enjoy these gluten-free Pumpkin Spice Cookies with your friends and family this holiday season. You may want to double the batch because they won’t be able to stop at just one!"
https://foodbabe.com/sweet-potato-sausage-breakfast-casserole-in-the-slow-cooker-easy-prep-to-feed-a-crowd/,Sweet Potato & Sausage Breakfast Casserole in the Slow Cooker – Easy prep to feed a crowd!,0,"Things have been a little crazy at my house as I’m running around getting everything ready to host Thanksgiving for my family next week. That’s what makes this new breakfast casserole recipe such a lifesaver! This holiday breakfast casserole is made in a slow cooker, so you can get it started right before bed…and in the morning breakfast will be ready! This is what I plan to make on holiday mornings, so breakfast is effortless and I can spend time with my family. This casserole is made with layers of yummy veggies (spinach, onions, bell peppers!), pastured eggs, cheese, and organic sausage. It makes the perfect breakfast to feed a crowd of up to 8 people. Serve it with some fresh fruit and perhaps some organic sourdough toast…YUM. This stainless steel slow cooker* is incredible for making soups, stews, meats, and I use the smaller 2.3 Quart Slow Cooker* to make my steel cut oats every night before bed. You have to be very careful about the cookware you choose because many brands use coatings that contain toxic chemicals that can leach into your food. This is why you want to avoid all slow cookers with a ceramic insert – which is almost every brand out there. As I write about in my new book, Food Babe Family, heavy metals can be especially harmful to children and babies. Exposure to heavy metals during childhood has been linked to ADHD, behavior problems, and learning disabilities. (1) With 360 Cookware*, I don’t need to worry about any of that. Their products are stainless steel and free of any harmful coatings such as PFAS, PFOS, PFOA and PTFE. This discount includes their amazing slow cookers (in 3 different sizes!), stainless steel cookie sheets, pots, and pans… which I all love. Now is the perfect time to stock up so you’re ready for the holidays! This ingredient is optional, but I use Bilinski’s Chicken Breakfast Sausages to make this casserole. These are made simply with organic meat and spices, and my family loves them. If you can’t find these near you, you can use another organic brand of breakfast sausage. You want to especially avoid breakfast sausage that is made with conventional meat, which is raised in a factory farm where it’s pumped up with growth-promoting drugs and antibiotics. When I was kid, I loved Banquet Brown n’ Serve Sausages, but man, those ingredients are atrocious! It’s made with “Mechanically Separated Turkey”, which is a paste-like meat product generally made from extra parts of turkey, which may include bones, nerves, and blood vessels. If that isn’t bad enough, these sausages are preserved with some risky chemicals: BHA and BHT, which are both linked to cancer in some animal studies. Stay far, far away from brands who use ingredients like this! I use Laclare brand raw goat cheddar cheese in this casserole, which you can find in natural food grocery stores. This is cheddar cheese, but from goats instead of a cow, which is easier to digest for many people. You can also use grass-fed organic cheddar cheese, just shred it yourself to avoid anti-clumping additives like “cellulose” that is added to pre-shredded bags of cheese. The best eggs for this casserole are pastured organic eggs. You don’t want your eggs from chickens who ate antibiotics and GMO corn their whole life. Nor do you want to purchase eggs from chickens that are being raised in crowded hen houses with no light and horrible conditions. There are a few good organic pastured options in stores like Vital Farms, or try your local farmers. You can use either organic grass-fed milk (such as Organic Valley) or an organic nut milk. If you use nut milk, I like to use the MALK brand, as it is organic and has minimal additives, it is the closest I’ve found to homemade! I hope you enjoy this holiday breakfast casserole with your family this year! If you know anyone who would love this recipe, please spread the love and share this with them. Happy Holidays!"

There are so many families still eating ultra-processed food and need help. They have no idea the chemicals in our food are wrecking their health. It’s time for everyone to wake up to this madness and learn the truth! They need this book right now and I’ve been doing everything in my power to get the word out.

https://foodbabe.com/why-dominos-pizza-at-schools-have-to-stop-the-shocking-ingredients/,Why Dominos Pizza at Schools Have To Stop (The Shocking Ingredients),0,"There’s a very important update to my new book Food Babe Family that I want to share with you. It was really devastating to me. I had a hard time grappling with it. It kept me up at night. It made me angry… Frustrated. Disappointed. But it also fired up my passion and reminded me why I do this work. I wrote this blog post so you’d know what happened and learn from it just like I did. As a food activist, author, and investigator of what’s in our food, I knew the ingredients in Domino’s are not something I wanted going into my daughter’s body every week. At the same time, I didn’t want her to miss out on having Pizza Fridays with all the other children. So, I decided to ask for a change. At the orientation meeting, in front of all the other parents, I asked if there was an opportunity to change pizza places. I explained how Domino’s contains questionable ingredients…including TBHQ that affects children’s immune systems. I was hoping this would get their attention, because parents will do anything to keep their kids from getting sick. right? But Immediately – I felt tension in the air. The consensus was that they wanted to keep Domino’s. I felt defeated – but I didn’t give up. I emailed the school my research on Domino’s ingredients and made a case for change. I reached out to our favorite pizza place in Charlotte which uses organic ingredients and olive oil. I explained the whole situation to the owner, and she agreed to match Domino’s prices with free delivery. When this happened, I was over the moon! Every Friday, the kids at her school enjoyed organic pizza made with organic wheat, organic tomato sauce, organic cheese and olive oil for the entire school year. At the time I thought…THIS is how you make a change in our schools! One small change at a time. One product, one food, at a time. Pick the worst food in your school and make a case for change. You may need to negotiate prices and do some footwork, but it is so worth it. But not so fast! A few weeks back, I wrote a letter to the school headmaster and to the owner of the local organic pizza chain to let them know I shared the story about Pizza Friday in my new book, and also to thank them for continuing to serve children healthier ingredients on Pizza Friday. The first Pizza Friday of the school year was organic, but then the next week as I was dropping my daughter off at school I was stopped by the headmaster. I rolled down my car window and she said… “I just want to let you know that we will be switching back to Domino’s for Pizza Friday”. I was shocked. I asked what felt like a million questions… My first question was “Why?” And she said something along the lines of having trouble scheduling and that it would be easier to just do Domino’s. Then I asked “But why Domino’s? There are pizza chains with better ingredients than Domino’s”. She abruptly said that this was their decision, and they just made it. The owner told me that they had given the school over a 50% discount last year and to continue, they would need to increase the costs by a few dollars a pie. As soon as I got home, I emailed the headmaster and asked her to wait before sending an announcement to all of the parents about Pizza Friday, because I had a proposal for her and wanted to meet. She immediately wrote me back and said: Time was of the essence, so I replied back by email that the organic pizza chain would raise their prices by just a few dollars, but that I would cover this in a donation to the school. This way it would be the same price as last year and we wouldn’t have to change anything about Pizza Friday. Problem solved, right? I was anxiously waiting to hear back from her, but a few hours later… I couldn’t believe this was happening. I remember spiraling the entire day after I got this email. Everything that I planned to get done that day didn’t happen. I was so up in arms about it. Not only did I take it personally because I had spent the time to research and make the case for this change…But also as a parent who cares deeply about all the kid’s bodies at school. No one should be eating these ingredients, especially our children! I wasn’t given the opportunity to make this right even though I was willing to do it, and this was just so upsetting to me. The next morning I stopped the headmaster at the car line so that I could further explain my position. I reassured her that the organic pizza place was good with the scheduling and that I’d be covering the extra cost. I wanted my donation to be anonymous. She replied that they wouldn’t switch back and forth. And they were just not going to do it. She really was adamant about the decision. I let her know that Kraft told me “No” five or six times before they removed artificial food dyes from their mac and cheese, and that I wouldn’t give up. This fight is not over and this story will be continued. I became an activist because all I want in this world is for kids not to feel like I did when I was little. My parents and I didn’t know the truth about our food when I was a child. I ate the “typical American diet” that all of my friends were eating…McDonalds, Burger King, Chick-fil-A, Cheetos, and Coca-Cola... and I felt AWFUL. There are more than 30 Pizza Fridays in the school year. That’s more than 30 times that children will be eating pizza doused with Roundup weedkiller, GMO soybean oil, TBHQ that affects the immune system, and many more controversial ingredients. I think that’s too many times. Way too many. This may not seem like a big deal to some… but perhaps that’s because they don’t know the truth about Domino’s pizza. The next thing I did was I sent a letter to all the parents so they could see the ingredients in Domino’s and decide for themselves if this what they wanted their children eating every Friday. Since my daughter would no longer be participating in Pizza Friday, I also armed them with the knowledge of what we were going to be doing as a family to pack homemade pizza for her lunch on Fridays instead. During this whole process, I was really concerned about what she would do or think when I told her what had happened. Of course she’s been part of this conversation for so long and was already aware of what the ingredients were in Domino’s, so I didn’t really have to say that much. While she was in the bath one night, I causally mentioned, “I think your school is changing to Domino’s for Pizza Friday”. She just looked at me and said, “Mom, why don’t you just send me pizza. I would love green peppers, red peppers and olives on it, please.” I said okay and just kind of left the room in shock and disbelief. I thought to myself, she doesn’t care where it’s from. She just wants Pizza. And so that next Friday I made her the homemade pizza she wanted, and put it in a little warming pack for her lunch. When I picked her up from school I asked her, “How was Pizza Friday?” And she said, “Mom, it was so amazing”. So I asked, “What it was like? Was it better than the local place?” And she said yes. I felt like a hero that day. Harley is one of the few children in her school not eating Domino’s on Pizza Friday. What is that teaching her? What is that showing her? What is she learning from that resilience? And why? If we’re going to live in this over-processed world, surrounded by all of the McDonald’s and Burger Kings and Domino’s of the world, we need to know how to navigate these situations. I’m teaching her those skills, and she’s building that muscle to stand up and be different. And I want to give this gift to every family across the country. Food Babe Family arms you with the tools you and your family need to stand up to the Big Food industry. You don’t have to succumb to the pressures of society and fall for B.S. marketing campaigns targeting you into eating toxic ingredients. And don’t EVER feel like your children are missing out when they aren’t eating the processed food that everyone else around them is eating. They’re not missing out when they’re avoiding chemicals that cause cancer, gut issues, eczema, fatty liver, obesity, and type 2 diabetes! So stop saying your kids are missing out when they aren’t eating Doritos and Domino’s with their friends. You are protecting them from dangerous chemicals, which is your greatest job as a parent. You could be saving their life! This experience also taught me that we can’t give up… I’ve found this out the hard way so many times, and I should have known better. I’ve petitioned companies like Kellogg’s who said they were going to remove artificial food dyes from their cereals. They announced it all over the news, but then they didn’t do it. M&M’s did the same thing! Then General Mills removed the dyes from Trix cereal, only to put them back in the following year! It’s horrible. It’s these types of situations that ignite my passion and make me realize my work so important to continue going. Even though the story I wrote about kicking Domino’s to the curb for the introduction to Food Babe Family is crushed (and I already have to update the book!) I hope that this situation inspires parents to keep going even when they face adversity. Raising my kids on real food has never been an easy feat. I’m constantly bombarded with everyday situations that expose my kids to an industrial food system that is making so many children and adults sick today. Every single time we leave the house, there’s some overly processed junk food available. Whether it’s at a birthday party, sporting event, playground, restaurant, you name it. It’s everywhere. Ultra processed foods made with chemicals that serve no nutritional purpose in the body. This is why I wrote Food Babe Family. I want to let everyone know there’s another way to feed our kids. Together we can make a change and choose better. We can teach our kids the truth about food and be responsible for their health. My mother didn’t know the truth about food, but once you know better, you do better. Pick up your copy from Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Million, or your local bookstore.

https://foodbabe.com/how-to-teach-your-children-the-truth-about-food/,How to teach your children the truth about food,0,"When I was child, I wasn’t allowed in the kitchen. It was off limits. My dad wanted good grades in school—not cooking skills. My mom would make these incredible Indian meals from scratch, but I never learned how to cook ANYTHING. My parents didn’t know it at the time, but learning how to cook would eventually save my life. As I got older the only things I figured out to make were in a microwave or cold out of the fridge. I ate Chick-Fil-A, Lean Cuisines, Hot Pockets, Burger King, and anything that was fast and easy. Eventually this caught up with me… In my early 20’s I got very sick and ended up in the hospital. I was on several prescription drugs, was overweight, and I felt like a zombie all the time. It was then I realized I needed to make a change. I could no longer give up control to processed food manufacturers. I had to figure out how to make food from living, real food ingredients. So, I taught myself how to cook. This is when my life turned around. My health improved dramatically and I got off all my prescriptions. The excess pounds MELTED off my body. My skin was glowing. Today, teaching my children the truth about food is one of my TOP PRIORITIES. I never want my children to feel the way I did when I was younger. I don’t want you to feel that way either! This bonus expires TOMORROW so don’t delay! Don’t wait! I started talking to my daughter about food when she was a toddler. I’m doing the same with my 2-year old son. I wanted to begin teaching them the truth and started as soon as possible! It’s been shown that children are most receptive to learning about the world around them between the ages of 2 and 7. This is a critical period of brain development, during which they learn faster than any other time in their life. You have this amazing window of time to shape their beliefs about food, so take advantage of it! That’s why I dedicate a big section in my book on how to teach your children about their food and get them involved in the kitchen. Once you know the truth about our food, it’s our ultimate obligation to pass it on to our children and loved ones. I don’t believe anyone should be shamed for this, and in this world full of Oreos, Pepsi, Doritos, we need to arm our children with the facts. If they decide to eat that food later on in life, they make that decision on their own, but at least you did your job as a parent and told them the truth. To give you a little snapshot of the tips you’ll find inside Food Babe Family here are… 1. Read recipes out loud together while you are cooking, especially in cookbooks with pictures. Show them how you follow the recipe, measure out the ingredients, preheat the oven, and put it all together to make the finished product. 2. Have your children right there with you when you prepare meals. This opens up a ton of opportunities to talk about the ingredients that you’re cooking with. Tell them what different fruits and vegetables are and why they are good for you. Explain what you’re doing and how you’re preparing something, so they start to learn how we use these ingredients to make meals. 3. Young children can wash vegetables and squeeze lemons, while older children can learn to peel and chop up vegetables. Get your child some child-safe knives that will allow them to learn motor skills for cutting when they’re ready for it. 4. If your toddler is too little to help out with a recipe, you can keep them busy by giving them some safe ingredients to play with, such as a sprig of herbs or a ball of dough. Let them play while they watch and listen to you cook in the kitchen. 5. When your child is around seven years old, they might find it fun to put together some easy recipes on their own. Start with cold recipes that don’t require an oven or stove, such as wraps and sandwiches. 6. At around 10 years old, they might be ready to learn to use the stove and oven with your assistance. For instance, your child could prepare blueberry pancakes and you can show them how to safely pour the batter onto the hot griddle and flip! 7. Children love to be creative, so use this to your advantage and ask them to help you decorate cookies and cakes. You can even take ordinary dishes and allow them to arrange the food on a plate in a fun way. 8. Have them help set the table.Younger children can set out the napkins and older children can set the plates, glasses, and silverware. 9. Ask them to help you clean up after a meal too. Show older kids how to unload and load the dishwasher or wash the pots, while younger children can wipe the table or clean up messes. Let them help scoop the leftovers into containers to store in the fridge or freezer. Above all else, keep this a positive experience! It’s best to involve them when you don’t feel rushed. Save cooking time with your child for lazy Sunday afternoons and other calmer times.

https://foodbabe.com/how-to-make-real-food-fun-for-your-kids-from-my-new-book-food-babe-family/,How to make REAL FOOD fun for your kids (from my new book Food Babe Family!),0,"In 2020, when daughter was 3, I was working on a campaign about Kellogg’s Unicorn Waffles. These pink waffles are made with artificial colors, artificial flavors, and other very processed ingredients. Harley came into my office, sat on my lap, and saw the graphic I was creating. Her face lit up when she saw that colorful purple box with a rainbow unicorn and pink waffles on it, and she exclaimed, “Mom, mmm those waffles look good!”… And, of course they did! Those colorful boxes are VERY ENTICING to any young child; that’s exactly what Kellogg’s is banking on and how they are able to sell boxes of Unicorn Waffles by the truckload. But it was the beginning of the pandemic and traveling wasn’t possible. Instead, I used this as a learning opportunity and talked to Harley about how they make Unicorn Waffles this pretty pink color by putting fake colors in them that aren’t actually real food, and that actually those fake colors are not good for our bodies and can make us sick. You’d be amazed at how quickly young children pick up on this and understand, and now, whenever Harley sees brightly colored food she knows to ask if it is artificially colored. I also published a blog about these waffles, blasted Kellogg’s on social media, and wrote about them in my new book Food Babe Family, warning parents everywhere about the artificial ingredients they use. This is a big win, but the sad reality is… There are still thousands of toxic products being pushed on our kids with cartoon characters on their packaging like Paw Patrol Fruit Snacks, Super Mario Oreos, Disney Princess Goldfish, and Mickey Mouse Eggos. This whole experience got me thinking about ways that I could make REAL FOOD fun for my kids to eat. If we’re competing with brands like Kellogg’s — we’ve got to have a few tricks up our sleeve, right? Food that is full of toxic chemicals is constantly being shoved in our faces by the media, celebrities, marketing giants and the terrible BIG food industry.

To prove it to you, let me give you a sneak peek inside of Food Babe Family, chapter by chapter so you can see for yourself what you’ll find inside! Food Babe Family is MUCH MORE than a typical cookbook. We actually considered publishing it into TWO books, because it’s jam-packed with so much information. This book has all the tools and information on how your entire family can eat real food, easily and effortlessly, along with over 100 family recipes. It’s like two books in one! In the first part of Food Babe Family (85 pages!) I show you how to raise your children to love real food, how to buy the healthiest food for your family, what to do at home to make it all work, and how to navigate the over-processed food in schools, restaurants, parties, events, and while traveling. The second half of this book provides over 100 delicious and simple recipes to make the process of feeding your family even easier! Because I believe that no one should have anxiety when feeding their children. Let’s look at each chapter in more detail… You’ll see a day-in-the-life as I prepare food for my children. I dispel some great myths we have been fed about feeding children and the real reason why some kids hate vegetables. I give you the rundown on what to look for in baby food and packaged toddler products along with a list of the brands I recommend. When your kids are in school, you’ll love the Mix & Match Lunch Ideas Chart and real-life lunch box examples that map out how to effortlessly pack healthy lunches for your child. I’ll take you on a virtual trip to the grocery store, where I’ll show you how to avoid misleading labels on packages and how to choose the healthiest snacks and drinks for your family. You’ll know how to quickly spot B.S. marketing, so you won’t be swindled. I also break down the Terrible 10 Ingredients In Children’s Food. You’ll see what makes these ingredients terrible and what specific products they’re found in, with brand names! You’ll also find the Best and Worst Beverages for Kids, which are ranked into four categories. I explain why each drink landed in each category, so you’ll easily be able to choose the healthiest drinks for your family.

There are both store-bought and homemade options to help you! Now we bring it all together so you know what to do at home to help foster a love for real food in your children. This is where we get into the real nitty-gritty of how to incorporate real food and healthy habits into your daily life. I’ll show you how to make Real Food FUN for your kids. We’re competing against multi-million dollar food brands like Kellogg’s Fruit Loops, so we’ve got to have some tricks up our sleeve, right? I delve into what to do if your child is “Picky” and how to encourage your child to try new foods. This includes my tried-and-true 5 Ways To Help Your Child Love Green Drinks – which is a great way to get more vegetables into your child’s diet. You’ll see why it’s a great idea to involve your kids when you’re preparing meals and ways to make it fun and rewarding for the whole family. I’ll also show you why eating together is so beneficial – and in many ways that you’d never expect! I give you my best tips for making it easier to have this special time together on a regular basis. We’ll delve into how to navigate the world we live in with your child, despite it being full of processed food temptations like M&M’s, Pepsi, and Doritos. I’ll show you how we handle birthday parties, the food in school, holiday candy, eating in restaurants, and what we do when we travel and go to events. You obviously can’t be with your child all the time and everywhere they go, so it’s very important to also teach them strategies to use when faced with food decisions and challenges as they venture out on their own. Can you believe how much you’ve already gotten in this book?!? The first part that we’ve covered is just the beginning… In part two you’ll find over 100 of my family’s favorite recipes.

https://foodbabe.com/four-toxic-chemicals-just-got-banned-from-food-but-theres-something-you-need-to-know/,"Four toxic chemicals just got BANNED from food, but there’s something you need to know!",0,"Lawmakers in California just passed a bill that will ban 4 artificial ingredients from our food, but it’s not all that it seems. There’s some good news and bad news! A post shared by Vani Hari | Food Babe (@thefoodbabe) Food brands will likely remove these ingredients from all products they sell in the entire U.S., because it would be too difficult to remove them just in California. Also, this paves the way for other states to enact similar legislation. But here’s what you still need to watch out for… You’ll find Red 3 in some foods like Hot Tamales and some Funfetti products, but they will very likely replace it with Red 40, another artificial dye that’s linked to health problems. Which leads me to the really bad news: This ingredient was BANNED in Europe after it was linked to cancer last year, but remains in over 11,000 products in U.S. grocery stores such as Skittles and Pop Tarts. So now it appears that it will remain in our food for a very long time. The best way to get companies to remove toxic ingredients, is to STOP buying their products. Vote with your dollars. For example, instead of buying Skittles for Halloween treats this year…Buy YumEarth’s brand: Giggles. Food Babe Family is packed with over 100 recipes and everything you need to help your children fall in love with real food: Every family needs the information and recipes in this book.

For example – These Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes look delicious…but with Polysorbate 60? Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate? Mono and Diglycerides? Natural Flavors? No WAY. And these pumpkin crumb cakes look so good, but this ingredient list hurts my eyeballs. SO MANY processed ingredients, and artificial flavors are listed how many times??? These are toxic. Look at these Pumpkin Spice Hot Cocoa Bombs…you’d think these would have real pumpkin spices. But nope! More artificial flavors and tons of dyes. Disgusting! Artificial dyes are one of the Terrible 10 Ingredients in Children’s Food that I write about in my new book, Food Babe Family. That’s because artificial colors (like Red 40, Blue 1, and Yellow 5) are known to cause hyperactivity in children and disrupt their immune systems. (1) And they’re also filled with high fructose corn syrup, TBHQ, caramel color, and so many other nasty ingredients that it will make your head spin. (2) If you love pumpkin treats but don’t want to eat this crap (or feed them to your kids) I have something for you! I love switching up the type of muffins I serve my kids. I want them to enjoy a variety of fruits and vegetables, and I love how good pumpkin is for them and me. These pumpkin muffins are perfect for freezing and reheating on busy school mornings. They also are a great lunch box addition. Teaching families the truth about real food is my mission in life and I want to make living in this over processed world easier for everyone!

https://foodbabe.com/does-your-slow-cooker-leach-toxins-try-these-safe-brands-instead/,Does your slow cooker leach toxins? (Try these safe brands instead!),0,"I want to give you some quick, valuable information on slow cookers that I wish I had known years ago… but didn’t and learned the hard way. As soon as I found this out, I ditched my old slow cooker ASAP. Ceramic slow cookers may leach lead, and if they get scratched it’s more likely. Even if a slow cooker brand says it was tested for lead at the time of manufacture, they can leach lead over time. This is why you want to avoid all slow cookers with a ceramic insert – which is almost every brand out there. As I write about in my new book, Food Babe Family, heavy metals can be especially harmful to children and babies. Exposure to heavy metals during childhood has been linked to ADHD, behavior problems, and learning disabilities. (1) So we especially don’t want our children to be exposed to lead. If you’re a family and have little kids, it’s really important to stop using these types of slow cookers and just throw them out. They aren’t safe for anyone. I’m am so excited to find this company, 360 Cookware. They use stainless steel for the pan in their slow cookers. I use the 2.3 Quart version (pictured), but they also have larger 4 Quart and 6 Quart sizes. This smaller size is perfect for my family’s oatmeal every morning from the Food Babe Family cookbook. This is what we eat for breakfast almost every morning, so this slow cooker gets a lot of use. Get 25% OFF slow cookers at 360 Cookware with the code FOODBABE. This code is good for cookware and bakeware, which includes their slow cookers! It’s also great for keeping dishes warm when I’m out on the morning with the kids and don’t have time to make lunch when I get back. I just stick the food in here with some water and let it steam to stay hot, so it’s ready to go when we come in from our morning activities. It’s absolutely incredible and has made my life so much more efficient. I can’t recommend this slow cooker enough. It has four different settings for the heat, which is great too. One time I put it on 4 (which is the highest setting) and it was boiling the water in there. That’s pretty amazing. The other stainless steel crock pot I own is from Wolf. It’s got to be the Mack Daddy of all slow cookers, because this one is huge! It’s 7 Quarts, so it makes giant stocks and I can put a whole chicken in here. I use the Wolf when I’m making meals that are really large, such as big pots of soup and chili.

I’m enjoying a cup of my favorite Hot Apple Cider. It’s so comforting drinking Malic Acid, Caramel Color, and Artificial Flavors… Ahhh. Sooo delicious! Ok, I’m kidding. I’m not drinking that! MALIC ACID: An artificial flavor enhancer and/or acidity regulator created in a lab from petrochemicals like butane. (1) MALTODEXTRIN: Heavily processed powder often made from GMO corn. Linked to increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune conditions, gastrointestinal issues – gas and diarrhea. (2) CARAMEL COLOR: There is Class III Caramel Color in Alpine Apple Cider mix, which is created with heat and ammonia – a process that produces a cancerous substance called 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI). (3) It is completely unnecessary, as apple cider should be naturally brown from the apples and spices. ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS: Chemical mixtures synthesized in laboratories, derived from petroleum and other inedible substances. Cheaper than using real food. Makes processed food taste irresistible. (4) NATURAL FLAVORS: Practically the exact same thing as Artificial Flavor, but it’s derived from substances found in nature (plants, animals, etc). This isn’t all it contains. Flavors typically contain preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other “incidental additives”, which can make up 80% or so of the formulation. Some of the most common incidental additives in flavors include: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol (none of which are labeled). (4) These ingredients are disgusting! I throw apples, ginger, an orange, and real spices into my slow cooker and turn it on for a few hours. It makes the most delicious apple cider that’s HEALTHY and it makes the house smell incredible. It’s the perfect way to celebrate fall! After the apples, orange, and spices cook down in the slow cooker for about 2 hours, all you do is strain the juice into a glass pitcher and enjoy! It’s naturally sweet from the apple and orange juice, so there is no refined sugar needed! It makes about four servings, and will keep in the fridge for about four days.

https://foodbabe.com/is-oatmeal-healthy-the-truth-about-oatmeal/,Is Oatmeal Healthy? The TRUTH About Oatmeal,0,"There’s a lot of chatter going around right now about oatmeal. If you are confused, let me help clear it up. People are saying oatmeal is the devil. That oatmeal spikes your blood sugar. That oatmeal is not healthy. And that you shouldn’t be eating it for breakfast. It’s true that I wouldn’t touch Quaker oats with a 10 foot pole. That’s because it’s conventionally grown and tests have found it contains Roundup that is linked to cancer. (1) So here’s the bottom line: Best of all – it takes me less than a minute to make in my slow cooker. Breakfast is ready to go first thing in the morning. What is better than that? Not only do steel-cut oats make a filling and healthy breakfast, but they are also easy to prepare ahead of time so that you don’t need to cook in the morning. These creamy oats take less than a minute to pop into the slow cooker at night before bed. Compare this to cooking oats in the morning while you’re busy and waiting 30 or more minutes for them to cook, watching the stove, and stirring, or even worse, resorting to instant oats that are not as nutritious.

https://foodbabe.com/wendys-chili-recipe-fast-food-swap-quicker-than-the-drive-thru/,Wendy’s Chili Recipe Fast Food Swap (Quicker than the Drive-Thru!),0,"Please forgive me… The other day I was really busy and needed a quick lunch, so I pulled into the Wendy’s Drive-Thru and ordered a cup of their chili. I know, I know, I’m always warning you about the ingredients in processed food…but I was having a hard day. JUST KIDDING!!! Ok, the truth is I DID order Wendy’s Chili in the drive-thru, but this was to film a video for social media to show why I never eat their chili. Even if I’m in a rush or having a crazy day, all I need to do is remember the ingredients in Wendy’s Chili and I’m not tempted. Wendy’s flavor enhancer contains Yeast Extract, which is known as a hidden form of MSG. It’s coupled with two more flavor enhancers: Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate. Disodium Guanylate is derived from guanosine monophosphate (GMP), which when mixed with MSG can amplify the flavor of food up to 8 times! (1) It’s been shown that food companies can take processed food that tastes gross on its own, and make it taste irresistible with these additives. In one study, researchers took an ingredient out of sausages which made them taste bad, but once they added MSG flavor enhancers, the study participants thought the sausage tasted delicious. (2) It’s been shown that MSG can help you gain weight, even if you don’t eat more calories. (3) This is why MSG is fed to rats in animal studies to make them obese! I don’t like to eat products that trick my brain into craving them, and I especially don’t want to give chili with “flavor enhancers” to my kids. This is why hidden MSG additives like Yeast Extract are one the Terrible 10 ingredients in children’s food that I write about in my new book, Food Babe Family. It’s very important to choose products made with organic meat to avoid consuming potential residues of antibiotics, synthetic hormones, and other drugs often given to animals on factory farms. Wendy’s still sources their beef from conventional farms who use antibiotics. They announced a commitment to end “routine use” of medically important antibiotics in their beef supplies by the end of 2030 – but that is still so many years from now. (4) Antibiotics are being routinely fed to farm animals – not to treat diseases – but to fatten them up and make them grow bigger on less food. Almost all of the antibiotics used in the U.S. are fed to farm animals and the amount continues to rise. This misuse of antibiotics is creating superbugs that could threaten the entire human population. When animals are constantly fed low levels of antibiotics, they become a breeding ground for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and it’s spreading to humans. (5) When you buy fast food like Wendy’s Chili, you are supporting the industrial BIG FOOD complex of crap food. Introducing my Slow Cooker Chicken Quinoa Chili… I just take 10 minutes to throw the ingredients in my slow cooker in the morning, and it’s ready by lunch time! It’s so filling and delicious, without addictive chemicals, conventional beef, and lab-created emulsifiers. The average drive-thru takes 6 minutes, and then whatever time it takes to buckle your kids in the car and drive down there. Why not just spend a few minutes in the morning putting these ingredients in your slow cooker? It makes a big pot that will feed a family without potential toxins. My secret ingredient in this hearty chili is quinoa. This is a gluten-free seed that contains about 8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber per cup. It’s also a good source of manganese and magnesium, which is why I love adding quinoa to my meals to bump up the nutritional content. Quinoa has a texture similar to rice and adds a special touch to this chili! If you want to make this chili vegan, you can easily do so by simply replacing the chicken stock with vegetable stock, and eliminating the chicken. Without the meat, reduce the cooking time to 2 hours on high or 3-4 hours on low, or until the quinoa is cooked. These recipes are an absolute LIFESAVER on busy days. I don’t know what I’d do without them. When you spend a few minutes in the morning throwing a few ingredients into a slow cooker, making a homemade meal is so much easier (and a zillion times healthier!)

https://foodbabe.com/organic-snack-bars-are-full-of-processed-ingredients-is-there-a-healthy-snack-bar-brand/,Organic snack bars are full of processed ingredients (Is there a healthy snack bar brand?),0,"Walk down the grocery aisle with me and let’s check out the organic snack bars. Will any of them be made with real ingredients that you’d find in your own kitchen? Or will they be filled with added “flavors”, emulsifiers, and processed sweeteners? My daughter saw this box of Chocolate Drizzled Made Good bars and got so excited. But look at the ingredients… NATURAL FLAVOR: Proprietary mixture invented to make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. Preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives can make up 80% of the formulation (such as: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol). None of these ingredients are labeled, so we are in the dark about what flavors actually contain. (1) ORGANIC INVERT CANE SYRUP: A thick, sweet syrupy liquid that’s processed by splitting the fructose and glucose molecules in sugar. It’s a refined sugar made in a lab and not what I’d consider a natural sweetener. (2) ORGANIC VEGETABLE GLYCERIN: Another heavily processed sweet syrup made in a lab. To make it, vegetable oils are processed under pressure (typically with lye–a caustic chemical) to separate the glycerin from the fats. Since it’s a sugar alcohol, you eat too much of it you could get gas and diarrhea. (3) MALTODEXTRIN: Heavily processed powder, often made from GMO corn. Linked to increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune conditions, gastrointestinal issues (gas and diarrhea). (4) Do you have “natural flavors” and “maltodextrin” in your kitchen? Ugh…nope! I used to love Z Bars because they’re organic. They say they’re “crafted for active kids” and contain “None of the No-No’s” like high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, or GMO ingredients. So, does that mean their ingredients are healthy? Well, look at that! They may not use “Artificial Flavors”…but they still use NATURAL FLAVORS which are practically the SAME THING! (1) The only difference between the two is that Natural Flavors are derived from natural substances (which can be literally anything ranging from tree bark to beaver anal glands), and Artificial Flavors are derived from synthetic substances. They are both made in a lab, contain proprietary additives, and are designed by teams of flavor scientists to give food an irresistible taste. Flavors are not real food, and not something that I want to eat (or give to my kids!) Plus, these Z Bars contain several refined sugars along with SOYBEAN OIL. Even if it’s organic, this unhealthy oil is too high in omega-6 fatty acids and increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. (5) I wouldn’t buy Z Bars now, and these aren’t ingredients I have in my kitchen. Moving on… Wow look at Dave’s Killer Bars! These say they’ve got 22 grams of whole grains and are organic. Let’s check those ingredients… Ugh…Natural Flavors is listed TWICE. That alone is a reason why I wouldn’t buy these. But they also contain other processed ingredients I don’t have in my kitchen like ORGANIC INULIN and ORGANIC CANOLA LECITHIN. There’s got to be healthier bars than this, right? How about Annie’s organic bars? Millions of parents buy these instead of those awful Quaker Chewy granola bars… but are they really much better? They say they “use ingredients that matter” to me on the box, so let’s see… Annie’s granola bars are made with several different processed and refined sugars. I especially don’t like to eat ORGANIC BROWN RICE SYRUP because it has a high risk of arsenic contamination. (6) Being organic doesn’t reduce the risk. Arsenic is toxic and is linked to increased risk of cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and impaired brain function. (7) When I see this sweetener in a snack bar, it’s an automatic NO GO for me. These also contain added ORGANIC NATURAL FLAVOR and ORGANIC SUNFLOWER LECITHIN. Are these ingredients in your kitchen? Nope. I hate these processed ingredients. These bars worry me the most, since they’re marketed for toddlers with Sesame Street characters on the box. Crossing my fingers that they use healthy ingredients… Awful! These contain three different added FLAVORS along with BROWN RICE SYRUP and refined flour, refined sugars, and refined oils. These bars are extremely processed and certainly not what I’d consider real food. I created a Kid’s Snack Guide with all of the packaged snacks that my family loves. You’ll see all the bars, fruity snacks, savory snacks, and sweet snacks that we buy that are made without refined sugars and other nasty ingredients. These are the healthy snacks I keep in my diaper bag, my car, and in the pantry for whenever we are running out the door–and my kids LOVE them.

https://foodbabe.com/see-takis-ingredients-every-parent-needs-to-know-the-truth/,See Takis Ingredients – Every parent needs to know the truth,0,"There’s nothing that makes me more angry than when food companies create products with highly addictive chemicals, and fill them with the absolute worst ingredients linked to health problems. That’s why I had to share the truth with you about Takis. If you haven’t heard of Takis, I bet your kids have. Check out these comments I saw on social media… “I see 6 year olds eating this for breakfast” “My high school students eat these A LOT! I’ve been telling them how bad they are for their health” “My last year of teaching…it seemed like half the high school walked in every morning with Takis for breakfast” I admit I’ve never tried Takis, but I hear they’re extremely spicy chips that are very addicting. That’s no surprise when you look at the ingredients… There are 3 forms of MSG in Takis: It’s awful that they add MSG because this entices you (and your kids) to eat more Takis…and the next thing you know you’re inhaling handfuls of artificial dyes and unhealthy processed ingredients. MSG is added to make you crave Takis, so you keeping eating and eating and eating their product. There is simply no other reason for food companies to use MSG. I don’t like to eat products that trick my brain into craving them, and I especially don’t want to give snacks with MSG to my kids. It’s been shown that MSG can help you gain weight, even if you don’t eat more calories. (1) This is why MSG is fed to rats in animal studies to make them obese! The natural and artificial flavor chemicals that flavor manufacturers engineer are contributing to what David Kessler (former head of the FDA) calls a “food carnival” in your mouth. (2) The inability to stop eating because the flavors they have synthesized trick your mind into wanting more and more. They don’t want you to have the full essence of a taste – they want you to only experience the best 1 millionth part of the taste – so you keep having to go back for more and more, continuously searching for gratification. (2) These ingredients are hijacking your taste buds one by one! This is why I try to avoid products with “Natural Flavors” or “Artificial Flavors” added. Artificial colors are one of the Terrible 10 Ingredients In Children’s Food in my new book, Food Babe Family. That’s because artificial colors come with so many health risks and are in a lot of foods that parents buy for their kids. Artificial colors (like Red 40 and Yellow 6) require a warning label in Europe that states they cause hyperactivity in children. (1) This is why most foods in Europe don’t contain them! Artificial colors have also been shown to disrupt the immune system. Any product with artificial colors in it is an automatic NO GO in my house. I’m teaching my kids how to spot artificial dyes and why we don’t want to eat them. Another major ingredient to avoid is TBHQ. This preservative may increase the risk of food allergies. Scientific research has shown that TBHQ negatively affects “T-cells” in the body (which are generally used to fight infections) in a way that promotes allergies to tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat and shellfish. It’s banned for use in food in other countries including Japan. (1) They color Takis naturally with Paprika Extract in Spain. (3) They also don’t use TBHQ. Which begs the question, why do they continue to use these ingredients in the U.S. if they aren’t necessary? The other ingredients in Takis in Spain are horrible too, but this just goes to show that they could use better ingredients if they wanted to. The FDA has a database (4) with reports of people who ate Takis and later received treatment for… In one shocking case, a 17-year old girl in Memphis had her gallbladder removed, which her mother believes was due to eating too many Takis and spicy chips. She was eating “big bags and would take them to school with her” before her stomach problems started. Dr. Cary Canvender at Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital also believes eating too many Takis probably contributed to her gallbladder removal. He said they see a lot of kids with stomach problems after eating spicy chips: “We do see tons of gastritis and ulcer-related stuff due to it… We probably see around 100 kids a month, easily.” (5) I filmed a 20-minute video on all the healthy snacks I keep in my pantry and to-go bag for when we are heading out the door.

https://foodbabe.com/kool-aid-or-kool-scam-dont-let-your-kids-drink-this/,Kool-Aid or Kool-Scam?! Don’t let your kids drink this,0,"I remember my mom mixing up Kool-Aid when I was a kid. She’d pour that packet of colored powder into a pitcher of water with a cup of sugar…and my brother and I would drink that down like it was no one’s business! At the time I didn’t think about the ingredients they used or what all that sugar does to the body, and I wish I knew then what I know now. Sadly, Kool-Aid isn’t a thing of the past. Children everywhere are drinking Kool-Aid Jammers and I can see why parents buy them for their kids. They are inexpensive and sold in boxes of 10 pouches that are easy to pack in your kids lunch box. Plus, they say on the front of the box that they’re an “Excellent Source of Vitamin C” with “75% Less Sugar Than Soda”. So Kool-Aid Jammers have got to be healthier for your kids than soda, right? Let’s see. Just like soda, Kool-Aid Jammers are mostly water mixed with High Fructose Corn Syrup, along with Artificial Flavors, Artificial Colors and preservatives. High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is a heavily processed sweetener made from Roundup-Ready GMO cornstarch that contains more fructose than regular corn syrup. Studies have shown it increases appetite and the risk of weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia. HFCS especially contributes to type 2 diabetes in children! (1) Look at the other controversial ingredients in Kool-Aid Jammers and what they do to your body: ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS: Chemical mixtures synthesized in laboratories, derived from petroleum and other inedible substances. Cheaper than using real food. Makes processed food taste irresistible. (1) NATURAL FLAVORS: Essentially the same as artificial flavors, but are derived from natural substances. This is a proprietary ingredient that has a top secret ingredient list. These flavors contain preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives that can make up 80% of the formulation (such as: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol) – none of which are labeled). (1) SUCRALOSE: Kool-Aid uses this artificial sweetener to reduce the sugar content, but it’s just as bad, if not worse. Sucralose is made in a laboratory by reacting sugar with Chlorine. Has been linked to leukemia and related blood cancers in animal studies. Although artificial sweeteners have no calories, they have been shown to contribute to weight gain by encouraging sugar cravings. Research finds they stimulate your appetite, increase sugar cravings, and promote fat storage and weight gain. (1) ARTIFICIAL COLORS: Dyes derived from petroleum, linked to several health issues, including allergies and hyperactivity in children, which require a warning label in Europe. May also be contaminated with carcinogens, such as benzidine. (1) CITRIC ACID: Heavily processed preservative and flavoring made from sugar fed to fungus (a GMO black mold, not fruit). It can contribute to leaky gut, or make it hard to heal from leaky gut. (1) SYNTHETIC VITAMIN C (ASCORBIC ACID): They add synthetic vitamin C to Kool-Aid Jammers so they can add the health claim on the box that they’re an “Excellent Source of Vitamin C”. Besides the fact that this is one really unhealthy way to get vitamin C into your child, synthetic vitamins are made in a lab from a variety of questionable sources like coal tar, petroleum and GMOs. Lab-created vitamins differ from natural vitamins found in whole food, and aren’t often believed to be absorbed by your body as well. (1) I offer my children just a few drink options. We serve filtered water with everything and this is what I pack in lunch boxes. This is the main thing that we drink as a family. Occasionally, we’ll enjoy organic coconut or almond milk, mint tea, kombucha, or raw coconut water. My husband likes to drink cold-pressed orange juice, so sometimes if my daughter sees him drinking it, she’ll want some. I’ll pour her a little OJ in a glass mixed with filtered water. She doesn’t know the difference! You’ll find drinks listed in four categories: (1) Worst Drinks for Kids, (2) Not-Much-Better Drinks for Kids, (3) Still-Not-the-Best Drinks for Kids, and (4) Best Drinks for Kids. It makes it so easy for you! If you are buying Kool-Aid Jammers for your kids, I don’t want you to feel bad. Remember, the Big Food industry spends millions of dollars on advertising to sell these drinks to you and your children. They know how to push your buttons. Take this as empowering advice. Now that you know better, you can choose better! Know anyone who needs to know the truth about Kool-Aid Jammers? Please share this with them!"
https://foodbabe.com/aspartame-in-diet-coke-classified-a-possible-carcinogen-found-on-1000s-of-food-products/,Aspartame in Diet Coke classified a Possible Carcinogen (found on 1000’s of food products!),0,"If you drink Diet or Zero Calorie drinks, you’ve got to hear this. The International Agency for Research on Cancer just declared the popular artificial sweetener, Aspartame, as a possible carcinogen. (1) That means there’s evidence it can cause cancer in humans, specifically liver cancer. You’ll find aspartame in so many “sugar free” products, like chewing gum, energy drinks, diet drinks, and snacks. I see a lot of people trying to dismiss this news and say it’s not a big deal… “Cancer scare around aspartame is mostly unfounded: Lovers of Diet Coke have little to fear“ – The Economist (2) “Aspartame may be linked to cancer, but officials say it’s safe“ – Houston Chronicle (3) “Aspartame Isn’t Great for You, But It (Probably) Won’t Kill You” – Bon Appétit (4) The truth is, there were (and still are!) many reasons to avoid Aspartame even before this news broke. A post shared by Vani Hari | Food Babe (@thefoodbabe) It’s not real food. Aspartame was originally created in a lab during pharmaceutical development. It was found to be sweet on accident when a researcher licked his finger! (5) It was never intended to be used in food, but somehow the FDA green-lit it and now it’s added to thousands of products on grocery store shelves. It’s safety has been questioned ever since! Many studies have linked Aspartame to cancer over the years, but the FDA has done nothing to stop its use. (9) A peer-reviewed study in France found that people are more likely to get cancer if they consume artificial sweeteners (such as Aspartame). The researchers studied the diet data of over 102,000 french citizens over a 10 year period (2009 to 2021). People who consumed artificial sweeteners often (Aspartame and Acesulfame Potassium) were more likely to get cancer. Specifically breast and obesity-related cancers. Heavy Aspartame intake was associated with a 22% increased risk of breast cancer! (10) Although artificial sweeteners have no calories, research finds they stimulate your appetite, increase sugar cravings, and promote fat storage and weight gain. (6) When you eat something sweet – even when it has no calories – your brain is tricked into wanting more calories because your body is not getting enough energy (i.e. calories) to be satisfied. So you keep craving sweets, eating sweets, and gaining weight. This is why a lot of people never reach their full health potential or weight loss goals, because they are constantly being pushed around by these chemical artificial sweeteners that trick the brain and body. In one study, researchers from the University of Texas discovered that drinking sodas made with artificial sweeteners may expand waist size, which is a risk factor in type 2 diabetes. (7) People who drank sodas had 70% greater increases in waist circumference compared with people who didn’t drink diet soda. Those who drank 2 or more diet sodas a day had 500% greater waist circumference increases! And in a following study they found that Aspartame raised fasting blood sugar in mice. (7) You’ll find aspartame in products labeled “diet” and “zero sugar”, and it’s not just in drinks. Aspartame is in some frozen pops and kid’s snacks. Are they getting funding from BIG Food companies that use Aspartame? Sometimes that’s the case! (8) So, what do you think of this news? Tell me in the comments!"
https://foodbabe.com/american-vs-european-ingredients-in-childrens-food-see-the-comparisons/,American VS. European Ingredients In Children’s Food (See the comparisons!),0,"Is your child getting sabotaged by American food companies who use healthier ingredients in Europe and the U.K.? There are several big food brands in the U.S. who use better ingredients and fewer processed ingredients in other countries. Some of the biggest offenders are Kellogg’s, Kraft Heinz, and PepsiCo. Check out these real examples from other countries… Kellogg’s uses beets and paprika to color their Strawberry Pop Tarts in other countries, while in the U.S. they use artificial colors Red 40, Blue 1, and Yellow 6. These dyes are linked to hyperactivity in children and can disrupt the immune system. Froot Loops in Germany are made colorful naturally, instead of the 4 different artificial dyes used in the American version. How many kids eat this for breakfast? They make Heinz ketchup with simple ingredients in other countries, which is very unlike the U.S. version full of High Fructose Corn Syrup and lab-produced “natural flavoring”. You’ll find it at nearly every restaurant in America and most children grow up dipping their fries in this. PepsiCo makes Gatorade without artificial dyes in other countries, and they are still brightly colored from natural sources such as Black Carrot Juice Concentrate. When I was a child, my parents would give me Gatorade when I was sick to keep me hydrated. Considering how many children and teenagers drink these, why don’t they make them dye-free everywhere? Europe has much stronger food regulations than America. The U.S. government allows food companies to largely police itself, deciding which ingredients, chemicals, and additives are “safe” to use in their products. This allows them to use chemicals that help them make products cheaper and quicker, with essentially zero oversight into their safety. (1) If a company can get away with using cheaper ingredients, they will! Even if these cheaper alternatives have a negative impact on our health. This is SO WRONG because many of these products are created for CHILDREN. In my brand new book, Food Babe Family, I walk you through how my family and I navigate the processed food world that we live in. You will learn how to deal with sticky food situations at parties and in restaurants. I list out healthy store-bought swaps for ultra-processed products so that your children don’t feel like they’re missing out. You’ll also find more than 100 delicious recipes that make it simple to put healthy, real food on the table that the entire family will love. From Pumpkin Muffins to Taco Salad Cups, Zucchini Pizza Bites, “Chick-Fil-A” Chicken Nuggets and Waffle Fries, and even Homemade “Oreos”. Pre-order your copy of Food Babe Family here and I’ll send you an incredible bonus TODAY! This is how we put pressure on these companies to change. We can’t depend on our government to force these companies to remove the processed ingredients they don’t use in other countries. This a grassroots movement that starts with each one of us. Because of YOU sharing this information and voting with your dollars, companies are changing. We’ve inspired companies like Kraft and Quaker to give us the same products they sell in other countries, and we can do it again! (2, 3) Thank you for fighting for safer food for everyone!"
https://foodbabe.com/read-this-before-your-kids-teens-drink-prime-energy/,Read This Before Your Kids & Teens Drink PRIME ENERGY,0,"You are probably really aware of the PRIME drink brand if you have a teen in your house. PRIME drinks are insanely popular. So many parents have asked me to write about them because their kids (mostly teenagers, but some even younger) are totally obsessed with these drinks. The are THE THING right now, heavily promoted on TikTok and YouTube. It’s really important to know that PRIME has two different drinks. The first one they came out with is a sports drink (kinda like Gatorade) called PRIME Hydration. They say it’s “the fastest growing sports drink in history” with $250 million in sales in its first year. (1) This is the drink that really got kids hooked on the PRIME brand. After that huge success, they came out with energy drinks earlier this year called PRIME Energy which have become very controversial… PRIME Energy drinks are LOADED with caffeine: 200mg per can. As much caffeine as 2 Red Bulls or 6 cans of Coke! The reason these drinks are being singled out is because the PRIME brand is popular with kids and teens. The energy drinks have been banned from schools in several countries (2) such as Australia and New Zealand where they are not even sold in stores. Kids are still getting a hold of them…buying them on the black market and selling them to each other on social media. (3) Some are even buying EMPTY bottles of PRIME off of Facebook for $20 a pop because the brand is so huge and kids want to be seen with the logo. (10) PRIME Energy drinks are selling out in grocery stores in America, and some U.S. schools will confiscate them from students if they see them. Kids and teens are more susceptible to caffeine and more likely to suffer from its effects like anxiety, abnormal heart rhythm, moodiness, sleep disruptions, and tremors. (4) High amounts of caffeine in energy drinks are also linked to heart problems in teens. (5) Sometimes even teenage heart attacks have been attributed to drinking too much caffeine. (6) It’s awful! And most parents don’t know about this. The American Academy of Pediatrics says there’s no safe dose of caffeine for children under 12…And teens under 18 should have no more than 100mg of caffeine a day. SUCRALOSE: An artificial sweetener made in a laboratory by reacting sugar with Chlorine. This zero-calorie sweetener has been linked to leukemia since 2016. (7) And more recently to other cancers too. (8) This is one ingredient I personally avoid at all costs. ACESULFAME POTASSIUM: Another artificial sweetener that Center for Science in Public Interest says to avoid it because safety testing was inadequate and some research also links it to cancer. NATURAL FLAVORS: Proprietary mixtures that make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. Preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives can make up 80% of the formulation (such as: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol) – None are labeled. CITRIC ACID: Heavily processed preservative and flavoring made from sugar fed to fungus (a GMO black mold, not fruit). It can contribute to leaky gut, or make it hard to heal from leaky gut. Besides the caffeine, you’ll find those same questionable ingredients in PRIME Hydration sports drinks. They don’t contain artificial colors, but I don’t otherwise consider these drinks any healthier than Gatorade Zero even though they are advertised that way. PRIME Energy has 200 mg. caffeine, but some brands have even more! To give you an idea of how much caffeine you’ll find in other drinks here’s a rundown: A Senator in NY is asking the FDA to investigate the marketing of Prime Energy as it’s packaged and marketed “in near identical form” as Prime Hydration. (9) I’ve seen reports of parents who didn’t realize the PRIME Energy drinks were different than their sports drinks or that they contain caffeine. Even though the cans have a small warning on them that they aren’t for anyone under the age of 18, some parents are accidentally buying them for young children! Thank you for doing your part Food Babe Army! You are the best."
https://foodbabe.com/is-non-gmo-or-organic-food-safer-the-truth-may-surprise-you/,Is Non-GMO or Organic Food safer? The truth may surprise you!,0,"I recently posted this graphic on social media about the difference between non-GMO food vs. organic food and people went wild… Which one do you think is safer to eat? When I have a choice, I choose certified organic food for all these reasons and more! Non-GMO Project verifies that a product doesn’t contain GMO ingredients. While that is good, it’s not the whole story about what the product contains, how it was produced, and where it came from. It’s key to remember: Let’s break it down… All of this is why the Non-GMO label is NOT enough! Chemicals like synthetic preservatives, artificial colors, synthetic pesticides, growth hormones and antibiotics are not used in organic food! These chemicals can lead to hyperactivity in children, allergies, skin issues, and even worse – they may put you at risk for scary, life-shortening diseases like cancer. Some organic foods get contaminated with pesticides from nearby crops, but thankfully it’s been shown to be minimal compared to what’s found on conventional crops. There are also some controversial ingredients added to some organic products such as carrageenan, natural flavors, refined flour, and refined sugar. So, remember to always read the ingredients on the food you buy, even if it is organic. If you rely on the Non-GMO Verified label to find the safest food, the info in this post is a lifesaver! Thank you for sharing and helping others know the truth about their food."
https://foodbabe.com/4-reasons-i-dont-buy-goldfish-crackers-for-my-kids/,4 Reasons I Don’t Buy Goldfish Crackers For My Kids,0,"When I first saw Goldfish crackers in the shape of Disney Princesses and Mickey Mouse – I lost my mind. Over the last few years, I’ve thrown myself into researching how Big Food companies lure children in, coaxing them with targeted marketing (like Disney characters on packages!) into craving processed foods from a very early age. This begins in the first year of life and accelerates as they get older! This is why it makes me so angry to see products like this. With products like this, the industry is putting young children on the processed food bandwagon so that it only seems natural to them to eat food from a box, bag, or jar. Sadly, this has helped create generations of children who are hooked on ultra-processed packaged foods, and who end up being “picky eaters” later in life. 1) Goldfish are primarily made from refined wheat flour that is not organic. This is a very unhealthy flour to consume. Enriched wheat flour is milled discarding all the essential nutrients the original grain contained. The heat that’s generated to crush the grain into flour destroys any vitamin or mineral normally found in the the grain, leaving a white powdery product devoid of any life. It’s essentially DEAD FOOD. So they “enrich” it back by adding in synthetic vitamins and minerals. In addition, the FDA has approved dozens of chemicals for manufacturers to use to help with the smell, appearance, and shelf life of flour. (1) Bottom line: It is very heavily processed and not real food. Conventional wheat crops in America are commonly sprayed with glyphosate (Roundup weed killer) as a drying agent before harvest, which is ending up in finished products on the shelf. This weed killer is not used on organic wheat crops. In 2016, an independent food safety laboratory tested popular American food products for residues of glyphosate (Roundup) and they specifically found it in Goldfish Crackers. In three samples of Goldfish tested, they detected 18.40 ppb glyphosate in Goldfish Crackers Original, 8.02 ppb in Goldfish Crackers Colors, and 24.58 ppb in Goldfish Crackers Whole Grain. (2) While it’s been awhile since Goldfish have been tested for glyphosate, Pepperidge Farm hasn’t addressed whether they would do anything to remedy this. Do Goldfish still contain weed killer residues? That’s not a gamble I’m willing to make. I don’t feel safe feeding my child a food known to be contaminated with Roundup, a chemical strongly linked to cancer. It’s safer to choose products made with organic whole grain wheat or other organic ingredients. 2) Goldfish are made with Soybean Oil and Canola Oil, both from GMO crops. These refined oils go through an insane amount of processing with chemical solvents, steamers, neutralizers, de-waxers, bleach and deodorizers before they end up in our food. These seed oils are very high in omega-6 fatty acids which are known to promote inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation leads to many diseases, increasing the risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. (1) The soybean and canola oil in Goldfish are derived from GMO crops, as it says so right on the label. These crops are also commonly contaminated with Roundup weed killer. 3) Goldfish contain hidden MSG in the form of autolyzed yeast extract. Pepperidge Farm adds Autolyzed Yeast Extract to engineer Goldfish Crackers to taste irresistible and memorable so your kids can’t stop eating them. This helps get your kids hooked on processed food. MSG is also linked to obesity because it causes food to taste better than it should, increasing addictive eating habits. (1) In fact, MSG is often used in animal studies to make rats obese. I don’t want my children eating Goldfish with a flavor-enhancer designed to hijack their taste buds. This is one the Terrible 10 ingredients in children’s food that I write about in my new book, Food Babe Family. 4) The cheese in Goldfish is not organic, and likely comes from factory farms where the cows are given antibiotics and hormones. It’s very important to choose products made with organic dairy to avoid consuming potential residues of antibiotics, synthetic hormones, and other drugs often given to animals on factory farms. (3) When you buy Goldfish crackers, you are supporting the industrial BIG FOOD complex of crap food. Looking for healthy snacks to feed your kids instead of Goldfish? I’ve got you covered! I filmed a 20-minute video on all the healthy snacks I keep in my pantry and to-go bag for when we are heading out the door. I also take these snacks everywhere we travel! The bonus video and snack guide will get emailed to you today. This bonus video is only going to be available for a very limited time, so make sure to get your order in now. Goldfish are a snack that almost every child in America eats. Parents buy them by the carton full at Costco. Preschools and daycares serve them. Everyone deserves to know the truth. Isn’t it time we all refuse to buy junk food designed to be addictive that has no nutritional value for our kids?"
https://foodbabe.com/3-ingredients-linked-to-cancer/,3 Ingredients Linked To Cancer In Our Food (Check your products!),0,"I recently spoke at a large event in Tampa, where I discussed the lies we are being fed about our food (by the very people we should be able to trust) and how we can protect ourselves. Afterwards I talked with many of the people there and listened to their struggles with their health, which many attributed to the food they were eating. For example, I met a man who worked for Pepsi for over 20 years. He used to drink Mountain Dew every day. He was going blind in one eye, had diabetes and heart disease. It was heartbreaking. And while I was there to teach the truth about ingredients in our food, I learned an important lesson that day… We have A LOT of work to do. The more I see how badly people are negatively affected by our food system in this country, the more passion grows within me to change it. What I am about to share with you will alarm you – it’s so downright appalling. But you need to know about it. There is a BIG misconception that the FDA diligently reviews and approves the ingredients that go into our food, and that they are protecting us from dangerous ingredients. The truth is that the FDA has done very little to improve the food system in this country, and continually allow us to eat harmful food additives, with very little oversight. Even worse, they fail to act (sometimes for YEARS) after an ingredient has been found to be unsafe. (1) For example – It took the FDA decades to remove “Partially Hydrogenated Oils” from our food, even though they began being implicated in heart attacks in the 1950’s. (2) There have been several products that have been deemed “FDA Approved” which were yanked from the market years after they were shown to be downright dangerous. What’s really scary is that history shows that something very serious needs to happen – like deaths – before the FDA takes action. Does someone really need to die before an ingredient is banned? In the eyes of the FDA, that may be the case. I put together a few examples for you of ingredients that have been allowed into our food supply, despite ample research linking them to cancer. The fact that these are (or have been) allowed in our food is outrageous, as there are safer ingredients and practices that could be used by the industry. This is not an exhaustive list, as sadly the list of potentially cancerous ingredients in our food is much longer. You’ll find Titanium Dioxide in reportedly over 11,000 products in U.S. grocery stores and SO MANY products targeting children…Including some you’d never know because it’s hidden under another name on the ingredient list! This whitening and brightening agent was banned in Europe after the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found it no longer safe to eat based on their review of hundreds of scientific studies showing that it has genotoxic effects. This means that it has the ability to damage DNA, leading to cancer. (3) Food companies all over Europe swiftly removed this chemical…but they aren’t in America. Because Titanium Dioxide is still allowed by the FDA here. Beware that the FDA doesn’t even require food companies to list Titanium Dioxide by name on an ingredient list. It can also be listed as “artificial color” “artificial color added” or “color added” on an ingredient list. There’s a bill pending in California that will ban the use of Titanium Dioxide. (4) If this CA bill passes and these companies want to continue selling these products in California, they would need to remove Titanium Dioxide. Which would likely mean that their products would change nationwide because it would be difficult to create a different product without Titanium Dioxide just for California. This is pretty cool if you ask me! In the meantime, make sure you check the ingredient label for titanium dioxide, artificial color, or color added. Popular products with Titanium Dioxide: This is an artificial sweetener made in a laboratory by reacting sugar with Chlorine, otherwise known by the brand name “Splenda”. Research done in Europe showed that rats developed leukemia and related blood cancers after consuming Sucralose. (5) This is why the Center For Science In The Public Interest (CSPI) considers Sucralose a top ingredient to avoid. (6) There are other health risks associated with Sucralose too, such as disrupting healthy gut bacteria and inducing food cravings. (7, 8) You’ll often find Sucralose in “zero sugar” drinks and other products targeting people trying to lose weight, but it’s in some kid’s products too. Popular products with Sucralose: BHA is otherwise known as Butylated Hydroxyanisole. This preservative has been shown to be an endocrine disruptor, increasing the risk of cancer. (9) The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies BHA as “possibly carcinogenic to humans“ (10) and it has been deemed a “reasonably anticipated human carcinogen” by the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, National Toxicology Program. (11) Its use is severely restricted in Europe, but the FDA doesn’t care and allows food companies to use it in America. (12) You’ll often find this preservative in sausage, pizza, canned soup, boxed potatoes, drink mixes, canned refried beans, spaghetti sauce, and chewing gum. Popular products with BHA: You don’t need to wait for the FDA to ban these ingredients linked to cancer to stop buying products with them! Start now. Check the ingredients on the products you buy and if you see these ingredients listed, look for a safer alternative (or make a homemade version instead). I bet you know someone who buys these products. Please share this far and wide! Everyone deserves to know the truth."

https://foodbabe.com/why-are-mms-in-america-made-with-artificial-ingredients-they-dont-use-in-other-countries/,Why are M&M’s in America made with artificial ingredients they don’t use in other countries?,0,"Nothing disgusts me more than food companies sabotaging us with ingredients they don’t use in other countries. Especially in products that children often eat. One of the most outrageous examples of this are M&M’s. That’s because not only do they use safer ingredients in M&M’s in other countries, but they lied to us… I filmed a video to explain: Mars Candy (the maker of M&M’s) told the media they were going to remove artificial colors from their candy in 2016, But THEY NEVER DID. (1) This was 7 Years Ago! And even worse… M&M’s in U.S. contain 10 artificial colors. M&M’s in U.K. contain ONE. The food regulations in Europe and U.K. are stronger. Europe takes a “precautionary principle” approach towards food additives that are potentially risky. They ban or add warning labels to these additives for their citizens. This is why artificial dyes Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Red 40 require a WARNING LABEL in Europe and the U.K. that says: The U.S. government doesn’t use the precautionary principle. They won’t remove additives from our food supply until they have been proven dangerous – which can take a very long time and a lot of red tape. This means Americans are literally the lab rats. It’s been shown time and again that if a company can get away with using cheaper ingredients, they will. And artificial colors are CHEAP compared to natural alternatives. Simply put, Blue 1 doesn’t require a warning label. So they can get away with still using Blue 1 in the U.K. without slapping a warning label on M&M’s. M&M’s only keeps out the artificial colors that require a warning label. Shady….right?!?!? Blue 1 doesn’t require a warning label because it wasn’t cited in the Southampton Study which found that when children eat certain artificial colors it can lead to hyperactivity. This study prompted the EU to adopt the warning label. (2) That doesn’t make Blue 1 and more safe to eat! There is ample research that all artificial colors are a risk to eat. They can disrupt the immune system, are contaminated with carcinogens, can have a negative impact on children’s ability to learn, and have been linked to long-term health problems such as asthma, skin rashes, and migraines. (3) Millions of American kids eat M&Ms. They are practically synonymous with Halloween, Christmas, and Easter. Mars said they would remove the dyes. Shouldn’t they keep their promise? Instead of M&M’s you can buy YumEarth Choco Yums or Unreal Gems, which both don’t have artificial colors. Please share this post and tell all your friends the truth about M&M’s."
https://foodbabe.com/food-babe-family-book/,My New Cookbook is Here! Food Babe Family – More Than 100 Recipes and Foolproof Strategies to Help Your Kids Fall In Love with Real Food,0,"When I became a mom, I got flooded with questions. You asked me… What do you feed your kids? How do I get them to not only eat vegetables…but LOVE them? Which snacks are good for us…and also fun to eat? How do we navigate the processed food in restaurants?…or when traveling? What do I pack in my kid’s lunch that they’ll actually eat? I am ready to share my advice, recommendations and recipes that my family loves. Introducing my new book in 2023… In this book, I show you all the ins and outs of our life as a Food Babe Family, walking you through how I feed my children (and myself!) on a daily basis. I actually almost published Food Babe Family into TWO books, because it’s jam-packed with so much information. This book has all the tools, information, and recipes you need to feed your children in a way that will foster a love for real food and set them up for a life of healthy eating. You’ll find more than 100 delicious recipes that make it simple to put healthy, real food on the table that the entire family will love. From Pumpkin Muffins to Taco Salad Cups, Zucchini Pizza Bites, “Chick-Fil-A” Chicken Nuggets and Waffle Fries, and even Homemade “Oreos”. This book isn’t just for parents or those with children living at home. It’s for everyone. This is how I eat and the recipes I’m passing on to my loved ones. I guarantee you’re going to love having this in your kitchen. Food Babe Family also makes a thoughtful gift for anyone you know who has children or is expecting. And it will be available just in time for holiday gift giving season. Food Babe Family will hit bookstores everywhere on October 17, 2023, but is available to pre-order so you can reserve your copy! Why should you pre-order now? I’m glad you asked… Here are some outtakes and behind-the-scenes photos of our photoshoot for this cookbook. It’s hard to believe but we shot all of the pictures at my house for this book in TWO DAYS. There were hundreds of shots to choose from, and only some of these made it into the cookbook. Let me just say that it was 48 hours of pure craziness between naps and set changes, but my photographer Susan Stripling is amazing and I’d never have been able to do it without her and my team there to make it run smoothly. The multimillion dollar food industry has used their vast resources to target parents, convincing them that it’s difficult to feed their children good food. But here’s the truth: parenting is difficult, but feeding your children simple, healthy, real food shouldn’t be. Our children are the future. Setting them up with the tools they need to thrive in a world that is overloaded with fast, easy junk food full of health-wrecking ingredients is a practice that’s worth its weight in gold.

https://foodbabe.com/the-alarming-ingredients-in-crumbl-cookies-dont-eat-until-you-read-this/,The Alarming Ingredients In Crumbl Cookies (Don’t Eat Until You Read This!),0,"I got this note in my inbox with a screenshot of Crumbl Cookies ingredients: “THIS is one of the fastest growing dessert shops in America?!?!?! This needs to be exposed. I think their motto should be ‘Cancer dressed up in a cookie’ – Thank you, Julie” Crumbl Cookies is indeed the fastest growing dessert shop in America right now. They’ve opened up more than 750 shops in the last few years…so you probably have one near you or will soon. When I researched Crumbl’s ingredients, I was shocked and knew I needed to share this ASAP! CRUMBL PINK SUGAR COOKIE INGREDIENTS: Powdered Sugar (Sugar, Corn Starch), All Purpose Flour (Bleached Wheat Flour, Malted Barley Flour, Niacin, Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Sugar, Butter (Pasteurized Cream, Salt), Heavy Cream (Heavy Cream, Carrageenan, Mono And Diglycerides, Polysorbate 80, Egg, Salt, Baking Soda, Corn Starch, Flavoring (Water, Sugar, Glycerin, Vanilla Extract (Water, Alcohol, Extractive Of Vanilla Beans), Natural Flavors, Fruit Juice (Color)), Almond Extract (Water, Alcohol, Oil Of Bitter Almond), Salt, Cream Of Tartar, Red Color (Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Glycerine, Sugar, FD&C Red 40, Modified Food Starch, FD&C Red 3, FD&C Yellow 5, Carrageenan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid. Crumbl Ultimate Peanut Butter Cookies: Crumbl Strawberry Shortcake Cookies: Crumbl Dirt Cake Cookies: Crumbl Red Velvet White Chip Cookies: Crumbl Banana Cream Pie Cookies: TITANIUM DIOXIDE: Banned in Europe after scientists at the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found it “no longer safe to eat” based on their review of hundreds of scientific studies showing that it has genotoxic effects. This means that it has the ability to damage DNA, leading to cancer. (1) ARTIFICIAL COLORS: Dyes derived from petroleum, linked to several health issues including allergies and hyperactivity in children, which require a warning label in Europe. Recent research shows they may also disrupt the immune system. (2) RED 3: The FDA banned this artificial color from cosmetics in 1990 after it was shown to cause cancer in animal studies, but they still allow it in our food! A bill is currently pending in both California and New York that will ban Red 3 from food…but for now it’s up to us to read the ingredient list to avoid it. (1) NATURAL & ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS: Proprietary mixtures that make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. Preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives can make up 80% of the formulation (such as: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol) – None of which are labeled. With these flavors, chemists can make anything taste like “strawberry shortcake” without any actual strawberries (or any real food for that matter), which is a really horrible thing if you care about health. But it’s a great thing for food manufacturers because these flavors are much cheaper than using real food. (2) BHA: Shown to be an endocrine disruptor, linked to cancer, causing tumors in animal studies. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies BHA as “possibly carcinogenic to humans“ and it’s been deemed a “reasonably anticipated human carcinogen” by the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, National Toxicology Program. (2) TBHQ: Controversial preservative that may harm the immune system and increase the risk of food allergies. Scientific research has shown that TBHQ negatively affects “T-cells” in the body (which are generally used to fight infections) in a way that promotes allergies to tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat and shellfish. (2) POLYSORBATE 80: An emulsifier linked to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. (3) CARRAGEENAN: A thickener and emulsifier that can cause digestive problems and intestinal inflammation. Tests have found that “food-grade carrageenan” is contaminated with up to 25% of “degraded carrageenan” (the kind not supposed to be used in food and drinks). Degraded carrageenan is classified as a “possible human carcinogen” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. (2) MONO AND DIGLYCERIDES: This emulsifier is a byproduct of oil processing – including canola and soybean oils – which may contain trans fat that is detrimental to our heart health. (2) HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP (HFCS): This heavily processed sweetener made from GMO cornstarch that contains more fructose than regular corn syrup. Studies have shown it increases appetite and the risk of weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia. HFCS especially contributes to type 2 diabetes in children. (2) ACESULFAME POTASSIUM: An artificial sweetener that the Center for Science in Public Interest says to avoid it because safety testing was inadequate and some research links it to cancer. (2) HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OILS: These contain small amounts of artificial trans fats which are detrimental to heart health. According to EWG – the FDA has found low levels of trans fat in fully hydrogenated oils. Refined oils go through an insane amount of processing at high temperatures with chemicals to transform them into clear, bland, and odorless product. (4) SOYBEAN OIL: This unhealthy oil is too high in omega-6 fatty acids and increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. (2) BLEACHED FLOUR: This is the worst type of flour because it’s been stripped of fiber and nutrients, and comes from a heavily hybridized wheat crop, which may have been pre-harvested with Roundup weed killer, linked to cancer. Treated with up to any of the 60 different chemicals approved by the FDA – including chemical bleach. (2) The ingredients in Crumbl’s ice cream are just as processed as their cookies. It is full of high fructose corn syrup and emulsifiers that can affect gut bacteria and trigger inflammation and other changes in the gut (2, 3), as well as obesity and metabolic syndrome: No thanks! If you know anyone who loves Crumbl Cookies, make sure to share these ingredient lists with them. Here’s to making delicious cookies for our families without toxins!"
https://foodbabe.com/roundup-weed-killer-detected-on-oatmeal-see-which-brands-how-to-avoid-it/,Roundup weed killer detected on oatmeal (See which brands + how to avoid it!),0,"Almost every night before bed, I start my slow cooker with steel-cut oats so they’ll be perfectly ready in the morning. They take less than a minute to prep at night before bed and zero time during the morning rush! While I love this for breakfast, I always choose Organic steel cut oats to make my oatmeal. Here’s why… Oats are one of those crops commonly contaminated with Roundup weedkiller (glyphosate). This chemical is known to cause cancer. (1) Organic oats are not sprayed with Roundup, as it’s prohibited on organic crops. Organic oats can be cross-contaminated, but thankfully, tests have found that organic products are less likely to be contaminated and have far fewer residues than conventional products. (3) It’s important to know that the Non-GMO label doesn’t mean much on plain oats, because all oats are Non-GMO. Also, the non-GMO label doesn’t mean that pesticides are not used, it only means that the ingredients are not genetically engineered. So, it doesn’t mean the same as organic and many pesticides can be used on non-GMO products, like oats. (2) It is safest to look for oat products that are certified organic, and ideally, that have been certified by a third-party to be free of glyphosate. The Environmental Working Group (EWG) tested non-GMO oatmeal and found most of it contaminated with Roundup! Quaker Old Fashioned Oats was found to have the most Roundup per sample, with more than 1,000 ppb in two of three samples tested. (3) Here’s a summary of brands with Roundup detected: Small amounts of glyphosate (or none) were found on organic brands tested: Do you buy any of these brands or know someone who does?"
https://foodbabe.com/chick-fil-as-cauliflower-sandwich-is-full-of-unhealthy-processed-ingredients-see-the-full-list/,Chick-Fil-A’s Cauliflower Sandwich is full of unhealthy processed ingredients… (See the full list),0,"When I first heard that Chick-Fil-A was going to start serving up Cauliflower Sandwiches, my first thought was… WOW… you can get a vegetable sandwich at Chick-Fil-A??!? But my second thought was… What are in those sandwiches? Knowing the crazy amount of processed ingredients they put in their chicken sandwiches (like MSG, Sodium Aluminum Phosphate, Potassium Iodate, and Dimethylpolysiloxane)… Let’s just say I was REALLY suspicious. And now that I have the full list of ingredients for the Chick-Fil-A Cauliflower Sandwich in my hot little hands, it’s safe to say my suspicions were confirmed. This sandwich is NOT what you’d think. You’d think that you’re just eating healthy cauliflower in a simple sandwich…but NO… DEAD WRONG. And before you think that it is a vegetarian or vegan option…it’s not that either “due to its cooking environment”. (1) Here’s the sad truth: Just like their chicken, Chick-Fil-A couldn’t resist adding MSG to their cauliflower. Would you EVER add MSG to your healthy cauliflower at home? Of course not. MSG is used by restaurants to make you crave their food so that you keep coming back. (2) It also makes you eat more than you should. There is simply no other reason to use MSG. It has been shown to help you gain weight, despite how many calories you eat. (3) This is why MSG is fed to rats in animal studies to make them obese! (4, 5) MSG is also an excitotoxin that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. (6) This is one of the top ingredients to avoid if you want to lose weight or maintain your weight. MSG is found in the breading that goes on that cauliflower in this sandwich. Natural Flavor is another ingredient that is similar to MSG. These are proprietary (ie. secret) mixtures created in a laboratory to make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. (7) Ever eat something and feel like you can’t stop? It probably had natural flavors added. Companies won’t tell you what ingredients they use to make these flavors…it’s top secret and heavily protected. I don’t know about you, but I hate the idea of eating something with secret ingredients. Who knows what it could be!? We do know that natural flavors can contain preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives that can make up 80% of the formulation (such as: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol – none of which are disclosed to the public). (8) Chick-Fil-A adds “natural flavor” to the Honey Buffalo Sauce on the cauliflower sandwich, and also to the Butter Flavored Oil that they spread on their buns (which is mostly soybean oil, and no actual butter). This is a very popular cooking oil used by most restaurants, but it also happens to be one of the most unhealthy oils out there. It’s widely known that Chick-fil-A uses peanut oil in their fryers, but you may not know that they use soybean oil in their buns, breading, and some sauces. Soybean oil is too high in omega-6 fatty acids and increases the risk of inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological conditions, and autoimmune diseases. (9, 10, 11) Several animal and human studies have found that eating seed oils (like soybean oil) increases obesity. (12, 13, 14, 15) The dramatic rise of soybean oil consumption in recent decades parallels the rise in obesity. (16, 17) Soybean oil is also made from GMO soybeans (heavily treated with pesticides and Roundup) and the oil is extracted with hexane–a neurotoxin! During processing, whole soybeans are submerged in hexane to separate the oil from the protein. It’s possible that some of the hexane remains in the oil (which is why organic expeller-pressed oils are safer). (18) It’s much healthier to use organic virgin coconut oil, avocado oil, grass-fed ghee and extra virgin olive oil. Potassium Iodate: I was surprised to see this controversial dough conditioner in the buns at Chick-fil-A. Most store-bought bread brands have stopped using it and it’s thankfully becoming increasingly rare. This ingredient has been linked to an increased risk of cancer because it can lead to excessive intake of iodine when it’s used in bread. It may also break down in dough to form iodide (a Japanese study found that high doses of potassium iodide leads to cancer in rats). (19) Xanthan Gum: This thickening ingredient in Chick-fil-A’s Honey Buffalo Sauce has recently been shown to actively alter the gut microbiome. (20) Gut bacteria is very important for our health and well-being, so disrupting this can have a negative effect on overall health. Animal studies have shown it to be inflammatory as well. (21) This additive is often made from GMO corn. Potassium Sorbate: This preservative has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer. (22) It has also been shown to damage DNA when it’s mixed with Ascorbic Acid (which is also an ingredient in Chick-fil-A’s Cauliflower Sandwich). (23) Enriched Bleached Wheat Flour: That healthy cauliflower is breaded in the most processed and refined flour known to man. It’s stripped of fiber and nutrients and is essentially dead food, so they “enrich” it with synthetic vitamins that are not from nature. It comes from a heavily hybridized wheat crop, which may have been pre-harvested with a spraying of Roundup weed killer, a chemical strongly linked to cancer. (24) Sodium Aluminum Phosphate: This leavening agent in the breading contains Aluminum (a neurotoxin) which can build up in your body over time, especially if you have kidney issues. Dimethylpolysiloxane: This de-foaming agent is added to the fryers at Chick-fil-A. It’s otherwise known as the main ingredient in Silly Putty. It was commonly used as a filler fluid in breast implants, until it was phased out due to safety concerns. If this substance is considered to be a hazardous ingredient when it’s placed inside our bodies, doesn’t it make you wonder why the FDA says we can eat it? I’ll tell ya why. They are jumping on the cauliflower trend to lure you into believing this sandwich is the healthy plant-based fast food option you’ve been dreaming about. I get so angry when I see products like this because I used to be so duped by them! It checks all the boxes I’d look for… lower in calories, full of vegetables, easy to pick up on my busy lunch break. Well thankfully, I’m duped NO MORE. If you love Chick-Fil-A…don’t despair! I have some incredible copycat recipes that will satisfy your cravings without the nasty ingredients: All of the major media networks (CNN, Yahoo, The Washington Post, USA Today, Fox Business) wrote about Chick-fil-A’s new Cauliflower Sandwich and never even bothered to investigate or report about the ingredients. All they did was promote it. It’s shameful! This is why it’s important to seek out independent investigative reporting on topics like this."
https://foodbabe.com/insane-facts-about-doritos-how-to-make-homemade-doritos-recipe/,Insane facts about Doritos + How To Make Homemade Doritos (RECIPE!),0,"A recent survey revealed that Doritos are the most popular snack in America, out-ranking M&M’s. I probably shouldn’t be surprised. I can hardly recall a time that I’ve gone to a party or outdoor cookout where Doritos aren’t being served. Have you ever wondered WHY this is? What makes them so appealing? I did some digging and found some insane facts about Doritos… 100 million Americans consume Doritos each year. And 6.65 million Americans consume 8 or MORE bags a month. Eight bags a month! WOW! I told you…It’s insane how popular Doritos are. First, they contain MSG. MSG is only added to food to make it taste so irresistible that you keep coming back for more. MSG is what they feed rats in scientific studies to make them fat. It also is associated with increased risk of obesity in humans. Studies show this additive can help you gain weight, despite how many calories you eat. Then they pile on “Natural Flavors” and “Artificial Flavors”. These are proprietary mixtures crafted in a lab, which are very similar to MSG. These flavors are designed so that you experience the best 1 millionth part of the taste – so you keep wanting to go back for more and more, searching continuously for gratification – eating more of that product. Sound familiar??? This is concerning because Doritos in America are filled with artificial colors that they don’t use in other countries. These artificial colors are derived from petroleum and linked to several health issues, including allergies and hyperactivity in children, which require a warning label in Europe. Recent research shows they may also disrupt the immune system. Doritos in the U.S. also contain GMO ingredients and have tested positive for Roundup weedkiller residues linked to cancer. If you eat Doritos, is it time to stop buying them? The decision is yours. This homemade version tastes incredible too, especially when they are still a bit warm from the oven! You’ll find my recipe for Homemade Doritos (which are organic and non-GMO) in the Food Babe Kitchen cookbook. If you don’t have my cookbook yet, I’ll post the recipe for you below so you can try it ASAP! Please share this Doritos recipe with your friends and family who are still buying Doritos full of questionable ingredients. Are you going to stop buying them? Tell me in the comments!"
https://foodbabe.com/orange-creamsicle-pops-recipe-healthy-swap-for-store-bought-creamsicles/,Orange Creamsicle Pops Recipe (Healthy Swap For Store-Bought Creamsicles!),0,"Orange Creamsicles were one of my favorite treats as a child, and since I’ve learned how bad the ingredients are in them, I’ve really missed them. Thankfully, I’ve figured out how to recreate this summertime staple with 100% real food ingredients which are actually healthy for you! I used to LOVE when my mom bought Orange Creamsicles as a child and ate them all summer long. Back then, we had no idea how bad the ingredients were in those little suckers! Orange Creamsicles are PACKED with seven different types of refined sugar: corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, maltodextrin, sugar, fructose, corn syrup solids, and orange juice “concentrate”. Did you know that juice “concentrate” is juice that is boiled down to a syrup? This heating process destroys beneficial nutrients and turns it into a refined sugar. Some experts say it is similar to high-fructose corn syrup! Then they add in several controversial emulsifiers, “natural” flavors, and conventional milk. Check out this comparison: First, you’ll need a good popsicle mold that isn’t made of plastic. I like these stainless steel ones. Then, you’ll simply blend the coconut milk, bananas, vanilla extract, and sea salt in a blender until smooth. This is your “cream” for the creamsicles. To assemble, add one tablespoon of fresh pressed orange juice to each popsicle mold (6 to 8 of them) and top this with one tablespoon of your cream mixture. Stick a popsicle stick in it and freeze this first layer for a hour. Now, repeat the process and build your second layer with one tablespoon orange juice and one tablespoon of cream mixture per creamsicle and pop it in the freezer for 2 more hours. That’s it! I hope you get to make these healthy orange “creamsicles” soon. If you know anyone who might still be buying Orange Creamsicles full of high fructose corn syrup and other nasty ingredients, please share this healthy swap with them!"
https://foodbabe.com/popeyes-spicy-chicken-sandwich-ingredients-exposed-see-whats-in-those-cajun-fries-biscuits-too/,Popeyes Spicy Chicken Sandwich Ingredients Exposed (See what’s in those Cajun Fries & Biscuits too!),0,"When Popeyes came out with their Spicy Chicken Sandwich a couple years ago, it was unlike anything I’d ever seen. Lines were around the block and the demand was so insane that they sold out of these sandwiches for weeks. (1) My first thought was, “What in the world is in those things that people can’t seem to get enough?” I had to know what was in them! Popeyes doesn’t publish their ingredients on their website like other major fast places do (KFC and McDonald’s) and they generally keep their ingredients under tight wraps. There are some old Popeyes ingredient lists floating around online – but these are outdated and don’t include the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. I contacted Popeyes and asked for their ingredients list – but they gave me their “nutrition facts” instead, which is just the calories, fat grams, etc… and really doesn’t tell you anything about what you’re actually eating. I contacted them again… and got the same canned response. Womp Womp! I have to admit, I’ve never eaten a Popeyes Spicy Chicken Sandwich. I don’t eat at places who refuse to disclose their ingredients. It’s totally shady to hide what the actual ingredients are in your food, and I knew that if Popeyes wasn’t willing to share what’s in their food, I wouldn’t eat there. Refusing to give up, I recently contacted Popeyes AGAIN for their ingredients and to my surprise they sent me the full list of ingredients in their Spicy Chicken Sandwich, Cajun Fries, and Biscuits. YEAH!! This has been a long time coming, so I can’t wait to share Popeyes ingredients with you. This is a far cry from how it’s marketed to us: “Popeyes’ Spicy Chicken Sandwich features a chicken breast filet marinated in Louisiana seasonings, then battered and breaded in a new buttermilk coating. The filet is served with barrel-cured pickles and Spicy Mayonnaise on a toasted buttery brioche bun.” MSG is purely used to make you crave their food and eat more than you should. There is simply no other reason to use MSG. Now it’s no surprise how Popeyes has hooked you on their Spicy Chicken Sandwiches and keeps you coming back for more and more. MSG can also help you gain weight, despite how many calories you eat… A study from researchers at the University of North Carolina looked at the diets of 752 men and women and found those who ate MSG were more likely to be overweight or obese even with the same amount of physical activity and calorie intake. So even if you’re NOT overeating, MSG could be silently packing on pounds. (2) MSG is also an excitotoxin that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, so there are other health risks associated with it as well. (3) Artificial Colors (Yellow #5, Yellow #6, Red #3): Derived from petroleum, may cause hyperactivity in children (4) & can disrupt the immune system. (5) Red #3 was banned by the FDA from cosmetics due to its link to cancer, so it is especially concerning. (6) Powdered Cellulose and Methylcellulose: This thickener is usually made from wood, because it’s cheap. Research links consumption of this additive (not naturally occurring when found in whole food) to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. (7) Sodium Aluminum Phosphate: Contains aluminum (a neurotoxin) which can build up in your body over time. (8) Soybean Oil: This unhealthy oil is too high in omega-6 fatty acids and increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. (9) BHT: Risky preservative linked to cancer. Unnecessary and not permitted in Europe or Australia. (10) Dimethylpolysiloxane: Main ingredient in Silly Putty. Was commonly used as a filler fluid in breast implants, however this substance was phased out due to safety concerns. (11) If this substance is considered to be a hazardous ingredient when it’s placed inside our bodies, doesn’t it make you wonder why the FDA says we can eat it? And let’s talk about Popeyes Biscuits… Popeyes Biscuits aren’t like grandma used to make! They may contain buttermilk…but they also contain artificial flavors, carrageenan (linked to intestinal inflammation), Potassium Sorbate (linked to DNA damage), and Aluminum (a neurotoxin). No thanks! “At Popeyes US, we’re working towards banning 120 artificial ingredients and offering a menu that is free from colors, flavors, and preservatives from artificial sources by 2025, wherever possible.” – Popeyes Website, June 2022 (12) Popeyes is owned by Restaurant Brands International (who also owns Burger King). Burger King recently “Blacklisted” 120 artificial ingredients from their food… but when I looked into this I found that this was a bunch of B.S. (13) Many of the ingredients they banned from their food are not approved by the FDA anyway, and their food is still riddled with controversial ingredients. Will Popeyes ban the same 120 ingredients? This is likely. That’s why it’s a pretty safe bet that Popeyes commitment to serving real food without artificial ingredients is B.S. too and just a shady marketing ploy. “Our chicken is free of added hormones and steroids. In the US, our chicken is now also raised without the use of antibiotics important to human medicine, as defined by the World Health Organization.” – Popeyes Website, June 2022 (12) Popeyes claims their chicken is “free of added hormones”, but this actually means nothing. All chicken in the U.S. is free from added hormones because it’s been banned since the 1950’s. (14) They also claim their chicken is “raised without the use of antibiotics important to human medicine”, which means they aren’t using antibiotics that are also used on humans. They may routinely use OTHER antibiotics when raising chicken, which is concerning. (15) That’s because the overuse of any antibiotic in animal agriculture has the ability to contribute to antibiotic resistance, which is a huge threat to our health – meaning that in the future if you get an infection, you won’t be able to treat it with antibiotics anymore because they don’t work. (15) “Eliminating medically important antibiotics for growth purposes is now the standard in the meat and poultry industry, so restaurants or meat producers that have this policy aren’t doing anything beyond what they’re already supposed to be doing.” – Michael Hansen, Ph.D., senior scientist at Consumer Reports. (15) Thanks to the work and a petition by Compassion in World Farming asking Popeyes to stop factory farming practices (16), Popeyes has agreed to some changes. By 2024, Popeyes committed to transitioning their breeds, providing more space and enhanced living environments (litter quality, lighting, etc) for their chickens per GAP standards. (17) While this is good, I don’t personally believe it’s enough. When I’m craving a chicken sandwich, there is nothing better than making one at home with pastured chicken and organic ingredients. I perfected the perfect “fried” chicken sandwich (which is actually baked) that tastes like a Chick-fil-A sandwich, and even better actually. You’ll find the recipe in my New York Times best selling cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen. If you don’t have a copy yet, you can give the recipe a try here. Isn’t it time that everyone knows what they are REALLY eating at Popeyes?"
https://foodbabe.com/burger-king-ingredients-finally-revealed-in-the-whopper-fries-and-chicken-nuggets/,"Burger King Ingredients Finally Revealed in the Whopper, Fries, and Chicken Nuggets",0,"This is a very important investigation into Burger King that you need to know about. What I’m about to share with you is the ultimate example of a food corporation swindling the public into believing their food is something that it’s not. You may have seen all over the media last September that Burger King banned 120 artificial ingredients from their restaurants. (1) They partnered with celebrities, like Nelly, to sell their new “Keep It Real” meals: Burger King published a “Blacklist” of their banned ingredients on their website. (2) However, when I pulled up their blacklist, I noticed something very interesting… Many of these ingredients haven’t been allowed in American food for decades, so of course Burger King doesn’t use them. For instance, you’ll find Violet 1 on their list, which hasn’t been allowed in food since 1973! (3) These ingredients may be artificial…but they aren’t allowed anyway. This is why it is beyond shady that Burger King would include these ingredients on their list, knowing that most consumers (and apparently also the media who covered their story) wouldn’t know this. (These ingredients are highlighted red in the graphic above) For example, Burger King separately lists these ingredients, which are different names for the same ingredient: Are these duplicates a mistake on their part? Or are they trying to trick us by making their list look longer? (These ingredients are highlighted green in the graphic above) I have never seen a processed food product with Anoxomer added. I’ve also never read an ingredient list and saw THBP or Trihydroxybutyrophenonon the list. I basically read food labels for a living, so this is really saying something! These ingredients may sound “scary” and make Burger King’s list look legit… but I highly doubt that Burger King ever used many of the ingredients on their list in the first place, because they are so rare or aren’t permitted in products they sell. (These ingredients are highlighted yellow in the graphic below) Burger King tells us what isn’t in their food, but doesn’t want to tell us what actually is in it. If they really want to show how “REAL” their food is, shouldn’t they publish all their ingredients online for everyone to see? Could it be because they don’t want you to know what’s really in their food? Burger King’s bun is laced with several dough conditioners, such as Calcium Peroxide which is banned in China (5) and Potassium Iodate that’s linked to an increased risk of cancer because it can lead to excessive intake of iodine when it’s used in bread. (6) It may also break down in dough to form iodide (a Japanese study found that high doses of potassium iodide leads to cancer in rats). (6) The Whopper also contains processed ingredients DATEM and Mono and Diglycerides, which are byproducts of oil processing – including canola and soybean oils – which may contain trans fat. (7) Burger King’s Chicken Nuggets are “Seasoned” with chemicals that are designed to keep you coming back for more, Yeast Extract (hidden MSG) and Natural Flavors (which are proprietary mixtures that make food taste irresistible). Burger King’s Fries are coated in “Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate” (which keeps their frozen fries from turning gray) and unhealthy vegetable oils like Canola Oil and Soybean Oil, which increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. (8) Soybean oil almost always comes from GMO soybeans – which have been shown to contain high levels of residues from the herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) compared to non-GMO soybeans. (9) Burger King might not use high fructose corn syrup….But they still use corn syrup. They might not use artificial flavors…But they still use natural flavors (which is essentially the same thing). They might not use MSG…But they still use Yeast Extract, which contains free glutamic acid and is used as a replacement for MSG. (10) Tell me what you think in the comments below!

https://foodbabe.com/chick-fil-a-chicken-nuggets-recipe-copycat-without-addicting-chemicals/,Chick-fil-A Chicken Nuggets Recipe (Copycat) without addicting chemicals!,0,"Next time you’re tempted into going through the Chick-fil-A drive-thru, I hope you remember you have this recipe for homemade Chick-fil-A chicken nuggets in your back pocket! These nuggets have that irresistible taste and crispy coating, without the nasty ingredients that Chick-fil-A uses. They are also baked, instead of fried, which also makes them a healthier option. If you’ve ever wondered why Chick-fil-A’s chicken is so addicting, here’s your answer! Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is a “flavor enhancer” that heightens the flavor of food by exciting neurons in the brain when eaten. This sounds like a good idea for spicing up bland foods, but MSG isn’t as innocent as it seems: A 2008 study from researchers at the University of North Carolina looked at the diets of 752 men and women and found those who ate MSG were more likely to be overweight or obese even with the same amount of physical activity and total calorie intake. So even if you’re not overeating, MSG could be silently packing on pounds. (1) MSG makes food taste so good that you help yourself to too much, which further sabotages your weight. (2) Ever wonder why you can remember the difference in taste between a Chick-fil-A’s Chicken and other fast food chains? It’s because of MSG. They engineer their food to make a flavor irresistible and memorable so you eat more. Chick-fil-A (and other food companies) know you don’t want to see MSG on their ingredient lists, so they will often substitute it with the additives “Yeast Extract” or “Autolyzed Yeast”, which contain the main component of MSG and is essentially the same thing. (3) Chick-fil-A does this by adding Yeast Extract to some of their chicken. You’ll find yeast extract added to Chick-fil-A’s “healthier items”: grilled chicken nuggets, grilled chicken sandwich, and grilled chicken salads. You’ll want to plan ahead, however, because to get that authentic “Chick-fil-A” taste you will marinate the chicken for at least 6 hours. It’s generally the easiest to prep these at night and let them marinate overnight. Carefully cut three boneless chicken breasts into 1-inch chunks and set them aside. Pull out a medium bowl and whisk together two eggs and 3/4 cup each of pickle juice and milk (dairy or non-dairy). Add the chicken pieces, cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours. Overnight is best. Most pickles are dyed with artificial colors (yellow 5 or yellow 6) to make them look brighter, but these dyes are linked to hyperactivity in children and other health risks. (4) Simply read the ingredient list on the pickles you buy to ensure they don’t contain artificial colors. Turn on your oven and preheat it to 400 degrees. In a medium bowl, mix together the spelt flour, powdered sugar, paprika, dry mustard, sea salt and pepper. Drain the marinade from the chicken and dredge the pieces in the flour mixture until fully coated: Place the chicken on a parchment-lined baking sheet, providing space in between each piece. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. I’ve figured out how to recreate Chick-fil-A’s sauce without the nasty corn syrup, soybean oil, natural flavors… and other unhealthy ingredients. We’re not going to use all those crazy ingredients to make a dipping sauce. You can choose to dip them in Primal Kitchen Unsweetened Ketchup, or you can make one of these delicious dipping sauces: I hope this gives you a ton of options! I also hope you try these nuggets soon and you are able to satisfy your craving for Chick-fil-A nuggets without the MSG and controversial ingredients. I’ve got you covered with recipes for their Waffle Fries and famous Chicken Sandwich too. There’s really no excuse to hit up the Chick-fil-A drive-thru anymore is there?"
https://foodbabe.com/homemade-toaster-strudels-without-artificial-colors-tbhq-or-high-fructose-corn-syrup-easy-recipe/,"Homemade Toaster Strudels without artificial colors, TBHQ, or high fructose corn syrup (Easy Recipe!)",0,"This recipe for homemade Toaster Strudels is gonna blow your mind! Let me tell you… These flaky and buttery pastries are DEADLY delicious. And even better… They are SO EASY to make. And look so fancy. You’ll impress your family and friends with your mad cooking skills. Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone that you weren’t spending hours in the kitchen to make these (they only take 30 minutes!) Shhhh…It’s our little secret. Yes…these DO taste as amazing as they look. I almost hate to call them “Toaster Strudels” because they are a million times better than those Pillsbury ones made with gross ingredients. Have you seen what’s in those things? Pillsbury uses a tiny amount of “Strawberry Juice Concentrate” which are strawberries that were boiled to death into a syrup, mixed with artificial colors, thickeners, artificial flavors, and corn syrup, to make it taste and look like real strawberries. Yuck! It’s sad to think how many parents are unknowingly buying these for their children…who might even be eating all these man-made processed ingredients for breakfast… potentially disrupting their young immune systems and triggering inflammation. Thankfully, we now have a MUCH better option: Most store-bought pastry dough and jam is made with dreadful ingredients, like hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup. Ideally, you will take a little extra time to make homemade organic jam and pastry dough. This is the best way to control the ingredients, especially since it isn’t always easy to find clean and organic versions of these products in the store. However, there are some better options available. You actually won’t use a toaster at all… as we bake these in the oven instead. They would get quite messy if we tried to use a toaster, and they get perfectly flaky and puffy when you bake them in the oven. To get started, preheat your oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper. Measure out 1/2 cup of jam and put it in a small bowl. Stir in half a tablespoon of arrowroot powder (this will thicken up the filling a bit). Set this bowl aside. Grab another small bowl and whisk together one egg with a tablespoon of heavy cream. This is the egg wash that you will brush on the pastries before baking. Set this bowl aside too. Take out your puff pastry, and cut the sheet into 8 equal size rectangles. Place these on the baking sheet like this: You’ll want to keep the puff pastry as cold as possible while working with it, so move quickly onto the next step. Put one heaping tablespoon of jam onto the center of four rectangles, leaving roughly 1/2” around the edges. Brush the edges lightly with the egg wash. You can use a brush, or it’s just as easy to use your finger since it’s a small surface and you only need a little bit. Place an empty puff pastry rectangle on top and seal it together using the back of a fork until it looks like a Toaster Strudel. Repeat with remaining ingredients until you end up with 4 strudels: Brush the tops of each strudel with the egg wash and bake for 20 to 22 minutes or until golden brown. While the strudels are baking, it’s time to make the icing. Mix together the icing ingredients (powdered sugar, heavy cream, and vanilla) in a small bowl. You’ll want to be able to drizzle it over your strudels, so add more cream if necessary to thin it out. The thicker the icing the more it will have that bright white color once drizzled on top. The thinner the icing is, the more it will be transparent after it is applied. Once the baked strudels have cooled, drizzle the icing on top. Now they’re ready to enjoy! They taste incredible when they’re fresh and still warm from the oven. Are you drooling yet? Here’s the printable recipe that you’ll want to keep handy! Please share this recipe with anyone in your life who is still buying Pillsbury Toaster Strudels full of artificial colors, fake “strawberries”, and high fructose corn syrup. I promise you that they’ll love this homemade version so much more!"
https://foodbabe.com/stop-buying-hidden-valley-ranch-seasoning-make-this-recipe-instead/,Stop Buying Hidden Valley Ranch Seasoning (Make This Recipe Instead!),0,"I recently shared my recipe for homemade taco seasoning – and since then you’ve been asking for a Ranch Seasoning recipe to replace those packets of Hidden Valley Ranch (which is full of MSG and other nasties). Without further ado, I went to work in the kitchen and figured out how to make an easy ranch seasoning mix with real food ingredients that you can use to make delicious ranch dressing, ranch dip, or in other recipes. MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE (MSG): A flavor-enhancer and excitotoxin that excites brain cells to death, increases food cravings, and makes you eat more than you should. ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS: Chemical mixtures produced by fractional distillation and chemical manipulation of various chemicals like crude oil or coal tar. Artificial flavors are much cheaper than using real food and make fake food taste irresistible. NATURAL FLAVORS: Proprietary mixtures that make food taste irresistible so that you keep coming back for more. CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE: This thickener usually made from wood because it’s cheap. Research links consumption of this additive (not naturally occurring when found in whole food) to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. It’s always best to buy organic herbs and spices, because virtually all conventional brands sold in the U.S. are fumigated and irradiated. These practices leave a finished product with decreased levels of vitamins and natural enzymes – and all that processing changes the chemical composition of a spice, potentially creating toxic, carcinogenic by-products. Organic spices are not irradiated and cannot have genetically engineered ingredients (GMOs), artificial colors, preservatives, and other synthetic anti-caking agents. Some of my favorite spice companies include – Simply Organic, Frontier, and various store-brands that are organic. I also choose an organic buttermilk powder instead of conventional brands. That’s because organic regulations prohibit the use of synthetic hormones, antibiotics, and GMO feed – and I don’t want residues of any of that in my food. You can find organic buttermilk powder in most natural food grocery stores and online. To make ranch dressing with this seasoning, mix 3 tablespoons of the mix with 1 cup mayo and 1 cup milk. I like to use organic grass-fed milk or nut milk, and mayo that is made with olive oil or avocado oil, such as Chosen Foods brand. Beware that almost every brand of mayo (even organic!) are made with unhealthy soybean oil or canola oil. You’ll find that the majority that say they are “Made with Olive Oil” are actually mostly sunflower oil or other inferior oils. This is why it pays to be careful and read the ingredient list to see what you are really buying. Don’t get swindled into buying Olive Oil Mayo made with mostly soybean oil! To make ranch dip with this seasoning, mix 3 tablespoons of the mix with 2 cups sour cream. You can use an organic pasture-raised sour cream (such as Organic Valley brand) or a vegan sour “cream” (like Forager Project brand). Feel free to add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice too, if desired. Please share this ranch seasoning recipe with your ranch-loving friends. There’s no reason to keep buying those expensive packets of Hidden Valley Ranch full of questionable ingredients!"
https://foodbabe.com/3-ingredient-homemade-hot-cocoa-recipe-healthy-swap-for-swiss-miss-hot-chocolate/,3-Ingredient Homemade Hot Cocoa Recipe (Healthy swap for Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate!),0,"Whenever we get snowstorms here in Charlotte I feel nostalgic about when I was a child and my mom would mix up Swiss Miss hot cocoa after we got done playing in the snow. It was the best way to warm up my cold little hands! This gets me wondering now though… What are the ingredients in Swiss Miss? They can’t be that bad, right? Shouldn’t it be basically cocoa powder and sugar? I ran down to the supermarket to see for myself. And boy was I wrong! CORN SYRUP or CORN SYRUP SOLIDS (in Swiss Miss, Nestle, Great Value): A heavily processed form of sugar typically made from the starch of GMO corn. This refined sugar has zero nutritional value. CONVENTIONAL WHEY or DAIRY SOLIDS (in Swiss Miss, Nestle, Great Value): Derived from conventionally raised dairy cows who were likely raised in a large factory farm on a diet of GMOs and routine antibiotics. NATURAL FLAVORS (in Swiss Miss, Good & Gather, Great Value): A proprietary ingredient that can contain preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives that can make up 80% of the formulation (such as: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol – none of which are labeled). ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (in Nestle, Great Value): Chemical mixtures produced by fractional distillation and chemical manipulation of various chemicals like crude oil or coal tar. Much cheaper than using real food ingredients, and used to make processed food taste irresistible. MONO AND DIGLYCERIDES (in Swiss Miss, Great Value): This emulsifier is a byproduct of oil processing – including canola and soybean oils – which may contain trans fat that is detrimental to our heart health. SUCRALOSE (in Nestle): Artificial sweetener made in a laboratory by reacting sugar with Chlorine. Has been linked to leukemia and related blood cancers in animal studies. CELLULOSE GUM (in Nestle, Great Value): This thickener and emulsifier is usually made from wood, because it’s cheap. Research links consumption of this additive (not naturally occurring when found in whole food) to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. There are some good organic store-bought hot cocoa mixes, such as Nib Mor, Lake Champlain, or Equal Exchange, but it is way cheaper to make your own. You can make a big batch and store it in a glass jar for when the craving strikes! All you do is mix together one cup each of cacao powder and coconut sugar. Stir in one and a half cups of coconut milk powder and store the hot cocoa mix in a jar. When you’re ready to make cocoa, simply add 3 tablespoons of hot cocoa mix to a mug and stir in hot water. Each jar makes 18 servings! If you want to be fancy – you can add some ground cinnamon or vanilla powder to your mix. You can also add a drop of vanilla extract or peppermint extract to your hot cocoa when making a cup. I sometimes like to top my homemade hot cocoa with natural marshmallows – and never Kraft Jet Puffed or other conventional marshmallows that contain artificial blue dye – bleh! SmashMallows are the brand I currently buy because I haven’t found an organic brand or another dye-free brand without carrageenan (Dandies uses carrageenan). I’m hoping SmashMallows go organic one day! I hope your family loves this hot cocoa as much as we do! Please share this recipe with anyone in your life who’s still drinking hot cocoa filled with questionable ingredients. They will (hopefully) thank you for it!"
https://foodbabe.com/homemade-taco-seasoning-recipe-replace-packets-full-of-processed-ingredients/,Homemade Taco Seasoning Recipe (Replace Packets Full Of Processed Ingredients!),0,"When I first started my clean eating journey many years ago, one of the best things I ever did was clean out my pantry. I took out everything and carefully read the ingredients on each product. If I didn’t know what an ingredient was or how it could affect my body, I got rid of it… and never looked back! This helped me learn so much about the processed products that I was buying all the time that I thought I couldn’t live without… like those little packets of Old El Paso Taco Seasoning which are filled with questionable ingredients. Who knew that it’s actually cheaper (and super easy) to mix up my own taco seasoning at home with just a handful of spices that are easy to keep on hand? Plus, homemade tacos taste wayyy better when they aren’t corrupted with all those nasty ingredients found in packets like de-caking agents, refined oils, and flavor enhancers designed in a lab… Ortega slaps a big “No MSG Added” label on the front of their taco seasoning, but if you check the ingredient list you’ll find that it contains “Yeast Extract”. This ingredient contains free glutamic acid – the main component of MSG. Food companies don’t want to get a bad rap by putting monosodium glutamate (MSG) on their ingredient list, so they use ingredients like Yeast Extract to secretly add this potent flavor enhancer to your food right under our noses. What a sneaky trick! Ortega doesn’t tell you what “spices” they use besides paprika and garlic powder, so you’ve got to wonder how much of their seasoning is just synthetically flavored to taste like tacos without using actual spices (which are nutrient-dense real food). It’s more expensive for food companies to use real spices than it is to use “natural flavor” and flavor enhancers which mimic the taste of real food. It’s no wonder they take the cheapest option. Kraft is one food brand notorious for using cheap additives to save on their bottom line, at the expense of our health. That’s why it’s no surprise that their taco seasoning is spiked with Yeast Extract (hidden MSG) and Malic Acid (an artificial flavor enhancer and preservative created in lab from petrochemicals like butane). I make homemade taco seasoning with 6 basic spices that I keep stocked in my pantry + sea salt and pepper. When you compare the ingredients in my homemade taco seasoning side-by-side with the ingredients in those processed packets, you really see the difference! Virtually all conventional spices sold in the U.S. are fumigated [sterilized] with hazardous chemicals that are banned in Europe and irradiated to kill bacteria. These practices leave a finished product with decreased levels of vitamins and natural enzymes. Irradiation changes the chemical composition of a spice, potentially creating toxic, carcinogenic by-products in the food and increasing our exposure to free radicals. Free radicals cause aging and disease – something we want to avoid at all costs! Organic spices are not irradiated and cannot have genetically engineered ingredients (GMOs), artificial colors, preservatives, and other synthetic anti-caking agents. Some of my favorite spice companies include – Simply Organic, Frontier, and various store-brands that are organic. It can be a little expensive at first if you are stocking your organic spice rack from scratch, but once you’ve get all the essentials, it’s incredibly inexpensive to make your own taco seasoning and other spice mixes. One of my tricks for saving money on organic spices is to buy them from the bulk bins at health food stores and natural food stores. You can buy just the amount you need or refill your own jars at home at a fraction of the cost. You can easily double or triple the recipe if you’d like to make a bigger batch of tacos, or save it in a glass jar for later. To make tacos, simply use 3 tablespoons of seasoning mix per 1 pound of meat. I’ve used this with both ground turkey and chicken and it is fabulous! Please share this recipe to save your loved ones from taco seasoning packets full of questionable ingredients. It’s worth the few extra minutes it takes to stir together yourself. Don’t you agree?"
https://foodbabe.com/homemade-waffle-fries-chick-fil-a-copycat-recipe-only-3-ingredients/,Homemade Waffle Fries – Chick-fil-A Copycat Recipe (Only 3 Ingredients!),0,"If you know me, you know I love french fries. They are one of my favorite foods besides cake. That’s why I am SO EXCITED about this new copycat recipe for “Chick-fil-A” Waffle Fries! There’s just something extra special about waffle fries. I don’t know if it’s the shape or what exactly makes them so delicious, but it certainly isn’t the Dimethylpolysiloxane, chemical preservatives, or unhealthy oils that Chick-fil-A uses to make theirs. Back in the day, I used to eat Chick-fil-A several times a week for lunch…and I can STILL remember how their waffle fries taste and it makes my mouth water. Now, I wouldn’t consider eating them because of all the shady ingredients they use. But I’m not depriving myself! I firmly believe that if you love to eat something, you can figure out how to make it at home with healthy ingredients. That way you can have your cake (or waffle fries!) and eat it too! You only need 3 basic ingredients to make waffle fries that are just as delicious as Chick-fil-A’s Waffle Fries (and thankfully, you won’t need to call up a chemical company to send you some “Disodium Dihydrogen Pyrophosphate”). All it takes are some organic potatoes, coconut oil and sea salt. If you don’t have coconut oil, olive oil or avocado oil work wonderfully in this recipe too. To cut your potatoes into that amazing waffle shape, you’ll need a good mandoline that has a thick setting and a waffle blade. This is the mandoline I used to make these waffle fries, and I highly recommend using this one because it allows you to cut your waffle fries thick enough (some mandolines don’t cut thick enough). You’ll want to put it on its thickest setting, otherwise you’ll end up with chips. To cut the potatoes into waffle fries, you’ll use your mandoline to make one slice down the potato. Then you turn the potato one quarter turn and make another slice. Voila! You’ll end up with little waffle slices like this… The next step is very important to get the crispiest fries in the oven. You’ll want to put your potato slices in a bowl, cover them with cold water, and let them soak for 30 minutes. This will wash off some of the extra starch and create a fluffier, crispier waffle fry. After your potatoes are done with their bath, you’ll pat them dry, toss them with oil and salt, and place them on a parchment lined baking sheet. If you want to jazz them up, you can season them with smoked paprika, garlic powder and a bit of fresh cracked black pepper when you are tossing them with the oil. Lay them out in a single layer like this… Pop them in a 425 degree oven for roughly 25-30 minutes (checking after 20 and turning if they are getting too brown). Once they are cooked through, you can stick them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp them up if needed. Next thing you know, you’ll be munching on these delicious waffle fries that are better (and much healthier) than Chick-fil-A! PRO TIP: Tossing cooked waffle fries with a bit of fresh rosemary adds a ton of flavor! I like to dip my waffle fries in ketchup that has no sugar added – like Primal Kitchen brand. Steer clear of Heinz and Hunts Ketchup because those are both made with GMO High Fructose Corn Syrup – bleh! Here’s the printable recipe – you’ll want to keep this one handy for when the craving strikes! Know anyone who loves the waffle fries at Chick-fil-A? Make sure you share this copycat recipe with them… or bake them a batch. I’m sure they’ll be thankful!"
https://foodbabe.com/the-birth-story-of-my-son/,The Birth Story of my Son,0,"This is my birth story for my son Finley who was born on January 1st, 2021. You’ll never believe it, but if you were to look at the stats on paper, my son’s birth was exactly the same as Harley’s birth. It was a Friday in January. I went to the hospital at the same time. I had the same doula. I had the same doctor. I had the same room. I had the same birthing tub. I started pushing at the same time. I had Finley earlier than Harley, because I knew what I was doing this time. I had him at 9:25pm and she was born at 10:11pm, which is about 40 minutes later because I didn’t know how to push with Harley. When she was born, I was like, that’s it?! And was just so relieved that it was over as I was so tired. With Finley, I really felt him coming out. He was a whole pound and a half bigger, so that was the biggest difference. So many things were similar, but there were so many things that were different too. Ever since Harley turned three, I started feeling like I really wanted for her to have a sibling. A friend once told me it’s the best gift ever for them and she was right, this whole year has been absolutely magical watching their relationship grow. Shortly after I started to family plan with my husband. I went to the doctor again for the first time in three years and everything looked really great. I was a little bit worried about getting pregnant because I was still breastfeeding Harley and my doctor told me not to worry and also said not to worry about weaning because it would happen naturally. And that there is no time like the present, don’t worry about planning this next child, it will happen when it happens. She literally took all of my worries away and said – just do it! (And everything she said was right – Harley weaned naturally on her own without any intervention about 6 months into the pregnancy). In the beginning of 2020 we started trying for a baby and BOOM in March I became pregnant. This was during the height of the chaos in the world and it was such a joy to be able to have a baby and have something to look forward to while all this madness was going on. This pregnancy was much different than the first. I was not in as good of shape as I was the first time in terms of athletically and physically fit, but I still was working out as much as I could considering that most of the gyms and fitness studios were closed. I was desperately trying to get back into a really good routine when I got pregnant, but then didn’t really get back into it as it was really hard to be motivated. I pushed myself to move everyday as I knew that giving birth is an athletic sport. I spent most of 2020 pregnant and the first few months I was very nauseous (about the same as my first pregnancy). I was really tired as well, and I didn’t have time to take naps because I had a toddler running around. The crazy thing was that I didn’t have heartburn like I did with my daughter. So that was really a pleasant surprise. But I felt generally uncomfortable and just achy and tired for most of my pregnancy. Of course, there was a second trimester where I had more energy, and generally speaking it was an okay pregnancy. I gained the same amount of weight that I gained with Harley as with this baby (approximately 35 pounds). Again another similarity! One time, I thought my amniotic fluid was leaking. Hearing the nurse say I needed to go to the hospital straight away to have my baby at 34 weeks was so scary, but that wasn’t the case thankfully. I was in the middle of a book launch (for Food Babe Kitchen) when this was happening. I know this is probably too much information, but I would sit so long at my desk conducting video interviews for the new book that I didn’t get up to use the restroom often, but when I did get up, I would just leak a little. I had no idea if it was pee or amniotic fluid and just to be safe, I got checked. Thank goodness it was not my water breaking and it was just pee! And then… I reminded myself, babies come when they want to come, and that happened to be on Jan 1st, one day after his due date. Leading up to that day was a very difficult time. Yelena, a dear close friend died in a surfing accident on Christmas. She was one of the most beautiful souls in the whole world, incredibly supportive of my mission here at Food Babe, we traveled together and she was an amazing friend who raised the most incredible family. Her daughters love to cook organically and garden, and she was just a truly beautiful mother. Losing her and finding out about that a week before I gave birth was very difficult. When I found out, I immediately went into contractions and continued contracting every single day until he was born. On December 31st, I was for sure thinking he was going to come, but my friend’s funeral was on the 1st and I feel like he knew that I needed to say goodbye to her before he came. Along the way throughout the week, she sent me so many different signs that she was okay, including showing up on one of the Mama Natural Natural Pregnancy Affirmation birthing cards I was reading to myself each day. The birthing card said, “riding each contraction like a wave” with this beautiful girl on a surfboard with long hair just like my friend coaching me through another natural childbirth. On the 1st, I got to say goodbye to my friend. I watched the entire Zoom funeral (because of Covid) on my iPad while I was in the bath contracting. Soon thereafter I got out of the tub, a complete mess of course, and went out into the living room to have lunch. My contractions stopped. And then all of the sudden they started back up at 3pm every 3 minutes. This is when my doula came over. These contractions were basically pretty painful. I had stopped what I was doing and really braced myself on a wall and breathed through them. I had to do what I needed to do and my daughter was watching this and was looking at me going, “Mommy, you look funny”. I started to laugh and said this is what your body does when it’s ready to have a baby, you have to push the baby out and so your body contracts to move the baby down the birth canal. Harley loved meeting the doula and being part of the day with me, during early labor at home. Around 5pm is when I felt like there could be some kind of water coming out of me and we were worried that my water was breaking and if it had broken then it was time to have the baby. So, my husband got the car packed, we hopped in and headed to the hospital. Given the fact that I was 41 at the time, I was nervous about having a home birth, and my husband was even more nervous and just wanted to make sure we had the least risky situation for me and this baby. So we decided to have a hospital birth. Even though I had really considered a home birth because I wanted to stay out of the hospital system during this very interesting time, but we went to the hospital and it was wonderful. I refused every intervention that I could. I was very gracious about it and polite about my wishes. The nurses and doctors were very supportive of my decisions. Because so many things were similar as my first birth, I really got to focus on the other details around me. I got to focus on the lighting and how I didn’t like certain lights in the room. And what time it was. And having fun and joking with my doctor and doula in between contractions. Of course that was before I went into transition, where I went from 7 to 10 cm, the hardest part of labor. Then I got a little bit cranky. But I was so calm and so fearless and just had no anxiety about anything really. My doctor had put me in such good spirits, knowing that there were no major Covid restrictions that I had to follow. I did not wear a mask during childbirth. I can’t imagine trying to wear one during childbirth. I was free to be me and have this baby. When things got really really tough, I said to myself, I will never judge a woman for getting an epidural or anything, because wow, this is intense. My friend was there coaching me from above and was looking down on me and saying, “Vani you can do this”. Knowing the sacrifices her family has had to make with her being gone, I knew I could get through it. If her family could get through what they just did at her funeral, I could do this. She got me through every tough contraction. Yelena – thank you for helping me birth Finley – I love you. When I saw my doctor start to put on different protective clothing, I asked my doula why. She said – your baby is almost here, I was elated labor was about to be over. It felt so surreal and so fast this time compared to the last time. This time I could just look at the clock and know, okay I think my body will progress this fast for this long, and would ask the doctor for predictions and for everyone to kind of bet on what was going on. It was so fun and beautiful. Very similar to Harley, I had high blood pressure again after childbirth, which was annoying, but I was able to get it under control very quickly after getting home, acupuncture treatments and getting back into my regular routine. Recovering from this birth was much harder. I felt like my body had broken into two during labor when I was pushing. I didn’t tear or have complications with the birth, but my body needed rest. I have a hard time asking for help and rest, I am a go go go person and I did not listen to my body. I should have rested more. Also I didn’t have a toddler running around the first time, and this made resting even harder. Right after birth, I had these really intense contractions almost like I was going into labor again two days after having my child, which were very painful. I would just take a hot bath with epsom salt and everything would get better. I was only in the hospital for 18 hours after I gave birth – I pleated to go home as fast as possible. The little guy decided to sleep almost 8 hours straight after he was born, while me and my husband just stared at him and stayed up all night in awe and got zero sleep. I really wanted to get back to my daughter, as she wasn’t allowed in the hospital. Having her meet her baby brother was the most beautiful thing in the whole world. She told him “I want you to be my baby brother forever, I love you so much ” when she met him. It was the most life changing thing I have ever seen and you could see the instant love in her eyes. I’d love to hear your thoughts, questions, comments and or birth stories below. Xo, Vani P.S. In case you missed it, you can read my daughter Harley’s birth story here."
https://foodbabe.com/homemade-starbucks-peppermint-mocha-recipe-with-real-food-ingredients-and-no-refined-sugar/,Homemade Starbucks Peppermint Mocha Recipe With Real Food Ingredients (And No Refined Sugar!),0,"I recently shared a recipe for my homemade version of a Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte, and many of you were asking for a recipe to replace their Peppermint Mocha. So, here it is…my real food recipe for a peppermint mocha without any of the crazy ingredients like potassium sorbate and carrageenan (both linked to cancer) that Starbucks uses: Even if you only order a “Tall” Starbucks Peppermint Mocha, you’ll be ingesting 42 grams of sugar. A “Grande” size has an astonishing 54 grams of sugar. Much of this sugar is coming from white sugar added to Starbucks Mocha Sauce and Peppermint Syrup. White sugar is one of the worst ingredients to eat in excess. Most experts recommend the average person eat no more than 25 grams (women) or 38 grams (men) of added sugar PER DAY. So, just one of these little puppies will put you wayyy over that. All the excessive sugar in our diets is one of the biggest health destroyers…increasing the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, liver disease, and cancer – but its detrimental effects can take years to surface. It’s the hidden link to so much pain and suffering – AND it makes you feel and look awful!!! My peppermint mocha recipe is sweetened with only one tablespoon of maple syrup and is just as satisfyingly delicious as the original. Maple syrup is an unrefined natural sweetener that has its nutrients intact, unlike refined sugar that is stripped of nutrition and has an acidic affect on the body. Most brands like Reddi-Wip aren’t organic and contain corn syrup and carrageenan. This is why I like to make whipped cream with canned coconut milk that contains just one ingredient: organic coconut milk. And then blending it with unrefined coconut sugar and vanilla extract. Let’s navigate our over-processed food world together."
https://foodbabe.com/homemade-chick-fil-a-peppermint-chip-milkshake-recipe-without-artificial-ingredients/,Homemade Chick-fil-A Peppermint Chip Milkshake Recipe Without Artificial Ingredients!,0,"When I saw the ingredient list for Chick-fil-A’s famous holiday drink, the Peppermint Chip Milkshake, I could not believe my eyes. There are so many artificial ingredients in there and the list is a mile long. It’s insanity! Of course I can’t keep this information to myself, so check it out for yourself: That is crazy… This is equivalent to pouring 23 packets of sugar into your coffee… Or eating 9 Krispy Kreme glazed donuts… Or eating a dozen fun-size Snickers. Yikes. It’s a lot easier to consume that much sugar when you are drinking it – and before you know it you will be on a sugar-high, crash and burn, like no other! Refined Sugar is toxic. Plain and simple. It wreaks havoc on our bodies. Makes us age faster than we should. Destroys our skin. Makes it easy to carry a spare tire around our bellies and taxes our organs. And, it is very addicting. ❌ CARRAGEENAN: A thickener and emulsifier linked to digestive issues and cancer. ❌ CELLULOSE GUM: This thickener is usually made from wood, because it’s cheap. Research links consumption of this additive (not naturally occurring in whole food) to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. ❌ SODIUM PHOSPHATE: Preservative can lead to excessive levels of phosphate in the blood and puts you at risk of chronic kidney disease, increased mortality, heart disease, and accelerated aging. ❌ POTASSIUM SORBATE: This preservative has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer. ❌ RED 40: Artificial color derived from petroleum, linked to several health issues, including allergies and hyperactivity in children, which require a warning label in Europe. May also be contaminated with carcinogens, such as benzidine. It baffles me how food companies and restaurants fill their food with the WORST possible ingredients in the name of the holidays! The holidays shouldn’t be an excuse to poison the public. Thankfully, you can still enjoy delicious festive goodies without junky ingredients. If you want your shake to be pink, you can add a bit of natural food coloring or organic Hibiscus Powder. This will give it a more authentic “Chick-Fil-A” look without the artificial colors! You can easily make this milkshake vegan and dairy-free by using coconut ice cream, coconut milk and dairy-free chocolate. See how easy that is? Who knows…maybe someday restaurants like Chick-fil-A will start creating holiday treats that are actually made with real food! Until then – If you know someone who loves Chick-fil-A’s Peppermint Chip Milkshake, please share this recipe with them and spread the word that there’s now an easy way to make it at home without artificial ingredients."

https://foodbabe.com/homemade-stove-top-stuffing-recipe-and-why-you-shouldnt-buy-krafts-version/,Homemade Stove Top Stuffing Recipe (And Why You Shouldn’t Buy Kraft’s Version),0,"Back in the day, when Thanksgiving rolled around I’d pick up these products at the last minute… Stove Top stuffing, boxed potatoes, and canned cranberry sauce. Can you relate? I’ve since learned that although the holidays are a busy time, it’s well worth my time to make dishes from scratch with simple recipes that allow me to control the ingredients that I’m putting into my own body and also feeding my family. I don’t have endless hours available to cook in the kitchen–and I’m sure you don’t either–so that’s why I created this knockoff version of easy Stove Top stuffing. It’s simple enough for anyone to make and frees up your oven for other dishes like the turkey and sweet potatoes! Before I show you how to make stuffing on your stove top, let me show you exactly why I never buy Kraft’s version anymore: HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP: This heavily processed sweetener made from GMO cornstarch that contains more fructose than regular corn syrup. Studies have shown it increases appetite and the risk of weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia. (1) HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN: Used as a replacement for MSG. This ingredient is an excitotoxin that overstimulates the neuron receptors in your brain and excites your tastebuds. It can greatly influence how much you eat…encouraging you to eat food that’s unhealthy for you, which ultimately will affect your waistline and health. (2) NATURAL FLAVOR: Similar to MSG, this ingredient is created in a laboratory from dozens of substances that are designed to make processed food taste irresistible. (3) INTERESTERIFIED SOYBEAN OIL: A heavily processed form of soybean oil that’s engineered to replace partially hydrogenated oil. The FDA banned partially hydrogenated oils since they are full of trans fat that is bad for the heart, but some research indicates that interesterified oils can be just as bad. (4) This unhealthy oil has been shown to promote weight gain, impair glucose tolerance and increase liver cellular stress markers in the body. (5) BHT: Risky preservative linked to cancer. It’s easily replaceable with safer preservatives and not permitted for use in many other countries. (6) BHA: Another risky preservative linked to cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies BHA as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” (7) Thankfully, you can make delicious stuffing on the stove top with real food! My “Stove Top” stuffing recipe is made with basic ingredients that you can find in any grocery store–bread, butter, broth, and spices. You can make this stuffing recipe with conventional bread, factory-farmed butter, and boxed chicken broth full of sugar and flavors… but then it won’t be much better than the boxed Kraft version. Let’s talk about how to choose the main ingredients… The main ingredient in stuffing is the bread, so you’ve got to choose this carefully. Most commercially baked breads come with a crazy ingredient list full of dough conditioners, preservatives, and sugar. Assuming you don’t want to bake your own bread, your best bet is to choose an organic loaf of crusty french bread from a natural foods bakery. The ingredient list should be simple and free from unhealthy oils (canola, soybean), sugar, and dough conditioners like DATEM. Ideally, look for a bread made with organic whole wheat or organic sprouted grains instead of a bread made with “Bleached Wheat Flour” or “Enriched Wheat”. If using an organic sourdough bread, make sure it’s on the mild side so it doesn’t overpower the stuffing. Feel free to mix sourdough bread and whole wheat or sprouted grain to give the stuffing more texture and improve the nutrition. Have fun with the bread combinations! You can easily make this stuffing recipe gluten-free by choosing your favorite crusty gluten-free bread and proceeding with the recipe as written. Again, don’t forget to check the ingredient list for crazy additives! Conventional butter is raised on GMO feed in a factory farm. Whatever the cows are eating… pesticides, antibiotics, etc, can end up in their milk too. That’s why I like to choose grass-fed and organic butter whenever I have the choice. Some good brands include Organic Valley, Vital Farms, and Kerrygold. You can use organic turkey or chicken broth to make this recipe. However – many containers of pre-made broth contain added flavors, hidden MSG flavor enhancers (such as yeast extract) and added sugar – even some organic versions! So make sure to read the ingredients carefully on your broth, or make your own. Here are some good brands: The most economical option is to make your own chicken broth, which is actually super inexpensive and easy to do. I explain how to make your own chicken or vegetable broth here. (You could do this with turkey too!) First you’ll cut your bread into cubes. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees while you carefully cut the bread and spread it out onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake the cubed bread for 10 to 15 minutes until it’s lightly toasted. This step can be done in advance and stored in an airtight container until needed. The drier the bread the better! Grab a large pot (big enough to fit all the bread cubes later) and melt 4 tablespoons of grass-fed butter over medium high heat. Add your chopped onion, celery, and garlic and cook it all together for about 5 minutes to soften. Stir in your spices and fresh parsley. Carefully add your toasted bread to the pot and give it all a good stir to combine. Slowly pour two cups of turkey or chicken broth over the bread crumbs and stir once again. Put a lid on the pot and remove it from the heat. Allow the stuffing to sit with the lid on for about 8 to 10 minutes until the bread cubes have softened. If you find the stuffing is too crunchy for your liking, simply add more hot broth in ¼ cup increments until you reach your desired consistency. If you want the stuffing to have a crunchy top, place in a baking dish and pop it in the oven set to broil. Broil until desired crispiness, but keep a close eye on it so it doesn’t burn. Simply mix in 2 eggs after you have stirred in the broth and place the stuffing in a baking dish. Bake at 350 for 30 to 35 minutes. Feel free to prep the baked stuffing version the day before. Keep it covered in the refrigerator and bake the next day. If you make it ahead of time, simply store the prepared stuffing in an airtight container in the refrigerator. To reheat, place in a baking dish in the oven at 350 degrees and bake for 25 to 20 minutes. The stuffing will be nice and warm and have a delicious crispy top. Making stove top stuffing from scratch may seem like more work at first, but small changes like this will have a dramatic effect on your health over time. It’s worth the effort… I promise! Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family."
https://foodbabe.com/homemade-pumpkin-spice-latte-better-than-starbucks/,Homemade Pumpkin Spice Latte (Better Than Starbucks!),0,"Let me show you how easy it is to make a Pumpkin Spice Latte at home that’s better than Starbucks… REALLY! First, you’ll need to grab the Potassium Sorbate and Carrageenan out of your pantry to make the flavoring… Ha ha, just kidding! Of course, you’d never use those ingredients in your coffee. But Starbucks does. When I first exposed the secret ingredients in the original Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte a few years back there was a media firestorm. Within days, my blog post made headlines from USA Today to Fox News. My phone was ringing off the hook while my post went viral on social media with more than a million shares. (1) I was so happy that Starbucks FINALLY had to own up to the ingredients they were using at the time. Specifically the Class IV Caramel Color, which is linked to cancer. All of the media attention really helped get the ball rolling in getting Starbucks to change. Next thing you know, they dropped the Caramel Color altogether. Then, Starbucks published the ingredients in their drinks on their website for the first time in history. This was HUGE. Now everyone can see exactly what they are drinking at Starbucks. (2) Potassium Sorbate: You’ll find this preservative in many of Starbucks drinks, including the PSL. This ingredient has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer. (3) Carrageenan: This ingredient in Starbucks whipped cream is a thickener linked to digestive issues and cancer. (4) Natural Flavors: It’s not just pumpkin spices that make the PSL taste delicious. Starbucks adds Natural Flavors, which is actually a top secret formulation that contains preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other additives (which could be: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol – none of which are labeled or disclosed). (5) Mono and Diglycerides: This emulsifier is a byproduct of oil processing – including canola and soybean oils – which may contain trans fat that is detrimental to heart health. (6) They do not serve organic coffee at most Starbucks locations, which means (like all conventional coffee) it’s been sprayed with pesticides. Increased exposure to pesticides are linked to birth defects, nerve damage and cancer. Starbucks also does not use organic milk. Their dairy comes from cows raised on GMO feed which is treated with synthetic pesticides. Whatever dairy cows eat can end up in their milk. And despite what you may have heard…illegal antibiotics, growth hormones, and pesticide residues are commonly found in non-organic milk, but NOT in organic milk. (7) Even though no one is testing Starbucks drinks for these substances, it’s made with non-organic milk, so it is a possibility. We all know Starbucks coffee ain’t cheap, but most people don’t know that regular consumption of their products can be a serious source of pesticide exposure and ingredients that sabotage your health. I like to use all organic ingredients, which is actually cheaper than Starbucks in the long run after you invest in these ingredients to make dozens of organic Pumpkin Spice Lattes at home! To make the Pumpkin Spice Latte at home, all you do is add milk, pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, and maple syrup to a small saucepan. After it heats up, pour it into your cup of coffee. That’s it! You can make a big batch of the latte and store it in your fridge for 3-4 days, that way it will be ready when you’re in a hurry. Simply heat it back up… or pour it over ice. Just make sure yours isn’t made with Carrageenan and Mono and Diglycerides like Starbucks! Since most brands of whipped cream aren’t organic and contain gums and other additives, I like to make whipped cream with canned coconut milk. Know anyone who would love to make a Pumpkin Spice Latte at home that is better than Starbucks? Please share this recipe with them, or perhaps bring them a cup. Now you can enjoy this delicious fall drink without the controversial ingredients that Starbucks uses! Isn’t it awesome when you take matters into your own hands? It’s small changes like this that can dramatically change your health and your life."
https://foodbabe.com/homemade-goldfish-crackers-with-organic-ingredients/,Homemade Goldfish Crackers With Organic Ingredients,0,"This recipe is a long time coming and something that countless parents have asked me for. Homemade Goldfish Crackers! Before I show you how to make these fun cheese crackers, let me tell you why I developed this recipe… Almost every child in America eats Goldfish Crackers. Parents love them because they are easy, not too expensive, and seem healthier than other snacks like Cheetos. They are served in schools and daycares across the country. But are they really a good snack for kids? To really examine this question, you need to know what Goldfish Crackers are made of. Let’s take a hard look at the ingredients used to make Pepperidge Farm’s Goldfish… Goldfish Crackers Ingredients: Enriched Wheat Flour (Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Cheddar Cheese ([Cultured Milk, Salt, Enzymes], Annatto), Vegetable Oils (Canola, Sunflower And/Or Soybean), Salt, Contains 2% Or Less Of: Yeast, Sugar, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Paprika, Spices, Celery, Onion Powder, Monocalcium Phosphate, Baking Soda. I personally don’t want my children eating Goldfish full flavor enhancers designed to hijack their taste buds. We need to stop the habit of brainless munching on low quality foods that has led millions of Americans with diseases like obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Even worse, they might be tainted with Roundup weed killer: In 2016, an independent food safety laboratory tested popular American food products for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (Roundup). They specifically found this weed killer in Goldfish Crackers. In three samples of Goldfish tested, they detected 18.40 ppb glyphosate in Goldfish Crackers Original, 8.02 ppb in Goldfish Crackers Colors, and 24.58 ppb in Goldfish Crackers Whole Grain (1). While these amounts are not as high as other products tested, I don’t personally feel safe feeding my child a food known to be contaminated with Roundup, a chemical strongly linked to cancer. Plus – when you buy Goldfish crackers, you are supporting the industrial BIG FOOD complex of crap food. Let’s stop supporting brands like Pepperidge Farm who are creating unhealthy products for our kids. Thankfully, I’m happy to report that you don’t need to give up Goldfish Crackers. I’ve figured out how to make crispy cheesy goldfish shaped crackers at home – with real food ingredients. The main ingredient in these crackers is flour. I chose to use organic spelt flour, which is an ancient whole grain form of wheat. I like to use spelt flour because it is easier to digest than regular whole wheat flour and contains a bit more protein. If you want to make these gluten-free, you can substitute oat flour for the spelt flour. You can make oat flour by simply grinding organic rolled oats in a blender, or you can also buy a bag of organic oat flour at most grocery stores. The other ingredients I used were also organic, especially the cheese and butter. It’s very important to buy organic animal products to avoid consuming potential residues of antibiotics, synthetic hormones, and other drugs often given to animals on factory farms. When it comes to dairy products – choose organic and grass-fed whenever possible. Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees. You’ll bake these on a baking sheet, so you can line that now with some unbleached parchment and set it aside. If you don’t have a food processor, simply place all of the ingredients in a bowl and use a pastry cutter to mix everything together until it resembles a fine meal. However, this process is much easier with a food processor. If using a food processor, add all the ingredients except the butter and pulse until a fine meal has formed. Add the butter and pulse until well combined. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons of cold water and mix until the dough forms a ball. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Roll out the dough on a floured surface until roughly ⅛” thick. Use a 1” goldfish cookie cutter to cut shapes out of the dough. I used a plastic cookie cutter because that is the only fish-shaped cutter I could find that had several fish in one row, which makes the job of cutting up the goldfish much more efficient. It also is small and gives the most genuine “Goldfish” look. Another option would be a stainless steel cutter, such as these animal shaped cookie cutters that are small (about 1″). You could certainly use any animal shape you want for more variety and fun. Place the shapes on a parchment lined baking sheet like this… And bake for 15 to 18 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool before removing from the cookie sheet. Please share this Goldfish Crackers recipe + snack alternatives with all the parents, teachers, and daycare workers you know. Let’s get everyone on board with healthier snacks for our children!"
https://foodbabe.com/homemade-organic-caramel-apples-without-corn-syrup/,Homemade Organic Caramel Apples Without Corn Syrup,0,"When I was a child I remember how fun it was to sink my teeth into a sticky caramel apple. It’s one of my favorite fall treats but I always hold off on buying the caramel apples from the market because I know they are made with corn syrup and some other very processed ingredients. This year we’re throwing a Halloween party for the kids and I thought… What could be better than serving mini organic caramel apples? It would be such a cute treat for the older kids. But I knew I needed to figure out how to make them at home without corn syrup and other nasties, and that’s when this recipe was born! Corn syrup is a heavily processed and refined form of sugar that’s usually made from GMO corn, and that’s why you won’t find this in my pantry. Some other “easy’ recipes for Caramel Apples call for using packaged caramels like Werther’s Original – which I wouldn’t want to use either because they are made with glucose syrup (another heavily processed sugar syrup) along with artificial flavors and soy lecithin. Instead of going down that road, my recipe calls for basic ingredients that you probably have in your pantry already: butter, cane sugar, vanilla extract, heavy cream, and sea salt. And of course… apples! I like to use the green variety, since they are more tart and offset the sweetness of the caramel. I like to use organic coconut sugar as a replacement for white sugar when cooking at home, but when I tested these caramel apples with coconut palm sugar, the result turned out very dark and just not as appealing in color. You can certainly use coconut sugar instead of cane sugar in this recipe if you’d like. Coconut sugar is completely unrefined and its vitamins and minerals are intact – making it healthier and less processed. You can also swirl the apples in fun toppings like chopped nuts, coconut flakes, or chopped chocolate. Look how gorgeous these caramel apples are! I hope you get the chance to make these fun caramel apples this fall and love them as much as we do. And if you know anyone who loves caramel apples…but not the nasty ingredients…please share this recipe with them. Happy Halloween!"
https://foodbabe.com/the-only-bar-is-here-a-truvani-snack-bar-with-real-organic-ingredients-and-amazing-taste-too-finally/,"The Only Bar is here. A Truvani snack bar with real organic ingredients (and amazing taste, too). Finally!",0,"Ever since we launched our small company, Truvani, I have wanted to make a snack bar that I would be happy to eat. You see, I’ve always been the type of person to reward myself at the end of a long day with a little treat. It was a ritual. I’d grab my favorite cup of tea and a treat. Then, I’d sit on the couch and enjoy it. It was a little “me moment” that would help me unwind from the day. The problem? Sometimes I would eat a piece of chocolate. Other times it was another snack that would feel good in the moment…and horrible later on. I needed something better, and that’s why I set out to create something better. I wanted a snack bar. A snack bar that I could happily eat at the end of a long day and feel good about. I only had one question: “What Makes A Great Snack Bar?” I had 3 rules: Ever eat a snack bar that seemingly saps all of the wetness out of your mouth, as if you spent an eternity in a desert? Or worse, a bar that’s so sticky you feel like you need to wash your hands immediately after eating it? This is not okay in my book. You see, I believe you should love the way the bar tastes and feels. It shouldn’t leave you with any unpleasant side effects like dry mouth or sticky fingers. NOT OKAY! Feeling aside, a snack bar should taste great. Some other bar companies just get it so wrong. They’re either too hard, or too soft. Too sweet or not sweet at all. And in some cases, it feels like a chore to eat them. NOT OKAY! When I’m eating a snack bar, I want the ingredients to be found in my kitchen. I don’t want to see weird additives… or soy lecithin… or anything like that. I want ingredients I could readily recognize at the organic market. And stock in my home kitchen. This was the hard part. Manufacturers these days can’t help themselves. They want to add all sorts of junk into their food to make their lives easier… NOT OKAY. Wrong. If you look at some other bar companies, they get it SO WRONG. This is one of the reasons why I knew Truvani had to do it better… It took us 2 years to get it right and today is the day! Our first flavor is Chocolate Love and I know you’ll love it. What makes The Only Bar so special? Look at the ingredient label. We used 6 simple ingredients. Each of which are ingredients you can find in any normal kitchen. It’s a tasty combination of almonds, dates, maple syrup, cocoa, and cacao nibs. Plus, a dash of sea salt. Natural flavors? Highly-refined sugars? Soy lecithin? Or other cheap fillers? HECK NO! The Only Bar is made with amazing ingredients. It’s also USDA Certified and has non-GMO ingredients. The best part? Or maybe it’s the worst part… It tastes so good you’ll want another one. And no refined sugar. No artificial flavors. No sugar alcohols. No gums. And no brown rice syrup. That’s the real deal. This bar took more than 2 years of development. It wasn’t easy. Every time we wanted to create a bar, they would tell us: “you need this weird ingredient” for some random reason. After a year, we almost gave up. “Maybe it just isn’t possible…” You see, one of the main issues we had was “holding the bar together.” The available ingredient options were just… not up to the Truvani standard. Sometimes they weren’t organic. Other times they were highly refined sugar syrups. Then, one day, someone on our team recommended we try Maple Syrup. And it worked. The bar stayed together. It tasted great. We knew we had a winner on our hands…but, we got hit by a big surprise: You see, when you add Maple Syrup to your bar, it has to be listed as “added sugars” on the nutrition facts panel. This is a weird labeling requirement. Added sugar was meant to expose companies adding sugar to their product, outside of the sugar found naturally occurring in the ingredients. For some reason they decided to label Maple Syrup as an added sugar… even though Maple Syrup is found in nature… which has sugar in it naturally. We argued about this back and forth with the team. “Should we cancel the bar because of the “added sugars” labeling requirement?” Luckily we didn’t. We knew we made this bar with ingredients that you can find in your kitchen. We knew we were doing the right thing. We knew that our customers would understand… So, we moved forward with it. And it’s worth it. We may fight this weird label law at some point, but for now… we can just eat the bar with a smile on our face! The Only Bar by Truvani is made with 6 simple ingredients our customers love: almonds, dates, maple syrup, cocoa, cacao nibs, and a dash of sea salt. So, if you’re ready to enjoy a snack bar without having to worry about nasty ingredients…order Chocolate Love, the first flavor of The Only Bar today!"
https://foodbabe.com/why-i-avoid-these-9-controversial-ingredients-in-my-personal-care-products/,Why I avoid these 9 controversial ingredients in my personal care products,0,"According to The Guardian (1), the EU has banned (or restricted) 1,300 ingredients found in personal care products. Meanwhile…the US only has banned (or restricted) 11. How can one group find ingredients so dangerous that they feel compelled to regulate them, while another group lets these ingredients run rampant? IT’S UNBELIEVABLE! Over the last decade, I fought for Ingredient Transparency in our food and other daily products (like deodorant, cosmetics, etc). Even though we’ve made tremendous progress…the truth is that big companies just don’t change fast enough. I believe we deserve to live in a world where our products can be made without weird – and nasty – ingredients. Is that too much to ask? Apparently so. Because we are so far away it’s crazy. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I launched Truvani and we have one main goal: eliminate nasty ingredients from all daily-use products. We started with supplements. Now we are creating personal care products. If you want to learn about them, click here to learn more. I know you’ll like them. And when you see the ingredient labels, you’ll LOVE THEM. But first, let me tell you everything that’s wrong with personal care… These are the ingredients I avoid in personal care products…because of the controversy that surrounds them. Ever look at the ingredient label on a traditional deodorant or antiperspirant? So many companies use aluminum in antiperspirants. This is a problem. You see, an antiperspirant is an over-the-counter drug that chokes your sweat glands shut and prevents you from sweating. And they use an aluminum compound to do it. Why is this an issue? Well, our bodies sweat for a reason. Why would we prevent it from doing what it wants to do? Even though it’s deemed “generally safe,” the controversy around this in antiperspirants made me switch to organic deodorant… without aluminum. Carrageenan can be found in most milk substitute products, infant formula, deli meats, cottage cheese… and also in personal care products. In some cases, these products can even be certified by the USDA and found in organic products. …but the controversy around carrageenan is concerning. Some scientists say it’s a carcinogen. Other scientists say it’s safe. I don’t want to risk it, especially after reading the research published by the Cornucopia Institute. They show the timeline of events, lack of regulation, and down right shadiness that all led up to carrageenan’s approval in organic products. (2) Yikes. It’s so controversial and if you’re mad about it in almond milk… you should be mad about it in toothpaste, too. This is why I avoid it in my personal care products. Parabens is a widely used preservative in cosmetics – and some personal care items. It’s also sometimes used as an ingredient in manufactured “Fragrances.” On ingredient labels, they’ll often be listed as: Propylparaben, Isopropylparaben, Butylparaben, or Isobutylparaben. And I avoid them whenever possible. The controversy around them is too great. Some scientists claim they’re safe. Other scientists claim they’re dangerous. I claim “it’s not worth it.” When you see the word “Parfum” or “Fragrance” on an ingredient label, I would personally run for the hills. Here’s why: Parfums or Fragrances are often a complex mixture of different chemicals and ingredients… and companies are not required to disclose these ingredients. “Because the formulas are patented.” This is not okay. I believe we deserve to know what’s being included in our products and I avoid these every single time. (I believe the same for Natural Flavors, or flavoring. If companies can’t disclose what’s being used in their flavors…I avoid those products, too). Ever wonder why soaps and other personal care products “foam?” Some companies use Sodium Laureth Sulfates (SLES). Now, depending on how people make this ingredient, this can be contaminated with measurable amounts of ethylene oxide. Again. This is another controversial ingredient and I don’t want them in my personal care products. Yes, some cosmetics (and personal care) products use formaldehyde releasing preservatives. And I want nothing to do with it. The reason why there’s so much controversy around them is because the ingredients slowly (and continuously) release small amounts of formaldehyde. As someone who cares about ingredients that go in or on our bodies…I avoid these like the plague. DEA (diethanolamine) and DEA compounds are found in some cosmetic (and personal care) products. It’s often used to make cosmetics more creamy or foamy… It also can act as a pH adjustor. What types of products use them? Sometimes you’ll see them in moisturizers… or sunscreens… and others are found in soaps or shampoos. But I avoid these ingredients, too. If you google it, there’s controversy around whether or not it’s considered “safe.” The main thing that people talk about? Some people suggest it’s a skin and eye irritant. Petroleum based compounds are often used as thickeners or solvents or softeners or moisture-carriers in cosmetics (and other personal care products). The big problem? Depending on how people manufacture these compounds, PEGs may be contaminated with ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane. This is why I avoid PEGs. The controversy around it is too great. What are BHA & BHT? Well, they are the short-form form of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). These ingredients are found in some cosmetics (and other personal care products) because they are synthetic antioxidants. They are also used as preservatives in lipsticks, moisturizers, and even found in food products, too, as food preservatives. The European Union prohibits the use of BHA as a fragrance ingredient in cosmetics. In the USA, California requires a warning label on product containing BHA, notifying consumers that this ingredient may cause cancer. Given the controversy, we don’t want BHA & BHT in our products, either. You see, when I launched Truvani, I wanted to eliminate all nasty ingredients from daily-use products. Yes, we started with supplements. And now we’re moving into personal care. But the mission will continue way past that. We want great products. Without nasty ingredients. And we will continue making all the products that fit the bill. Our new personal care product line launches March 15th:"
https://foodbabe.com/quaker-oatmeal-ingredients-changed-because-of-you-food-babe-army-strikes-again/,Quaker Oatmeal Ingredients Changed Because Of You! Food Babe Army Strikes Again.,0,"If you feel like you don’t have the power to get food companies to drop nasty chemical ingredients from their food, I have news for you! Every time you share the truth about these products with your friends you are making a huge difference. Food companies are listening and they are changing. Here’s proof! A few years back I shared several graphics showing how companies like Kraft-Heinz, Kellogg’s, PepsiCo, and Quaker sell safer, better products overseas while making inferior versions with different ingredients to sell to Americans. You may have seen them. These graphics have gone viral and are still being shared all over the internet. (1) In the U.K. you’ll find… I know you’re as appalled as I am, because every time I write about this I get tens of thousands of shares and hundreds of emails asking how we can get these companies to stop selling us inferior products here in the U.S. I wrote about this (and specifically Quaker’s oatmeal) in my bestselling book Feeding You Lies, which has been read by thousands of people. And my U.S. vs. U.K. comparison graphics have been picked up by the media numerous times. (2) Now I’m happy to say that because of YOU sharing this information and voting with your dollars, companies are changing. Sometime in the last year, Quaker quietly changed the ingredients in their Strawberries & Cream Oatmeal here in America. And the change is DRAMATIC… Quaker Strawberries & Cream in America originally had NO strawberries at all. Instead they used “Flavored and Colored Fruit Pieces” composed of dehydrated apples, artificial strawberry flavor, citric acid, and the artificial dye Red 40. A total scam! (3) In the U.K. Quaker doesn’t even attempt to sell that garbage and doesn’t make any products like this. The closest counterpart they have is a product called “Oat So Simple” that has REAL strawberries in it—light years ahead of the popular U.S. version that has been on the market since I was a child. (4) Quaker now uses REAL STRAWBERRIES in their American version, and it’s now very similar to the U.K. version. (5) This is a huge deal! Not only are they using real food ingredients instead of conning consumers with fake strawberries, but they are no longer using artificial colors. Artificial colors are one of the absolute WORST ingredients in our food and should be banned. Especially since they are usually in products made for children. And, they removed the artificial colors and caramel color linked to cancer (7) from Dinosaur Eggs Instant Oatmeal for kids, and replaced these with natural colors made from radishes, spirulina, and turmeric. They aren’t the only one who has changed their ingredients… Since our graphics came out, there are a couple more big changes. We have petitioned Kellogg’s TWICE asking them to remove the preservative BHT from their cereals, as they don’t use this ingredient in other countries, it’s linked to cancer and it’s unnecessary. Our first petition in 2015 received over 53,000 signatures (8), and Kellogg’s removed BHT from popular cereals like Rice Krispies. Now it’s finally out of Frosted Flakes. But, they didn’t remove BHT from all of them. And they started inventing even worse cereals for children with artificial colors and BHT, like Baby Shark Cereal. That’s why we petitioned them again a couple years ago. We will not stop until they change. SIGN THE PETITION: Add your name here and demand that Kellogg’s stop making cereal for children with these controversial ingredients! Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO) is an ingredient BANNED in Europe, so Pepsico has sold Mountain Dew in other countries without it for years. In 2014, PepsiCo told the media they would remove BVO from all of their American drinks following a viral petition by activist Sarah Kavanagh, but they actually didn’t do it. (9) I’m happy to see that after years of public pressure, the BVO is gone!!! Continue sharing the ingredients in processed products with your friends and vote with your dollars by refusing to buy products from these companies until they do the right thing. We are making a real difference! The Food Babe Army is AMAZING. I love you all so much."
https://foodbabe.com/introducing-truvani-proteingreens-drink-your-greens-daily/,Introducing Truvani Protein+Greens: drink your greens daily!,0,"If you know me, you know I love Kale. And, I love green drinks. I drink a green juice or smoothie made with kale and other healthy vegetables nearly every single day…and have been for over a decade now. When I first started this habit in my corporate days, it took some getting used to. Even thinking about it now. I’m getting a little… let’s say, choked up 🤢 Back then, I made it a point to drag my coworkers down to the local juice bar. I wanted everyone on board with this whole greens thing. They’d watch as the shop attendant handed me a wheatgrass shot…and this deep sense of dread would shiver over my body. Wheatgrass is very powerful stuff and its potency takes getting used to. I have to psych myself up every time I take a shot…but by the end of it all, I’m all smiles. I knew drinking it would make me feel amazing. But the anticipation of that taste… Made me gag a little. Okay, a lot. “Bottom’s up!” I’d say to myself. Then with a plugged nose. I’d shoot it down. Trying to bypass my mouth so I didn’t taste the lawn clippings. How can something so good for you… TASTE SOOOO BAD?! And if you do. You might not munch on these lush veggies daily. So, if you struggle to get enough greens. Don’t feel bad. Because you’re not alone. Let’s be honest… Eating dark, healthy greens every day is hard. (Not everyone loves them.) And if you do love them, you have to: Easier said than done, right? We know skipping our veggies is out of the question. They provide our bodies with important nutrients vital to overall health. We decided to look into greens powders. When we started researching some other brands… do you know what we saw on the labels? You guessed it. Unnecessary fillers and additives. Like crystalized cellulose. And artificial sweeteners and stevia. No way 🙅‍♀️ We KNEW we could do better. It wasn’t easy. And it took us a long time from conception to finished product. But it’s finally here! We created a greens powder that has three of my favorite dark greens: Broccoli Kale Spinach And four amazing sprouts. Plus the satisfying plant-based vanilla protein Truvani fans love. (with a hint of banana for a subtle sweetness). Protein+Greens delivers 10g of plant-based protein with our favorite leafy greens and incredible sprouts. No cheap fillers. No unnecessary additives. Only the good stuff. It tastes amazing and blends easily with water or into my favorite morning smoothie. You can try it today! Save up to 25% when you subscribe for a limited time. That was no easy feat. Because we saw that some green drinks did things to mask the ‘green taste.’ Like using artificial sweeteners and “natural flavors.” Not happening. It took us a looooong time. But we figured it out. One of the best things about our powder is the TASTE. It’s got a subtle hint of all the right sweetness. From vanilla bean, banana, and monk fruit (not artificial sweeteners or stevia). You won’t find any overpowering grassy flavors like some other greens drinks. Which means it blends perfectly with your favorite liquid. And you can add it to a delicious smoothie or healthy treat recipe. To make a nutritious dessert. No matter how you make it. It tastes incredible. So incredible…you won’t believe you’re drinking greens. Don’t take my word for it. Watch the video testimonials here to see what the Truvani Team has to say about our new Protein+Greens and it’s amazing taste! We all know the undeniable benefits of eating vegetables. And greens drinks help you get more veggies into your day—the easy way. Plus, greens support alkalinity, daily energy, and healthy digestion. You can try shots of wheatgrass. A green smoothie. A glass of green juice. Or stock Truvani’s new Protein+Greens in your pantry. The easiest way of all! Now you can whip up a green drink in no time and have a painless cleanup. Don’t get me wrong. I still love juicing. But now I can get all the benefits of extra greens. Even when I’m short on time."
https://foodbabe.com/dont-let-internet-trolls-stop-you-from-sharing-the-truth-about-our-food/,Don’t let internet trolls stop you from sharing the truth about our food!,0,"I’m coming out bold in 2021. This isn’t the year to back down and I am going to be fearless in everything I share with you. I’m going to continue telling you the truth about your food, while also exposing those who are working to destroy our movement. And this year is already shaping up to be pivotal. Let me tell you a quick story… I recently had the amazing opportunity to hang out with Shaun T and be on his podcast, Trust and Believe. I’ve been doing his workout videos for 10 years and am a huge fan, so even though I was 9 months pregnant I jumped at the chance. We chatted about the campaigns that the Food Babe Army has done that inspired changes at billion-dollar food corporations. We also talked about how to be your own food detective and why the BIG FOOD industry is not looking out for our best interests. When our episode aired this week, Shaun posted a clip of my interview on his Instagram page (with currently 175k thousand views!), and TROLLS were directed by a paid spokesperson by the food chemical industry to go into comment section and go WILD! I was called “a danger” who was using “dangerous pseudoscience”. People accused Shaun T of “promoting anti-science propaganda” and “fear mongering” just for having me on his show. Witness it for yourself here: If you’ve read my 2nd book, Feeding You Lies, you know all about trolls and astroturfing–and how the food industry uses this tactic to discredit the good food movement. If this is news to you, here’s a recap because you NEED to know about this… Processed food and chemical corporations (the ones who make food additives and pesticides) hire people to leave comments online in an effort to appear as though they are part of a grassroots movement that stands firmly against a person or an issue. This is called “Astroturfing”. For example: The chemical company Monsanto had a program called “Let Nothing Go” which was designed to leave no critical comment about them unanswered. As noted in court documents, Monsanto “through a series of third parties, employs individuals who appear to have no connection to the industry, who in turn post positive comments on news articles and Facebook posts, defending Monsanto, its chemicals, and GMOs.” That’s textbook astroturfing! Knowing this has made me extremely wary of comment sections. When you see dozens or hundreds of comments that make similar statements, go on the attack, and all appear at once (like a mob), there’s a good chance you’re looking at an example of astroturfing. “These campaigns are designed to make it appear that an issue has widespread public support (or public opposition) even if it doesn’t. If a campaign sows enough doubt, excitement, or skepticism about a contentious issue or individual, it can shape the opinions of real people. And that’s the primary goal. We’re social animals, and the theory of groupthink suggests that perceived community support for a patently false “fact” is often all it takes to win over real supporters. Public ridicule and censure also works to cow, silence, or discredit critics who offer dissenting views. As a result, astroturf efforts can have a profound influence on how we understand and advocate for many critical health-related issues. This is why it’s so important to understand how it works”. – Turf Wars, Experience Life Magazine Astroturfing is used to create shame in sharing content online (so we will stop) and to create the illusion that there are negativity and ignorance around the good-food movement. They want to create confusion so you never know who to trust or what to believe. Use your common sense and don’t let anyone silence you. You also don’t need to be a food scientist or a doctor to learn about ingredients and take control of your food. That is the GIANT LIE that the processed food industry wants you to believe. (See the video clip that Shaun T posted on Instagram and feel free to leave a comment!) I’m so looking forward to the BIG things in store for 2021. We need to rise up. We need to stick together. We need to stand up for what we know is right."

https://foodbabe.com/how-cooking-saved-my-life/,How Cooking Saved My Life,0,"For most of my life I lived in what felt like a foreign body – the food and chemicals I was eating were not serving my health, my weight, or my beauty. I suffered a myriad of health issues that kept me on several prescription drugs just to cope – now I’m on zero. When I look back at that time, I feel immense sadness. I don’t want anyone to ever feel the way that I did. This is what motivates me to help people like you. You need to know that you don’t need to feel overweight, sick, and tired. I recently sat down with Dr. Mark Hyman, who I greatly admire and that I’m happy to call a friend. On his podcast, The Doctor’s Farmacy, we discussed how I gained back my health, the sorry state of the processed food industry, and my New York Times Best Selling cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen. I know this cookbook will inspire millions to get back in the kitchen, shop for the best ingredients and convince people once and for all that we must take back control of our health. It makes a great gift! Please consider buying a copy for your loved ones."
https://foodbabe.com/8-minute-organic-candy-bars-from-food-babe-kitchen/,8-Minute Organic Candy Bars from Food Babe Kitchen,0,"When you crave chocolate but don’t want to eat the stuff filled with artificial ingredients sold in stores, try my 8-Minute Candy Bars from the Food Babe Kitchen cookbook. They are fast, fun, easy to make, and portable. You can prepare 12 organic candy bars in just a few minutes. To show you how quick, watch me make them in record time on Fox 46 Charlotte: To make them, you’ll only need about 8 minutes and a bag of organic chocolate chips, brown rice cereal, almonds, vanilla extract, and sea salt. Like all of my recipes, the most important thing is the ingredients that you choose! Kellogg’s isn’t organic and they add “malt flavor” and a slew of synthetic vitamins to Rice Krispies. Plus – let’s not support a company like Kellogg’s who makes cereals for children filled with artificial colors, BHT, refined sugar, and all kinds of controversial ingredients. Vote with your dollars and support companies who are doing the right things. Good organic cereal brands to make these candy bars: They are made with only 3 organic ingredients and no white sugar, which is a zillion times better than most other brands. I like to use organic coconut sugar instead of white sugar when I’m baking treats. That’s because it is a perfect 1 to 1 substitute for any recipe that calls for regular old sugar. One of the big pluses of coconut palm sugar – it’s completely unrefined and not bleached like typical refined white sugar, helping to preserve all of its teeming vitamins and minerals. It is naturally high in amino acids, potassium, magnesium, and iron. You can’t say that about regular old white sugar! To make perfectly shaped candy bars, I set them in a non-toxic silicone mould that holds 8 candy bars. If you don’t have one of those, make them on a 8 x 8-inch baking pan lined with unbleached parchment and simply cut them into bars when they are set. Share this candy bar recipe with your friends and family to show them this fun treat you can make for the holidays or any time you get a chocolate craving!"
https://foodbabe.com/how-to-teach-your-child-about-artificial-food-dyes-and-become-a-food-advocate-at-home/,How to Teach Your Child About Artificial Food Dyes and Become a Food Advocate at Home,0,"Someone asked me a very good question the other day… “What do you do when your daughter’s at a party with cakes and candies full of artificial food dyes? Do you let her eat it? Does she miss out? What do you do?” My daughter was at a friend’s birthday party recently and the mom whispered over to warn me about the blue & red Spiderman Cake they had baked. Since she knows me very well she said: “You may not want Harley eating this cake because the kids went really crazy with artificial colors while making it”. I appreciated her giving me the heads up, so I could be prepared when cake time rolled around! I’m sure you’ve also found yourself in this situation…you don’t want your kids to feel left out…but there is no way you are going to allow them to eat artificial dyes made from petroleum that disrupt the immune system and are linked to hyperactivity, cancer, and allergies. (1) So, what do you do? Now that my daughter is almost 4, she’s encountering artificially dyed, flavored, over-processed foods more than ever, and I know I can’t always be there. I hope to give her all the tools she needs to know what to do when this happens. Watch the video below to hear how I handled the “blue cake situation” at this party and how I’m raising my daughter to make these decisions on her own as she gets older (jump to 25:50 in the video to hear the story). Dhru and I also talk about the nasty ingredients in Kellogg’s cereal, why Starbucks removed caramel color from their drinks, and the simple tips and recipes I provide in my new cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen. Watch or listen below and share it with your friends! Now that Food Babe Kitchen is a New York Times Best Seller and is getting increased exposure, available copies are even more limited.

https://foodbabe.com/how-to-avoid-artificial-dyes-at-birthday-parties-and-celebrations-recipes-products-and-tips-i-use/,"How to avoid artificial dyes at birthday parties and celebrations (recipes, products, and tips I use!)",0,"My daughter went to two different birthday parties on the same weekend, and while I love kids parties and my daughter being invited to celebrate with her friends, there was something that made me VERY SAD. Both of the birthday cakes were covered in brightly colored icing that was dyed with artificial colors. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been surprised. Almost every bakery makes their cakes with a lot of artificial colors and other horrible ingredients. Have you seen the ingredients in those cakes at Walmart? I don’t eat artificial colors or allow them in my daughter’s diet at all. I have ZERO tolerance for artificial dyes. This may sound extreme – but there are so many reasons why we shouldn’t be eating them, especially children. Quite honestly, I thought my friends and family already knew this information, but as my daughter attends more parties (and is now in school) I’m still seeing artificial colors EVERYWHERE. That’s when I realized I needed to write about this pronto! Now, I know that parties are just an occasional thing, so why should you even worry about it? Even if you aren’t attending many parties right now because of the pandemic, almost everyone is still buying and baking cakes for their family. And, it’s not just parties. Children are being bombarded with artificial colors at every turn! Products specifically targeted to kids are full of them. They’re in drinks, cereals, snacks, and even school lunches. Artificial colors are in just about every holiday candy out there from Halloween, to Christmas, to Valentine’s Day, to Easter. And, then you’ve got the summertime backyard parties with brightly dyed popsicles. Even though parties and celebrations aren’t a daily occurrence, I’m not okay with poisoning my daughter’s body with artificial colors made from petroleum and linked to so many health risks. I don’t know about you, but I want my child to have the best. That is why I will not compromise. Not at one party, and not ever. As parents, it’s our responsibility to teach our children about their food. I have been teaching Harley about dyes and how to spot them. She’s starting to learn that if a treat is covered in brightly colored icing, that it is probably artificially colored and not good to eat. I’ll suggest that she choose a white or chocolate option instead (if available) or to scrape off the colorful icing. Of course, I don’t want her to feel left out or miss out on enjoying treats. That’s why I’ve educated her about artificial dyes, and we agree to take off the icing at the very least. I’ve also learned how to make colorful treats without artificial colors at home. And it’s my dream that someday everyone will do this! It may sound like a miracle, but it’s such an easy change to make! Natural colors are so inexpensive and readily available now, there is no reason to keep using the artificial stuff. These may contain additives and generally are not organic, which isn’t ideal, however they are a zillion times better than artificial colors and very inexpensive. Here are the best brands I’ve found: You can buy powders made out of 100% freeze-dried produce to dye your cakes and cookies. You can also buy freeze-dried fruit to make your own powder, such as strawberries, which is what I use for the Strawberry Cake recipe in my cookbook Food Babe Kitchen. This way your colors are also nutritious! You can take a plain white cake and make it look amazing with colorful decorations. You can blend pureed berries (fresh or cooked) into cakes and frosting very easily to make them more colorful, or use chopped fruit as decoration. Since there is water in the fruit, you may need to slightly decrease the amount of liquid in your recipe. I was so happy with how this Strawberry Cake from scratch turned out for Harley’s 3rd birthday. I was able to make it this gorgeous shade of pink by using REAL STRAWBERRIES. Unlike those gross cake mixes by Betty Crocker and Pillsbury full of artificial red dye, artificial flavors, and tons of synthetic additives. NOT ONE REAL STRAWBERRY is used to make them. Pillsbury uses “Artificial Strawberry Flavor Bits” to make their cake. 😳 So, I had to create my own version! It was DELICIOUS. I hope you make this cake for your next birthday party or celebration, because it was a real hit! My cookbook also includes the recipe for the organic birthday cake I made for Harley’s 1st birthday that is sweetened with applesauce, bananas, and a tad of maple syrup! It’s perfect for one-year olds and young children. It turned out so delicious, I plan to make it time and time again for birthdays and other celebrations. Look for a bakery in your town that will bake without artificial colors. Here in Charlotte, there’s a bakery called Jewell Treats that bakes cupcakes and cakes with natural colors. Also pinkturtlecookies will make their famous sugar cookies with natural dyes if you ask. If you can’t find a natural bakery in your area or if a bakery wants to charge you extra to use natural colors, you can purchase the colors yourself and ask the bakery to use them. I’ve done this multiple times and it works like a charm. I’ve also purchased organic sugar cookies and frosted them myself. Since the frosting is typically the biggest culprit, you can do this with cakes and cupcakes too (simply ask the bakery to use no dyes). Another option is to use organic cake and cookie mixes to make it easier and to save you time. Homemade tastes best and you can totally control the ingredients you use, but if you don’t want to bake from scratch you can buy mixes and make them colorful and festive with any of the options in this post. Here are some of the best mixes I’ve found… Cakes: Cookies: Frosting: Almost every popular cake mix and frosting on the market has artificial colors added to it – even some chocolate versions. You’ll find artificial colors in Dunkin Hines Classic Yellow, Pillsbury Devil’s Food, Betty Crocker Super Moist Yellow, Pillsbury Moist Supreme Lemon, Betty Crocker Super Moist Red Velvet, and many more. Even vanilla frosting (which is white) has artificial yellow dye in it! This is why you want to choose a certified organic brand, which won’t contain artificial ingredients. I hope this gives you TONS of options so that you aren’t tempted into skimping and buying cakes and cookies full of artificial dyes. Our kids deserve the best, don’t they? If you agree, please share this post with your friends and family and let them know how we can all have safe dye-free parties together. Happy Baking!"

I know what it’s like to feel sick, tired, and overweight. Years ago, that was me. Until one day I woke up in a hospital bed. This was my wake up call. I started to investigate what I was eating, and what I found shocked me to my core. The majority of my “food” was composed of man-made materials from a factory. I was not eating real food. The food was DEAD—which is how I felt most of my life. I didn’t have energy, I had lots of health issues, was on tons of prescription drugs, and felt just like the food I was eating—dead. I was walking around like a ZOMBIE and I knew why: I was eating overly processed food filled with chemical additives. I realized that I could no longer give up control to processed food manufacturers. I had to figure out how to make food from living, real food ingredients… That’s when I taught myself how to cook. And everything changed in my life! All the health issues I had—asthma, eczema, allergies—went away. My excess weight fell off and I began to have more energy. Cooking at home had saved my life! And, I’m never going back to my old lifestyle. I’ve learned how to make delicious, unprocessed meals efficiently—and fast. I wrote this cookbook for you. And for everyone who has ever asked what I really eat on a daily basis and how I shop for food. Food Babe Kitchen outlines it all, step-by-step, with beautiful photography. Food Babe Kitchen gathers together my favorite recipes, the things that I make for my own family every single week — and that they love — all in one place.

If there is anything that spells out what I’m passionate about… this is it! It brings me so much joy to be able to share a glimpse of this happiness in my life with you. The first 55 pages of Food Babe Kitchen includes a comprehensive shopping guide, so you can easily find the healthiest ingredients and products to stock in your kitchen.

https://foodbabe.com/organic-grilled-chicken-tacos-with-fresh-peach-salsa-healthy-mexican-food/,Organic Grilled Chicken Tacos With Fresh Peach Salsa (Healthy Mexican Food),0,"It’s no secret that I LOVE Mexican food. I’m always looking for ways to make it healthier at home because the food at most restaurants is made with unhealthy refined oils, genetically-modified corn, and factory-farmed conventional meats. It’s nearly impossible to find organic chicken tacos at restaurants where I live, so being able to make them at home is a lifesaver! These homemade chicken tacos are quick and easy to make – and kid’s love them too. Simply grill up some pastured chicken and top it with fresh peach salsa and goat milk feta, all wrapped up in organic corn tortillas. Delish! To make these tacos, I start with the best organic ingredients. Especially when I’m cooking with meat, I am extra careful. Most chickens are raised in despicable conditions where they don’t have room to move freely in cramped barns without access to natural light. They sit in ammonia-ridden waste all day, which is why they are routinely fed antibiotics to prevent disease. These practices disgust me. This is why I choose to only eat organic pasture-raised chicken. Chickens that are humanely raised on pastures are healthier and more nutritious than their indoors-only counterparts, with higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids. When shopping for chicken, look for the USDA Organic label along with the Animal Welfare Approved by AGW, or Certified Humane label. And don’t feel limited to chicken! This peach salsa is the perfect accompaniment to any type of white fish. You can simply spoon it over baked fish or make fish tacos with this salsa, instead of chicken. If you have time, mix up the salsa the day before and let marinate in the refrigerator. It’s always better the next day when all the flavors have had time to meld. These tacos are even MORE incredible with the homemade corn tortillas from the Food Babe Kitchen cookbook! So, you’ll have to give that a try too. Once you make homemade tortillas, it’s really hard to go back to the store-bought ones. If you know anyone who loves Mexican food as much as I do, please share this recipe with them! It truly is a lifesaver."
https://foodbabe.com/goji-berry-smoothie-an-antioxidant-powerhouse/,Goji Berry Smoothie – An antioxidant powerhouse!,0,"Let me count the ways I love goji berries… That’s why adding goji’s to a smoothie is the best idea ever! Antioxidants are very important because they fight all the free radicals and toxins you can accumulate in your body that cause aging and disease. Goji berries are great for eyesight, skin, and fertility too! (1) Paired with organic strawberries, raw almond butter, and bananas, they make a delicious antioxidant-rich smoothie that will give you tons of energy. I like to add Truvani Vanilla Plant Based Protein to mine, which makes it a meal that lasts for several hours. Smoothies are something that I try to incorporate in my everyday diet because they are the ultimate “fast food” which makes it easy to incorporate several nutrient-dense ingredients in one easy to drink shake. Simply whiz it up in the blender and eat. One thing I don’t do, however, is buy pre-made bottled “smoothies” from the grocery store, such as the ones made by Naked and Bolthouse Farms. These smoothies are very heavily processed, which destroys the beneficial nutrients. Especially when they use “concentrates” which are made by boiling juice into a syrup. If you’re going to drink a smoothie, what’s the point if its nutrients have been boiled to death?! That’s why my new cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen, includes a wide variety of smoothie recipes to keep things interesting.

(VIDEO)",0,"I got a very special package this week from my publisher. I was so excited to see my new cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen, hot off the press…and then something funny happened: What a head fake – all those tears for nothing lol! 🤣 The second was supposed to be a cookbook after The Food Babe Way was published. But the publisher wanted to print my cookbook in black & white! 😲 I told them there was NO WAY that I could have a black & white cookbook. I wanted full color photographs of every recipe and wanted to create at least 100 recipes for this book. They said they didn’t have the budget for it, which was so heartbreaking. So I BEGGED my agents to get me out of the publishing contract and they helped me find a new publisher who saw my vision. It is going to be so beautiful, with FULL COLOR photos of every recipe (over 100!) and never-before-seen photos of me with my family enjoying time cooking and eating together. This cookbook has been YEARS in the making and now we have only a few weeks to go (it hits bookshelves Oct 20th!)…I can’t wait for you to get your copy to see how wonderful it is!

https://foodbabe.com/mango-yogurt-milkshake-a-mango-lassi-tropical-treat/,Mango Yogurt Milkshake – A Mango Lassi Tropical Treat!,0,"If you love milkshakes, this is for you… My golden lassi is like a frosty tropical milkshake, made with 100% healthy ingredients. A lassi is a drink that’s made by blending yogurt with fruit and spices. You can easily make this vegan by using coconut yogurt (CocoYO and Harmless Harvest are my fave!) I also love to use my mom’s homemade yogurt that she makes from grass-fed organic milk. Whatever you do, make sure you choose an unsweetened plain organic yogurt to avoid dairy raised on drugs and GMO grains. The star ingredient here is the fresh ginger. This is one very special ingredient that I eat almost every single day. Not only does it have a sweet and spicy taste that I love, but it’s great for the body and is a master at fighting inflammation. It’s a true superfood! Making this lassi couldn’t be easier when you use frozen pineapple and mango that’s already chopped and ready to go. Simply add the fruit, yogurt, ginger, cardamom, and coconut milk to a blender and mix it for about one minute. Once it’s smooth, pour the lassi into two glasses and share with a friend! Here’s the printable recipe. You’ll want to keep this one handy! My first cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen, is available to pre-order now and will be in bookstores on October 20th! It contains all of the real food meals that I love to make for myself and my family, plus many more healthy treats like this one! I’ll show you how to cook, shop for food, and plan meals without spending hours in the kitchen. When you pre-order Food Babe Kitchen today, I’ll send you my Ultimate Pantry List. In this bonus guide, I walk you through every single item that’s in my pantry, fridge, and freezer. Virtually EVERYTHING, including the brand names that I buy is included.

https://foodbabe.com/interview-request-to-kelloggs-ceo-15-min-interview-for-100k-please-share-this-post/,Interview Request to Kellogg’s CEO – 15 min interview for 100k (Please share this post),0,"My latest post about the new waffles Kellogg’s created for children which are full of artificial colors and other horrible ingredients and a disaster to a child’s immune system has made people ready to hold Kellogg’s accountable. After seeing the post, my friend Jesse Itzler challenged the CEO of Kellogg’s with an offer only a fool would refuse: $100,000.00 for a 15 minute Live interview on Instagram to discuss their products. Jesse will donate this money to any kids charity of the CEO’s choice. Isn’t this amazing?! In his letter to Kellogg’s CEO he says: I spent last week reaching out to reporters to get an official response from Kellogg’s CEO, Steve Cahillane. I can’t wait to see what he has to say and whether he will agree to be interviewed by Jesse. Which news agency is going to report on this? Who is brave enough? Who cares about our children enough? Shouldn’t the media question why certain food companies are creating products with ingredients that are clearly making us (and our children) sick? Will Kellogg’s refuse $100,000 to a children’s charity in exchange for a 15-minute interview about their products? If so, what are they afraid of? That’s why they report about how fantastic Kellogg’s new waffles are instead of investigating the ingredients. Much of the media nowadays is public relations, and not true journalism. The first reporter to publish a response from Kellogg’s should win an excellence award in journalism. Real reporting takes the bravery to publish what other people (like Kellogg’s) want to keep behind closed doors. The public needs to know the truth about Kellogg’s products, and it’s time for the media to stop pandering to them and start asking real questions. I know there are many brave reporters who are doing great work. And, I can’t wait to see which one steps up to cover this and gets a response from Kellogg’s headquarters. Let’s make this happen! Kellogg’s can’t hide behind their artificial waffles forever."
https://foodbabe.com/homemade-fruit-jam-4-flavors-without-corn-syrup-and-refined-sugar/,Homemade Fruit Jam (4 Flavors!) Without Corn Syrup and Refined Sugar,0,"I don’t know why I didn’t start doing this sooner… because making my own jam at home is incredibly easy and delicious. And, it is absolutely amazing on the homemade biscuits (with real grass-fed butter!) from my new cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen. Freshly baked biscuits with homemade jam on a lazy Sunday morning are to die for! Homemade jam is the way to go. The popular store-bought jams like Smucker’s and Welch’s are made with High Fructose Corn Syrup (1) and are not organic. If you follow the EWG Dirty Dozen List of pesticides on produce (2), it tells you that strawberries are the most contaminated fruit or vegetable out there – topping the list with the most pesticides. You’ll also find blueberries and raspberries on the list with high levels of pesticide contamination. These pesticides are hormone disruptors, neurotoxins, or reproductive toxins which are strongly linked to many diseases and health issues (3). That’s why it’s super important to buy organic jam, or make your own with organic berries. A few cups of berries (fresh or frozen), lemon juice, and some honey. You simply heat the ingredients in a pot and simmer for about 20 minutes… EASY PEASY. You can reduce or eliminate the honey in this recipe if you’d like to make a fruit-only jam. Just beware that it may not be as sweet as what you are used to unless the fruit is very ripe and sweet. Feel free to use coconut sugar if you’d like to make vegan jam without honey. The recipes below include 4 flavors of jam: Strawberry, Raspberry, Blueberry, and Mixed Berry. But, don’t feel limited! Have fun and play around with different combinations. Try using peaches, blackberries, cherries, apricots, etc. You will find that if the fruit is naturally very sweet, you may not need to use as much honey (or vice versa if the fruit is tart). Simply taste it after it is done cooking and adjust the sweetness as desired when creating new combinations. The best way to store your homemade jam is in small glass mason jars (no plastic!). I like to use jelly jars like these here. It can be stored in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks and in the freezer for up to 3 months. .ctfont{ } .pre-order-now { color: #ed534d; font-weight: bold; } .claim-your-bonus-link { text-decoration: underline; color: red !important; } .preorder-button{ max-height:52px; } .preorder-button:hover, .submit-button:hover { -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(2px 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)); -ms-filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Dropshadow(OffX=2, OffY=2, Color='#444')""; filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Dropshadow(OffX=2, OffY=2, Color='#444')""; } .preorder-button.dark-bg:hover{ -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(2px 2px 2px rgba(255,255,255,0.2)); -ms-filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Dropshadow(OffX=2, OffY=2, Color='#444')""; filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Dropshadow(OffX=2, OffY=2, Color='#444')""; } .block-font { font-style: normal; font-weight: 700; } If you know anyone who is still buying Smucker’s Jam (I’m sure you do!) please share this recipe with them and let them know how easy and inexpensive it is to make healthy organic jam at home."
https://foodbabe.com/new-kelloggs-waffles-are-a-disaster-for-childrens-immune-system/,New Kellogg’s waffles are a disaster for children’s immune system,0,"When I saw these new waffles I wanted to jump on a plane, fly to Kellogg’s headquarters, and give them a piece of my mind. But given that I am pregnant, I thought that wouldn’t be a good idea because I need to keep stress levels to a minimum. But, I’m not going to be quiet about it! The same company that brought you Baby Shark Cereal full of artificial ingredients last year (1), is targeting our children again. Kellogg’s just came out with three new waffles for 2020 – Unicorn Cotton Candy Waffles, Mermaid Blue Raspberry Waffles, and Birthday Cake Waffles – which are full of toxic ingredients. How did the team at Kellogg’s decide that it’s a good idea to release these products during a “pandemic”? How do they EVER decide that it’s okay to poison children with artificial ingredients that are not fit for human consumption? If food companies cared about our health, they’d be creating more products with organic real food ingredients that are naturally full of vitamins and minerals. And not this garbage. It’s disgusting. The Birthday Cake Waffles alone have 6 different artificial colors in them, along with refined flour, synthetic vitamins, refined sugar, refined oils, and artificial flavors. Artificial colors are made from petroleum and can disrupt the immune system. Research has found that “The molecules of synthetic colorants are small, and the immune system finds it difficult to defend the body against them. They can also bond to food or body proteins and, thus, are able to act in stealth mode to circumvent and disrupt the immune system.” (2) This is one of the many reasons I have a zero tolerance for artificial colors in anything I eat or my daughter eats. Artificial colors… Our petition has now reached nearly 54,000 signatures of concerned citizens (add your name now). Kellogg’s has largely ignored our petition – but I’m not going away. You are joining over 461,618 supporters to make this happen! I infiltrated their shareholder’s meeting in April and demanded to know if they were removing artificial colors as they had promised to do. They told me that they “will not make compromise is around taste and enjoyment” and will continue to “delight consumers with non-compromising foods”. (10) There are a lot of people out there who don’t know the truth about the food they are eating and buying for their kids. What about the parents who trust their doctors and give their children ADHD medications, not realizing that removing artificial colors from their diet could make a world of difference? (11) What about all the kids out there eating Froot Loops full of artificial colors and BHT? Meanwhile for our neighbors in Canada, Kellogg’s makes Froot Loops with natural colors and no BHT. You may know the risks of these ingredients – but not everyone does. I’d dare say that MOST people would be SHOCKED if they knew what the government allows in food products. Did you know that there’s an artificial color in Baby Shark Cereal that is banned from cosmetics because it’s a cancer risk? Yet they put it in kid’s cereal! (This is Red #3). Most people do not know what additives like Red #3, Yellow #5, and BHT could be doing to their health or the health of their kids. I’ve made it my mission to tell people the truth. And I want companies to change, because it is wrong to sell poisons for profit. Especially when it’s food for our children. Let’s hold Kellogg’s accountable."
https://foodbabe.com/how-to-choose-the-best-ingredients-to-make-a-healthy-pasta-salad/,How to choose the best ingredients to make a HEALTHY pasta salad,0,"I have been craving a lot of cold, fresh food these days to beat the heat, so I couldn’t wait to share this healthy recipe with you! Back in the day, I actually believed a box of Suddenly Salad was a healthy option because you “cook” it at home and assemble it yourself. Now I see that it is made with refined wheat flour pasta and risky additives like MSG, sodium phosphate, and caramel color. This is even worse than most salads found in a supermarket deli. I have yet to find a pre-made pasta salad that is made with healthy ingredients. They use refined flour pasta and unhealthy oils like soybean oil. I avoid soybean oil as much as possible because it is too high in omega-6 fatty acids, which increases the risk of inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Also, if it’s not organic, the oil is refined with the neurotoxin hexane – and I don’t want that in my food. Cooking starts with the ingredients. What you use to make any meal is crucial to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. And dare I say, it’s the only thing you should really concern yourself with when it comes down to how you decide to eat. 1. Choose pasta made without refined wheat flour. Most store-bought pasta is made from refined wheat flour that has been chemically bleached and completely stripped of its nutrients. It is then “enriched” with added vitamins from synthetic sources. The consumption of refined flour increases inflammation in the body and can disrupt the good intestinal bacteria in your digestive system. Most wheat grown today has been hybridized and damaged nutritionally during processing, so it really is “dead food”. My favorite type of pasta to use is lentil pasta made from 100% organic lentils. This is a healthy alternative to traditional pasta that is very high in protein and fiber, so it helps keep you feeling full longer. It’s easy to digest, and great for people who cannot eat gluten or wheat. I also sometimes like to buy 100% whole wheat pasta, but only if it is organic. It’s best to choose einkorn wheat (an ancient grain) because it hasn’t been hybridized over time and is more nutrient dense than the wheat that is produced today. 2. Choose organic pasta. Wheat is commonly contaminated with the herbicide Roundup, so it’s important to always choose certified organic pasta to avoid ingredients that contain synthetic chemical residues. After I mix this salad together, I like to let it chill for awhile to really let the flavors marinate together. This pasta salad is delicious and 100% nutritious! If you know anyone who could use a pasta salad makeover, please share this recipe with them!"
https://foodbabe.com/misting-booths-disinfecting-humans-is-this-where-we-are-headed-please-beware/,Misting Booths Disinfecting Humans – Is This Where We Are Headed? (Please Beware),0,"When I saw this, I couldn’t believe this was real – but it is. The Denver Broncos installed walk-through misting booths filled with hand sanitizer to disinfect their players. You can watch the players being sprayed with hand sanitizer in this short video: Microsure the company that makes the ingredients for this human disinfectant misting system, is actively lobbying school districts. We’ll likely see disinfectant booths like this in airports, stores, and other public places too – they are already doing them in Asia. Remember – your skin is your largest organ. And what are these chemicals going to do when they get in your ears and eyes? There are a lot of questions we need to be asking before we just conform to this madness. When you destroy all germs that our bodies encounter, you weaken your body’s defenses. I cannot sit back and let our world get over-sanitized without saying something. I’m not saying there’s not a place for sanitizers – like if you’re a medical professional (Purell stations by the thousands in every office are quite the sight, though). The constant use by the general public is out of control and creating a bigger problem. Good old fashioned hand washing is the best alternative. I use wipes that contain 99% water and 1% citrus extract on the go for my daughter. If you don’t want to be subjected to disinfectant spray booths everywhere you go, it’s time to make your voice heard! Please note: An active ingredient in this sanitizer – Benzalkonium Chloride – promotes antibiotic resistance, decreased fertility and can irritate the skin, eyes, and lungs. We campaigned in the past to get restaurants to stop using meat raised on antibiotics (and we won!) (8) That’s because the overuse of antibiotics in the meat supply creates resistant bacteria that is spreading to humans, making antibiotics less effective when we need them. (9) Antibiotic-resistant bacteria infects at least 2.8 million people and kills more than 35,000 each year in the U.S. (10) We need to do whatever we can to protect the integrity of our antibiotics – and the overuse of disinfectants is detrimental!"
https://foodbabe.com/peanut-butter-almond-butter-to-never-buy-again-my-top-brands-ultimate-nut-butter-buying-guide/,Peanut Butter & Almond Butter To Never Buy Again + My Top Brands (Ultimate Nut Butter Buying Guide),0,"One of my favorite indulgences is almond butter. I eat it almost every day… I’ll put a scoop in my morning oats, in my smoothies, and spread it on celery. When I was growing up, we always had a jar of Peter Pan Peanut Butter in the house. To me, that sweet heavily-processed spread was the only real peanut butter there was – and I really didn’t realize until well into my 20’s that there are MUCH healthier options out there. Today, the nut butter section is one of the most confusing sections in the grocery store. You’ve got creamy, crunchy, no-stir, stir, reduced fat, sweetened, unsweetened, palm oil, no palm oil, raw, roasted, natural, and organic. It’s no wonder that one of most popular questions I get is what brand of nut butter I use. In this post, I’m going to walk you through practically every brand of nut butter that you’ll see on the shelf and tell you what I look for. And, the absolute first thing I look at is the ingredient list. Flip over all the major brands of nut butter and read the ingredients. It’s common to find hydrogenated oils (soybean and cottonseed) or palm oil added, which is used to keep it from separating on the shelf and keeps it fresh without refrigeration. This may be more convenient, but those heavily processed and refined oils are not good for your health. Also, you’ll usually find sugar added to nut butter, which is an ingredient that most people eat way too much of. If you are eating nut butter on a regular basis, you especially want to make sure it is not sweetened. Occasionally, I may choose an organic nut butter that’s sweetened with coconut sugar (such as JEM brand), but I would treat this as a dessert. My everyday nut butter doesn’t contain any added sugars – just nuts! Let me give you a perfect example. Jif has three types of peanut butter (regular, Simply, and Natural) that all contain white sugar and additional oils. Other popular brands such as Skippy, Peter Pan, and Reese’s are also filled with hydrogenated oils and white sugar. Barney Butter, Justin’s, and Jif Almond Butter may sound healthier, but they also add oils to their nut butters so that stirring isn’t required. The oil in nuts naturally separate in the jar and float to the top, that is why you have to stir it the first time you use it. This can be messy, but one trick I’ve found is to store an unopened jar upside down in your pantry. When you’re ready to open and use it, it is much easier to stir without making a mess because the oil has largely incorporated into the butter and settled at the bottom of the jar, instead of the top. After stirring, make sure to store the opened jar in your fridge. Some brands (Adams, Smucker’s, Crazy Richards, Trader Joe’s, and Kirkland) make nut butters with only nuts, but they are not certified organic. It’s very important to choose organic nut butter because conventional nuts and peanuts are known to be heavily treated with synthetic pesticides and fungicides. Especially when it comes to peanuts because they are a legume (not technically a nut) and their pods grow underground, which allows pesticides to be more readily absorbed and concentrated. Couple that with the fact that peanuts are often rotated with cottonseed crops (1) (the world’s most pesticide-ridden crop) and you’ve got a breeding ground for massive pesticide contamination. (2) Conventional almonds and peanuts can be contaminated with Piperonyl Butoxide (3) a pesticide ingredient that is classified by the EPA as a possible human carcinogen (4) and linked to liver damage. Conventional almonds can also be contaminated with Chlorpyrifos (5), a controversial pesticide which is a neurotoxin. (6) Glyphosate (Roundup) herbicide is used on conventional peanuts and nuts (7) – and it’s known to cause cancer (8). Products are usually not tested for these chemicals, but residues of glyphosate have been found in Skippy Natural Peanut Butter. (9) There are several organic brands with one ingredient (which is good), but they are made with roasted nuts instead of raw nuts. If it doesn’t specifically say the nuts are “Raw” on the label, it is safe to assume the nuts are roasted. Roasted nut butters taste really good, I’m not going to lie – but if you want to choose the best one, raw nuts are healthiest because… Raw peanuts may be contaminated with Aspergillus flavus, a type of mold which produces the cancerous toxin aflatoxin. (11) Roasting peanuts prohibits the production of aflatoxin and may also reduce aflatoxin content (12) – so roasting may make peanuts safer to eat. Also, the fat found in peanuts is fairly heat resistant and less likely to oxidize. (13) It’s rare to find raw peanut butter on the market, but you can make it at home. Note: All almonds grown in the U.S. are pasteurized (typically with steam if they are organic) to destroy any pathogens such as salmonella. So there are not any truly raw U.S. almonds, but they are not cooked to the extent of roasted almonds. Beware that if the almonds are NOT organic, they may be pasteurized with the toxic chemical propylene oxide – which is classified as a probable human carcinogen. (14) Yet another reason to only choose organic! For example, the brand MaraNatha makes conventional almond butters, but also has a raw organic version that I like. The packaging looks NEARLY IDENTICAL, which is why reading the ingredient list is so important. To make it super easy for you, here’s a list of brands that meet my criteria. I personally buy the Artisana Organics brand often – which is found in natural grocery stores and online. If you have a nut allergy, I also listed my picks for seed butters. This includes pumpkin seed butter, which many people find better tasting than sunflower seed butter.

https://foodbabe.com/healthy-organic-4th-of-july-cookout-recipes-entire-meal-mix-match/,Healthy & Organic 4th of July Cookout Recipes (Entire Meal Mix & Match!),0,"Back in the day, 4th of July to me was a big BBQ with hot dogs, potato salad from the supermarket, and popsicles full of artificial colors and corn syrup. Eating this type of food – even just on a holiday – made me feel horrible. I woke up with a food hangover, my face looked puffy, and I was tired all the time. I’ve since learned that it’s not worth it to sacrifice my health and weight with additive-filled processed foods on holidays – and now I’ve figured out how to celebrate with fun and festive food that is actually healthy. Healthy food doesn’t need to be boring! I put together a round-up for you of my 4th of July cookout favorites, and it features a couple new recipes from my new cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen. Look at all this fun, healthy food… I feel like you can’t have a 4th of July cookout without burgers, that’s why the main dish for both of these menus are burgers! The Grilled Pineapple Turkey Burgers from Food Babe Kitchen are absolutely incredible. There’s something so special about adding sliced grilled pineapple to burgers. The sweet-and-savory combination takes turkey burgers up a notch and really hits the spot. I’m always concocting new veggie burger recipes at home, now that I no longer buy packaged or processed veggie burgers because of the scary ingredients and additives they contain. The Quinoa Veggie Burgers from Food Babe Kitchen are FABULOUS and too EASY not to make ASAP. You can make several ahead of time and either freeze or refrigerate them to enjoy later. Just have the grill master plop them on the grill to reheat and you’ve got a delicious plant-based, protein-packed meal. This healthy 7 layer dip is absolutely fabulous to and perfect for the 4th – it’s fun to prepare and a good opportunity to get a load of vegetables in to get the party started! I love how I sneaked in some kale – I promise no one will notice. I like serving it with organic corn chips and celery sticks. I like to alternate between the two so I don’t eat so many chips at one sitting. Other appetizers to try: My family goes bonkers for homemade ginger ale. When I realized that store-bought ginger ale is usually made with no real ginger, I was so disgusted. Manufacturers use “natural flavors” instead, because it is cheaper than using real ginger. That’s why I came up with this recipe. It’s sweet, spicy, and sooooo refreshing on a hot day. Other drinks to try: The star salad here is my Grapefruit Goddess Salad from Food Babe Kitchen . This tart, sweet, crunchy, and juicy salad is such a nice departure from typical salad ingredients. The combo bursts with flavor and has an amazing ability to zap sugar cravings too, which is a great side benefit! Other sides to try: These Blueberry “Cheesecake” Bars are fun and festive. You can garnish with sliced strawberries to give them a red, white, and blue look for the 4th.

https://foodbabe.com/drinking-alcohol-every-night-to-get-through-this-why-its-the-worst-idea-ever/,Drinking alcohol every night to get through this? Why it’s the worst idea ever.,0,"We are going through a crazy time. Undoubtedly the craziest time in my lifetime. I’ve been having long, personal conversations with my friends about everything going on, doing what we can to build each other up. And many of them expressed frustration about one thing… Ever since the quarantines started they’ve been drinking more alcohol…way more than they normally do. What used to be maybe a weekly (or monthly) occurrence, is seriously becoming an every night of the week habit that is getting out of control. They aren’t working, they’re bored and completely stressed out – and turning to booze to make them feel better. I hate to be a buzzkill, but honestly, I have to say it…. Drinking all the time, especially during this crisis, is one of the worst things you can do right now. You are relying on something that (ironically) is horrible for your health because you are feeling stressed out. There are better ways to handle this situation. I know you probably don’t want to hear this, but hear me out. You’ve heard alcohol is bad for your liver – but that’s not the only organ it’s affecting. Drinking too much alcohol disrupts the healthy balance of bacteria your gut. You see, we all have a garden of bacteria living in our intestines (1), which is vitally important to the health of our immune system as a whole (2). The “good” bacteria in your gut helps to keep you healthy (3, 4, 5). When you drink – you create an imbalance in your gut bacteria (6) – which in turn compromises your body’s ability to fight infections (7). Further down the line, this can lead to leaky gut syndrome (8) – which creates tiny little holes in our digestive system organs that leak out the good bacteria we need to stay healthy and keep our immune system strong. When you drink, certain white blood cells that are your “front-line” of defense against infections essentially get shut down and are only about ¼ as effective as fighting viruses as they usually are (9). It is a major blow to your natural immune defenses. Heavy drinking can lead to vitamin and mineral deficiencies as well, because it impairs your body’s ability to absorb nutrients (10). Without necessary nutrients, you’re more susceptible to infections and won’t be able to heal as quickly. And if all this isn’t enough, drinking too much alcohol is known to specifically increase the risk of respiratory infections (11), such as pneumonia and ARDS. Knowing what we know so far about COVID-19 and how it affects the respiratory system… do you think those nightly drinks are worth the risk? It’s not just the alcohol that’s shutting off your immune system. Most alcoholic drinks are filled with unhealthy ingredients that are sabotaging you. Ever wonder what makes Bailey’s Irish Cream so deliciously brown, or Blue Curacao so tropically blue? What makes Malibu Rum so sweet, or what gives Captain Morgan its golden hue? The alcohol industry has lobbied for years against ingredient labels because they don’t want you to know what you’re drinking. As a result, we know more about what’s in a bottle of Windex than we do about the world’s most popular drinks. After we petitioned beer companies (12) to tell us what’s in their beer, the two largest beer manufacturers began listing their ingredients online (13) – but there is still a lot we do not know. My research for The Food Babe Way uncovered a slew of unlabeled additives (14) and crazy ingredients you’d never guess you were drinking. To give you a recap, this might be lurking in your favorite drink: NOTE ABOUT WHITE CLAW: White Claw says their full ingredient list is “proprietary” – which means it is a secret. “The alcohol in White Claw Hard Seltzer comes from fermented sugars derived from malted gluten-free grains” – which could mean corn syrup, but who knows? They haven’t responded to an inquiry from my team to clarify this yet. I enjoy wine, champagne, and tequila every now and then. When I do, I make the best choices I can. Having alcohol is not a judgment call that any of us should make for others, unless excessive drinking is ruining someone’s health, family, and personal life. The important thing is to be educated about alcohol, what’s in it, how much should be consumed, and whether you feel it’s something you want to have in your lifestyle. If you are finding yourself drowning your quarantine-sorrows in booze, there are healthier and more effective ways to handle your stress. So, set down that cocktail and let me show you some strategies that work for me to keep my sanity, which I’m sure could help you as well. What are you doing to relieve stress during this crazy time? Tell me in the comments. Let’s share our ideas and support each other. It’s more important right now than ever!"
https://foodbabe.com/introducing-truvanis-plant-based-omega-supplement-its-vegan-and-carrageenan-free/,Introducing Truvani’s Plant Based Omega Supplement! (It’s vegan and carrageenan-free),0,"I have great news for you today: Truvani’s Plant Based Omega is finally available! This new supplement can help support brain health, heart health, and overall wellness within your body. There are over 30,000 studies supporting the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet. But, when we set out to develop our omega supplement, we faced a few obstacles. We wanted to create a product that: You’d think this is easy to accomplish, but it’s not. This product wasn’t easy to make. And it almost didn’t happen. The biggest problem was… Even though you can’t certify plant-based omega supplements as organic, some organic supplements use sunflower oil to help deliver nutrients and keep the product stable. Sunflower oil can be organic, and for some reason manufacturers refused to replace their non-organic sunflower oil with organic sunflower oil. We pressed them. And I was stunned at their response: “There’s no demand for it.” Meaning they wouldn’t use it. REALLY?!?! I WAS demanding it. And I wasn’t going to compromise. Not for this product, or any product with the Truvani label. So, we put the product on hold immediately. Even though it created some major headaches, it was worth it. We built Truvani into a brand people can trust. And saying NO to bad ingredients is our motto. We didn’t lose hope. We kept looking for ingredient suppliers, and now, after a year, we finally found one. So, our new product is now possible… and it’s amazing. Watch the video to learn more… These little details are what makes Truvani products bar none. So, if you ever thought about trying an Omega 3 supplement, I highly suggest you check it out. Plus, since it’s brand new, we are offering up to 25% off. We like to reward our most loyal customers with the best possible pricing. Truvani’s Plant Based Omega is made with responsibly-sourced algal oil, delivered in a banded capsule that is carrageenan-free and gelatin-free. (Many Omegas come in soft-gels. Soft-gels often have carrageenan. Sometimes they don’t call it carrageenan and disguise it as “seaweed extract.” Truvani doesn’t use soft-gels). It gets better, too. The #1 complaint for omega supplements is “Fish burps.” Because most omega supplements are made from fish oil. However, we use algal oil, which is plant-based. Plus, we use a water-based extraction process, so no chemical solvents involved. This process removes impurities, too. Which means no nasty fish burps. No gross smell. Just a clean-tasting, shelf-stable omega-3 supplement that you’re going to love. I will always put up a fight to make sure each product meets the high-quality Truvani standards. Even if it means we delay a product. Or cancel it altogether. Luckily we could make this product happen and I hope you’ll try it out. Snag a bottle of Truvani Plant Based Omega at special launch pricing. Xo, Vani P.S. Are you as excited about this new supplement as I am? Tell me in the comments below!"

My husband has an incredible green thumb and takes requests every season to grow the plants we like to eat, in aboveground planters that we fill with organic soil and water with filtered water. Being able to just walk right outside and grab our own homegrown organic produce to make a salad is my dream come true. When we shot the cover of this cookbook, we had an array of the most delicious spicy arugula. It’s so fresh and tastes amazing—even Harley eats it. There’s truly nothing better.

https://foodbabe.com/i-infiltrated-the-kelloggs-shareholders-meeting-and-what-the-ceo-said-will-shock-you-video/,I infiltrated the Kellogg’s shareholders meeting and what the CEO said will shock you (VIDEO),0,"I have some outrageous news for you today… If you’ve been reading this blog – you know that Kellogg’s sells cereals in the U.S. with artificial colors, artificial flavors, and BHT, while they make the same cereals without these risky ingredients in other countries. We petitioned Kellogg’s, asking them to remove artificial ingredients from all of their cereals in the U.S. just as they do in other countries. This petition has now reached over 50,000 signatures of concerned citizens (add your name now). Kellogg’s has largely ignored us. And, due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, I was unable to go in person to the Kellogg’s annual shareholder meeting to deliver these petitions. So I had to come up with another plan… I was authorized by a Kellogg’s shareholder to act as their representative at Kellogg’s virtual meeting last week. I was only permitted to submit written questions, and there was the risk that the moderator would ignore my questions. Only one of my questions was read and answered during the meeting. During your 2015 2nd Quarter Earnings Call, Paul Norman, former president of Kellogg North America stated: “we have been working to remove artificial colors and flavors across Kellogg’s branded cereals and a variety of Kellogg’s branded snack bars as well as Eggo frozen foods. Our goal is to complete this transition by the end of 2018.” Kellogg’s currently is still selling cereal made with artificial colors, such as Fruit Loops and Apple Jacks. In addition, artificial flavors and colors are in some limited-edition cereals, such as Baby Shark Cereal. What is Kellogg’s current position on this? Does Kellogg’s still have a goal to remove artificial colors and artificial flavors from their entire line of cereal? I then asked a 2nd question regarding the status of removing BHT from all of their cereals. This question was also ignored. My question: What is your current position on removing artificial colors from all your cereals, such as Fruit Loops and Apple Jacks? Steven Cahillane, CEO of Kellogg’s: “We have made tremendous progress in removing artificial ingredients from all of our products including our ready-to-eat cereal products. Where we will not make compromise is around taste and enjoyment, and so, to the extent that we can continue to make progress and delight consumers with non-compromising foods, that’s our north star.” In 2015 this was all over the news… “Kellogg to stop using artificial ingredients by 2018” – USA Today “Kellogg to Eliminate Artificial Ingredients in Cereal” – NBC News “Kellogg to stop using artificial products in cereals, snack bars” – Reuters “Kellogg announces removal of artificial colors, flavors” – Food Dive “Kellogg’s to dump artificial ingredients from cereal by 2018” – Fox News I’m sure they loved all the good publicity! Well, now everyone can know that they are LIARS. The truth is that Kellogg’s is not making “tremendous progress” removing artificial ingredients from their cereals, and continues to create brand new cereals FOR CHILDREN with them. All the while, Kellogg’s sells safer cereals with better ingredients in other countries. We’re not asking Kellogg’s to start at square one and to reformulate their cereals without artificial ingredients, as this has already been done! Just like when we petitioned Kraft and I arrived uninvited at their headquarters with thousands of your signatures, they reluctantly agreed to meet with me. And, I’ll never forget what they told me… Kraft said, “We’ll have to agree to disagree” and that their customers like Kraft Mac & Cheese just the way it was, with artificial colors. Well, we all know what happened next! Kraft removed the artificial colors after all. We influenced Kraft to change their iconic Mac & Cheese and I know in my heart that we can influence Kellogg’s to do the same with Fruit Loops, Apple Jacks, and all of their cereals. I’m so thankful to all of you who have stepped up in such a huge way in support for this petition. You’re truly remarkable. We can do this, but we all need to continue sharing our petition everywhere! Go, Food Babe Army, Go!"
https://foodbabe.com/over-100-snacks-better-than-goldfish-for-kids/,Over 100 snacks better than Goldfish for kids,0,"If I can stop one goal of the BIG food industry in the way I raise my daughter it would be this: Refuse to buy junk food designed to be addictive that has no nutritional value. And refusing to feed my daughter Pepperidge Farm Goldfish fits the bill brilliantly. But why is this snack something almost every child in America eats in the first place? Parents buy them by the gallon carton full at Costco. Preschools and day cares serve them. It’s time for this to stop. First, let’s talk about what’s not on the label. The majority of wheat in this country is sprayed with glyphosate (Roundup weedkiller) as a drying agent before harvest (1), which is ending up in finished products on the shelf. Tests have specifically found residues of glyphosate in Goldfish Crackers (1). This chemical is known to cause cancer (2). The cheese in Goldfish Crackers is not organic. That means it comes from factory farmed cows that were raised on an unhealthy diet of food that was not organic and probably sprayed with glyphosate and other pesticides (3). When you buy Goldfish crackers, you are supporting the industrial complex of crap food. And you don’t need to do that. Kids will be just fine without Goldfish Crackers and I will prove it to you. When you combine the blood sugar spiking ingredient white flour, cheap oils likely produced with hexane with an addictive flavoring like autolyzed yeast which is just MSG disguised as another name – you create the perfect food for hooking your brain to crave it over and over again. Autolyzed yeast is an excitotoxin, purely used to increase food cravings and irresistibility, so you eat more than you should. I personally don’t want my child’s taste buds to be hijacked by foods like this. We need to stop the habit of brainless munching of low quality foods that has led millions of Americans to diseases like obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. But here’s the good news… I put together a list of over 100 snacks that are a zillion times better than Goldfish Crackers. This is for all the moms and dads out there who think they need Goldfish Crackers to have snacks on-the-go for their kids. You can stash any of these alternative snacks in your bag or car, or wherever you go and you’ll always have a healthy snack handy for your child that is non-white flour and non-white sugar. It’s time to stop letting our kids get hooked on nutrition-less dead food! Big food has done of enough damage to our health. Let’s break their control together. Choose organic whenever possible. I linked to the products to make shopping easy for you. Note: this list doesn’t include the myriad of fresh fruits and vegetables and homemade snacks you can make in your kitchen – which are the snacks I offer most to my daughter. 1.

https://foodbabe.com/how-to-make-rice-krispies-treats-without-controversial-ingredients-like-bht-and-corn-syrup/,How to make “Rice Krispies Treats” without controversial ingredients like BHT and corn syrup,0,"DISCLAIMER: I can polish off a half of a pan of these Rice Krispie Treats in one sitting, so before you start reading, don’t get mad at me – you’ve been warned. Seriously, though it makes me incredibly sad that so many children are eating “treats” full of corn syrup, artificial flavors, BHT, TBHQ, DATEM, and all kinds of additives that are linked to health issues. (1) I grew up with homemade Rice Krispie Treats – they were a staple in my mother’s kitchen. Since then, Kellogg’s came up with this processed crap that makes its way into kid’s lunches everywhere. This ingredient list is CRAZY to me, especially since you can make similar treats at home without all that nonsense. Here’s how I make mine, but first let’s talk about the ingredients. There are 3 basic ingredients you need to make Rice Krispies Treats: (1) butter, (2) crispy rice cereal, and (3) marshmallows. But you need to be extra careful on how you choose these ingredients… 1. Butter: Look for a pastured grass-fed butter. Here’s why – Conventional non-organic butter comes from cows fed almost entirely GMO corn and soy. The harmful pesticides used on GMOs (like glyphosate) is also being eaten by these cows too and can end up in their milk – and thereby, butter. (2) You’ll also want to stay away from margarines made with inflammatory oils like soybean oil that are most surely GMO (unless specified otherwise). They also can contain hidden trans fat additives (like mono and diglycerides), flavors, and artificial preservatives. (2) 2. Crispy Rice Cereal: Choose a certified organic brand. This is the best way to protect yourself from synthetic pesticides. (3) I like to use 365 Organic Brown Rice Crisps from Whole Foods, as it has no “flavors” added like the Kellogg’s version does. 3. Marshmallows: This is the most tricky ingredient, but very important to choose correctly because most brands are AWFUL. Unfortunately, I have (yet) to find 100% certified organic marshmallows unless you make them from scratch. So, until then, I use SmashMallow brand, which are made with organic cane sugar and no artificial colors. Did you know they dye most marshmallows with Blue 1 made from petroleum? Steer clear of Kraft Jet-Puffed Marshmallows which are full of GMO Sugar and awful ingredients! All you do is melt 3 tablespoons of pastured butter on the stove in a saucepan. I like to use a GreenPan saucepan, so the marshmallows don’t stick. Then you toss in a bag of marshmallows and melt them all together (One of my friends made these with two bags of marshmallows and said they were great. You can use two if you’d like, but I think it would be too sugary! But now I wanna try it, LOL) Then you’ll take it off the heat and mix in 6 cups of rice cereal… After it’s mixed up well, you pour the mixture into a buttered baking pan and press it down well. That’s it! Here’s the printable recipe… Which would you rather eat? Share this recipe with all your Rice Krispy loving friends. I’d love to never, ever, see kids eating out of those blue wrappers again."
https://foodbabe.com/how-i-am-supporting-my-immune-system-right-now/,How I Am Supporting My Immune System Right Now,0,"This week I was supposed to be in California attending the biggest natural products show in the U.S. I prepared weeks for this show. Everything from lining up meetings, to preparing frozen meals to take with me for my daughter to eat while I was busy working and lots and lots of packing! It was stressful but it was going to be so worth it. Truvani was going to have their first booth at this major trade show. But on Monday night right as I finished putting all the last minute things in my bag, I got a text. The trip was cancelled because of the global health emergency going on right now. When I told my daughter we weren’t going to California – she looked at me and almost cried. And I did too. Health scares always make me think about my overall health and mortality. And it reminds me of why I got into eating better in the first place. It all started with a hospital trip. Even though it was for something that was completely out of my control, it made me realize that I was ignoring my overall health. Then, everything changed. I started blogging about food and ingredients on Food Babe. I also launched my company Truvani, where I sell remarkable supplements. We are also running a sale on some of our newest products, specifically Under The Weather, Vitamin C, and Vitamin D. I love taking these – not only because they are organic and the best in class – but because they give me peace of mind that I am doing everything I can. Here’s to staying sane and healthy in this trying time."

Your children. Your family. I hoped it would help people to stop believing the lie that everything on the shelf is safe and that even foods advertised as “healthy” are often far from it. In this book, I wanted to make it easy for people to stop falling for food industry tricks and transform their food choices. That’s why it makes me SO HAPPY to see reviews like this… “Just when I thought my family was eating good, BOOM……MIND BLOWN !! After reading this book, our family will never shop for our food the same way again! We are now in the process of slowly restocking our kitchen and refrigerator with nothing but “real” food with the knowledge and ideas from this book.” – Terry “This book is the real deal. Big bucks are paid by companies to NOT get the word out on how our food supply has poisoned us. If you feel GMO is fine, conventional foods are fine, etc, you’ve been duped. The propaganda of big bucks has influenced you. READ THIS BOOK. And don’t stop there. Continue to educate yourself on good nutrition. You’ll live a lot longer, feel better, look better, and be a lot happier. Most Americans are addicted to garbage foods. AS I SAID, read this book.” – Emily “I shudder to think how much trust I had previously put into “Big Food”, most especially as it relates to my child and the foods I thought “must be safe or they wouldn’t be selling it”. This book is a MUST if you want to protect your loved ones. It’s horrifying to discover how much damage can be caused by ingesting dishonest foods and this book arms you with the tools you need to make the best decisions.” – Amazon customer “We’ve been eating clean for years, but I still learned a LOT from reading this book. I can’t believe that food companies have the power and ability to manipulate the press the way they do. Just goes to show you that there is not a single news outlet out there that you can trust anymore. There is no such thing as an unbiased view when it involves making or losing money. Big Food has been winning at this garbage for TOO LONG! It has to stop.” – Happy Shopper Calling out specific food brands, industry experts, and front groups is VERY RISKY to report on. Newspapers, TV networks, and publishers don’t want to touch this information because it could hurt their ad accounts (yes, I’ve been told this point blank). And although I struggled to get a publisher who was courageous enough to move forward with this book, my persistence has been worth it. I’m really thankful that I didn’t let the naysayers and critics scare me off from writing it. This book has already helped so many people, and for that, I’m so grateful! I wrote this book to expose the unethical tactics used by certain corporations who are feeding the world, because they are hurting and misleading a lot of people with their lies. And it needs to stop. We need to tell everyone all about this – and that is why this book is so important. It’s a tell-all on the food industry in one book that’s super easy to share with your friends and family. You’ll learn how to cut the toxins from your food and improve your health. And now you can listen to the audiobook (narrated by yours truly!) while you’re out running errands or while you’re cooking dinner. Or, pick up the paperback that you can easily pack and read anywhere. It makes an incredible gift too. Feeding You Lies Know anyone who needs to read or listen to Feeding You Lies?

https://foodbabe.com/valentine-candy-showdown-what-to-buy-and-not-to-buy/,Valentine Candy Showdown – What to buy and NOT to buy,0,"Valentine’s Day has always been one of my favorite holidays. I love seeing all the hearts everywhere and it brings back fond memories that I cherished as a child… making cute little valentines for all my friends, and of course, all that candy! One thing I’m not looking forward to though is when my daughter starts going to school and gets offered candy like this to celebrate Valentine’s Day. I wish I could wipe all the candy like this from the earth… But you don’t need to use risky and potentially toxic ingredients to make delicious candy. Of course, candy isn’t supposed to be healthy, but you don’t need to poison yourself (and your kids) just to have fun celebrating a holiday. ❌ ARTIFICIAL COLORS (like Red 40 and Blue 1): Derived from petroleum and linked to several health issues, including allergies and hyperactivity in children, which requires a warning label in Europe. May also be contaminated with carcinogens such as benzidine. (1) ❌ ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS: Artificial flavors are complex chemical mixtures made in a lab using various substances like crude oil or coal tar, and can contain upwards of 100 ingredients (including some recently banned). Food companies don’t need to tell you anything about the ingredients actually in their artificial flavors – they just slap “artificial flavors” on the ingredient label – and we are left in the dark about what we are really eating. (1) ❌ BHT: Risky preservative linked to cancer. Unnecessary and much more heavily regulated in Europe or Australia. (1) Instead of candy, many parents are buying fruit snacks for their children to exchange at school. Unfortunately, the popular brands are not any better than traditional candy… Even organic fruit snacks usually contain added sugar and I consider them candy. Organic fruit snacks are a slightly better candy option because they don’t contain artificial colors and a slew of unnecessary gums and emulsifiers. A much better option to candy would always be organic dried fruit. Quaker Chewy Granola Bars may look like a healthier option to candy with “17 Grams of Whole Grains” and “No High Fructose Corn Syrup” called out on the front of the packaging. But don’t be fooled. They’re still PACKED with refined sugar and corn syrup along with sorbitol, artificial colors (Red 40, Yellow 6), refined soybean oil, and artificial flavors. Luckily for us, not all candy is made with controversial ingredients. There are many choices available that are delicious (and some are actually even nutritious). I plan to indulge in some decadent chocolates on Valentine’s Day – I love it, but I don’t buy the toxic stuff. As a general rule, I like to choose organic food whenever possible, to lessen my exposure to pesticides and artificial additives (2). When it comes to chocolate, the cocoa bean is one of the most heavily sprayed crops in the world, so it’s very important to choose organic chocolate. Organic chocolate is made with organic dairy, which comes from cows raised without hormones, antibiotics, and GMO feed (3). Organic candy also doesn’t contain artificial colors, which are one of the worst additives found in children’s candy (4). I have a big list of Valentine’s candy swaps for you below. If you have little ones in school, many of them come in mini-packs which are great for valentine exchange parties. While these aren’t all perfect in terms of ingredients and not something I recommend eating on a regular basis (it’s candy!)… these options are way, way better than conventional Valentine’s treats, and you can find them at natural foods grocery stores or online (links provided below). If you know anyone who would love these candy swaps, please share this post with them. This Valentine’s Day, I want you to know how much you mean to me and to all of us here at Food Babe. We truly love you so much for being on our team and helping us change the food system. We’ve got a lot in store for you this year that we know you’re going to love. I can’t wait until you see what’s coming. Xo, Vani References:"

Back in the day, I’d pick up some of these fun items as gifts for my friends – but not anymore. I’ve since learned about all the toxins in these products… Beauty products from The Body Shop, Bath & Body Works, and Victoria’s Secret are made with a slew of artificial ingredients that are linked to cancer and other health issues. This also goes for drugstore brands like Bodycology and Dr. Teal’s. Those popular scented lotions and body washes from The Body Shop and Bath & Body Works are dyed with artificial colors made from petroleum, like Yellow #5 and Red #40. These dyes may be contaminated with carcinogens (1) and are readily absorbed by shaven skin (2) where they can go right into your bloodstream (3). The body washes and bath products from Bath & Body Works, The Body Shop, Dr. Teal’s and many others are foamy with the help of the chemicals Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) and/or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS). The ingredient SLES may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane (4), which is linked to cancer (5), and SLS irritates the skin and scalp by stripping away the natural oils that protect it. And SLS becomes even more harmful when combined with the ingredient Triethanolamine (TEA), where it creates the nitrosamine NDELA – a carcinogen (6). You’ll also want to watch out for “PEG-100” or other “PEG” compounds on the label, these can be contaminated (7) with Ethylene Oxide (8) and 1,4 Dioxane (4), which are both linked to cancer. Cosmetic companies don’t tell you what is in these fragrances and they can include highly toxic ingredients (9), hormone disruptors, and carcinogens (10). They also often contain alcohols, which can irritate sensitive skin and make you appear older (Kinda crazy for a “beauty” product, right?) And for years I struggled with rashes and eczema – and came to find out that many of these big-name skincare products were making my problems worse! It’s better to keep your beauty regimen simple and use natural techniques to fight wrinkles, eczema, rosacea, acne, and other skin issues. Your skin is your largest organ. It covers and protects everything on your body and what you put on it, is absorbed into your blood and can affect your overall health. Make sure that the products you are using (and giving to your loved ones as gifts) are safe and made with natural, organic ingredients.

https://foodbabe.com/whats-the-best-way-to-stay-hydrated-and-other-news-you-should-never-believe/,What’s the best way to stay hydrated? (And other news you should never believe),0,"I was instantly suspicious when I saw this recent headline on a major news outlet: “Which drink is best for hydration? Hint: It isn’t water.” They reported the results of a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition which found that milk, soda, and sports drinks are all MORE hydrating than water. Water was ranked down as 10th on the list. (1)(2) I always follow the money trail when reading something that goes against my common sense about food and promotes junk food or sodas as healthy options. As I wrote about in Feeding You Lies, a major way that the Big Food industry fools the public is with shady paid-for science, producing studies that are actually thinly veiled marketing ploys. They’re also really good at manipulating the media into reporting messages that support the processed food industry. To suggest that sodas and sports drinks filled with high fructose syrup, artificial sweeteners, artificial colors, and caramel color linked to cancer are a good choice is outrageous. If anything, these toxic concoctions are destroying your health one sip at a time. I just knew that the soda industry had to be behind such a study that would ridiculously promote that idea that guzzling down Coke and Powerade is a good way to stay hydrated. And it turns out my suspicions were right… Coca-Cola spent £4.86 million setting up the EHI – a group that promotes the consumption of soda and sports drinks. Coca-Cola remains listed as a founding partner on EHI’s website. (3) EHI’s Director, Jane Holdsworth, worked in marketing for the dairy industry and founded her own marketing consulting firm. She counts Coca-Cola, Kellogg’s, Kraft, and Pepsico as previous clients. (3) None other than Rhona Applebaum, former chief health and science officer for Coca-Cola, sits on the Board of Trustees for EHI. (3) Rhona famously retired Coke in 2015 after the New York Times and Associated Press exposed how Coke funded another front group (the Global Energy Balance Network) to fool people into believing sugary drinks don’t cause obesity. (4) The lead researcher in the hydration study had worked hand in hand with the soda industry as well. Ron Maughan was an emeritus professor at Loughborough University, which received almost £1 million from Coca-Cola. (5) He is currently sits as chairman on the EHI’s scientific advisory board. (3) I know it’s frustrating when there is so much conflicting health information being fired at us from all directions. Here are some tips for how to separate the TRUTH from the FICTION in health news: Yes it often takes quite a bit of time and effort to figure out the facts. However, when it comes to your health, it’s absolutely worth it to determine what’s real and what’s not. At the end of the day, it’s nobody else’s responsibility to tell you what’s true. If you know anyone who needs to hear this, please share this post with them.

https://foodbabe.com/truvanis-new-immune-supporting-supplement-is-here-and-its-called-under-the-weather/,Truvani’s new immune-supporting supplement is here!,0,"When I was a kid, my mom used to make a special tea for me whenever I was feeling “under the weather”. It wasn’t like any normal tea that you’d buy at the grocery store. It was more like an elixir because it was filled with many different herbs that she’d pick up from the Indian market. It felt so soothing to drink and always made me feel better. But even though she’d make her tea with all the love in the world, I didn’t truly appreciate it until I started learning about the ingredients in my food. You see, some of the ingredients she used like ginger are remarkable ingredients that have been used for centuries to support overall wellness. This got me thinking… While I’d love to make homemade elixirs with fresh ingredients from the farmers market, I’m a working mom and sometimes I just don’t have the time. It is made with a blend of organic berries, herbs, and roots that support your immune system, which we can all use this time of year! This is important even if you’re eating healthy and getting plenty of exercise and sleep. Because if you’re like me, even with the best intentions things don’t always go according to plan… Work. Travel. Family. Holidays. Weather Changes. These things pull us out of routine, and also take a toll on our immune system. That’s why I take this supplement at the first sign of feeling ‘not myself’ and also during seasonal changes, when I travel, or when life feels extra stressful. Truvani’s Immune Support is like having an abundant garden of botanicals used for centuries in an easy-to-swallow tablet. When you look at the ingredient label, you’ll see how remarkable it is. First, you’ll notice what we DON’T include in the product… You won’t find Synthetic Vitamins, Artificial Flavors, “Natural” Flavors, Artificial Colors or Preservatives. We keep it simple. Second, you’ll notice it’s made with nutrient-dense ingredients… Some companies blend together many different superfoods – and then lace their products with synthetic vitamins and minerals to make it appear more nutrient-dense on the label. These supplements are just a sprinkle of this and a sprinkle of that without enough of anything to be effective. In reality, much of the nutrition doesn’t actually come from the fruits and vegetables in the product… it comes from the synthetic vitamins and minerals that are added to the product. We don’t do that at Truvani. We keep it simple and use nutrient-dense, real food ingredients. We set out to create a properly dosed immune-supporting botanical blend with research-backed ingredients… all in tablet form. It wasn’t easy – but we finally did it. I look forward to hearing what you think."
https://foodbabe.com/6-proven-health-benefits-of-vitamin-d/,6 Proven Health Benefits of Vitamin D,0,"Vitamin D is different from other vitamins in that it actually functions like a hormone in your body. Interestingly enough, nearly every cell in the body has a receptor for vitamin D! (1) It is essential to good health and effects everything from your bones, to your brain, to your heart, to your immune system. It’s been called the “sunshine vitamin” because your body can make it from sunlight! Let’s look at the proven health benefits of Vitamin D that are backed up by research. Vitamin D Promotes Healthy Bones: D3 plays a huge supporting role in the absorption of calcium and other minerals important for bone strength. Vitamin D helps your body regulate and absorb the calcium from your diet, along with maintaining the level of phosphorus in your blood (2). These nutrients are crucial to maintaining the strength and health of your bones. Without vitamin D, much of the calcium that you eat would not be absorbed and would end up being excreted by the kidneys. This is why a lack of vitamin D in the body can lead to poor bone density or osteoporosis in older adults. Supports Healthy Immune System: D3 turns on key peptides in the body responsible for a healthy immune response. Vitamin D regulates the expression of thousands of genes in the body which fire up your immune system into gear to fight bacteria and viruses. Vitamin D induces and antimicrobial peptide gene expression so your body can effectively fight infections (3). Keeping your vitamin D levels in a healthy range has been shown to reduce the risk of contracting the flu, colds, and other respiratory infections (4, 5, 6, 7). In fact, it is theorized that 5,000 IU/day doses of vitamin D may prevent colds and the flu, and higher doses may be helpful in treating full-blown flu patients (8). Vitamin D Supports Healthy Brain Function: D3 supports the growth of new brain cells, playing a big role in brain development and function, as well as, a mood boost. The human brain contains receptors for Vitamin D, many of which are located in areas of the brain that are linked to depression (9). Vitamin D is known to help with the release neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, which relieves feelings of depression. One study of adults who supplemented with high doses of vitamin D (4,000 IU/day) experienced an improvement in their depression symptoms after only 2 months (10). Vitamin D greatly affects brain function as well. Animal studies have shown that Vitamin D supports “neurogenesis” which is the formation of new brain cells (11). Higher vitamin D levels in the body is associated with better short-term and working memory (12), and reduced risk of cognitive impairment that comes with aging or following a stroke (13). Vitamin D regulates the enzymes in the brain that are involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and nerve growth, and research suggests that vitamin D protects the neurons in the brain from damage (14). Vitamin D Maintains Healthy Blood Sugar Levels: D3 maintains healthy blood glucose levels that are already within the normal range. There is an abundance of vitamin D receptors in the cells of the body which regulate blood glucose. One study found that when obese adults (who were at risk for type 2 diabetes, but did not have diabetes) took a daily Vitamin D supplement (2,000 IU), their blood glucose levels and insulin secretion from the pancreas improved (15). This shows a potential for Vitamin D to play a role in slowing down the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes in obese adults. In another study, adults with diabetes supplemented with 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day, after which their fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c, insulin resistance, waist circumference, and body mass index all decreased (16). Vitamin D Supports Respiratory Health: D3 is a breath of fresh air in supporting healthy respiratory and healthy lung function. A lack of Vitamin D can contribute to poor respiratory health and lung function. A 2018 Australian study found that respiratory illnesses (such as asthma and bronchitis) were more common in people with low levels of vitamin D (17). Likewise, the researchers found that those with high levels of vitamin D had better lung function. One study found that patients with COPD improved their respiratory muscle strength and could exercise longer after supplementing with vitamin D (18). Further research shows that vitamin D helps to reduce airway inflammation, which explains why low levels of vitamin D are linked to increased risk of asthma attacks and vitamin D supplementation reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations (19). Vitamin D Promotes Heart Health: D3 doesn’t skip a beat to protect the heart and supports healthy blood vessels and cardiovascular muscles. Heart disease is the #1 killer in America, so this is a very important health benefit of vitamin D. The heart and blood vessels in the body host several vitamin D receptors, which rely on optimal levels of vitamin D to properly function (20). Vitamin D prevents an excessive buildup of proteins that raise blood pressure and stiffen the arteries (21). Studies have found that low levels of vitamin D increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and clogged arteries (22, 23, 24). According to the New England Journal of Medicine that nearly 1 billion people worldwide have insufficient levels of Vitamin D, which can put your health at risk. If the level of vitamin D in your body is too low for an extended period, you may experience muscle weakness, bone loss, and fractures. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes, non-Alzheimer’s dementia, and high blood pressure (25, 26, 27, 28). This is why it is important to keep your vitamin D levels up! Vitamin D deficiency is a big problem, so the question is: How do we get Vitamin D in the first place? Exposing your skin to the sun is widely considered the best way to get your vitamin D. Energy from the sun turns a chemical in your skin into vitamin D3, where it can be used by your body. In order to get enough vitamin D from the sun, you should expose bare skin (arms and legs without sunscreen) to strong sun (UVB rays) for 15-30 minutes a day. However – this is not easy for most of us. Depending on where you live, the weather, and the time of year, you may not be able to get this much quality sunlight on a daily basis. And, if you live above 37 degrees north or below 37 degrees south of the equator, you likely won’t produce any vitamin D from the sun during the winter. This is anyone north of San Francisco and Philadelphia in the U.S. (29). Also if you wear sunscreen or have darker skin tone, you won’t produce as much vitamin D from the sun and it could take much longer. This is also the case for older people. It can be difficult to get enough vitamin D from food alone, as there are not many foods that contain an amount significant enough to give you benefits. Here are the approximate amount of vitamin D that you’ll get from these foods considered good sources: Wild Salmon: One serving of wild salmon (3.5 ounces) provides about 988 IU which makes it one of the best food sources! However, the amount of vitamin D varies greatly per fish and it is very important to choose wild salmon (and not farmed salmon). Farmed salmon only provides a meager 250 IU of vitamin D per serving. Cod Liver Oil: You’ll get about 450 IU per teaspoon. Cod liver oil is also a good source of vitamin A, however it is so high in vitamin A that you need to regulate how much cod liver oil you eat to avoid vitamin A toxicity. This can make it difficult to get enough vitamin D from cod liver oil alone. Egg Yolk (pasture-raised): Conventionally raised egg yolks contain about 18–39 IU of vitamin D each, however, yolks that come from pastured hens can contain 4 times this amount! Still, most people do not eat more than 2 eggs per day, so you would be unlikely to gain enough vitamin D from eggs alone. Canned Light Tuna: Each serving (3.5 ounces) contains about 236 IU of vitamin D. Keep in mind that canned tuna can be high in mercury, so most experts advise eating tuna no more than a few times per month. Fortified foods: These are packaged foods that are fortified (supplemented) with extra vitamin D – but they are almost always heavily processed foods that I wouldn’t recommend eating. Also, the type used is almost always Vitamin D2, which is not the more bioavailable form and not considered by health experts to be suitable for fortification. You’ll often find vitamin D2 added to fortified milks, drinks, and cereals in the U.S. Wild Mushrooms: This is widely considered the best vegan food source of vitamin D, yet they need to be wild grown mushrooms and not the commercial varieties which are often grown inside. Wild mushrooms get their high vitamin D content from sun exposure and can be found at specialty markets and some farmers markets. Wild mushrooms can contain up to 2,300 IU per 3.5 ounce serving (about 1 cup chopped) serving. As you can see, unless you eat a significant amount of eggs, fish, and seafood, you likely aren’t getting the benefits of vitamin D from your diet. Likewise, if you aren’t spending significant time outside in direct sunlight each day, you also are not getting the benefit of the “sunshine vitamin”. This is why vitamin D supplements are so popular and crucial for good health. That being said, not all supplements are created equally. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol): This type is found in wild mushrooms, fortified foods, and some supplements. Vitamin D2 is less effective at raising the level of Vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol): This type is found in oily fish, seafood, egg yolks, and some supplements. This is also the type that your body makes from sunlight. Vitamin D3 is more effective at raising vitamin D levels in the body, so it is the preferred type. When you take vitamin D, it takes time for the level in your body to increase (it may take weeks or months) but it is a fat-soluble vitamin that can be stored in your body for a long time. You can find out the level of Vitamin D in your body by requesting a simple blood test from your doctor. You can also order a vitamin D test kit to check your levels from home. It is generally believed that blood levels of vitamin D that are above 30 ng/ml are sufficient and 50 ng/mL to 70 ng/mL is considered optimal to experience the health benefits (30, 31). You should aim for having your levels checked every 2-3 months to see if you are on the right track. If you know that you are already deficient in Vitamin D (most of us are) then you need to increase your dose until your level is brought up. To maintain already healthy vitamin D levels in the body, the Institute of Medicine recommends 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D daily (10-20 micrograms), however, many health experts believe this amount is far too low, especially if you don’t spend significant time in the sun. It is safe and effective for most people to take a daily vitamin D supplement in the range of 1,000 to 4,000 IU (25 to 100 micrograms). Studies have found daily supplementation of 2,000 IU per day sufficiently raises the vitamin D in the blood to the target of 30 ng/mL of vitamin D (32). If your vitamin D levels do not increase with this dosage, your healthcare provider may recommend a specific dose to meet your needs. It is very, very rare for someone to experience Vitamin D toxicity, which causes dangerously high levels of calcium and phosphates in the blood. This can only happen when someone takes vitamin D supplements in extreme excess, as you can not overdose on vitamin D from sun exposure. There are a handful of toxicity cases in people who have supplemented with very high doses of vitamin D (over 50,000 IU) every day for an extended period of time (33). Research shows that taking up to 10,000 IU/day is safe and does not cause toxicity and most supplements contain far less than this. Yet, it is best to stick with the recommended dosage levels of 1,000 to 4,000 IU per day, as amounts in excess are generally unnecessary. Most people do not experience negative side effects from taking Vitamin D, but like any other vitamin supplement, it’s recommended that you discuss it with your healthcare practitioner. This is especially true if you suffer from health conditions such as kidney problems, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung diseases, or any other chronic condition. If you are taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, they may interact with vitamin D, such as: As mentioned above, one of vitamin D’s great benefits is its ability to help your body absorb calcium. The vitamin K2 steps in to move this calcium to the right places in your body and keeps it out of places that it shouldn’t be – like your arteries. Without K2, excess calcium may get directed to soft tissues where it may be harmful. If you are taking vitamin D in very large doses this may be an issue (34), which is why many experts recommend also taking a vitamin K2 supplement if you are taking a lot of vitamin D. Others argue this isn’t necessary when taking moderate doses of vitamin D. There are some companies marketing Vitamin D supplements with added Vitamin K to prevent the risk of Vitamin D Toxicity, which may lead to calcification and hardening of the arteries. However, according to research, Vitamin D Toxicity has been observed in people who take 60,000 IU of Vitamin D per day over the course of several months. Most supplements fall within the recommended range of only 2,000 IU per day, which is far less than the amount shown to cause issues. Magnesium aids in the activation of vitamin D so it can be used by the body (35). In fact, some experts argue that without magnesium, vitamin D isn’t beneficial. One study found that people who consume a lot of magnesium are less likely to have low vitamin D levels (36). You can get magnesium from good sources like almonds, avocados, spinach, pumpkin seeds, whole grains, cashews, and clean magnesium supplements. At Truvani our #1 priority is ingredients.

And that’s a hard truth to swallow… Because like me, you may do everything in your power to feed yourself healthy food. You might be eating all your veggies and cook meals from scratch with the healthiest ingredients. And it’s all worthwhile, because what goes into our bodies matters. However – if food isn’t properly digested and absorbed, it can lead to some not-so-fun problems like: * Gas and bloating * Heaviness in the stomach * Embarrassing burps * General stomach discomfort * Pieces of undigested food in your stool Our bodies may also have a harder time absorbing important nutrients found in our food. That’s why taking a digestive enzyme before my biggest meal gives me confidence knowing I’m not only absorbing the nutrients my body needs, but I’m feeling the way I should after eating my favorite foods (including healthy ones, like kale!) – energized. Not sluggish and bloated. I have been taking digestive enzymes for the past 8 years, and couldn’t wait to create one that could meet Truvani’s strict ingredient standards… Right now, you can take advantage of our special launch pricing. Compared to other options on the market (made from animals), our enzymes are 100% vegan and grown on plant matter here in the USA. These diverse, plant-based enzymes aid in the digestive process so your body can better absorb and use nutrients from your diet. In a perfect world, we’d have all the enzymes we need in our gut. But there are many factors that can affect our body’s ability to produce enough enzymes… So, even though you eat well and live a healthy lifestyle, your body might not produce enough digestive enzymes. You do A LOT to give you and your family the best quality food… so make sure your bodies are getting the support they need! Xo, Vani"

This is amazing!!! But our work is not done. We are taking on a multi-billion dollar food company, and need all the help we can get. ** IMPORTANT: Please share our petition with everyone you know. Simply hit the social share buttons to share instantly. It takes 2 seconds. We are getting Kellogg’s attention. I made an appearance on Fox46 this morning to discuss how important this petition is and we received an official response. Watch the news clip here: You are joining over 461,618 supporters to make this happen! The truth is that Kellogg’s has made NO PROGRESS. This brings up questions about their real intentions. Why is Kellogg’s creating brand NEW cereals with artificial ingredients if they truly want to remove these chemicals? Kellogg’s makes Froot Loops and Unicorn Cereal in other countries without artificial colors or BHT, so they already have the formula. They know how to do this. Back in 2015 Kellogg’s said that 75% of their cereals were made without artificial colors. Now they are saying that 87% of their cereals are without artificial colors. And they call this “significant progress”? What has Kellogg’s been doing for the last 4 years? Which cereal did they remove artificial colors from? You’ll still find it in their ever-popular Froot Loops and Apple Jacks. And again, they keep churning out new children’s cereals full of them… They refuse to address the preservative BHT in their U.S. cereals. In 2015 Kellogg’s told reporters they were “actively testing natural alternatives” to BHT. So, are they going to remove it like they do in other countries? Does Kellogg’s really intend on dumping the artificial ingredients? They keep saying one thing, but doing another. This is unethical. Don’t you agree? We’ve got to hold Kellogg’s accountable. Artificial colors should NOT be in food – especially in food marketed with cartoons aimed at our children. These dyes require a warning label in other countries because they cause hyperactivity in children. Kellogg’s knows this. This is outrageous! Even if you’re not a parent, or would never ever feed your child Kellogg’s Baby Shark Cereal, your support for this petition is helping others. Not everyone knows what these artificial ingredients are doing to their kids. I get emails like this one all the time… “After being told about your blog by family members, I have completely changed how I shop and feed my family. And have seen improvements in my kids when we’ve cut out food dyes from our diet. I have one son that is borderline ADHD, has classic symptoms, and when he’s had a red Gatorade, for example, he’s off the chart crazy and goes bonkers. It’s insane what is in our food system in the USA, of all places!! It drives me crazy when I talk to moms who’s kids have actually been diagnosed with ADHD and are medicated for it, but they give them colored gatorade or Cheetos or other foods that have food dye in them that are just pouring fuel on the fire and they don’t even know it. So, I gently point them to it because it’s crazy how unaware most consumers are. It makes me sick and I for sure put my money where my mouth is and only shop organic and brands I know are striving for more whole natural foods. Thank you for all you do to push this agenda!! “ – Emily It is time to stop Kellogg’s lies! If you do anything today, please share our petition and help spread the word. You are making a meaningful difference in our world and I can’t thank you enough!"
https://foodbabe.com/tell-kelloggs-to-stop-targeting-kids-with-cereals-full-of-artificial-ingredients-petition/,Tell Kellogg’s To Stop Targeting Kids With Cereals Full of Artificial Ingredients (PETITION),0,"When I first saw Kellogg’s new Baby Shark Cereal my heart sank. My daughter, who is 2 years old, LOVES Baby Shark – and I knew when she saw this she would beg me for a box! Just look at all those artificial ingredients… In 2015, Kellogg’s announced plans to remove artificial colors and artificial flavors from all of their cereals by the end of 2018, and this was widely reported by the media (1). They never did. Kellogg’s uses these five artificial food dyes in their cereals: Red 40, Blue 1, Yellow 6, Yellow 5, and Red 3. Artificial food dyes… In recent months there has been Kellogg’s Peeps Cereal, Kellogg’s Unicorn Cereal, and Kellogg’s Caticorn Cereal… filled with artificial ingredients and BHT. It’s time for Kellogg’s to stop churning out cereals like this. Why should American children needlessly consume these controversial chemicals if Kellogg’s has already figured out how to make their cereals without it? Kellogg’s Unicorn Cereal without Artificial Colors or BHT in Australia: Kellogg’s Froot Loops without Artificial Colors or BHT in Australia and Canada: Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes without BHT in the UK: “With all the reports of pesticides in cereals and what not, today while walking down the cereal aisle looking for my organic oatmeal I came across a cereal that just mortified me, as a parent and a responsible consumer doing my best to shop for better foods for my family I was so disgusted to see a cereal named Unicorn cereal by Kellogg’s. Not only that, but a family with 3 little girls in front of me were struggling to get past that cereal without a breakdown because the girls wanted the pretty unicorn cereal! I took some pics which I will attach and hope that this finds you in some way. It’s so incredibly off putting that a cereal company would do that to families.” ~ Irene Kellogg’s is targeting young children, toddlers even, knowing they will get excited when they see a cartoon-covered box of Baby Shark Cereal at the store, begging their parents to buy it for them. “We know ‘Baby Shark’ is a catchy tune that has captured the hearts of many families… New Kellogg’s Baby Shark cereal was created to expand on the joy families feel in a tasty way.” – Kellogg’s Press Release, July 2019 This is an absolutely disgusting marketing ploy by Kellogg’s to snag in the youngest consumers out there and get them hooked on their products. Kellogg’s packages up Apple Jacks, Froot Loops, and Chocolate Frosted Flakes especially for schools across the country. Millions of children are eating risky artificial additives and BHT for their most important meal of the day. PETITION Dear Steven Cahillane, CEO of Kellogg Company: In 2015, Kellogg’s announced they would remove artificial colors and artificial flavors from their U.S. cereals by the end of 2018. This was widely reported in the media. It is now 2019, and Kellogg’s still sells several cereals with artificial colors such as Froot Loops and Apple Jacks. In addition, Kellogg’s has recently launched new cereals made with artificial colors and/or artificial flavors (Baby Shark, Peeps, Unicorn, and Caticorn). These cereals are directly targeted towards young children and toddlers. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a policy statement in 2018 warning that some chemicals found in food colorings, preservatives, and packaging materials may harm children’s health and best be avoided. Artificial colors have been banned in countries like Norway and Austria and the UK has imposed a voluntary ban. They may be contaminated with carcinogens and cause an increase in hyperactivity in children. Artificial colors add absolutely no nutritional value and are used solely for aesthetic purposes. There are risks that come with artificial flavors as well. A governmental agency does not approve the safety of artificial flavors. Instead, a flavor industry trade group, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA), has assembled their own panel of scientists who review and approve new flavors as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS). These scientists are paid by FEMA (who ultimately get their funding from flavor companies). Public advocacy groups have questioned FEMA’s processes and called on the FDA to ban certain flavor substances that have known links to cancer, but little has been done. In 2019 the FDA banned seven ingredients used to make artificial flavors that have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Any food company using artificial flavors has been given 2 years to remove them from their flavors, so they are still on store shelves. Your children’s cereals are preserved with Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT). BHT is linked to cancer in some animal studies and is an endocrine disruptor that interferes with hormones. Although the FDA has granted it GRAS, BHT simply hasn’t been proven safe and researchers agree that more studies need to be conducted. BHT has been classified as one of the top “Dirty Dozen” food additives to avoid by the respected Environmental Working Group. Kellogg’s sells some of the same cereals (Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, and Unicorn) in other countries with safer ingredients. In Europe and Australia for instance, Kellogg’s takes artificial colors and the risky preservative BHT out of their cereals completely. We deserve the same, safer cereals that other countries get. These unnecessary and potentially harmful ingredients are not in Kellogg’s cereals sold overseas – so they shouldn’t be in ours. The simple fact that you don’t use these ingredients elsewhere is proof that they are not needed. I urge you to remove Artificial Colors, Artificial Flavors, and BHT from all of your cereals here in North America and worldwide. Sincerely, [Your name] Thank you for joining me in signing this petition and spreading the word: SHARE THIS PETITION. We are helping to shape a safer food system for everyone."
https://foodbabe.com/introducing-truvanis-glorious-gut-probiotic-supplement/,Introducing Truvani’s Glorious Gut Probiotic Supplement,0,"I’m a big believer that your overall (mind and body) health starts in the gut. After experiencing a health crisis and changing my diet, I found an incredible health practitioner who recommended I start taking a probiotic. They explained to me that this would help to restore healthy bacteria in my gut, which has a dramatic effect on your overall health. So, I began taking a probiotic – this was the first health supplement I ever took. Now over ten years later, I still take one daily. This one simple change helped support my health more than anything else I tried. After just a few weeks of working on balancing my gut, I started to notice some little things… My mind felt clear. My body felt good. My skin looked fantastic! Since taking a probiotic was a BIG turning point in my health journey, when I co-founded Truvani I knew I had to create one. And I’m not the only one who’s a mega fan of probiotics. It’s been our #1 most requested product since we launched Truvani. But the thing we learned is formulating a great probiotic is no small task. We considered making a probiotic powder, a probiotic tablet, a probiotic drink… and none of them were good enough. And a lot of funny things happen while working with these live strains of bacteria… like when we created a liquid one and it outgrew the container (yikes!) So, I went with my gut (pun intended) and waited until we got our product juuuuust right, and…. In the end we created one awesome probiotic capsule supplement. One that contains 15 incredible strains of healthy bacteria to support a balanced gut. I’m proud to introduce Truvani’s Glorious Gut Probiotic. It’s been a long time in the making… and it’s available today at our special launch pricing! Up until recently, the health of our gut has been largely ignored. But now, researchers are even calling this remarkable system our “2nd brain”, and some doctors have dubbed it “A new clinical frontier”. Thanks to all this research pouring out, we now know that much of our health is controlled by our gut. And it’s one of the reasons why everyone keeps talking about “Gut Health”. Silly health fads can get a little obnoxious… But gut health isn’t a fad. It’s a revolution. Watch this video to see why gut health is so important and how Truvani’s Glorious Gut is the best probiotic on the market: When it comes to probiotics, different bacterial strains have different benefits. So when formulating a probiotic you can choose to include ones that focus specifically on skin health, or immunity support, or digestive health. Well, I wanted one to do it all… So, I put together my DREAM formula. Most brands don’t do this. The cost to create a probiotic with more strains costs more money… and some companies cut strains to cut costs. But here at Truvani we believe in creating the best. We put our customers first, and if you can get all the good stuff in one probiotic, I say we do it. We included 15 properly dosed strains to deliver a wide range of benefits. Some other brands “strain wash” their probiotic. This means the bulk of it only contains 2 or 3 strains, lightly “dusted” with other strains to save money and look better on the label. We don’t take shortcuts at Truvani. All of this is why I can proudly call Glorious Gut the best probiotic on the market. It’s vegan and non-GMO with 15 Strains and 15 Billion CFU’s per capsule. And right now, you can get Glorious Gut at special launch pricing. If you ever thought about trying a probiotic, now’s the time to do it. Gut health is extremely important and I love giving my gut everything it needs to handle the day ahead. It’s going to be a game-changer for you too! Xo, Vani P.S. There is a lot of complicated (sometimes conflicting) medical research about gut health. But really it all comes down to this: Your gut is a garden. It is where the seeds for health and beauty are planted. Probiotics are like fertilizer, they help the good stuff in the gut grow. This keeps our gut strong, so that bad bacteria (kind of like weeds), don’t overtake our beautiful blooming gut flora. Healthy soil makes for beautiful blooms, and a healthy gut makes for beautiful skin and a happy you."
https://foodbabe.com/here-are-the-55-ingredients-in-a-chick-fil-a-sandwich-should-you-eat-them/,Here are the 55 ingredients in a Chick-fil-A Sandwich. Should you eat them?,0,"QUICK LOOK: Read More Investigations Exposing The Food Industry Here I had an early love affair with Chick-fil-A. While in college, I’d eat there at least 3 to 4 times a week, sometimes more. I’d pick up one of their sandwiches on my way back from the gym and thought they were healthy because they were only around 400 calories. If only I knew then what I do now. One of my first restaurant investigations was into Chick-fil-A (about 7 years ago!) That’s when I posted the ingredients in their chicken sandwich on my personal Facebook page and got an intense reaction from my friends and family – everything from horrified to “no one is going to stop me from eating those 100 ingredients of deliciousness….” Ha ha, yeah, I once thought those sandwiches were delicious too. But I finally came to a point in my life where I realized that eating “food” full of artificial additives was making me feel and look horrible. It was not worth it. I went on to write several blog posts about Chick-fil-A during the summer of 2012, exposing the unholy ingredients in the company’s sandwiches from antibiotics, to MSG, to artificial food dyes, to GMOs and TBHQ (1). This eventually got the attention of the executives at Chick-fil-A, and to my surprise they invited me to their headquarters to consult with them on how they could change their ingredients. I came to them prepared with a laundry list of what it would take to improve their food. I tried my hardest to convince them that they’d be surprised by how many people would choose clean, organic chicken sandwiches, if offered. And if Chick-fil-A did make their menu items additive-free, I promised them that I’d rent a cow costume or whatever they wanted and run up and down the street on live TV. That promise still stands! They did some outstanding work in implementing a No Antibiotics Ever policy for their chicken – the #1 suggestion I made to them (2). (UPDATE: On March 22, 2024 Chick-fil-A reversed their “No Antibiotics Ever” policy and now allows for the use of antibiotics in their chicken). They also dropped the TBHQ and high fructose corn syrup – another suggestion I made (3). And then they made a big announcement about dropping artificial dyes from their sauces a few years back (4). Well… Those same artificial dyes are still in the pickles found on nearly every Chick-fil-A sandwich. And there are dozens more health-wrecking additives still in their food. This is the complete list of ingredients in the Chick-fil-A Sandwich – some items appear more than once because they are used in multiple items, like in the chicken, and again in the bun. CHICKEN: 1. Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast Filet – Not organic or pasture-raised, Chick-fil-A’s chicken is raised in large barns where the chickens likely spend little to no time outdoors (5). 2. Salt 3. Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) – What is it that makes Chick-fil-A sandwiches so addicting? This ingredient is the main culprit! MSG is a flavor-enhancer and excitotoxin that excites brain cells to death, increases food cravings, and makes you eat more than you should (6). 4. Sugar – Refined likely from GMO sugar beets. 5. Spices – We asked Chick-fil-A what exactly is in their “spices” in the Chick-fil-A sandwich and they said the spices are: “black pepper, paprika, and mustard” and confirmed that this is the complete list in this sandwich. 6. Paprika CHICKEN COATING: 7. Enriched Bleached Wheat Flour – Heavily processed flour treated with bleach to quickly make it white. It has no nutritional value and is essentially dead food, so they “enrich” it with synthetic vitamins that are not from nature (6). 8. Sugar – Again, likely from GMO sugar beets. 9. Salt 10. Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) – There wasn’t enough MSG added to the chicken itself, so they add it to the coating too. 11. Nonfat Milk 12. Baking Soda 13. Sodium Aluminum Phosphate – Stabilizer additive that contains aluminum, linked to neurological problems, and on EWG’s Dirty Dozen Additive Watch List (9). 14. Monocalcium Phosphate – Rising agent found in baking powder 15. Spice – This ingredient is listed twice in this sandwich. 16. Soybean Oil – One of the most unhealthy vegetable oils, known to increase the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases (6). It’s most likely made from GMO soybeans, which have been shown to contain high levels of residues from the herbicide glyphosate (Monsanto’s Roundup) compared to non-GMO soybeans. Glyphosate was deemed a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO). To extract the oil, the soybeans are typically subjected to intensive chemical refining with toxic hexane, bleach, and deodorizers (6). 17. Color (Paprika) 18. Water 19. Nonfat Milk 20. Egg 21. Fully Refined Peanut Oil – A heavily processed oil that is treated with bleach and deodorizing chemicals. All of the heat and processing that it goes through creates free radicals (10) – which are renegade molecules that damage cells in the body, triggering a host of diseases from liver damage (11) to cancer (12). Peanut oil is also very high in omega-6 fatty acids which promote harmful inflammation in the body. 22. Dimethylpolysiloxane – The main ingredient in Silly Putty is used as an anti-foaming agent in their cooking oil. This substance was also commonly used as a filler fluid in breast implants, which is being phased out due to safety concerns, but supposedly it’s “safe” to eat (6). It also can be preserved by formaldehyde according to the FDA. BUN: 23. Enriched Wheat Flour – Refined wheat flour in which the healthy part of the wheat is removed. The refining process removes most of the fiber, vitamin E, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, and B vitamins from the wheat. Some synthetic vitamins (not from nature) are added back in to “enrich” it (6). 24. Water 25. Sugar – This is the 3rd time refined sugar is added, this time in the bun. There are 5 grams of sugar in the entire sandwich – equivalent to eating about one heaping teaspoon of sugar. 26. Yeast 27. Soybean Oil – The 2nd time this unhealthy oil is found in this sandwich, and it will show up again. 28. Wheat Gluten – This additive is an isolated form of gluten, which is already present in the wheat flour used in the buns. It’s added to improve texture. 29. Salt 30. Cultured Wheat Flour 31. Vinegar – Likely made from GMO corn like most white vinegar in the U.S. 32. Calcium Sulfate – Also known as “plaster of paris”, this ingredient is used in some breads for many reasons, commonly as a dough conditioner/strengthener (13). 33. Monoglycerides – An emulsifier made from oil byproducts including partially hydrogenated canola and soybean oils – which contain artificial trans fat, making this additive a potential source of trans fat. Even trace amounts of trans fat are considered harmful to the heart (6). 34. DATEM – Another potential source of trans-fat, this dough conditioner is usually derived from soybean or canola oil (GMO crops) (6). 35. Calcium Propionate – Considered a safer preservative, but research published in the Journal of Pediatric Child Health links it to “irritability, restlessness, inattention and sleep disturbance in some children” and long term consumption has been shown to damage the stomach lining and induce ulcers (6). 36. Ascorbic/Citric Acid – Although citric acid is naturally found in lemon and other fruits, the additive form is typically derived from mold made with GMO corn. Ascorbic acid is the synthetic form of vitamin C typically derived from corn too. 37. Enzymes 38. Soy Lecithin – Another super processed additive that comes from GMOs. Just like the soybean oil, it’s extracted from GMO soybeans with the neurotoxin hexane (14). 39. Potassium Iodate – This additive is banned from flour in Europe and several more countries as it can negatively affect thyroid function (15) but in the U.S. it can be used as a maturing agent in dough. BUN OIL 40. Soybean Oil – That buttery-looking substance on their buns is not butter at all. Instead of real butter, Chick-Fil-A uses oils that are colored and flavored to taste and look like butter. Unhealthy soybean oil is the main ingredient. 41. Palm Kernel Oil – This semi-solid oil is used by the industry as a trans-fat-free replacement for partially hydrogenated oils (which were recently banned). Unfortunately, not only is it unhealthy for the body, but the cultivation of it is killing orangutans and destroying rainforests (16). This ingredient should be banned. 42. Soy Lecithin – The 2nd time this processed emulsifier is found in this sandwich. 43. Natural Flavor – The only difference between natural and artificial flavors, is that natural flavors are derived from things found in nature. Natural flavors are a proprietary mixture of chemicals and each flavor may contain up to 100 ingredients, including sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol (none of which are labeled) (17). 44. Beta Carotene – A yellow color additive derived either from vegetables or synthesized in a lab from chemicals (18). This makes their “buttery” spread look yellow. PICKLES UPDATE 3/11/22: Chick-fil-A quietly changed their pickles recently. The new pickles do not contain artificial colors (Yellow 5, Blue 1), Alum, or Polysorbate 80. New Pickle Ingredients as of 3/11/22: Cucumbers, Water, Vinegar, Salt, Calcium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate [Preservative], Turmeric Extract [Color], Natural Flavor, Dill Pickle Spice, Beta Carotene [Color], Garlic Emulsion. 45. Cucumbers 46. Water 47. Vinegar 48. Salt 49. Alum – This ingredient used to make the pickles more firm is comprised of aluminum (a neurotoxin) which can build up in your body over time (19). 50. Calcium Chloride – Another additive used to make pickles more firm. 51. Potassium Sorbate –This preservative has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer (20). 52. Natural Flavor – The 2nd time this proprietary ingredient is added to this sandwich. 53. Polysorbate 80 – An emulsifier linked to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems (21). 54. Yellow 5 – Artificial dye derived from petroleum that is linked to allergies and hyperactivity in children. Artificial dyes have been found to be contaminated with carcinogens, such as benzidine (6). This is used to brighten up the color of the pickles, but simple turmeric could be used instead. 55. Blue 1 – One of the worst artificial dyes because it has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. This dye is also linked to hyperactivity and an increased risk of kidney tumors. Some research suggests it is a potential neurotoxin (6). Does Chick-fil-A really need all these risky and artificial ingredients to make one delicious tasting sandwich??? Of course not. Most of these ingredients cut costs and make their food addicting so we keep coming back for more. This all means more money in their pocket, which comes at a great expense of our health if we continue to eat there. When I heard Chick-fil-A say their Mac & Cheese is a “classic” blend of cheddar, Parmesan and Romano… I didn’t believe it for one second. It’s mostly made out of “Pasteurized Processed Cheese Spread” – which is like that cheese in a can. This is NOT real cheese. It’s made by mixing and heating cheese together with colors, emulsifiers, whey, salt and preservatives. This makes a “cheese food” like product that doesn’t separate when heated or get moldy as fast as real cheese. Then they blend this FAKE cheese with FAKE butter… “Margarine”. Margarine is made by heavily processing vegetable oils so that they’re solid at room temperature. Since partially hydrogenated oils were banned by the FDA (due to trans fats that are horrible for the heart) the food industry has found out how to skirt by this issue by blending unhealthy refined oils with “mono- and diglycerides” and palm oil. I can only imagine how many kids are going to be eating this Mac & Cheese along with chicken nuggets. When I examined the ingredients in the Chick-fil-A Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Grilled Cool Wrap, I still found soybean oil, yeast extract (alternative form of MSG), and natural flavors. The chicken on their salads is spiked with MSG, unhealthy refined oils, flavors, and more preservatives. Those colorful chips on top are artificially colored with Red 40 and Blue 1. Why can’t they just use uncolored chips? The cheese comes with a side order of “powdered cellulose” (i.e. wood), which keeps the shredded cheese from sticking together but is also linked to weight gain and digestive problems (22). What COULD be a super healthy menu item – kale and broccoli – is ruined with the addition of yeast extract (a form of MSG), natural flavors, synthetic preservatives, and unhealthy oils (soybean and canola). It even rings in with over 30 ingredients – many of them completely unnecessary. Chick-fil-A really missed the mark here. I’d order their Market Salad without the chicken, nuts, granola, or dressing, as that is where most of the unhealthy ingredients are in this item. Or maybe the Superfood Side without the unhealthy dressing and toppings, which just leaves me with kale and broccoli. But… we both know that’s not going to happen – it’s just as easy for me to just make a salad at home and no one is forcing me to eat there. And, who really wants to go to Chick-fil-A and not have their chicken?!? I figured out how to make a “Chick-fil-A sandwich” at home that tastes exactly the same (even better, seriously!) with none of the nasty preservatives, dyes, and MSG. Ok, yes, it takes a bit more effort than standing in line at Chick-fil-A, but it’s actually pretty simple to make and you can even enjoy it on Sunday! If you know anyone in a serious love affair with Chick-fil-A, please share this blog post with them. Who knows, maybe they’ll surprise you with a deliciously organic homemade “Chick-fil-A” sandwich next time you see them!"
https://foodbabe.com/the-key-to-feeling-happy-isnt-what-you-thought-this-makes-all-the-difference-organic-vitamin-d3/,The key to feeling happy isn’t what you thought. This makes all the difference! (Organic Vitamin D3),0,"Several years ago I worked in a corporate office environment and lived in a city condo. I’d wake up, walk down to the indoor gym in my condo, and then drive from one below-ground parking garage to another. I literally NEVER went outside. Then I’d work all day in a building that had tunnels to get to various lunch spots. The next day I’d do it all over again…again. After awhile I noticed that I just didn’t feel like myself and was starting to feel depressed. I’ve always felt it’s important to trust your intuition and listen to your body. Because if you don’t, who will? So, I went in to get some blood work done and my doctor told me that my vitamin D levels were low. This made perfect sense! You see, exposing yourself to sunlight every day is a primary way to keep your vitamin D levels up. And since I was basically hiding inside all day long, my vitamin D levels to PLUMMETED. Even if you don’t work in an office, this could be happening to you too. Experts say over 1 billion people today don’t get enough vitamin D and if you don’t get enough, you may feel: And since it’s tough to get a good quality Vitamin D supplement in a form that’s easy to take and absorb, we decided it was time for Truvani to step in to help. Watch the video to see how and why Truvani created the best Vitamin D supplement available today: Your body CAN get vitamin D from exposure to sunlight. However, expert’s opinions vary when it comes to how much time you need to spend outside, and how much of your skin needs to be exposed. Other factors like the time of the year, where you live, and the color of your skin also affect how much time you need to spend in the sun to get the D that your body needs. The bottom line is: It’s not as easy as you might think – particularly with more and more of us working indoors and slathering ourselves with sunscreen, which blocks UV rays. But don’t worry, you can get all of the crucial vitamin D that your body needs, by taking Truvani’s Sunshine in a Bottle Organic Vitamin D3 Supplement. Supplementation is the easiest way to get your body the vitamin D that it needs. Truvani’s 100% vegan Vitamin D3 is unlike regular old vitamin D supplements. Ours is created using algae-like plants called lichens. These lichens accumulate D3 as they grow, and gets extracted at the source to ensure maximum freshness and potency. So if you’re living life like I was… Or experiencing any of the symptoms listed above… and perhaps your doctor has even recommended vitamin D… You need a good source of this potent vitamin. With Truvani’s Bottled Sunshine, you’ll experience the benefits of the “sunshine vitamin”, regardless of the weather. Or lack of weather (lol) So, if you’re ready to stop living your life in a fog and ready to brighten up your days… Xo, Vani P.S. Know anyone who might need a little more sunshine in their life?

You don’t even have time to grab a wipe and before you know it, her immune system can’t cope and she ends up getting sick. And then it spreads… I get sick… my husband gets sick… it’s a vicious cycle. When I was sick as a child, my mom would give me orange juice. It’s a great source of vitamin C and good for your immune system, right? Well, not quite. Watch this video to see why orange juice isn’t the best way to get your vitamin C and what we now use instead… Orange juice does have vitamin C, and it can help support our immune system. But, nowadays, most people don’t get Vitamin C from oranges. We fill our bodies with vitamin C supplements made from Synthetic Vitamin C. Isn’t it about time we started thinking about what we get our vitamin C from? First of all, shouldn’t it be REAL? Believe me, you don’t want your vitamins made in a lab. Synthetic vitamin C is made from ascorbic acid, and not only is this form difficult for the body to absorb, it can even upset your stomach. Why feel better in one way and feel awful in another? That’s like curing a headache with a nosebleed. Second, shouldn’t it be STRONG? Most people think oranges have the most vitamin C, when in fact, they are super low on the list. Oranges are like most politicians. A lot of promise. No delivery. Other fruits and vegetables aren’t that much higher, and you’d need to eat A LOT of them to get enough vitamin C. But, there is ONE that’s higher in Vitamin C than them all… The Amla Berry. And after months of research and development, I’m so excited to share with you… Truvani’s Immuno-C: An organic Vitamin C supplement made from organic amla berries. The majority of the top vitamin C supplements on Amazon are synthetic and most “real food” supplements use less expensive ingredients, such as conventional citrus fruits. Truvani’s Immuno-C supplement was created with organic amla berries because they’re the only fruit that can retain their potency through the drying process and deliver the highest concentration of vitamin C. In fact, fresh amla juice contains 20 times as much vitamin C as is present in orange juice. Who knew right? And EVERYONE needs some help in the immune support department… Vitamin C is key for giving yourself a fighting chance against the immune compromising condition known as “daily life”. Xo, Vani P.S. If you know anyone who needs to dump the OJ, please share this with them!"

The ONE thing missing from your health routine!",0,"Back when I was working my high-powered corporate job, I was a mess. I wasn’t eating well. I was full of anxiety and stress. I DEFINITELY wasn’t sleeping well. And I got very irritated by the smallest things too. Actual footage of me screaming into a pillow at night after work… You’ve probably been there too… You know, those times when you’re staring at the computer screen and can’t concentrate. Those times you’re banging your head against the wall, trying to remember something. And how about those times that you get a little too heated while talking to a loved one. We have ALL been there! And, you know where much of this irritability and frustration comes from? Lack of sleep. So what can you do when you find yourself unable to face the day? More Coffee? You’ve already had two cups and are starting to twitch. A Sugary Snack? You don’t need that junk. These solutions only help treat the symptoms and NOT the cause. You’re tired. And a good day begins with GOOD sleep. So why not start there? Prioritizing sleep is how I got out of my funk – and you can too. Watch this to see how I “sleep like a baby”, each and every night: Magnesium is a naturally occurring mineral that is an extremely important nutrient for the human body. In fact, it handles over 300 reactions in your body. Sounds pretty important right? Especially since 70-80% of the American population is deficient in magnesium! Since food has become the massive mono-cultured travesty that it is, our fruits and veggies just don’t have as much magnesium in it as it did for past generations. We also lose magnesium when we sweat and use the bathroom… and a lot of people out there just don’t realize they’re losing magnesium at an alarming rate. Truvani’s Mineral Magic Magnesium is sourced straight from the nutrient dense Dead Sea. Magnesium compounds from the waters of the Dead Sea are of superior quality with significantly low levels of heavy metals lead, arsenic, aluminum, and mercury. Bottom line: It’s got all the stuff you need, and not what you don’t. Truvani’s Mineral Magic Magnesium can help ease anxiousness and quiet all of the swirling thoughts in your head. Imagine being able to erase the extensive to-do list that pops up as soon as you close your eyes. You wouldn’t need a white noise machine, ear plugs, or even a sleep mask. You could just put on your pjs, crawl under your cozy covers, and enjoy hours of uninterrupted sleep. Sure, life may never stop coming at you… But at least you’ll rest as best as you can."

https://foodbabe.com/are-you-a-victim-of-healthwashing-find-out-the-ways-food-companies-trick-you/,Are you a victim of healthwashing? (Find out the ways food companies trick you),0,"When I first started researching ingredients and food over 8 years ago, the industry was so different than it is now… More people are aware of what’s in their food – we’re reading ingredient lists, juicing, taking supplements, and eating more real food. That’s why we’re now seeing a wave of new “healthy” products flooding the market as some food brands are hoping to cash in on the health food movement… But some brands aren’t going about it the right way. You’ve heard of greenwashing, right? That’s when a company makes their product appear more environmentally-friendly than it really is. Well, the same is happening to our food. Health-washing is EVERYWHERE. “Health-washing” is when a food company adds synthetic and processed additives to food to make it appear healthier and more nutrient dense than it actually is. Food companies will also add specific labels to the packaging, which imply a product is healthier than it actually is. They are targeting people like you with these products, people who care about their food and are trying to make the healthiest decisions. Health-washing is getting RAMPANT out there – that’s why you need to know how companies do this so you can protect yourself. Here are 6 ways food brands health-wash their products: 8Greens tells you it’s got “As much Vitamin C as 6 Oranges”… “As much Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid) as 15 cups of Broccoli”… and “As much Vitamin B6 as 6 cups of Spinach”… but actually these nutrients in 8Greens are NOT coming from oranges, broccoli, or spinach. 8Greens adds in synthetic vitamins (i.e. artificial vitamins) that are made in a laboratory. Deceitful right? “The eight greens themselves (spinach, wheatgrass, kale, blue green algae, spirulina, chlorella, barley grass and aloe vera) naturally contain vitamins, but we have added extra vitamins to make sure that 8Greens is a more effective supplement. These are those extra vitamins and minerals that you see added to our formula and listed on the nutrition label. These extra vitamins on the label are synthetic… Any naturally occurring vitamins are not listed and such breakdown isn’t available however our green proprietary blend is 686 mg per tablet.” – 8Greens Customer Support (June 2019) Right on the package it says “Made from Real Greens” but really the majority of the product is coming from synthetic vitamins. How much actual “greens” are you feasibly eating in that small 8Greens pill? You’d be getting a lot more by drinking a green smoothie, I can tell you that much! Products like this make consumers feel like they are getting their daily greens, but in reality, it is just a high-priced synthetic vitamin supplement. Now, you might be thinking this doesn’t matter. All vitamins are healthy, right? Not if they are made in a lab from a variety of questionable sources like coal tar, petroleum and GMOs. Lab-created vitamins differ from their natural counterpart, and thus aren’t often believed to be absorbed by your body as well as naturally present vitamins that you get from whole food and supplements with vitamins derived naturally from whole foods (1). Natural vitamins still contain cofactors that aid in absorption and bioavailability – enzymes, bioflavonoids, minerals, etc. Real food and natural vitamins are always best. Here’s another example… Good Health Veggie Pretzels look like snack-time gold! Right there on the package, they tell you you’re getting the same amount of Vitamin A as 2 ½ cups of broccoli… the Vitamin C in 3 ½ beets… the Vitamin E in 5 tomatoes… the Vitamin B6 in 7 cups spinach… and the Vitamin K in 2 carrots. Wow – sounds like you’ll be eating a ton of produce, huh? Nope. Turns out they are playing the same dirty trick as 8Greens by just adding all those synthetic vitamins in to make it look like you are getting nutrients from real food. MAJOR FAIL. Adding probiotics to a Double Chocolate Muffin full of sugar doesn’t make it better for you. It’s widely known that sugar destroys good gut bacteria (2)… and sugar is literally the first ingredient in these FlapJacked Double Chocolate Mighty Muffins, essentially negating benefits that you might be getting from the probiotics added. The FDA is not regulating how much (if any) actual living probiotics are in products like this (3). Probiotics are fragile living organisms that are typically killed by heat, so the type FlapJacked uses is heat-resistant designed to survive heavy processing (4)… but that doesn’t mean I’m not skeptical that nuking a Mighty Muffin in the microwave on high (their recommended cooking method) isn’t going to kill many of the probiotics. They claim the microwaved muffins have been tested and contain live probiotics. Either way – Wouldn’t you rather get your probiotics from healthy fermented foods and high quality probiotic supplements than from sugary processed muffins? There are much healthier and cost-effective ways to get your probiotics in each day and this is just one way food companies try to “health-ify” junky food. There’s no doubt that organic food is the safest choice and I’m a huge advocate of organic farming. That being said… some organic brands make some really unhealthy products. This is where the organic label can be a bit deceptive. Many people equate “organic” with “healthy” – but that is not always the case. Even worse – I often see the most unhealthy organic products made especially for babies and children. Shouldn’t they be starting out with the healthiest food? If you find yourself assuming organic products are healthy and buying them without reading the ingredients, just remember to repeat after me: The organic label does not mean a product is healthy… Clif Bar Organic ZFruit Strawberry Snack is made with ZERO strawberries (maybe that is what the “Z” stands for? LOL). To illustrate this… a Clif Bar ZFruit (made with apple puree concentrate and juice concentrate) contains 14 grams of sugar and less than 1 gram of fiber. They add in synthetic Vitamin C (ascorbic acid). If you were to eat 1⁄2 cup real strawberries instead, you’d eat only 4 grams of sugar with about 2 grams of fiber – and lots of valuable vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients. This is why whole fruit is best. Stonyfield says YoBaby is “Made with only organic whole milk and the kind of ingredients you would use yourself” – Ummm not true. I wouldn’t add refined white sugar and “natural” flavors to yogurt…especially if I was feeding it to my baby (6). It’s super simple to add “flavor” to plain grass-fed yogurt at home by stirring in some mashed berries or bananas…YUM…and no sugar needed. UPDATE 8/29/19 – I received the following from Stonyfield in response to this investigation: “We saw your recent post regarding natural flavors and organic sugar in our YoBaby Vanilla yogurt and I wanted to send along some additional information for context. All of the natural flavors we use in our products are always derived exclusively from natural sources like spices, fruits or fruit juices, vegetables or vegetable juices, and plants. We choose our suppliers very carefully to make sure that they are as committed as we are to producing natural flavors without the use of any artificial components. Regarding sugar, the sugar we do add is organic sugar, because we never use artificial ingredients and would never use artificial sweeteners – both of which are not allowed with organic as you know. Maybe most importantly, we do offer three lines of baby yogurt that have zero added sugar – our YoBaby Banana Mango, YoBaby Purple Carrot /Sweet Potato, and YoBaby plain. We feel it’s important to offer several flavors and plain, all without added sugar. We care about the amount of sugar that people consume, including in our yogurts. In fact, this is why we reduced sugar across our entire portfolio, starting with our Kids brand in 2017. Stonyfield Kids yogurt has up to 40% less than the leading kids brand of yogurt. You can read more here: https://www.stonyfield.com/organic/healthy/sugar-reduction Ultimately though we offer the choice to the consumer, and offer almost 100 different organic products. And, for those who do want to restrict their sugar intake, we offer plain versions of our nonfat, lowfat, whole milk and Greek yogurt without any added sugar in addition to the YoBaby yogurts I mentioned above. I hope this helps provide a bit more context for you! We greatly respect the work you do to educate consumers around the world about their food choices, and we want to make sure you were up to date with information around our yogurts.” Little Duck Organics Fig Bars are the perfect example of how some organic brands make healthy products, while also making some not so healthy ones. I’ve bought products by Little Duck before, but I wouldn’t buy these. When you look closely at the ingredient list you’ll find 4 types of added sugar before any actual blueberries or kale (Brown Rice Syrup, Dried Cane Juice, Concentrated Apple Juice, Coconut Palm Sugar) along with unhealthy refined canola oil and lots of processed flours/starches (1). You’ve got to wonder how much blueberry and kale are really in these too – I bet it’s negligible. On the other hand, Little Duck also makes “Tiny Fruits” that are simply 100% freeze-dried organic fruit that I buy for my daughter Harley as a little snack to have on trips or when we go out to an event. Taking a super unhealthy product and adding extra protein to it does not transform it into a health food – especially when it’s soy protein isolate. When soy is isolated to just its protein state, it becomes severely denatured and can cause hormonal disruptions because of the excessive amount of estrogen contained in it (1). Soy also contains an abundance of phytic acid, which leaches calcium and other vital minerals from your body. Plus – over 90% of the soy produced in this country is GMO and contaminated with Roundup herbicide. Kellogg’s Special K Protein Cereal is also spiked with refined sugar, fake flavors, and BHT (a preservative linked to cancer)(7) – not a good protein-packed way to begin your mornings. Try a healthy green protein smoothie instead! Protein-infused Protein20 water looks like a health supplement, but it’s sweetened with one of the worst sweeteners out there – Sucralose (aka Splenda). This artificial sweetener is linked to leukemia and other blood cancers in animal studies (1). It’s also been shown that artificial sweeteners like Sucralose are doing little to help people lose weight and are actually linked to weight gain (1). The type of protein in these is another popular protein supplement – conventional whey protein isolate – which is highly processed. Most whey protein isolates start from ultra-pasteurized “Monsanto Milk” raised on GMOs, antibiotics, and other drugs. This milk is then exposed to acid processing, which strips out alkalizing minerals and naturally occurring vitamins and lipids. This processing makes whey protein isolate overly acidifying in the body. And, chronically consuming whey protein isolate without appropriate balance of alkalizing foods can acidify your body, which over time can increase your vulnerability to degenerative disease. Despite that big strawberry on the cup, there is not one strawberry in there. “Two Good” yogurt by Dannon is extra processed to remove natural sugars in the milk and then flavored and colored to look and taste like there is fruit in it – but it’s all fake. They also add thickeners (tapioca starch, gellan gum) to replace some texture lost from all that processing. Natural flavors used to make it taste like fruit are not actually “natural” at all (6). These fake flavors are made in a lab to mimic the taste of fruit and are designed to keep you coming back to eat more. As explained by flavor manufacturer Nature’s Flavors, “The trick to making a product taste good is to give the customer only enough flavor to tease their taste buds. You never want to completely satisfy their tastes” (8). Do you really want to eat fake flavors that were manufactured to keep you unsatisfied and wanting more, or would you rather just eat real fruit and all the nutrients that come with it? Sara Lee and BFree say their products are good sources of fiber, but they add cellulose to artificially pump up the fiber content. The type of cellulose that food companies typically use is made from wood. Cellulose is much cheaper to obtain from wood than fruits and vegetables, and is manipulated in a laboratory to form different structures (liquid, powder, etc) depending upon the food product it is used in (9). According to the Center For Science In The Public Interest, cellulose is a cheap way to boost the fiber content on food labels, but it isn’t as healthful as fiber that comes from natural foods (10). Recent research links this additive to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems (11). Get your fiber from whole grains, fruits & veggies instead. We’re not gonna add probiotics to sugary snacks… We’re not gonna add protein to junk food… We’re not gonna add fake vitamins to chips… We’re not gonna add wood to bread… We’re not gonna use the tricks that Big Food uses to pull one over on you.

(I use mine every day!),0,"You may have heard some of the public outcry to ban plastic straws. Well, there’s definitely something to it… In America alone, we use over 500 million plastic straws each day. That’s A LOT of waste. Plus these straws are made using potentially toxic petrochemicals. One study showed that a third of the tested plastic products released toxic substances. And it gets worse. These toxins leached out of the plastic samples when exposed to organic substances. In other words, the toxins come out when contacting our food. And if you’re like me… You DO NOT want to use anything toxic in your food. Or home. Fortunately, the world is moving away from plastic straws. In fact, California has become the first state to outright ban plastic straws from restaurants. That’s a BIG win. So, what other options do we have? Well, some restaurant chains are offering paper straws… but have you ever used a paper straw? THEY’RE HORRIBLE! They seemingly disintegrate in liquid. Then, there are these collapsible metal straws. They seem like an O.K choice… Until you realize that option it’s VERY difficult to ensure cleanliness (due to the opaque metal, you can’t see inside easily). Then you have my favorite option: A sleek, modern, glass straw. I love these because they are see-through, which makes checking cleanliness a breeze (They also come with a handy cleaning brush). And they’re surprisingly sturdy… Harley uses them to drink her green smoothies too! I use one each morning when I drink water with fresh squeezed lemon and cayenne pepper. I also like using them in smoothies because it’s wider than a normal straw, which makes drinking thicker beverages a breeze. Each time I use mine it puts a smile on my face knowing I’m not ingesting toxins or other nasty pollutants. Plus, it’s a great feeling to begin each day with an environmentally-conscious choice. This is one of the reasons why we offer these remarkable smoothie straws at Truvani… and today we’re offering a special deal on them."

And it’s not just the pollen in the air making us feel bad… These substances lead to headaches, poor sleep, hormone imbalances, lethargy, and have been linked to a greater risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and cancer. Your air quality may be affecting your health right under your nose. Take this short quiz below to find out. Do you… One place that I can control the quality of my air is in my home. I use a high quality air purifier (made by my partner Intellipure). Ever since I started using it I’ve slept better and don’t suffer from seasonal allergies – even during this pollenpocalypse! The Intellipure is the most effective air purifier on the market. Here’s why I love it: As I always want to share with you what works for me, my team was able to negotiate a special deal just for the Food Babe Army: Even if I’m eating the purest, most organic food in the world and drinking the cleanest filtered water around, I know that the air I breathe is just as important! If I wouldn’t drink unfiltered water, why would I breathe unfiltered air? If you can’t get an Intellipure right now, other ways you can protect the air around you is to thoroughly dust surfaces in your home with a damp cloth, mop floors, and vacuum often. Also get some indoor plants, which help to purify the air. I hope that we all get some relief from all of this pollen soon!

https://foodbabe.com/is-hormel-is-scamming-people-with-their-100-natural-deli-meat/,Scam alert…You could be eating SPAM meat,0,"Think back to the last time you were grocery shopping for meat. What labels did you look for? Are those 100% natural, hormone-free, antibiotic-free, and nitrate-free meats really the best choice or are you being SCAMMED? Unfortunately a lot of people are getting totally scammed… Food companies are legally allowed to put misleading labels on their products to fool customers. To see how screwed up regulations are when it comes to meat labels, look no further than a recent lawsuit against Hormel. They got sued by the Animal Legal Defense Fund who alleged the advertising for Hormel’s Natural Choice Deli Meats was misleading consumers (1). They argued that Hormel advertises this deli meat as “100% Natural” but raises the meat in factory farms with risky drugs and antibiotics. That is FAR from natural, right? Hormel shouldn’t be allowed to advertise this meat as “natural”, right? Actually they can. Last week, the court dropped the lawsuit (Hormel won!) because they found that the claims they are making about their deli meat, such as “100% Natural” are legally approved by the USDA (in other words, our government allows it) – so Hormel is free to use these terms in both their advertising and packaging even though this meat is raised on antibiotics and growth-promoting drugs in a factory farm (2). A big surprise in court filings revealed that the pork used to make Hormel’s Natural Choice Ham Deli Meat is the same pork they use to make SPAM (3). This pork is raised in inhumane large-scale factory farms where the pigs dine on GMO grains laced with growth-promoting drugs to bulk them up on less food (which bulks up Hormel’s profits too). Insane, right? How could this be? It’s shocking because of the way Hormel advertises this deli meat. They even call it the “NATURAL CHOICE” right there in the name! Products like this disgust me because they are preying on consumers who are trying to feed their families healthy food but don’t know that food companies are allowed to use labels that are not really truthful. To see how Hormel has been able to scam so many people into believing their Natural Choice deli meat is a healthy choice, let’s look closely at the labels on this package… “100% Natural”: Companies can call their meat “Natural” if it has no artificial ingredients and is minimally processed. Natural meat is often raised in the same horrible factory farm conditions that conventional meat is – with antibiotics, hormones, ractopamine, GMO feed, etc. This is why it’s perfectly legal for Hormel to call their meat natural – but that doesn’t mean it’s ethical for them to do so! Remember this applies to fresh meat too (not just deli meats). “Pork Raised Without Added Hormones”: This label infuriates me. Why? Because pork farmers are not allowed to use hormones – it is prohibited (4). This means that all pork and ham are raised without added hormones (the same goes for chicken & turkey). So, why does Hormel add this label to their pork and turkey? It is 100% pure marketing B.S. They know that the average customer sees this as a sign that their meat is somehow raised better, but it literally means NOTHING. They do use hormones to raise their beef as regulations allow this, and this is why you won’t find this label on Hormel’s Natural Choice Deli Roast Beef. The lawsuit revealed that some of Hormel’s pigs are raised with the growth-promoting drug ractopamine (5). This drug is BANNED in Europe, Russia, and China and causes pigs to suffer from “hyperactivity, trembling, broken limbs, inability to walk and death” (6). Using ractopamine is just as bad, if not worse, than growth hormones… so don’t be fooled! “No Nitrates or Nitrites Added”: This is misleading because technically nitrates are added. You see, Hormel doesn’t add synthetic sodium nitrate or nitrite like you’ll find in most deli meats – which is good because these additives are linked to cancer and heart disease (7). Instead they use cultured celery powder and cherry powder, which are both naturally high in nitrates (8). There is controversy surrounding whether naturally-derived nitrates are any safer for you when added processed meat, because they may still create cancerous nitrosamines (9). Some “natural” processed meat products with celery powder have been shown to contain very high levels of nitrates – even more than conventional varieties (10). “No Preservatives”: Hormel does use cultured celery powder and cherry powder to preserve the meat, so I wouldn’t consider this preservative-free. Some brands to try: Kol Foods Oven Roasted Turkey, Organic Nuna, Organic Valley Turkey or Roast Beef, and True Story Organic Turkey. Yes, these organic deli meats may cost more than conventional deli meats raised in factory farms. But rather than judge the value of food in terms of dollars, think of its value in terms of nutrition – and your health. The only way factory farm practices will change is when enough people refuse to buy meat that was raised this way. If you know anyone who might be buying Hormel’s Natural Choice deli meats and blindly believing the lies on the package – please share this post with them."

I ran myself ragged – traveling to events, doing interviews, meeting new people. It was all “part of the job,” and it was for a good cause, but the truth was, after a few months, I got burned out. This time around, I knew better. When I released my second book, worked “recovery” time into my schedule. And let me tell you… I feel great. Our life is not a sprint. It’s a marathon. …but this whole idea of Recovery got me thinking: How many people push themselves to the limit and burn themselves out? I talked to a few friends and it felt like it was almost everyone. We push ourselves to our max… and stay at the max… until we can no longer lift one more finger. It’s unhealthy. It’s unrewarding. And there has to be a better way. So, at Truvani, we put together something called “The Truvani Recovery Bundle.” The best part?

https://foodbabe.com/they-just-banned-this-chemical-in-europe-but-its-still-used-on-american-food/,"They just banned this chemical in Europe, but it’s still used on American food.",0,"Have you ever traveled to Europe and noticed how different their food is compared to America? I’ve had friends tell me… “I can eat bread only when I’m in France” “I lost 10 pounds eating whatever I wanted while in Europe, but came home and gained it right back”. Our food is filled with things not on the label… like pesticides, hormones, and drugs that aren’t in the food in Europe. Why is their food so much better? Europe takes a precautionary approach towards food safety (1). This means they are proactive in banning chemicals that MIGHT harm people. The U.S. takes the opposite approach. It does not ban chemicals from our food supply until they have been PROVEN dangerous – which can take a very long time because it’s filled with industry influence or people have to start dying from long term exposure – as was the case with trans fats (2). This makes Americans literally the lab rats while the food and chemical industries rake in the profits at the expense of our health. They banned it after a scientific review found it possibly causes DNA damage (which can lead to cancer) and also to steep declines in bumblebees. This fungicide is used on wheat and barley crops, as well as some fruits and vegetables. The USDA has found residues primarily on cucumbers, celery, summer squash, peaches, and berries in recent years (wheat and barley haven’t been tested for chlorothalonil) (4). The good news? This fungicide is NOT used on organic crops and the USDA hasn’t found residues of it on organic foods tested (4). In my latest book, Feeding You Lies, I show you simple ways to avoid the chemical onslaught on our food, despite all of the lies on product pages like “natural”, “healthy”, and “diet”.

https://foodbabe.com/food-labels-are-lying-to-you-spot-these-lies-on-the-package/,Food Labels Are LYING To You. Spot These Lies On The Package!,0,"Imagine the following scenario… You’re grocery shopping and trying to find a safe cooking oil. You’ve been cleaning up your diet and want something healthy to saute all those veggies you’ve been eating. Since you’ve read my investigations, you know that canola, soybean, and other processed oils are out because they are ridiculously bad for you. You see a shelf lined with cooking sprays like PAM, and recall hearing that those aren’t healthy for you either, until you see this one… It says simply “100% Extra Virgin Olive Oil” right there on the front of the can. 100% means 100%, right? So you think, “Bam! This is perfect! It contains just 100% olive oil without any nasty unhealthy additives”. Smucker’s (the maker of Crisco) has been sued for misleading the public into believing this cooking spray contains 100% Extra Virgin Olive Oil – because it simply isn’t true (1). This cooking spray actually contains Soy Lecithin, Dimethyl Silicone, and Propellant, which could be found discreetly listed on the ingredient label on the back of the can (which the average consumer doesn’t look at): Soy Lecithin: This emulsifying additive is “produced by degumming crude soy oil extracted from soy flakes with hexane” (2). Hexane is the neurotoxin (3) that comes from gasoline production. It’s possible that some hexane remains in the finished product (4) and almost all toxicology research on hexane focuses on the industrial use and inhalation of hexane, so no one knows exactly how dangerous eating it is – but it surely isn’t healthy. Dimethyl Silicone: This silicone ingredient is commonly used in lubricants and hydraulic fluids (2). Again, not much research has been done on what happens when we actually eat it. Propellant: This is used to propel the spray from the can, but it’s not simply compressed air. According to the lawsuit, the ingredient is “Propane and Isobutane, substances that are classified as ‘Hazardous Ingredients’ by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration” and Crisco is “violating state and federal law by refraining from disclosing the common or usual name” of these ingredients on the packaging (2). In other words, even the ingredient label is lying to you. This just goes to show how far they were willing to go to mislead customers and didn’t change until they were caught and sued. It’s just so outrageous because when a product says that it’s 100% of something, don’t you think it should really be 100%? I could go on. I can’t count how many times I’ve been shopping and found a product with a marketing claim on the front of the package that was so misleading that it was hardly true. If you know anyone who might be swindled by lies like these, please share this post with them. People need to know the truth."
https://foodbabe.com/the-ultimate-guide-on-how-to-avoid-roundup-weed-killer-in-your-food/,The Ultimate Guide On How To Avoid Roundup Weed Killer In Your Food,0,"The other day I got an email from another concerned mom, “What are we supposed to eat when all of our food is contaminated with Roundup??!!!” She had just heard the news… Earlier this week, a federal jury unanimously determined Roundup weed killer is responsible for causing cancer (1). In this case, Edwin Hardeman claimed Roundup exposure caused his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and the jury has yet to award damages. This follows an earlier case in which Monsanto was ordered to pay $78.5 million in damages to a California man after a jury found them liable for failing to warn that Roundup causes cancer (2). Despite the risk – Roundup is the most widely used herbicide in the world. It continues to be used on food crops, parks, playgrounds, and by homeowners everywhere. It is now so rampant in our environment that it has been found in honey, cereals, meat, drinking water, breast milk, infant formula, chips, cookies, crackers, oatmeal… the list goes on. So, it’s pretty scary when you realize you are probably eating Roundup every day. Most Americans are. You’ve likely seen news headlines like these… “Roundup Weed Killer Chemical Found in Cheerios and Quaker Oats, Researchers Say” “Carcinogenic pesticide found in Ben & Jerry’s ice cream” “Weedkiller found in granola and crackers, internal FDA emails show” “Oat cereals, snack bars test positive for trace amounts of weed killer in Roundup” “FDA Finds Monsanto’s Weed Killer In U.S. Honey” “Cheerios, Kellogg’s Corn Flakes and Doritos among products found to contain GM crops WEEDKILLER that has possible link to cancer” “Monsanto’s Roundup Found in 75% of Air and Rain Samples” “FDA Tests Confirm Oatmeal, Baby Foods Contain Residues of Monsanto Weed Killer” “Traces Of Weed Killer Linked To Cancer Found In 95% Of Wine And Beer” It’s maddening to find out Roundup weed killer was found in your daughter’s favorite cereal, your baby’s food, and in the ice cream you like to treat yourself with on Saturday nights. I dedicated an entire chapter to this subject in my latest book, Feeding You Lies, because this has become a major issue. In this chapter I explain how this happened, what foods we know are contaminated, and how to protect yourself. Thankfully, there are ways to greatly reduce your exposure to Roundup, and I summarized my top strategies for you below. You’ve probably heard organic food contains Roundup too, which is so disheartening. This is true to some extent, but has been overblown. I have gotten SO MANY emails about this, so I think you’ll be happy to hear that it’s not as bad as you may have heard. For example, in 2018 the Environmental Working Group (EWG) tested popular oatmeal products for glyphosate and did not find ANY detectible levels in most of the organic products tested (3). Nature’s Path Organic Granola, Kashi Heart to Heart Organic Honey Toasted Cereal, Cascadian Farm Organic Harvest Berry Bars, 365 Organic Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats, and Simple Truth Organic Instant Oatmeal all came out clean (3). In contrast, the EWG found glyphosate in EVERY non-organic product they tested. They detected glyphosate in only two organic brands – Nature’s Path Organic Old Fashioned Oats (at 30 ppb) and Bob’s Red Mill Organic Old Fashioned Rolled Oats (at 20 ppb) – which is negligible compared to how much glyphosate they found non-organic brands like Quaker Old Fashioned Oats (at 1300 ppb). EWG’s child-protective health benchmark for daily exposure to glyphosate in food is 160 ppb – and the organic foods all fall well below this range (3). As you know, I don’t preach “the dose makes the poison” mantra, as I believe any amount of Roundup of our food is TOO MUCH – but based on the evidence I’ve seen so far, it looks like the vast majority of whole organic foods are not contaminated. So, if you know anyone who is worried about all the Roundup being found in our food, please share this post with them. Isn’t it good to know there are ways for us to protect ourselves from this cancerous chemical?"

My new book Feeding You Lies is an INSTANT bestseller despite the opposition. The publisher of my first book passed on publishing it, I had another publisher back out of offering me a deal because they were concerned the information would affect their “ad accounts”. The book was rejected by some major retailers. The mainstream media ghosted us – This happened over and over again. A journalist would reach out, write an article, and their editors would get cold feet – and it would hit the chopping block without getting published. Or a big show like Dr. Oz would put in an urgent request – their producer would be so excited to have me on and promote the book, then suddenly I’d get a message like this in my inbox – “Unfortunately, I just received word that we are taking the segment in a different direction so I will no longer need you for the 2/26 show” But none of this matters. This book is reaching people because it shares the TRUTH about our food – information that has never been shared before and it’s going to change the world.

https://foodbabe.com/food-in-america-compared-to-the-u-k-why-is-it-so-different/,Food in America compared to the U.K. (Why is it so different?),0,"Want to know what really opened up my eyes to how food companies exploit us? I spent years investigating the differences between European and American food products, and what I found disgusted me. A college buddy of mine decided to go live in London for a few years. While she was there, I often had her go to Tesco and other European grocery stores to take pictures of the ingredient lists for me and send me boxes of products. I’d compare them with the same brand of American products side-by-side and saw completely different ingredient lists. Companies like Kraft-Heinz, Kellogg’s, PepsiCo, and Quaker sell safer, better products oversees while making inferior versions to sell to Americans. The evidence of this runs the gamut from fast food places to boxed cake mix to cereal to candy and even oatmeal— you can’t escape it. This is what set me down the path of advocating for change in the food system and I’ve never looked back. Let’s start with McDonald’s French Fries. They make their iconic french fries in the U.K. with a few simple ingredients: potatoes, oil, dextrose, salt—but in the U.S they’re made with “natural beef flavor” and sodium acid pyrophosphate, and are fried in oil laced with the anti-foaming agent dimethylpolysiloxane – the main ingredient in silly putty (1). They’ve somehow figured out how to cook their fries without all these extra ingredients overseas, so why not here? Did you know Quaker Oats Strawberries & Cream has ZERO strawberries? In the U.S. Quaker mimics the look and taste of real strawberries by using “Flavored and Colored Fruit Pieces” comprised of dehydrated apples, artificial strawberry flavor, citric acid, and the artificial dye Red 40. It’s a total scam! Meanwhile in the U.K. Quaker doesn’t even attempt to sell that garbage and doesn’t make any products like this. The closest counterpart they have is a product called “Oat So Simple” that has REAL strawberries in it—light years ahead of the popular U.S. version made with artificial dyes and artificial flavors. Pick up a bottle of Mountain Dew in the U.K. and you’ll find that it gets its bright yellow color simply from beta carotene (a natural color derived from carrots and other plants). Meanwhile, PepsiCo sells a very different version of Mountain Dew in America. Here in the States, instead of using natural colors to give it a tantalizing look, Mountain Dew is artificially colored with a petroleum-based dye called Yellow #5. Although artificial dyes are common in America, that doesn’t make them okay to eat. They’ve been linked to several health issues and may be contaminated with carcinogens (2). They certainly are not as safe as beta carotene. And it gets worse… The U.S. version of Mountain Dew contains brominated vegetable oil (BVO) – which is an ingredient BANNED in Europe (3). Way back in 2014, PepsiCo announced they would remove BVO from all of their American drinks following a successful petition by activist Sarah Kavanagh (4). But they still have not removed BVO from Mountain Dew, nearly 5 years later. Meanwhile, they continue to sell BVO-free Mountain Dew in other countries. You know what you’ll find in almost every restaurant in America? Heinz Tomato Ketchup. Heinz ketchup is GMO-free in the U.K. (5) but full of GMOs and High Fructose Corn Syrup in the U.S., along with lab-produced “natural flavoring” that helps create an addiction to their product (6). Think of this next time you’re dipping your fries in and can’t stop! While Heinz makes a “Simply Heinz” version of ketchup in the U.S. (still with natural flavors but a cleaner ingredient list), why don’t they just make this their regular ketchup? There is no need for the heavily processed version that you’ll find in most restaurants and homes in America. Both versions of Doritos are horrible, but American Doritos are covered in artificial dyes made from petroleum (Red #40, Blue #1, and Yellow #5). These dyes have been found to be contaminated with carcinogens, such as benzidine (2) In the U.K., these dyes require a warning label that says “May Have an Adverse Effect on Activity and Attention in Children” (7). No one wants to put that on their product! That’s why they don’t use artificial dyes in Doritos overseas and instead color Doritos more simply with paprika extract and annatto. The Doritos in the U.K. are also non-GMO, while the American versions are made with GMO corn contaminated with glyphosate weed killer (8). At first glance the ingredients in Frosted Flakes in the U.S. and U.K. look nearly identical. The main difference is the addition of the preservative BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) in the U.S. version. Controversial research links BHT to cancer (9) and it’s believed to be an endocrine disruptor that interferes with your hormones (10) BHT isn’t permitted in cereals in Europe, so Kellogg’s reformulated their cereals to sell them legally overseas. Following our 2015 petition to get BHT out of American cereal (11) Kellogg’s removed BHT from several brands (like Rice Krispies), but still use it 4 years later in Frosted Flakes despite selling it BHT-free in the U.K. I’ll tell you why. Europe takes a “precautionary principle” approach towards food additives that are potentially risky. They ban or add warning labels to these additives for their citizens. The U.S. takes the opposite approach. It does not remove additives from our food supply until they have been proven dangerous – which can take a very long time and a lot of red tape. This means Americans are literally the lab rats. The U.S. government allows food companies to largely police itself, deciding which ingredients, chemicals, and additives are “safe” to use in their products (12). This clearly isn’t a wise approach – is it? If a company can get away with using cheaper ingredients, they will. Given a choice, they’ll always opt for the cheaper flavor enhancer, and the cheaper color additive, and the cheaper preservative, and the cheaper GMO ingredient, even if these cheaper alternatives have a negative impact on our health. I dedicated an entire chapter in my latest book, Feeding You Lies, to this subject because there is so much more you need to know! The food industry doesn’t care about your health, so you really need to. It is now available in bookstores everywhere. Feeding You Lies Please share this post with all of your friends.

https://foodbabe.com/watch-listen-how-the-food-industry-is-lying-to-us-and-what-to-do-about-it/,WATCH & LISTEN: How the food industry is lying to us (and what to do about it!),0,"The last few weeks have been a whirlwind! My daughter turned 2, and then we flew across the country to California to promote my new book Feeding You Lies, had a huge launch party here in Charlotte, was on the cover of a magazine, had a road trip to welcome a new baby nephew and do a talk/book signing in Charleston, SC, and have been on what feels like a million interviews. These interviews and events have been crucial in getting the word out about how the food industry is lying to us and what we can do about it. The more people listen to them and share – the more we have the chance to change the world. So that’s why I am sharing some of my favorites here today… If you want to know what makes me tick, why I became a food activist, and how I REALLY eat – grab some (organic) popcorn and listen in! And, I’d love to know your thoughts and questions – leave them in the comments below. Can you guess what I had to practically sneak on the plane on my way to this interview? It’s a pretty funny story. I had a blast sitting down with Shawn to talk about my latest project too. There’s something simple I ask myself before I sit down to eat… I share it all with Lewis Howes. Seeing myself on the cover of a magazine is a strange feeling! In this interview I discuss my journey to health, how I started blogging, and some of the ways that the food industry dupes us. Best Self is offering Food Babe readers a free 1-year subscription on their mobile app. I sat down with Lauryn and Michael to discuss what’s happening to food these days – and we had so much fun! After you listen in, let me know if you’d still eat McDonalds 😉 Dhru Purohit and I discuss how the media, big food, academia, and “trusted” sources silence activists like myself and how they are being exposed in my new book. I also walk you through exactly what I eat on a daily basis (and what my daughter eats too!) It might surprise you how simple it is. We discuss how the non-GMO label isn’t all that it seems and how the food industry has made us believe that it’s complicated to eat healthy. Thankfully, it’s easier than it looks! I had a great time sitting down with Kate Northrup and Mike Watts to discuss what’s going on behind the scenes in the food industry and why I had to write Feeding You Lies. I absolutely loved this interview with Danny Zederman on the Armchair Nutritionist Podcast. We talked about tricky food labels, how the food industry dupes us into buying junk food, and my honest thoughts on the Keto diet. In this interview with Ben Greenfield Fitness we discuss a new study that found eating phosphate additives (like the preservative sodium phosphate) can decrease your endurance and cardiovascular fitness level. You’ll find these additives in many fast foods like Taco Bell and McDonald’s, and processed food from the grocery store. The good news is it’s easy to spot on an ingredient list.

https://foodbabe.com/breaking-roundup-found-in-beer-wine-samples-see-the-brands/,BREAKING: Roundup found in beer & wine samples (See the brands),0,"We all know that alcoholic drinks are not a health food – and alcohol itself is linked to cancer. But, these new findings are just further evidence that this hazardous weed killer is ending up in almost everything that we eat and drink. How much weed killer are we each eating every day? Breaking new tests conducted by the consumer interest group U.S. PIRG finds that many popular beer and wine brands are contaminated with – glyphosate (the main ingredient in Roundup). Roundup is the most widely used weed killer in the world. In 2015, the World Health Organization’s cancer arm declared glyphosate a probable human carcinogen. Last year Monsanto lost a HUGE lawsuit filed by a California man with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma – the jury decided that Roundup caused his cancer and awarded him millions. This was the first of thousands of lawsuits filed. The wine brands that tested positive for glyphosate are Beringer, Barefoot, Sutter Home, Inkarri Estates (organic), and Frey (organic). Sutter Home wine rang in with the most glyphosate at 51 ppb (parts per billion). The wines that came out with the least amount of Roundup were both organic – Inkarri Estates Malbec Organic (5.3 ppb) and Frey Organic Natural White Blend (4.8 ppb). (Source: U.S. PIRG report) The beer brands that tested positive for glyphosate are Budweiser, Coors Light, Miller Lite, Sam Adams, Samuel Smith (organic), New Belgium, Corona, Heineken, Guinness, Stella Artois (beer and cider), Ace Perry, Sierra Nevada, and Tsingtao. The beer with the most glyphosate was Tsingtao at 49.7 ppb, followed by Coors Light, Miller Lite, Budweiser and Corona. (Source: U.S. PIRG report) I was a bit surprised seeing Samuel Smith’s organic beer coming up with some glyphosate in it. It’s worth noting that the organic beer and organic wine had the LOWEST amount on the list. This is because glyphosate is prohibited to be used on organic crops – and glyphosate in them is the result of contamination through water, rainwater, or drift from nearby crops. It wasn’t directly applied to their crops if they are certified organic. Organic winery Frey Vineyards told USA Today that they do not use herbicides and “glyphosate in trace amounts is now found in rainwater because of its application to conventionally farmed agricultural land. Glyphosate in trace amounts can be found in many food products across the United States. We urge consumers to speak up to ban all use of glyphosate.“ The one brand tested by U.S. PIRG that had no detectible glyphosate was Peak Organic brand beer. Even though Roundup is strongly linked to cancer, Roundup has NOT been banned. It continues to be used on food crops, parks, playgrounds, and by homeowners everywhere. Glyphosate is sprayed on 80% of crops in this country and is now so rampant in our environment that it’s found in honey, cereals, meat, drinking water, breast milk, infant formula, chips, cookies, air samples… the list goes on. Just remember this… Monsanto/Bayer has tried to hide the dangers of Roundup from the public and regulators for years. Monsanto has colluded with regulators at the EPA – and the “safe levels” for glyphosate in our food were raised by the EPA at the request of Monsanto. Are we supposed to trust Monsanto that these levels are safe? If there is Roundup in everything that you eat and drink today, are you still consuming a “safe” level? Critics say that scientists disagree with my work and that we should trust them because they are the real experts. They branded me “pseudoscience” because I avoid GMOs and conventional foods grown with glyphosate. The truth is: Science is always evolving. It’s not always “settled” and it is riddled with industry corruption. Just look at what Big Tobacco has done during the last 80 years, as they tried to hide the grave dangers of cigarette smoking from the public. Monsanto’s playbook is the same and they use many of the same tactics. Roundup is the new tobacco. Internal emails published in Feeding You Lies show how many of these critics received money from Monsanto and Bayer. These companies enlist experts to spin the story on glyphosate and lie to the public about its dangers. They also enlist experts to discredit activists like myself who are telling the truth about their products. It’s disgusting. If you want to know the TRUTH about how to avoid Roundup in your food and who is LYING about its dangers – you need to read Feeding You Lies! Pick up your copy today at these bookstores.

https://foodbabe.com/fda-banned-ingredients-linked-to-cancer-but-they-are-still-all-over-shelves/,FDA banned ingredients linked to cancer – but they are still all over shelves,0,"I went into a news stand at the airport with my 2-year old daughter trying to occupy her for a moment before our flight. The next thing you know, she was playing with the packages of M&Ms, Skittles, and Twix – just going back and forth, admiring all the colorful packages. They were all lined up at her eye level and I can only imagine how captivating they looked. She’s two, you know? Then I said to her, “Hey, I just want to let you know, these things are yucky, and these are things that Mom is teaching people about. The ingredients in them are not good for your body.” She just kind of looked at me, and goes, “Yucky?” And I go, “Yup, yucky.” Now anytime we see those candies… guess what she says? The food industry doesn’t want people to know the truth. They want you to believe everything in stores is “safe” to eat… But the safety of our food system is a lie. There are products (many marketed towards children) on store shelves right now with ingredients that have been banned by the FDA… and no one is doing anything to prevent it. Please share this information with those that you love, here’s what’s happening… The FDA recently banned 7 ingredients used to make “artificial flavors” that have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals (1-2). These ingredients were originally approved in 1964, so have been in our food for decades. This ban would have never happened if it wasn’t for the FDA petition and lawsuit filed by several consumer protection organizations who put persistent pressure on the FDA to take action (3-4). The banned ingredients are benzophenone, ethyl acrylate, eugenyl methyl ether, myrcene, pulegone, pyridine, and styrene* – but you won’t see them on an ingredient label So any product that lists artificial flavors as an ingredient may contain them, but food manufacturers are not required to tell you. Artificial flavors are complex chemical mixtures made in a lab using various substances like crude oil or coal tar, and can contain upwards of 100 ingredients (including those just banned). Food companies don’t need to tell you anything about the ingredients actually in their artificial flavors – they just slap “artificial flavors” on the ingredient label – and we are left in the dark about what we are really eating. Any food company using artificial flavors has been notified of the 7 ingredients banned, but the FDA has given them TWO YEARS to remove them from their artificial flavors. The FDA and the industry trade group representing these companies has refused to disclose which companies use the banned flavors. And there haven’t been any companies voluntarily telling the public either, because they are not required to. In other words – if you see “artificial flavors” on an ingredient label, it could contain these banned cancerous substances and food companies are not going to warn you. Up until October 9, 2020 this is perfectly legal! This is what’s wrong with our food system. Food companies are allowed to continue selling you products with ingredients known to cause cancer in animal studies – without any warning. It’s so outrageous. The FDA doesn’t care either. In their statement about the banned flavors they said,”rigorous scientific analysis has determined that they do not pose a risk to public health under the conditions of their intended use. The synthetic flavoring substances that are the subject of this petition are typically used in foods available in the U.S. marketplace in very small amounts and their use results in very low levels of exposure and low risk.” Should we have cancerous ingredients in our food in any amount? Why take that risk? What about children, who may be more susceptible to these substances? How much are we really eating if we eat multiple products with artificial flavors each day? This is not being addressed. This is why I wrote my new book, Feeding You Lies. You can’t trust food companies or government agencies to care about our health. .ctfont{ font-family: 'Crimson Pro', serif; } .pre-order-now { color: #e81f31; font-weight: bold; } .claim-your-bonus-link { text-decoration: underline; color: red !important; } .preorder-button{ max-height:52px; } .preorder-button:hover, .submit-button:hover { -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(2px 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)); -ms-filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Dropshadow(OffX=2, OffY=2, Color='#444')""; filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Dropshadow(OffX=2, OffY=2, Color='#444')""; } .preorder-button.dark-bg:hover{ -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(2px 2px 2px rgba(255,255,255,0.2)); -ms-filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Dropshadow(OffX=2, OffY=2, Color='#444')""; filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Dropshadow(OffX=2, OffY=2, Color='#444')""; } .block-font { font-style: normal; font-weight: 700; } Feeding You Lies As soon as I learned that the FDA banned these ingredients, I started investigating which food brands were using artificial flavors… Doritos, Cheetos, Jell-O, Oreos, Trix, and Lucky Charms are all spiked with them. But there is one food corporation that I noticed as a BIG offender. They admitted they’re in the process of removing the banned ingredients from their artificial flavors. This means, yes, these ingredients shown to cause cancer in animals have been used in their products. They are complying with FDA regulations requiring companies to remove them within 2 years. Our next question was… What products are these in? Are these banned ingredients in M&Ms? What about Snickers? Skittles? Eclipse Gum? Here’s the kicker. They refused to tell us. Their reasoning is that they didn’t want to give us inaccurate information because they are in the process of removing them. We then asked how long they anticipate it will take, and they simply said “as fast as possible”. How fast this is, is anyone’s guess. Remember, the FDA has given food companies two years to stop making products with these flavors – so this does not include products already on store shelves, vending machines, or in your own house. As candy and gum has a very long shelf life, it is likely that even after two years some of the products with these banned ingredients will still be on shelves. Since they won’t, you might want to err on the side of caution and just avoid ALL of their products with artificial flavors. And that isn’t the only reason to avoid these products – as they are filled with other risky additives like artificial dyes (5) and BHT (6)… The best way to change the food industry is with a grassroots movement. This is why I’ve done petitions – they are quick and effective at making people aware as to what is really in the food they’re buying. This is also why I recommend voting with your dollars by refusing to buy products from companies who are poisoning us for profit with cheap and dangerous ingredients. How you choose to spend your money is VERY powerful. On the other hand, expecting our government agencies (like the FDA and the USDA) to take action often takes decades of intense pressure. Consumer advocacy groups spent YEARS pushing the FDA to take action on these carcinogenic flavors – and even had to file a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Appeals (4) to force them to do anything. We cannot rely on the FDA to protect us. And we certainly can’t trust Big Food to self-police. After all, the food industry has consistently shown that it will only remove dangerous and unhealthy ingredients when they are forced to do so.

https://foodbabe.com/why-ingredients-in-beer-matter-and-what-beer-companies-arent-telling-you/,Why Ingredients in Beer Matter – And What Beer Companies Aren’t Telling You,0,"I was having a blast watching the Super Bowl last weekend… and it had NOTHING to do with the game! Bud Light started advertising that they have No Corn Syrup in their beer, and texts like this kept rolling in… You see, we launched the petition that started the conversation about beer ingredients and why they matter. And now, Bud Light is spending millions of dollars on a marketing campaign to tell us that corn syrup isn’t in their beer – but there is SO MUCH MORE to this story. A little over 4 years ago I was sitting at Anheuser-Busch headquarters trying to convince their executives to develop an organic beer. At the time they told me they had tried one in the past, but it didn’t sell. Stone Mill Organic Pale Ale was the first one they produced many years ago, but they took it off the market… The original organic beer as seen at the Anheuser-Busch headquarters Well, so much has changed since then, and not only did they end up coming out with an organic Michelob Ultra Pure Gold beer, but they advertised it during the Super Bowl! I couldn’t have been more happy to see that. I remember sitting in their board room, wondering if my arguments for an organic beer were convincing enough or just falling on deaf ears. Meeting with executives at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, MO I’ve been investigating the ingredients in alcohol for the last 6 years and dedicated an entire chapter (chapter 7!) to it in my first book. The ingredients in beer are not required by law to be listed anywhere on the label and manufacturers have no legal obligation to disclose the ingredients. The beer industry is regulated by the U.S. Treasury Department (the people who collect taxes) instead of the FDA like most other food and beverages. This is why we know more about what’s in a can of Coke than what’s in our beer. Since beer companies aren’t required to tell us their ingredients, I knew I needed to investigate this for myself and what I found shocked me. I grew concerned after discovering there is a long list of additives the government has approved for use that beer companies don’t need to tell you about… corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, stabilizers linked to intestinal inflammation, artificial colors, caramel coloring, and genetically modified ingredients, to name a few. I knew people wanted to know more about what was in their beer (especially since my husband loves beer), so I launched a petition in 2014 asking the two biggest beer manufacturers in the world (Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors) to publish their ingredients online (1). The response was HUGE. Within the first 24 hours the petition received 43,000 signatures and Anheuser-Busch publicly agreed to publish the list of ingredients online (2). MillerCoors quickly followed. The petition we started in 2014 Thanks to the work of the Food Babe Army, we made history that day. And that’s when Anheuser-Busch invited me to St. Louis to see how their beer was made. Behind the scenes at Anheuser-Busch If you watched the Super Bowl, you likely saw Bud Light’s ads about how they don’t use corn syrup in their beer. They also threw Miller Light and Coors Light under the bus for using corn syrup in their beer…Which is completely true. I LOVE how they played the part of “Food Babe Army” in listing out the ingredients for everyone to see in these flyers. But as I wrote about in my first book, Bud Light actually never used corn syrup in their beer, so I found that misleading. Anheuser-Busch (the parent company for Bud Light) is insinuating that just because one product is “clean”, all of their other products are a better choice, when that couldn’t be further from the truth. They are using the same ingredients as Miller Light and Coors Light in some of their other beers. Bud Light spent millions of dollars on a marketing campaign to tell us that corn syrup isn’t in their beer, but other beers by Anheuser-Busch still use it. And this didn’t go unnoticed by their competition. During the SuperBowl, MillerCoors called them out online for putting high fructose corn syrup in some of their beers… The battle is brewing between Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors. And while it’s great to see them open up the conversation around beer ingredients and transparency, it would have been better to see Anheuser-Busch remove all corn syrup from their beers before making a such a spectacle. You’ll find corn syrup in several of their most popular beers like Rolling Rock, Kokanee, and Busch beer… When MillerCoors first published their ingredients online following our 2014 petition, they did not list “corn syrup” as an ingredient (3). While the media was eating up the story, they simply reported the ingredients in Coors Light and Miller Light as “water, barley malt, corn, yeast, and hops” (4). More recent updates to their website shows the ingredients as this… Coors Light: Water, Barley Malt, Corn Syrup (Dextrose), Yeast, Hop Extract Miller Light: Water, Barley Malt, Corn Syrup (Dextrose), Yeast, Hops and Hop Extract Was MillerCoors not telling the whole truth about their ingredients 4 years ago or did they recently add corn syrup and hop extracts? Corn syrup isn’t typically used as a sweetener in beer, rather it’s used as a cheap sugar which ferments. The reason why you wouldn’t want to drink beer made with corn or corn syrup is because almost all corn is genetically modified (GMO)(5) and if you don’t want to support GMOs, Monsanto/Bayer, and the chemical companies who are poisoning our food and environment with Roundup herbicides linked to cancer (6) – you don’t want beer produced with GMOs. Beer is traditionally brewed with malted barley, a non-GMO grain (7), and not corn. Hop Extract: Rather than using whole hops or hop pellets, beer companies use a chemically altered hop extract to add bitterness while reducing the amount of actual hops in the beer. This is a cheaper way to produce beer. Caramel Color: This brown coloring is used to make some beers appear darker. It’s manufactured by heating ammonia and sulfites under high pressure, which creates carcinogenic compounds. Newcastle removed this from their beers in 2015 (8) after we called them out for this. It appears Stella Artois (by Anheuser Busch) also no longer contains caramel coloring, as we had reported finding it listed as an ingredient on an overseas website in 2014 (3). It is CRAZY that Anheuser-Busch would base an entire multi-million dollar campaign on ONE product that doesn’t have corn syrup or hop extract – while their other products still use these ingredients. Bud Light VP Andy Goeler was quoted as saying “While ingredient labels are not required, consumers deserve to know more about their beer. We brew Bud Light with the finest ingredients and we’re happy to proudly display them on our packaging. When people walk through a store, they are used to seeing ingredient labels on products in every aisle, except for the beer, wine and spirits aisle. As the lead brand in the category, we believe increasing on-pack transparency will benefit the entire beer category and provide our consumers with the information they expect to see.” (9) It’s just common sense. Don’t bash other products that use corn syrup and hop extract when you are doing the exact same thing. Either clean up your beers or don’t. I hope Anheuser-Busch learns from this and realizes this is not the way to win customers. We are smarter than that. In just two short weeks my new book hits shelves and I’m so excited for you to read it. It is very eye opening. In Feeding You Lies, I delve deep into the lies that food and beverage companies tell us to get us to keep buying their products. My hope is that it will change the food industry again, by encouraging them to use more transparent practices and improve their products. We need all hands on deck, Food Babe Army! Pre-order a copy below to be one of the first to read it and be part of our movement pushing the industry to do better. Feeding You Lies It’s amazing how the seeds we planted to change the terrible lack of transparency in the beer industry are now bearing fruit. You are an amazing force Food Babe Army! Thank you for continuing to spread the word and demand the truth about what we are eating and drinking. If you know anyone who loves to drink beer (I’m sure you do!)

https://foodbabe.com/heres-4-examples-of-fake-health-news-and-how-to-spot-it/,4 Examples of Fake Health News – And How To Spot It.,0,"How many times have you read a new study promoting the benefits of things that you love to consume- whether it be candy, chocolate, or diet soda? It’s so comforting to see that some of these foods could have benefits to your health, right? Well don’t get too excited – because it’s all a BIG SCAM by the food industry. Here’s what’s really happening behind these “studies” and fake health news… When I read the CBS News headline—“Does candy keep kids from getting fat?”—I went nuts. If this were true, it would be a shocking scientific finding, especially since it would contradict decades of research into the hazards of sugar (and also contradict common sense!). The study that inspired this ridiculous headline was funded by a candy trade association that represents the makers of Snickers, Skittles, Butterfinger, and other big candy brands (15). Their research was based on government surveys that asked people to recall what they had eaten in the past 24 hours. The problem with this methodology is that people often don’t remember what they ate, which is what led the researchers to admit that their data “may not reflect usual intake” and that the study was “thin and clearly padded” (16). Translation: the results were bogus and a perfect example of how the news media is used by the food industry to fool us into thinking candy is ok for our kids. The purpose of the study isn’t to convince us that candy is healthy, but rather, make us less concerned about its affects on our kids so we keep buying it. A small milk brand – Fifth Quarter Fresh – paid the University of Maryland to study their “high protein” chocolate milk and it’s apparent ability to help athletes recover from concussions. Their chocolate milk was also atrociously high in sugar – 42 grams per serving – making it very unhealthy by any estimation (17). Emails show that Fifth Quarter Fresh coincided the release of their findings with the release of the Will Smith movie Concussion to help boost publicity for the study (18). After the seemingly positive results were announced to the public, some school districts were clamoring for their sugar-laden chocolate milk. One superintendent announced that he planned on buying $25,000 worth of their chocolate milk for his athletes (19)… YIKES. The study was suspect because the actual study findings weren’t made available, the results were preliminary and not peer reviewed. Thankfully, the university conducted an internal investigation, disavowed the study, and returned the research funds to Fifth Quarter (20). Anyone who ever says diet sodas are better than water clearly hasn’t looked into their ingredients. A small 3-month study funded by the American Beverage Association (a Coca-Cola and Pepsi lobbying group) found that participants who drank diet soda lost more weight than people who just drank water. This contradicts numerous other studies that show artificial sweeteners in diet drinks cause people to crave sugar, suffer from increased food cravings, and gain weight (21-27). Soda companies love to use short-term studies like this that don’t show the overall health or weight impact of what happens to people who are drinking diet soda long term consuming risky artificial sweeteners that are linked to leukemia and other cancers (28-29). When I was growing up there was one staple that my family ate to celebrate countless birthdays: Pepperidge Farm Golden Layer Cake. It came out of the freezer section in a white box. I remember struggling to wait while it thawed on the counter. I always begged for a second piece. One thing we didn’t know then is that it was filled with Partially Hydrogenated Oil – an ingredient that has now been banned by the FDA because it’s very harmful to the heart (1). You may know this as the stuff that made up margarine and Crisco shortening. That oily goo was a staple in the processed food industry, and basically, if you ate anything processed in the last few decades, you were eating this substance. “Partially hydrogenated oil” is made in a factory by taking a liquid vegetable oil (like the soybean and cottonseed oil that Pepperidge Farm used in their cake) and transforming it into a semi-solid by adding hydrogen to it. The food industry LOVED to use this heavily processed, solidified oil because it was CHEAP… much cheaper than using real butter and allowed them to create foods with a really long shelf life… But they had a problem… Buzz started generating in the 1950’s that it was giving people heart attacks (2). As the years went on, more and more research backed up the harmful effects of partially hydrogenated oils on the heart (3)(4). Yet the FDA turned a blind eye and allowed it in our food for DECADES. Why, you ask? Big Food companies (Kraft and Procter & Gamble) hired scientists to SPIN THE SCIENCE and hide the dangers of partially hydrogenated oils so that the industry could keep using this cheap ingredient (5). Besides squelching worries that partially hydrogenated oils (particularly the trans fats they contain) were bad for the heart, they took it even FURTHER, and were successful in convincing almost everyone that partially hydrogenated oils were HEALTHY (6). Any scientist who tried to state otherwise couldn’t get research funding or they were ridiculed and smeared by their peers so that their research would be viewed negatively (7-8). With the FDA’s blessing, the industry went on to market margarine as GOOD for your heart… and fooled sooooo many people (my own family included!) Maybe you remember seeing ads like this? Thankfully, there were some good nutrition researchers who pressed on the truth and eventually forced the FDA to ban these heart-wrecking partially hydrogenated oils – but it took over 60 years and a lawsuit! (9-10) They did it once, and they can do it again. During that time, researcher Walter Willett theorized that 30,000 people were killed each year from trans fat consumption (11). That is 30,000 people (EACH YEAR) whose lives could have been saved had the FDA done its job and banned partially hydrogenated oils decades ago. We’re talking nearly 2 million people here. I also believe the Big Food industry should not be paying scientists to defend their products. It’s absolutely shameful and people need to know the truth behind these tactics. What’s interesting is that most researchers who take dollars from food and chemical companies do not believe that it will affect their research (12). They flat-out will say that where the money comes from will not change the results of a study. But this is NOT TRUE (13). Marion Nestle, a nutrition professor from NYU, demonstrated this well. She cataloged 168 studies which were either directly funded by the food industry or done by researchers who had food industry connections. She found that 156 out of the 168 studies (93%) of them had results that were favorable to their industry sponsors (14). That’s a lot more than by just chance I’d say! Industry-funded researchers may not consciously realize that they are biased, but the data shows that $$$$ from industry = results that help the industry. Many studies might seem convincing, but are thinly veiled marketing ploys that undermine our health. If a headline seems too good to be true… it probably is. Especially if it favors a heavily processed food industry product! Unfortunately, the food industry isn’t going to stop paying for science to promote their products any time soon. So, please, SHARE THIS POST and spread the word about this practice. Warn your friends to pay close attention to who is funding the “science” they are using to make their food decisions."

https://foodbabe.com/the-video-i-was-afraid-to-show-you/,The video I was afraid to show you,0,"I didn’t want to share this video with you, because every time I think about it, it’s too painful to relive. And quite honestly, I didn’t want to deal with the backlash that I knew I’d get… but now it’s time. In this video below, I’m talking to over 3000 people at the World Domination Summit in Portland, Oregon. It is the first time that I publicly express my reaction to the industry onslaught against my character. After we successfully influenced several multi-billion dollar corporations to change for the better, I became a target – and it was unlike anything I’d ever experienced in my life. Although this was a very exciting time for us and I was overjoyed with the response to our campaigns rippling throughout the food industry – it came with a cost. The personal attacks became so vicious, that at one point I almost stopped what I was doing, but realized I NEED to continue. Now three years later, I am feeling much stronger. I’ve worked through why and who was behind these attacks. I uncovered compelling evidence showing how certain critics were connected to and were taking money from the food and chemical industries. I also uncovered how the industry will stop at nothing to keep their unhealthy products on the market, even if it means lying repeatedly to the public. I couldn’t allow them to silence me. This is why I wrote my newest book, Feeding You Lies. I’m sharing the video of my talk now, because I’m starting a new chapter – and I’d love for you to see how far we have come. WATCH MY TALK HERE (Warning – graphic language): Feeding You Lies is not like any other health or diet book. You can learn more about the book here. I’ll just say that certain individuals and companies do NOT want their lies to be published and that’s why I know this book is going to really open me up to attacks again. And, this will not be easy for me. That’s why I really need your support right now, and the best way is to order a copy here today. Feeding You Lies If you’ve already read the book, THANK YOU. Please share this post with your friends! The best way to make Big Food’s lies less effective is to show people the TRUTH – and that is what this book does. I’m counting on you to get this book into the hands of everyone you know. Were you surprised by anything I said in this talk? How do you deal with “haters”? Tell me in the comments below!"
https://foodbabe.com/emails-reveal-coca-colas-shocking-plot-to-take-us-down/,Emails Reveal: Coca-Cola’s Shocking Plot To Take Us Down,0,"While working on my new book last year, I received a STARTLING email from U.S. Right To Know. They had obtained an internal email from Coca-Cola… and when I read it, I was shocked. Right there in black in white, I read how Coca-Cola tried to lobby the FDA against us, the Food Babe Army. In the months following our successful campaigns to get “yoga mat” out of Subway, the artificial dyes out of Kraft Mac & Cheese, and the caramel coloring out of Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte, Coca-Cola took aim at our ability to convince major food companies to change. You see, we were hurting their bottom line, and they wanted to put that to a halt. As I read through Coca-Cola’s correspondence I couldn’t believe the lengths they had gone to try to stop our movement. An email proposal was sent to the head of the FDA, written by none other than Alex Malaspina. Alex is a former senior vice president at Coca-Cola who founded the front group International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) way back in the 70’s (1). This front group still operates today, funded by Coca-Cola, Nestlé, McDonald’s, Pepsico, and other processed food and chemical companies (2). Notice how Alex greets FDA head Michael Taylor in his email… “Dear Mike: How are you? I hope with the summer you have slowed down a little; Our friend Mat Echols, whom you met at our breakfast is asking, as per his email, if you would have an interest in becoming involved in this most important debate. i assume that, if your time would allow you, you will try to consider this task as this would be so important in FDA bringing good science to the table and as a result help people make the proper choices in such critical health issues. If you are interested, and could do it, please contact Mat directly to obtain all the details. Many, many thanks. Warmest personal regards. Your Friend. Alex” Pretty interesting to see that “friend” Alex Malaspina, Mat Echols (a senior vice-president at Coca-Cola), and the head of the FDA had been breaking bread together. Makes you wonder if they’ve worked together in the past, doesn’t it? Sure sounds like they have a close relationship. And, there’s more. The email thread included a FDA Roundtable proposal written by Coca-Cola… “Recent events—the vaccine scare in California, investigations by AMA and others into Dr. Oz, criticism of the Food Babe’s misuse of science and pledges by food service establishments and companies to remove ingredients in response to ‘consumer pressure’—have created a window of opportunity to drive an important message about the pervasiveness of pseudo-science and the unintended consequences it creates among consumers who now fear perfectly safe and beneficial products.” Hah. I’ve heard many outlandish things from Big Food companies, but I never thought I’d hear someone defend soda as “beneficial.” And, this is what they wanted the FDA to do… “POSSIBLE EXECUTION: FDA chairs a roundtable discussion on “Junk Science Reporting and its Unintended Consequences on Consumer Confidence, Consumer Choice and Public Policy. FDA convenes experts from a variety disciplines from nutrition policy, food science/academia, healthcare and journalism. During the discussion the experts will examine case studies where junk science is driving media attention, corporate action and consumer decision-making. They will look at how this information is communicated, its effectiveness in raising concern among consumers and how it could be addressed in the future to prevent alarmism and risks to consumer health and wellbeing.” Risks to consumer health and wellbeing? Isn’t removing risky additives linked to cancer and other health issues helping consumer health and wellbeing? Who’s really risking consumer health here? Could it be that Coca-Cola’s PROFITS were at risk because of all the caramel coloring and additives they use in their products? I’m not the first person to be targeted by Big Soda… and I certainly won’t be the last. They will try every tactic under the sun to trick the public into buying their unhealthy products, and that includes infiltrating our government agencies. When the food industry can’t get people to trust them, they use front groups to help weasel their way in. And ILSI (that front group partially funded by Coca-Cola mentioned above) has been successful at this… A new report published in The BMJ and The Journal of Public Health Policy document that ILSI has huge influence in China (3). So much in fact, that ILSI operates from inside the government’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing. Pretty crazy. What’s most ludicrous is that ILSI is supposedly “fighting” the obesity epidemic in China… organizing obesity conferences and paying scientists to attend these events. They’ve launched public health campaigns heavily promoting the idea that obesity is caused by a lack of exercise – and not from drinking sugary sodas and processed food. Anything to make sure people keep loading up their grocery carts up with Coke, right? You may remember that Coca-Cola tried the same tactics here in the U.S. and it backfired BIG TIME when they were caught secretly funding a nonprofit group called the Global Energy Balance Network. Emails obtained by the Associated Press and U.S. Right To Know outlined how “the group would use social media and run a political-style campaign to counter the ‘shrill rhetoric’ of ‘public health extremists’ who want to tax or limit foods they deem unhealthy” and “quickly establish itself as the place the media goes to for comment on any obesity issue.” (4) The group disbanded and Coca-Cola’s chief health and science officer retired after the scandal broke. (5) They might have been caught then – but we both know they are going to try another tactic. And another. And then, another. This is the reason why I wrote my book Feeding You Lies. Not only are the food companies using front groups to feed us lies in the U.S., but they are doing it across the globe. It’s happening everywhere and they won’t stop until they are exposed. There’s more to this story too. I have so much more to share and put all of the information you need to know in Feeding You Lies. Just like the tobacco industry lied to us about the dangers of cigarettes, the same untruths, cover-ups, and deceptive practices are occurring in the food industry. It’s more important than ever that people know about this. Feeding You Lies is written for you – it’s a tell-all on the food industry in one book that’s super easy to share with your friends and family. Feeding You Lies I hope you pre-order a copy of the book today so you can be one of the very first people to read it! Plus, when you pre-order before it’s released on February 19th, you’ll get an incredible bonus (I can’t wait to tell you all about it next week!) And for all of you who have already pre-ordered, thank you SO MUCH for your love and support. Make sure you claim your bonus too! I can’t wait for you to receive the book and share its important message with your loved ones. We can change the world one person at a time. Please take a second to hit share on this post and spread the word about this book."
https://foodbabe.com/what-are-the-healthiest-non-dairy-milks-to-drink/,What Are The Healthiest Non-Dairy Milks To Drink?,0,"The other day I was ordering an organic smoothie at a local shop and as I watched her put the kale into the blender and grab a carton of almond milk, I stopped her just in time… Right before she poured the milk into the blender I asked, “Would you mind if I read the ingredients on that?” She handed me the carton, and, wouldn’t ya know it… The almond milk was filled with all kinds of crazy ingredients that I’d never use in my smoothies at home… So I simply asked, “Can you use water instead?” I personally eat very little dairy and usually opt for nut milks to make smoothies and recipes. Almond, coconut, and cashew milks are great alternatives to dairy – but I don’t buy the majority of popular brands at the store, like Silk, So Delicious, or Almond Breeze. Here’s why… Common ingredients to avoid in dairy-free milk: Added sugars: Eating too much sugar (which is easy to do, because it’s in almost every processed food) leads to obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer (1) – but its detrimental effects can take years to surface. There is no reason to add sugar to milk and we all could use a little less sugar in our life! Some brands have sweetened and unsweetened versions – so always choose the latter. Guilty brands: Silk Original, Almond Breeze, Califia Farms (non-organic), Ripple Original, Milkadamia Original, Pearl Organic Soymilk. Natural flavors: Natural Flavor is practically the exact same thing as Artificial Flavor, but it’s derived from substances found in nature (plants, animals, etc). Chemists create these complex formulations in a lab, isolating and blending specific flavors extracted from upwards of hundreds of compounds, some of which may be GMOs. These compounds can come from substances that are nowhere close to the actual thing. For example, they might take some castoreum from a beaver (2) to make a flavoring that resembles vanilla – without ever using any vanilla beans. But, hey, it’s “natural” because it’s from a beaver! Common additives in flavors include: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol (none are required to be labeled by the FDA). Natural flavors are a complete mystery ingredient and completely unnecessary (3). Guilty brands: Silk, Almond Breeze Vanilla, Califia Farms (non-organic), Ripple, So Delicious, Milkadamia, Pacific Foods Almond, Simple Truth Coconut Milk, Westsoy Vanilla Soymilk, Pearl Organic Soymilk. Carrageenan & Gums: Carrageenan is linked to intestinal inflammation and cancer (4). Since so much awareness has been raised about the risks of consuming carrageenan, a lot of brands have removed it (yay!) but – they often end up replacing it with gums to thicken the milk, like gellan gum and guar gum. In my opinion, these are safer than carrageenan, but not really something I want to consume often – as they’re linked to bloating and gas (and again, simply unnecessary) (5). Guilty brands: Pacific Rice Milk Original, Simple Truth Coconut Milk, Pearl Organic Soymilk. I get this question a lot. I personally don’t drink soy and rice milks. Here’s why – Soy can cause hormonal disruptions because it has estrogen-mimicking properties. Soy also has an abundance of phytic acid that leaches calcium and other vital minerals from your body (6). And, if soy milk is not organic it is almost surely made from GMO soybeans. GMO soybeans have been shown to be contaminated with Roundup herbicide, which might end up in your glass of soy milk (7). As for rice, it is notoriously contaminated with arsenic (a carcinogen) – even organic rice – (8) and tests by Consumer Reports have found arsenic residues in rice milk (9). Unless a brand says that they test their rice milks for arsenic, I don’t feel confident that it is safe. Rice milk is also higher in sugar than most non-dairy milks. I typically stick with organic coconut and almond milks. Organic store-bought hemp milk or oat milk is hard to find, but is a good choice too. Oat milk is gaining in popularity right now and you’ll probably start seeing a lot more of it popping up in coffee shops and stores. Recently the Environmental Working Group (EWG) did some testing (10) and found many popular oat-based cereals, oatmeals, granolas and snack bars contaminated with glyphosate (the active ingredient in Roundup weedkiller). Oat milk wasn’t specifically included in their testing, but it’s good to be aware that conventional oats (non-organic) oats are commonly sprayed with Roundup as a drying agent before harvest, which makes them more likely to be contaminated. Organic oats are not sprayed directly, but are sometimes cross-contaminated. Thankfully, what the EWG found was that organic products were less likely to be contaminated and had far fewer residues than conventional products. The cancer arm of the World Health Organization considers glyphosate to be a probable carcinogen (a substance that causes cancer) – so you don’t want that in your food! That’s why it is safest to look for oat products that are certified organic, and ideally, that have been certified by a third-party to be free of glyphosate. Oatly is one brand that isn’t organic, but carries the Glyphosate Residue Free certification by The Detox Project. If you buy the Oatly brand, just make sure to pick up what they call the “low fat” version, because Oatly’s regular oat milk contains added rapeseed (canola) oil and other unnecessary additives. I normally wouldn’t recommend a product labeled as “low fat”, but in this case it simply means they didn’t add unhealthy oil to it. And, check out my recipe for homemade organic oat milk below – it’s soooo simple to make. Ripple Milk and some other brands like Silk’s Protein Nut Milk and Milkadamia are made with pea protein. I’m now very cautious about consuming pea protein as I learned something very shocking about this ingredient while developing protein powder for my company Truvani... Our protein powder is made primarily with organic pea protein. We have strict ingredient standards that not all brands have – all ingredients need to be organic, non-GMO, and pass heavy metal testing. We reached out to dozens of ingredient suppliers and every single sample of pea protein failed the heavy metals test and was coming back contaminated with LEAD. I couldn’t believe it. We had such a hard time finding a clean source of pea protein that I thought we would need to scratch the recipe altogether and completely reformulate it without pea protein. We eventually found a pea protein source that passed testing, but it was an exhaustive process that I know most food brands don’t bother doing. I’m not saying Ripple Milk, Milkadamia, or Silk’s Protein Nut Milk is contaminated with lead. I can’t say that because I haven’t tested them for lead – and I don’t know anyone who has. That being said, given how common lead is in our pea protein supplies, it is a risk and it’s not one that I’m personally willing to take – especially after my personal experience with pea protein! My team has reached out to these companies and we haven’t heard back yet – but we’ll update this blog post when we do. UPDATE 2/1/19: Following this investigation, Ripple made the following statement on their Instagram page: “We confidently stand by the integrity of our products and we want to give our fans complete peace of mind, so we tested several bottles of each flavor of Ripple Milk for lead. We tested bottles from different production runs, produced over a few months, using a strict EPA-standard testing method (EPA 6020) at an independent laboratory. As expected, all test results came back negative. This means that the amount of lead in the product is either zero, or so small that highly sensitive analytical equipment could not detect it. Thank you for reaching out to us with your concerns! We know how important it is to feel confident about the products you and your family rely on.” Ripple Milk is not certified organic, contains added flavors, and contains added refined (white) sugar (unless you buy their unsweetened version). Especially watch out for Vanilla Ripple Milk with 15 grams of sugar per serving. I try to avoid added sugar in foods that I’m eating regularly (that are supposed to be healthy!) Think about it: We get bombarded with added sugar all over the place… do we really want it in our daily drinks? I sure don’t. Of course, making homemade dairy-free milk is the best option… but I realize we all don’t have time to soak, blend, strain, and bottle it up every few days! When shopping for almond, coconut, oat and other dairy-free milks follow these two tips: Some better brands are MALK Organic Almond and Cashew Milks, Oatly (low fat version), Three Trees Organic Almondmilk, New Barn Organic Almondmilk, Whole Foods 365 Organic Unsweetened Almond Milk, Thrive Market Organic Almond Milk and Organic Oat Milk, Simple Truth Organic Unsweetened Almond Milk, Califia Organic Almond Homestyle Nutmilk, and Native Forest or Natural Value Coconut Milk (canned). Be careful, because these brands may have some other versions with added sugar and flavors. This is how I make homemade coconut milk from a can in less than 5 minutes. And if you’ve got a little bit more time…here is a recipe for fresh pistachio milk that is out of this world. If you know anyone who likes to use dairy-free milk, but might be buying the wrong brands, please share this post with them!"
https://foodbabe.com/how-to-make-a-change-in-the-new-year-that-lasts/,How to make a change in the New Year that lasts,0,"Last week I shared the right (and wrong) way to do Keto in our latest investigation on the blog. The timing was appropriate, too… Right about now you’re probably *overwhelmed* with new diets, fitness challenges, and “new year, new you” promotions. However, there’s one BIG PROBLEM – even with the most well-intentioned resolutions. I’ll explain. The reason 99% of New Year’s resolutions fail is: People try to do too much at once… and end up with nothing. Sure, an overnight “lifestyle change” sounds exciting today. But will it stick? You have a crazed work schedule. Or a newborn. Or both. Your plate is about as full as it could be… So how are you suddenly going to fit in 57 new healthy habits? You can’t. And it’s not your fault – it’s just unrealistic. That’s why it’s better to take a different route… Something that’s easy. Something that’s instantly rewarding. Something that fits perfectly into your already crazy-busy life. But why focus on SELF CARE? Because so many of us – especially we moms – always put ourselves LAST! Work, kids, family… you take care of everything and everyone. BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU? I learned this the hard way: If you don’t take care of yourself today, you won’t be here to care for those that matter to you tomorrow. It’s like they tell you on the plane, “Put YOUR oxygen mask on first.” If you don’t, sooner or later, bad things will happen… You get anxious and irritable. You feel tired ALL THE TIME. You start to feel unattractive and undesirable. You lose your energy AND your confidence. And you can’t be there for the ones you love either. So, even if there’s a voice in your head telling you otherwise… Self-care is NOT SELFISH. Self-care IS SACRED. Actually, it’s easier than you think. You can start each day off by doing one easy morning ritual for yourself… Everyone is talking about marine collagen right now because it’s a remarkable supplement. And there are three reasons why I LOVE taking marine collagen as a self-care habit: There are many areas of self-care, but the truth is, when I feel like I look my best, I feel my best. My confidence soars. And people notice it. Now, to help you make 2019 the year you finally make YOU a priority, I have something special for you: When you order Truvani’s Wild Caught Marine Collagen today, you also get a free glass straw! Just click the link & enter your email to claim this offer. Then place your order, and we’ll include your glass straw – FREE. I use my glass straw every single day.

Don’t google it. It’s heartbreaking. So, by using a GLASS straw, you can help reduce plastic waste. Plus, you should know… Truvani’s Marine Collagen is made from the skin of WILD CAUGHT fish. Meaning, it’s made from a byproduct that otherwise often goes to waste. So, you’re not adding to the problem of overfishing by using Truvani’s Marine Collagen. Let’s make 2019 the year of YOU.

https://foodbabe.com/is-the-keto-diet-healthy/,Is The Keto Diet Healthy?,0,"When I was in my 20’s overweight, upset and ready to change my life – I went on a diet. Little did I realize at the time, that diets do not produce long lasting results – for my body, for my health or for my mental state. This is why I think it’s important to demystify the latest diet trends to help people see through the lies they promise. One of the biggest trends in the diet world right now is KETO. Here’s what I’ve uncovered for you… The word “keto” comes from the word “ketosis” – which is a metabolic state that your body can go into to efficiently burn fat when you dramatically reduce the amount of carbohydrates you consume. In the Keto diet, it is typical for fat to make up about 70% of what you eat. Your remaining diet on Keto is roughly 15-25% protein and 5% carbs. These amounts vary a bit by person, but carbs are severely restricted to fewer than 50 grams per day (some need to go as low as 5-15 grams to reach ketosis). To put this in perspective, the average person eats over 200 grams of carbs (from sugar, grains, fruit, etc) per day. The reduction in carbohydrates is similar to the first phase of the popular Atkins Diet in the 90’s. It’s common for people to lose significant weight on Keto – especially at first. After a few days on the Keto diet, your body will kick into ketosis and starts burning fat for energy instead of glucose (carbs). When you stick to it, you dramatically change how your body processes these nutrients – leading to weight loss without food cravings and increased energy (1). (At least that’s what most people who’ve done Keto say about it.) You’ll eat lots of healthy foods on Keto… like avocados, wild salmon, coconut oil, and leafy greens. When Keto is done right, you won’t eat processed food and will eat way more vegetables than the average person. And, you’ll stop eating sugar. Eating too much sugar is truly toxic to the body – and sadly, it’s super easy to overdo it. Sugar can be implicated in many cases of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer (2). It’s the hidden link to so much pain and suffering. So, the fact that the Keto diet helps people get off of sugar (a highly addictive substance) is AMAZING. On Keto you typically won’t eat meat at every meal either, which is better for the planet. Besides losing weight, Keto lowers inflammation in the body, may fight cancer, and can be used to help manage type 2 diabetes. The Keto diet has been used to treat symptoms of epilepsy in children for over 100 years (3). Not everyone on Keto is eating healthy food. The diet is not focused on the source of ingredients (organic, grass-fed, etc…) or whether the food is nutritious. It’s okay to eat pork rinds and factory-farm salami for example. Organic, grass-fed, and unprocessed animal products are FAR healthier than conventional versions, with more healthy omega-3 fatty acids, and without residues of antibiotics, artificial hormones, and other drugs that are given to most farm animals. It’s especially unhealthy to eat processed meats like salami with cancerous nitrates and other risky additives like BHT (4). There are also packaged Keto snacks and drinks coming out that are filled with processed additives. To sweeten them up without carbs, they’ll often use sugar alcohols (erythritol, xylitol) – or even worse, they’ll sometimes use artificial sweeteners like sucralose. Sugar alcohols may be low carb, but they are made in a laboratory with a complex fermentation process (often from GMO corn) and consumption may wreak havoc on gut health and cause gastrointestinal issues (4). Sucralose is an artificial sweetener linked to leukemia and should be avoided at all costs (4). You’ll also find fiber additives like cellulose in many of these products. We should be getting our fiber naturally from fruits, vegetables, beans, seeds, whole grains, and not from processed fiber additives that were manufactured in a lab. The industry calls these “functional fibers” but they do not function in your body the same as fiber in real food (5). Keto can be done healthfully (olive oil, avocados, nuts, organic grass-fed dairy) or unhealthful (“sugar-free” candy, conventional cheese, processed sausage and bacon). It’s a lot easier to do the latter… but the “right” way to do Keto is with home-cooked whole foods. You can’t eat fruit for instance. Maybe a small handful of berries per day, but that’s about it. There’s a long list of healthy foods that you aren’t allowed to eat on Keto if you want to stay in ketosis which includes almost every fruit, sweet potatoes, lentils, beans, quinoa, brown rice, and oatmeal. Some say you can eat a few bites of non-Keto fruits, like 1/3 of a banana a day, but these healthy foods are pretty much banned from the Keto diet… Avoiding these foods doesn’t come without a cost! You’re missing out on all the beneficial vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients abundant in some of the healthiest foods on the planet (6) which may lead to nutrient deficiencies over time. You’re lowering your fiber intake significantly, which is detrimental to your gut heath. A healthy gut is crucial for healthy digestion, clear skin, and a strong immune system (7). The lack of fiber is one reason why people on Keto commonly get constipated. The other reason is that your electrolyte levels go out of whack… While on Keto, your kidneys become more efficient at expelling excess sodium and water. This can leave you dehydrated and constipated. The mineral potassium commonly gets depleted too, which is essential for healthy heart and muscle function. This is why many people on Keto supplement with electrolyte supplements and drinks (which are sometimes heavily processed with added flavors, colors, and artificial sweeteners). Almost everyone experiences the “Keto flu” for about a week when starting Keto. You’ll feel tired, headachy, queasy, light-headed, and moody while your body gets used to burning fat instead of carbs for energy. This happens when you drastically cut out sugar from your life, and isn’t dangerous for a healthy person… but will throw you off for a few days, and some people throw in the towel at this point because it’s so uncomfortable. This may explain why coffee is sometimes consumed in excess on Keto (to compensate for loss in energy that carbs provide). Drinking too much coffee makes the body acidic and can lead to problems sleeping – so this can really backfire. Keto can also give you some nasty smelling breath. “Keto Breath” happens because acetone is a byproduct of ketosis, which is expelled in breath, making your breath smell metallic and fruity (8) Women on Keto may start experiencing irregular periods or their periods may stop completely. This isn’t a healthy or safe side-effect and should be evaluated by a doctor if it happens to you. It’s easy to knock your body out of ketosis if you eat one too many bites of the wrong thing. Having a second helping of sweet potatoes at dinner or too many blueberries in your smoothie might just do it. Even eating too much meat can set you back for days getting back into ketosis. Keto “treats” made with certain sugar alcohols can cause blood sugar levels to rise in some people (my father who has diabetes experienced this). Keto hardly allows for any “cheating” and is really strict for this reason. Once cheating takes you out of ketosis, it can take 1-3 days to get back in, during which carb cravings skyrocket. So, you have to be very diligent and very careful about counting each and every macro to make sure you are eating the right amount of protein, carbs, and fat. If you occasionally like to indulge, Keto isn’t for you. Most experts recommend not doing Keto forever (9) so at some point, you’re going to want to go off of it – and you don’t want to gain all your weight back when you do. There’s a very specific way to transition out of ketosis, which not everyone is aware of – such as forgetting to reduce fat intake when adding carbs back in. Going right back to eating fruit, oatmeal, and other healthy carbs will likely lead to weight gain after you’ve restricted carbs for an extended time, leading to an endless cycle of extreme dieting. If you’re not careful, you’ll be yo-yo dieting in no time. I don’t want to stop eating juicy oranges, crunchy apples, and savory sweet potatoes. It seems absurd to me to avoid these healthy foods. And, who doesn’t like to have some real chocolate chip cookies from time to time? During the holidays, I wouldn’t want a second helping of sweet potatoes to completely steamroll my diet. When I travel, I love to partake in the local cuisine… croissants in Paris and pizza when in Italy! I also love to eat Indian food – which is full of medicinal spices and healthy coconut milk, but generally way too high in carbs to be considered Keto. I can’t imagine life without dal and dosas! My philosophy when it comes to eating is to create healthy habits that I can stick to for life and take with me wherever I go. I want my diet to be sustainable day after day, not feeling guilty if I eat something that is otherwise healthy, but not on “the plan”. Instead of worrying about how many grams of carbs or fat something contains, I have found it easiest to choose foods that are nutrient-dense, organic, and unprocessed. For me, this has helped me feel amazing. I can still enjoy basically any food, anywhere, at any time – I just make sure it’s made with healthful ingredients. Eating this way is how I lost excess weight when I was younger and how I am able to effortlessly maintain my weight now for over 10 years. Losing weight is one thing, and getting healthy is another. I want the best of both worlds. Keto can be helpful for people with certain conditions and can help break an addiction to processed food and sugar – but I consider it extreme for the average person who just wants to drop some pounds. I believe there are healthier, safer, sustainable, (and more enjoyable) ways to lose weight and keep it off. With as popular as Keto is right now, you are going to start seeing lots of new processed Keto snacks, treats, bars, drinks, etc, in stores. If you do decide to go Keto – make sure you do it the right way with organic whole foods and stay away from processed products full of sugar alcohols, natural flavors, and conventional meat and dairy. If you aren’t on the Keto diet, you probably know someone who is! Please share this post so they can decide if the Keto diet is right for them."
https://foodbabe.com/pumpkin-cheesecake-bites-dairy-free-grain-free/,Pumpkin Cheesecake Bites {Dairy-Free & Grain-Free},0,"I call these Pumpkin Cheesecake Bites “unbelievable” because once you take a bite, it’s hard to believe these decadent treats are made with no white sugar, no grains, and no dairy – just 100% healthy deliciousness in a pan. Plus, it’s great for the holidays – if you’re baking lots of cookies and have your oven tied up, this recipe is perfect to throw into the mix! No baking involved – it just takes about 15 minutes to assemble and pop into the freezer. The filling in these Pumpkin Cheesecake Bites is made with healthy pumpkin (of course!) but instead of blending it up with tons of white sugar, I use just 1/4 cup of coconut sugar and a couple tablespoons of maple syrup. Coconut sugar has a lower glycemic index than white sugar (meaning it doesn’t spike your blood sugar levels), plus it’s completely unrefined, helping to preserve all of its teeming vitamins and minerals. That’s why whenever I’m baking at home, if any recipe calls for “sugar”, I’ll cut the amount down (sometimes in half) and swap it with coconut sugar (and sometimes maple syrup or dates). Coconut sugar is easy to do, because you can swap it out at a perfect 1:1 ratio with regular sugar, so there is no guess work! To give these bites that rich “cheesecake” taste without the cream cheese, I add organic cashew butter to the pumpkin mix. And, instead of using flour, I make this incredible crust out of unsweetened coconut, pecans, and dates… mmm mmm! To get started, you’ll want to use your food processor to easily blend the ingredients. You could also use a high powered blender if you don’t have a food processor. Add a cup of pumpkin puree, half a cup of cashew butter, a quarter cup of coconut sugar, and two tablespoons of real maple syrup, along with the vanilla and spices to the food processor… Blend until all of the pumpkin pie filling ingredients are very smooth. Remove the smooth filling from the food processor, place it in a bowl and set it aside. Clean your food processor so that you can use it again to make the pie crust… Add a cup each of unsweetened shredded coconut, Medjool dates, and pecans along with a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the food processor. Save a handful of pecans to use as a topping. Blend the ingredients until a dough-like consistency is achieved. It should look like this… Take out an 8×8 baking dish and evenly press pie crust mixture into the dish. To make it easier to make pretty squares later, you can line the baking dish with unbleached parchment paper before pressing the crust into the pan. This will allow you to easily take out the Pumpkin Cheesecake Bites in one piece in which you can then cut into pieces… Grab the pumpkin pie filling and scoop it on top of the crust, spreading it around as evenly as you can… Garnish it with those pecans you set aside and place in freezer overnight to serve chilled the next day. Try to save some to share!… If you know anyone who loves to bake during the holidays, please share this recipe with them. Happy Holidays!"
https://foodbabe.com/healthy-holiday-sweet-potato-casserole/,Healthy Holiday Sweet Potato Casserole,0,"There’s just nothing like a homemade sweet potato casserole during the holidays… it’s almost like dessert (but healthy!) I always use fresh sweet potatoes or yams to make this casserole, and NEVER the canned versions. Those cans are packed with tons of added refined sugar and especially after you’ve had the real thing you realize they taste awful too. Instead of refined sugar, I add only three tablespoons of organic maple syrup to the entire casserole. It comes out sweet, savory, and incredibly delicious. This sweet potato casserole is one of my all-time favorite holiday recipes. To get started, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Scrub eight medium-size sweet potatoes and poke each one all over with a fork. Place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake until tender – about for 60 to 70 minutes, depending on the size of your potatoes… After allowing them to cool for a little bit, scoop out the insides of the sweet potatoes and place in a bowl… Add in a teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla extract, a pinch of nutmeg, half a stick of softened butter, two eggs, two tablespoons maple syrup and a pinch of salt and pepper. You can omit the eggs by subbing in two tablespoons ground flaxseed mixed with six tablespoons of water. Blend with a hand mixer until well combined… Scoop the sweet potato mix into a casserole dish and bake for 30 minutes… Now, it’s time for the fun part! You can top it with a streusel made with pecans and maple syrup (my favorite!) and/or natural marshmallows. It’s even delicious without any topping if you prefer a healthier version. If you want to make the pecan streusel, make it while the casserole is baking. In a small bowl, mix together one cup of pecans, one tablespoon of maple syrup, two tablespoons butter, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Set aside until ready to use. When the casserole is done baking, remove it from the oven and set the oven to its broil setting. Top the casserole with the pecans and/or marshmallows and place under the broiler for a couple minutes to toast. Enjoy!

https://foodbabe.com/take-a-healthy-snack-wherever-you-go-protein-powder-travel-packs/,Take a healthy snack wherever you go… (Protein Powder Travel Packs!),0,"What’s the hardest time to stick to your healthy habits? For me, it’s when I’m either pressed for time, on the go, or in a place with no healthy food options. Especially this time of year, when we are traveling to visit with family and running around like crazy trying to get a million things done. It’s HARD to find healthy, filling snacks when you’re out and about. Think about when you’re at… There are times when it feels like you only have TWO options: This isn’t your fault… When all the available food choices are full of additives and sugar, what are you supposed to do? When I used to travel a lot for work, I went to great lengths to bring healthy food and snacks with me. Now, I always keep a quick and easy snack in my purse, because I never know when I’ll need it. And I know I’m not the only one. A friend told me, “When I travel I put my Protein Powder in ziplock bags, and I get really weird looks!” That’s why I think you’ll appreciate this new product is available NOW… Sometimes convenience is EVERYTHING. Especially during hectic times – like the holiday season. There’s no quicker, easier way to have your smoothie or shake than with these new single-serve packets. Stash them in your gym bag… your suitcase… and your car… You can choose between our CHOCOLATE or VANILLA flavor. We’ll send you seven of these “on the go” packets in a convenient kit.

https://foodbabe.com/how-the-food-industry-tries-to-silence-us-my-appearance-on-cnn/,How The Food Industry Tries to Silence Us (My Appearance on CNN…),0,"I got a request to be on CNN last Sunday night asking me to discuss the romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak. But here’s the crazy thing… My appearance on national TV really pissed off some people. And no – not because it was on CNN. (My stance on national media has always been to take the opportunity to spread the truth, no matter what outlet). So why would anyone be enraged that I went on TV to talk about lettuce? Let me explain… There are a band of food industry people who follow my every move and do whatever they can to bring our movement down. This includes people who work with Big Food and chemical corporations and public relations firms who represent these companies. They don’t want an activist like me to have an audience and to tell people the truth about our food supply. This threatens their profits… and when you are a threat, you become a target. It can be scary at times, but I do my best to not let it sway me. So after my appearance on CNN last weekend, I found myself again being targeted with a tactic called “astroturfing”. This is something they have done to me in the past, often after I make a big public appearance or launch a successful campaign or petition. When an astroturf campaign is launched, it will look like there are swarms of people on one side of the issue, when in all actuality, it is a small group of people working together backed by public relations firms or special interest groups. Astroturfing is designed to shape and distort media messages to fit a industry-friendly narrative and manipulate public opinion. For instance, when we petition a Big Food company and ask them to drop a harmful additive from their food, hundreds of social media profiles (some real, some fake) are activated and flood Facebook with messages in opposition to what we are asking the company to do. When we asked In-N-Out Burger to stop the routine use of antibiotics, several profiles came to In-N-Out’s Facebook Page and told them specifically not to change and not to listen us “fear mongers.” The same happened when we wrote about the risky additives in Boar’s Head deli meats and asked them to improve. Astroturfing also happens behind the scenes and off of the pages of social media. When I am invited to speak at events, a swarm of social media profiles spam the organization who invited me to speak. When I was on the cover of Experience Life magazine and when Yahoo Health featured me in some videos, they tracked down the editors of these publications and swamped them with complaints. It appeared on the surface that the complaints were coming from dozens of separate individuals, but it was actually a small group of people working together to make it appear that way. The shocking insults and name-calling… The relentless bullying… The defamatory allegations… The canned “industry-friendly” responses… After you’ve seen it a few times, it becomes glaringly obvious. It encourages people to talk smack about a person – like Dr. Oz is a “quack” and Food Babe is a “fearmonger” – versus the real issues of having Roundup weedkiller in our food and artificial dyes in our mac n’ cheese. They fear an honest discussion with what’s wrong with these chemicals in our food. An astroturfing campaign was kicked off by a woman who calls herself “Farm Babe” (wonder where she came up with that name?!). She is a conventional farmer who has worked as a “social media influencer” for Domino’s Pizza, Arctic Apples (GMO), Tyson Foods, and Elanco (maker of livestock drugs). She writes a regular column in Ag Daily – a publication backed by Monsanto and Bayer. Numerous makers of conventional farm feed and GMOs have hired her to speak at their events. She is literally working directly with Big Food and Ag brands. She also has a personal stake in the industry. On her farm she grows corn, soybeans, alfalfa and raises conventional beef on a feedlot that uses grains and growth hormones. She works with many of the big players in Ag who are proponents of factory farming – something I want to change – so of course, she does not like what I stand for. So it was no surprise that she posted this on her Facebook page after my appearance on CNN: I’ll address her comments about sewage sludge and antibiotics, but as you see below, her post engaged a swarm of people to send emails to CNN to complain about me and tell them to never have me on their network. Here are just a handful of responses to her post: As you can see – there were swarms of people contacting CNN about my appearance. I don’t know exactly how she got wind of it – but if I was a betting woman (and in this case, I would love to take a bet if I someone is daring enough to come forward to tell the truth about what happened here) – I would bet she was tipped off by Farm Babe herself or other industry-aligned people with an agenda. The journalist Tanya Basu tried to fact check what I said – but instead FAILED miserably… In fact she completely disregarded what I said and made up a narrative that suited the FDA’s response. On CNN, I said I choose whole heads of lettuce (over bagged cut lettuce) because there are fewer points of potential contamination. I also made it clear that this wouldn’t always eliminate the risk and that you cannot wash E. coli off of contaminated lettuce. I said I like to minimize the touch points in the supply chain when I make food choices. The less processing a product goes through, the better. And this isn’t wrong – especially when it comes to lettuce. Lettuce is known to be particularly tricky when it comes to food safety as everything ranging from “production practices, harvesting, packing, processing and food handling have all been linked to illnesses associated with leafy greens. E. coli can get into food through manure, contaminated water used during growing or harvesting, or improper food handling at a store, restaurant or home”. Buying a whole head of lettuce does minimize these touch points. She went on to state that some scientists have said my “hatred of additives” is rooted in “anti-science” and “perpetuates myths”. To back up this statement, she quotes Kevin Folta criticizing our successful campaign to remove azodicarbonamide from Subway’s bread. It is irresponsible that she uses this argument for two reasons. One – scientists do back up the fact that azodicarbonamide breaks down into carcinogens when baked. Secondly – Kevin Folta was the scientist quoted who is a known shill for the chemical industry. Also, I am correct in stating that the overuse of antibiotics is creating superbugs that can’t be treated with antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization, “The high volume of antibiotics in food-producing animals contributes to the development of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, particularly in settings of intensive animal production… Many of the bacteria (such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli) carried by animals can also cause disease in people. These bacteria, which are frequently antimicrobial-resistant, can contaminate our food supply from farm to fork, such as through slaughtering and processing. Fruits and vegetables may also be contaminated by such bacteria at the farm or later through cross-contamination.” As you can see, they try to mince my words on purpose to try to destroy my credibility. What a journalistic fail on this writers fault. She does a real disservice to public safety by spending her time attacking me. They want to control the narrative – so that everything you see on TV, in the news, on billboards, and on food packages is pro-processed food, pro-chemical, pro-Big Ag, and pro-Big Food. I refuse to let them silence me. I will not back down from telling people who will listen what I know. And plenty of people are listening. And this is WHY I wrote my new book Feeding You Lies. I know these types of attacks will be ramping up as this book is hitting stores in a few short months. In the book, I go into greater detail on the many different ways the industry pulls stunts to fool the public (and the media). It’s eye-opening and you need to know what’s going on! Please pre-order a copy of Feeding You Lies to show the food industry that you support the work I am doing. Pick up a couple extras for your loved ones, it makes a great gift! Feeding You Lies I need every single one of you by my side. The best way to make astroturfing less effective is to tell everyone about it! Please share this post."
https://foodbabe.com/how-to-travel-with-a-baby-still-eat-organic-food/,How To Travel With A Baby & Still Eat Organic Food,0,"One of the biggest joys in my life is traveling. Now that I’m a mom, that hasn’t changed – and even more so, as I want to show my daughter the world. I have taken a lot of trips since she has been born and I always take her with me. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, trying to always eat 100% organic while traveling would make me go crazy. Unless I’m traveling to a place like New York or California where everything is at your fingertips, it isn’t always possible. I’ve had to remind myself over and over again that the joys and experience of travel outweighs eating organic which relaxes my anxious mind when I think about all the things I know about our food. Once you learn something you can’t unlearn it… but you can just grin and bare it, right? haha. My rule of thumb is when I’m in control and have the choice, I’ll choose organic. But if I don’t have the choice, then I’ll make sacrifices. The same goes for naps. I know Harley will be perfectly fine if she misses a nap and gets a little off her normal routine. During travel delays and other unexpected situations, Harley always surprises me! She is a trooper! Pictured above: Napping at the Nassau Airport after our flight got delayed 5 hours, Harley in a suitcase at 3.5 months old in St. Barts, and Harley checking out the cockpit in Denver. Before I had kids, I heard many parents complain of the hassles of travels and I’ve had to consciously drown out their voices in my head. Some have been so negative, that they choose to not go anywhere with their kids. Of course, it takes work and there is a lot of preparation and special things you need to pack, but I believe the joys of taking my child to see a new place with their own eyes and experience it for the first time so far outweighs any hassle it takes to travel. (Like my in-laws always tell me – to enjoy the good things in life, it takes work) Watching Harley see a sea turtle for the first time in the Bahamas (and a stingray and shark!) was pretty amazing – and also for her to come home with this new vocabulary was so awesome. Her making a little fish face and expressing her excitement over what she saw… that is worth everything. Pictured above: Celebrating my birthday in the Bahamas at Baha Mar The first big trip we took with Harley was to the French West Indies for two weeks when she was about 3 1/2 months old. It was a very easy trip because her food source was on me and it was easy to breastfeed her on the plane, which helped keep her calm and happy the whole flight. And, basically whenever we went to restaurants she would either breastfeed or just stay in my arms or in my wrap – she was very portable and the easiest to travel with at this age. Pictured above: Our first trip as parents to the French West Indies – St. Barts Traveling with her became more complicated when she started really eating solid foods (around 9-10 months). Around that time we took a work trip to L.A. and have made many trips since then – and so I’ve learned several things about what works well (and what doesn’t) when we travel. I’ve managed to keep her super healthy and eating as clean as possible by following these tips… Pictured above: 2 different trips of Harley eating a homemade meal packed in a stainless steel lunch box on the airplane We go everywhere with this travel high chair – it’s awesome. Pictured above: Highlights from our trip to the Four Seasons Jackson Hole, WY Pictured above: On the beach in Xpu-ha, Mexico If you are looking for more inspiration on how to travel with children, you’ve got to check out The Bucket List Family on You Tube… their videos blow me away. Are you planning to travel with your children soon or have you recently? Tell me all about it in the comments!

When I started revealing how big food manipulates us, I thought everyone would be happy. And most people were. But what about the companies we demanded change from? They were mad.

https://foodbabe.com/i-am-going-to-be-attacked-for-writing-my-next-book-feeding-you-lies/,I am going to be attacked for writing my next book: Feeding You Lies,0,"I was naive when I started blogging on Food Babe back in 2011. I thought everyone would be happy about what I wrote because I was helping people. I had no idea that my investigations into the food industry would produce such a firestorm. I thought if I just told the truth on my blog, everything would get better. I thought the food industry would change because people would demand it once they learned the truth. After we succeeded in changing dozens of food company ingredients and food practices for the better, we (the Food Babe Army) became a TARGET. Droves of critics were unleashed to take me down. They were organized by people with deep pockets, with a mission to protect the billion-dollar processed food and chemical industry. Now that I look back, I see how ignorant I was to think that nothing would happen to me. This group of critics weaseled their way into major newspapers all over the place, and said horrible things about me (that I was crackpot and a bimbo, and worse). This was done to damage my credibility and to make me look like an uneducated crazy person. And at the time, reporters believed that these critics of mine were independent experts – without financial ties to the food industry – and so they allowed them to be the antagonist in these stories about me as an activist. At first, I couldn’t pin down exactly what was going on. I had my suspicions, of course, but I couldn’t really prove that these people were getting money from the industry. And then slowly, but surely, the truth started to reveal itself. I submitted freedom of information act (FOIA) requests and received hundreds of internal emails. I met with someone who admitted he had edited my Wikipedia page, because he was paid by a firm to discredit my work. I talked to other experts and went behind the scenes to really figure out more about what was going on. My eyes were opened to a whole world of corruption… What I have now found, is compelling evidence showing how these critics were connected to and were taking money from the food and chemical industries. I also uncovered how the industry will stop at nothing to keep their unhealthy products on the market, even if it means lying repeatedly to the public. And, this series of events led me to realize that… whoa, there are SO MANY LIES that the food industry has told us over the years. They manipulate us to buy their products and they use dirty tactics just like what the tobacco industry has done. I had an epiphany. I knew I had to tell people all about this. I knew I had to get this out to the public and my next book was born… This book – which I call FEEDING YOU LIES – is being printed this week and getting ready to hit bookstores in just a few months. It is not something that has ever been written before. It’s told from my perspective and shares personal stories on how I figured out the lies that needed to be exposed. When I decided to write this book, I was pregnant and pitched it to publishers, and by the time I got a publisher and was ready to write it, my baby was born. I spent the last two years becoming a mom, trying to figure out how to raise my daughter and continue being an activist. And, now that she is almost 2, I am back. I’m ready to get back in the fight again. Now is the right time for this book to come out. Certain individuals and companies do NOT want their lies to be published and that’s why I know this book is going to really open me up to attacks. And to be honest, this will not be easy for me. That’s why I really need your support. The best way you can support my new book is by pre-ordering a copy. The book will be shipped to you on its release date on February 19, 2019, so you will get to be one of the very first people to read it! .ctfont{ font-family: 'Crimson Pro', serif; } .pre-order-now { color: #e81f31; font-weight: bold; } .claim-your-bonus-link { text-decoration: underline; color: red !important; } .preorder-button{ max-height:52px; } .preorder-button:hover, .submit-button:hover { -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(2px 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)); -ms-filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Dropshadow(OffX=2, OffY=2, Color='#444')""; filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Dropshadow(OffX=2, OffY=2, Color='#444')""; } .preorder-button.dark-bg:hover{ -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(2px 2px 2px rgba(255,255,255,0.2)); -ms-filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Dropshadow(OffX=2, OffY=2, Color='#444')""; filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Dropshadow(OffX=2, OffY=2, Color='#444')""; } .block-font { font-style: normal; font-weight: 700; } Feeding You Lies The reason why pre-ordering the book is so helpful is that this sends a signal to bookstores everywhere that they should carry FEEDING YOU LIES when it comes out in February.

I really want every single one of you to pre-order this book and to tell your local bookstores to carry it. That is the only way we are going to get it out there… The media likely won’t be reporting about it. Do you think that the morning shows are going to have me on their network while their sponsors are Kellogg’s and General Mills? I’m not going to rely on traditional media to get this book out… I’m going to be relying on you. I’m relying on you to help get this book into the hands of more people. This will continue to educate the public about the lies of the food industry and let them know how they’ve been duped. We exposed their dirty ingredients in the first book, and we are exposing their dirty tactics in the second. Many food corporations have NO DESIRE to help us be healthy. They want to continue selling us their sugary, toxin-ridden products. There is nothing admirable about selling food that makes people sick. Just like we got major multi-billion dollar corporations to change in the past, we will do it again when their lies are finally revealed in this book. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for supporting the pre-order of this book, asking your local bookstores to carry it, and for sharing this with your friends. You are courageously helping me stand up to the Big Food industry that always puts their profits over people. It needs to stop."
https://foodbabe.com/the-healthiest-vanilla-protein-powder-is-now-available/,The Healthiest Vanilla Protein Powder Is Now Available!,0,"Earlier this year when my new company Truvani launched our Chocolate Plant-Based Protein Powder, the #1 thing people asked me was, “When will you make Vanilla?” I couldn’t have agreed more. I really WANTED a vanilla protein powder too. And, I’m so excited to let you know that vanilla is now available! If you’re wondering why it took us a little while to come out with this vanilla version, let me share some behind-the-scenes of what it took to make this product… You see, just like all Truvani products, we wanted to create the best tasting organic plant-based protein powder with the CLEANEST ingredients. We focus on using real whole food to make our products and we weren’t sure if we could pull it off for Vanilla. There were two reasons why: First… The price of Vanilla Bean – how you get the “real” taste of vanilla – skyrocketed, and we were worried that it would force us to charge too much for a Vanilla Plant-Based Protein Powder. Most other brands would use “natural flavors” to get a vanilla flavor at a fraction of the cost. We refuse to cut corners like that! We’d have to use the real stuff – vanilla bean. And that would drive the price of the product up too much. Second… We weren’t sure if people would like the “real” taste of vanilla. As we started to share our Vanilla Protein Powder with people, they kept saying: “It tastes great. But it’s not the vanilla I’m used to…” And they were right. It wasn’t a vanilla “natural flavor” engineered in a laboratory. It was Vanilla Bean… or as we like to call it… real vanilla. However, back in September we had a big breakthrough. The person in charge of product formulation sent me a sample. I opened it, I smelled it and was immediately overcome by the aromatic scent of real vanilla. I couldn’t believe it – it smelled so good! As I mixed it into water, and took the first sip… I knew we had a winner. It smelled great. It tasted great. It’s awesome. It’s only made with 5 simple ingredients: Organic Pea Protein, Organic Pumpkin Seed Protein, Organic Chia Seeds, Organic Vanilla Powder, Organic Monk Fruit. (Yes, that’s it!) I’m sure you’ll love it to… And, I’m so confident that you will that we have a “love the taste guarantee.” You can try it, and if you don’t love it, email our support team and we’ll issue you a refund. The best part? We pushed back on our ingredient suppliers so that we’d be able to offer this REAL VANILLA organic protein powder at a reasonable price (this also allowed us to LOWER the price on our chocolate protein powder.

https://foodbabe.com/they-say-mcdonalds-is-removing-artificial-ingredients-but-the-menu-is-still-full-of-them/,They Say McDonald’s Is Removing Artificial Ingredients – But The Menu is Still Full Of Them!,0,"This story about McDonald’s was all over the news… Did you see it? Here are some headlines: “McDonald’s removing artificial additives from its burgers” – CNN Money “McDonald’s burgers: New recipes remove artificial ingredients” – CBS News “McDonald’s Nixes Artificial Ingredients from Its Burgers” – Food & Wine Sounds pretty good, right? At first, I was very intrigued. But after doing a little digging, I got ticked off by these news stories. These types of headlines can lead people into believing that McDonald’s has made sweeping changes and that their food is no longer made with artificial ingredients but that is FAR from the case, as I’ll demonstrate below. High fructose corn syrup is still in ALL of the classic McDonald’s burgers. McDonald’s didn’t remove high fructose corn syrup from the ketchup or Big Mac Sauce that they put on their classic burgers. And that’s not all these news stories left out… The “new” ingredient list at McDonald’s is a who’s who list of ingredients to avoid. Artificial dyes, artificial flavors, artificial emulsifiers, and artificial preservatives are still very DOMINANT on their menu. I’ve written about the artificial emulsifiers DATEM and Mono-and-Diglycerides in the past. These two ingredients are not exactly safe because they can contain trans fats. Trans fats have been linked to heart disease and the CDC has attributed them to up to 7,000 coronary heart disease deaths each year in the U.S. You’ll find these artificial emulsifiers in essentially all of the sandwiches at McDonald’s… the Quarter Pounder, Big Mac, Cheeseburger, Hamburger, McChicken, McMuffins – every McDonald’s sandwich made on with a sesame seed bun, regular bun, english muffin, or artisan roll. The pickles on almost every McDonald’s burger contain the emulsifier Polysorbate 80. A 2015 study links Polysorbate 80 to significant weight gain and inflammatory bowel disease. This is NOT a necessary ingredient in pickles… the ones I buy sure don’t have it! And, they are artificially preserved with Potassium Sorbate, which some evidence finds to be genotoxic to white blood cells. McDonald’s can get away with saying it contains no “artificial colors” because the industry considers caramel color “natural”… but I sure don’t! Caramel color is typically made in a laboratory by reacting corn sugar with ammonia and sulfites under high pressure and temperature. When caramel color is made like this, it produces the byproduct 4-Mel. A U.S government funded study found that feeding mice caramel coloring IV (which contained 4-Mel) increased their risk of developing lung cancer and leukemia, at every dosage level. And the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies 4-Mel as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”. To be fair, there are safer forms of caramel color available for the industry to use. Which is why I gave McDonald’s the benefit of the doubt and asked them what type of caramel color they use. I was told that this information is “proprietary and not available”. (I’ll leave it up to you to decide whether you think they use a safer version after that response!) The bottom line is that caramel color is totally UNNECESSARY and POTENTIALLY RISKY. It’s only used to add a brown color… and does McDonald’s really need to color their “special sauce” brown to make their customers happy? I doubt it. This is the same ingredient that we campaigned Starbucks to remove from their drinks – and they did! If Starbucks can do it, I know McDonald’s can too. Back when I investigated McDonald’s in 2015, they used the artificial preservative BHA in 10 menu items. BHA has now been removed. Gone is also the propyl gallate and TBHQ. The artificial dough conditioner azodicarbonamide (yoga mat) was used in nearly all of their buns – and now it’s only in one (a “bakery style bun” that may be used in some locations, but is not a core item). These are big wins! …and, that’s because they did not contain artificial colors to begin with! McDonald’s really only adds artificial dyes (like Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40, Blue 1) to some shakes and the Frappe Mocha. And, they still do today… You’ll find artificial dyes in McDonald’s EggNog Shake, Shamrock Shake, and Frappe Mochas. As I’ve written many times before, these dyes are derived from petroleum and linked to health issues ranging from cancer to behavioral issues in children. They have no business being in our food. McDonald’s is once-again ranked as the #1 most popular fast food chain in America, surpassing everyone else in sales. This means a lot of Americans are eating there – even if you don’t. No one should be eating these risky ingredients at the most popular fast food restaurant in America. Don’t you agree?"
https://foodbabe.com/what-my-toddler-eats-in-a-day/,What My Toddler Eats In A Day…,0,"Feeding my daughter Harley real organic food has been one of my highlights as a Mom. From the very start, I’ve had so much fun introducing as many vegetables as possible to Harley and teaching her about where her food comes from. We started a large vegetable garden when she was first born and now picking the vegetables is one of her favorite activities. We love to visit farms in the spring and fall to pick fresh produce and see farm animals. She definitely takes after my Mother and my husband – who both love to garden! And the obsession is serious – she bangs on the front windows of our home screaming to go outside and “pick matos!” from the large above ground wooden planters we have. Mato is her name for tomato at the moment 🙂 I exclusively breastfed Harley for 6.5 months before introducing solid food (and still breastfeeding as she turns 21 months). Avocado was her first food and I continued with various vegetables before I exhausted the options and then introduced all the fruits, some meats, eggs, oats and quinoa. At the moment, she does not tolerate dairy too well but loves almond butter – so I plan to make her fresh almond milk one day soon. Here’s what a typical day in the life looks like in terms of what Harley eats. Please note – she doesn’t always finish her plate, but this is what she starts with and what I offer her. Also – I usually serve the meal in courses, unless we are in a hurry to get somewhere or running late. And keep in mind, she still breastfeeds first thing in the morning, several times throughout the day, and before bed. I serve all of her meals with water. Breakfast is always what we are eating, plus a few of her favorites. I love making steel cut oats in a crockpot overnight on low so it’s ready to roll first thing in the morning. She loves them and I love them. We always pair it with some ground flaxseeds, cinnamon and fruit – her favorite is pomegranate seeds and blueberries. For her egg muffins, I follow this recipe but leave out the cheese. I also bake them in mini silicone cups (which prevents sticking and makes them easy to store in the freezer). I thaw them out in our toaster oven at 300 degrees for 6 minutes. Pictured: Steel cut oats with pomegranate seeds, 1/4 of a banana, and an egg muffin made with red peppers and onions. Snack #1 is usually leftover breakfast. A lot of days, Harley is so full from nursing first thing in the morning, she will just eat a little of her breakfast. Instead of throwing away her food, we’ll offer it to her again as a snack and then usually thaw out one buckwheat pancake – I make a bunch and freeze them separated by parchment paper. I use this store-bought mix, but add an extra egg and add one mashed banana to the mixture instead of honey. Lunch on this day was one steamed vegetable, some type of bean and her favorite pasta and some fruit. If she is still hungry, she’ll dig out of my salad bowl till she’s satisfied (I almost always have a salad for lunch these days, or I’ll offer her some avocado or almond butter (she eats it by the spoonful!) Pictured: Steamed yellow squash and lima beans with grass-fed butter, and Tolerant elbow macaroni with Yellow Barn pasta sauce, and a side of grapes. Snack 2# happens after she wakes up from her nap. She likes to nurse and then have a mini zucchini muffin plus some fruit (watermelon balls are the current favorite). Harley also started eating rice crackers recently, and likes to dip those in almond butter. She loves organic dried fruit like goji berries and golden berries and will ask for most snacks by name and knows what she wants! For Dinner we always almost eat the exact same meal as Harley. On this day, I made wild salmon, quinoa, sautéed purple cabbage and sautéed kale in olive oil and she had some frozen peas, raspberries and pomegranate seeds for dessert. Pictured: Wild salmon, quinoa, kale and purple cabbage I’d love to know! Please share a typical day in the comments below, not only am I always looking for more ideas, I know other parents would love to see what you do as well!"
https://foodbabe.com/13-proven-health-benefits-of-turmeric/,13 Proven Health Benefits of Turmeric,0,"Years ago, I had a bad fall and injured my tailbone. It was one of the WORST pains I’d ever experienced. All the nerves surrounding my spine and lower back felt like they were on FIRE…Yoouuch!!! I was traveling for work at the time, and had to be pumped full of morphine just to get on the plane back home. I was bedridden for 3 weeks and miserable. I desperately tried every natural remedy I knew about to bring down the inflammation… and some things worked better than others. One of the most effective herbal supplements I took was a daily turmeric supplement. Thankfully, after several more weeks of turmeric supplements, acupuncture, and taking it easy, my tailbone had a full recovery. This was the first time I experienced for myself how powerful turmeric is. I’ve since learned that turmeric is even more amazing, and that it is literally PACKED with health benefits that can improve your skin, your heart, your mood, and even your waistline! To show you how remarkable this spice is, here’s a breakdown of research on 13 proven health benefits of turmeric. Turmeric is Anti-Inflammatory: The active ingredient in turmeric is curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory that helps maintain healthy inflammation responses. The typical western diet (think lots of processed foods, sugar, and alcohol) leads to what is called “chronic inflammation” in the body. Doctors believe this inflammation is a silent killer, because it sets the body up to be the perfect host for diseases like heart disease (1), cancer (2), Alzheimer’s, and even obesity (3). That’s why you want to do everything you can to bring down inflammation, including eating more unprocessed whole vegetables and fruit along with specific spices (like turmeric) and herbs known to fight inflammatory responses. One of the main anti-inflammatory components of turmeric is called curcumin (4), which one scientific study found to be as effective as some over-the-counter drugs (5) in bringing down inflammation in the body. The researchers actually found that aspirin and ibuprofen (active ingredient in Advil) were the LEAST effective out of all of the anti-inflammatory compounds they studied. Turmeric Supports Healthy Joints: Beneficial in promoting overall joint health and mobility. As the curcumin in turmeric is an anti-inflammatory, it can benefit the joints and help keep them from getting inflamed and swollen. This was demonstrated in a scientific study (6) on rheumatoid arthritis patients. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that causes painful swelling in the joints. Researchers found that 500 mg. of daily curcumin was more effective than the prescription drug Diclofenac when given to RA patients. When it comes to taking turmeric for your joints, it was shown most effective when taken before symptoms kick in (7), as a preventative measure to keep your joints healthy, pain-free, and mobile. But some studies have demonstrated it can help treat osteoarthritis (8) (a degenerative disease of the joint) as well. Turmeric Promotes Heart Health: The properties support the overall health of the cardiovascular system. There are several lifestyle factors and conditions in the body that can lead the heart disease – which is the #1 cause of death in the world. As discussed earlier, chronic inflammation plays a major role in heart disease, so taking turmeric as an anti-inflammatory can help prevent heart disease (9) and heart attacks (10). One of the most interesting benefits of curcumin is how it can improve the lining of blood vessels (known as the endothelium). When the endothelium isn’t working properly, it can’t properly regulate blood pressure and clotting, which can lead to heart disease (11). We’ve all heard that exercise is good for the heart, right? One study showed that taking curcumin is as effective as aerobic exercise (12) at improving vascular endothelial function. Turmeric Encourages Healthy Cholesterol Levels. High cholesterol is known to be caused by oxidative stress (13), brought on to the body by chronic inflammation and high blood sugar. So, again, reducing inflammation in the body supports healthy cholesterol levels. One study found curcumin comparable to prescription drug Lipitor (14) on endothelial dysfunction in reducing in inflammation and markers of oxidative stress. An earlier animal study (15) showed similar results on the body. One study of human volunteers found that taking 500 mg. of daily curcumin dropped their total cholesterol by 11.63% (16), while their HDL (the “good” cholesterol) went up 29% in just 7 days. Turmeric Boosts Stress Tolerance: As an adaptogen, it helps counteract the adverse effects of everyday stress on the body. If you feel stressed, adaptogens should be your new best friend! In herbal medicine, some botanicals are termed “adaptogens”, which means they have the ability to modulate the release of stress hormones from the adrenal glands. This can help you adapt better to physical and emotional stress and be more resilient to anything that comes your way. They also help to keep your hormones balanced. The curcumin in turmeric is a known adaptogen that has the ability to decrease the secretion of stress hormones in the body (17). In 2011, researchers in India found that turmeric had several adaptogenic properties that help with body weight, memory, blood sugar, and moreover that it helps the body maintain healthy stress hormone levels (18). Turmeric Supports Weight Loss: Curcumin can positively influence weight management in overweight people. Elevated stress can cause sudden weight gain. When stress hormones (cortisol) get out of whack, fat accumulates near the stomach (19) because the cells in the stomach are more sensitive to cortisol, and very effective at storing energy. As turmeric can help you balance your stress hormones, it can help stop that extra spare tire from forming around your waist. The anti-inflammatory properties in curcumin are able to fight obesity too. One study actually found that taking curcumin can reduce the growth of fat cells (20)! Turmeric Supports Healthy Metabolism: Aids in maintaining normal blood sugar levels. Turmeric has been used to treat diabetes (21) in Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine for years. A 2013 review of scientific studies (22) found that curcumin stabilizes glucose levels in the blood and also helped with complications related to diabetes. In one study, 100 overweight people with type 2 diabetes took either 300 mg. of curcumin or a placebo for 12 weeks. The researchers found that those taking curcumin had significantly lower fasting blood glucose (23). There is promising research suggesting curcumin may reduce the risk of developing diabetes in high risk people too. In a 2012 study, all participants who took curcumin extract for 9 months didn’t develop diabetes (24), although they were prediabetic. While 16% of the prediabetic participants who took a placebo did develop diabetes after the 9 months. Turmeric Optimizes Vitality: Its powerful antioxidant properties fight excess free radicals in the body that can damage cells and diminish health. Antioxidants zap free radicals in the body that can lead to cancer, neurodegenerative disease and other disorders. With all of the processed “dead” foods that creep their way into our diets… we can all use more of antioxidants in our life! The curcumin in turmeric is a powerful antioxidant (25). Even better, curcumin is special in that it’s been shown to boost the antioxidant enzymes (26) in your body, giving you even more benefit (27)! Turmeric Supports Brain Health: Helps maintain healthy cognitive function and working memory. Curcumin has the amazing ability to boost a protein in the brain called BDNF (28). This important protein – brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (29) – is responsible for helping the brain grow. It’s been shown to increase neurons and form new connections in the brain – two things we really need as we get older. BDNF builds up the “roadway” in your brain so that neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine can travel more easily where they need to go. Which is why high BDNF levels are linked to better memory (30) and mood… And, when BDNF levels are low, the risk of Alzheimer’s (31) and depression (32) goes up. Turmeric Promotes Radiant Skin: By providing proper nourishment, it helps your body produce more radiant and healthy-looking skin. Turmeric is an anti-aging powerhouse (33). Given that it’s an antioxidant – it can fight oxidative damage and boost the overall look of the skin. It’s anti-inflammatory properties help fight the appearance of aging skin (34) as well. A scientific review of studies in 2016 found that turmeric has the ability to improve numerous skin conditions (35) when it’s either ingested or applied directly on the skin. Turmeric Improves Mood: Curcumin helps to reduces symptoms of mild mood changes. As the curcumin in turmeric boosts the brain-builder protein BDNF, it may help prevent depression (36). Curcumin can also give a boost to serotonin and dopamine (37) – two “happy” chemicals in the brain. It shows promise for helping people who already have depression too. In one study, 60 people diagnosed with depression were given either Prozac, curcumin, or a combo of the two. Those who took just the curcumin had improvements in their mood on par with Prozac (38) – while those who took both had the best results during the 6 week study. Soothes Digestion: Reduces symptoms of bloating and gas related to occasional indigestion. Turmeric has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine (39) to improve digestion and heal gut inflammation – likely due to its nature as an anti-inflammatory. Also the curcumin in turmeric stimulates the gallbladder (40), helping your body produce bile to break down food and improve digestion. One study found that turmeric has the ability to reduce bloating and gas symptoms (41) in people who have indigestion. Some research shows curcumin can help people with ulcerative colitis (42) too – an inflammatory bowel disease that causes sores in the digestive tract. Reduces Risk of Cancer: Curcumin’s anti-cancer properties may inhibit the growth of tumors and reduce the spread of cancer. The curcumin in turmeric may be able to slow the development and growth of cancer in the body. Animal research indicates that cucurmin has the ability to actually kill tumor cells (43) and inhibit tumor growth (44). This may prevent cancerous cells from growing (45) in the body. When it comes to preventing cancer before it starts, one human research study found that taking 4 grams of daily curcumin reduced the number of precancerous lesions (46) in the colon by 40%. The research suggests that curcumin is most beneficial in breast, bowel, stomach, and skin cancer (47). Curcumin has been shown to enhance chemotherapy (48) treatments for colon cancer. Another 2017 study found that curcumin enhanced tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy (49) in pancreatic cancer, indicating that it is useful in combating chemo-resistance. Turmeric has been used in ancient medicine for over 4,000 years, going back to when residues of turmeric were found in ancient pots in New Delhi, India. Turmeric is still in use in Ayurvedic medicine today, an ancient medical system that originated in India. It’s medicinal properties and components (primarily curcumin) have been the subject of thousands of peer-reviewed and published studies. There are three basic forms of turmeric. Each option has its own benefits, depending on what you want to do with it. (Try the Truvani Daily Turmeric Supplement here) What to look for in a Turmeric Supplement: The primary reason to take a supplement is to provide your body with nutrients that are not already abundant in your normal diet. Ironically however… it’s easy to sabotage your health with supplements if you’re not careful. Look for turmeric supplements that… (Try the Truvani Daily Turmeric Supplement here) Fresh turmeric: The best way to store fresh turmeric root is in the refrigerator. You will first want to clean and completely dry the turmeric root. Then wrap the root in a paper towel and place in an airtight container. Fresh turmeric will last 1-2 weeks or more if refrigerated. Ground turmeric: To store turmeric powder it is important to keep it in a cool, dry place. Ideally this will be in a cabinet or pantry away from heat or excessive light. Turmeric supplements: Ideally, turmeric tablets should be stored in an amber glass bottle, to provide UV protection. Keep it away from excessive heat and light as much as possible. Side effects from eating turmeric or taking supplements are rare, but it’s important to know about them. When turmeric is taken in high doses, it may lead to upset stomach, dizziness, or diarrhea. Some people are allergic to turmeric and have an allergic reaction. During pregnancy, turmeric is not recommended because it is associated with stimulating the uterus. Known drug interactions for turmeric include medications that slow blood clotting, because turmeric is also known to slow blood clotting. So, be careful when taking turmeric with these types of drugs such as such as aspirin, Plavix, ibuprofen, naproxen, and warfarin. Always check with your healthcare provider before taking turmeric. 1. Brew Turmeric tea: Bring 1 cup of water to a boil and then stir in ¼ teaspoon of organic ground turmeric, fresh grated turmeric or an uncoated turmeric tablet. Allow it to simmer for 10 minutes. You can stir in honey or fresh lemon juice for added flavor. 2. Mix up a curry powder: A basic curry powder can be made with 8 parts ground coriander, 4 parts ground cumin and 1 part each of ground turmeric and cayenne or paprika. You can decrease the cayenne and use paprika instead if you don’t want it spicy, and store this in a glass container in your pantry for up to 6 months. 3. Blend it into a smoothie: Add organic turmeric powder, grated root, or uncoated turmeric tablets to a flavorful smoothie and you won’t even taste it! Granted… it may change the color of your smoothie, since it’s got such a strong pigment. 4. Juice it: When making fresh pressed green juice, add in up to 1″ of organic fresh turmeric to your juicer (per serving). 5. Season roasted veggies: Toss some fresh vegetables (like diced potatoes, cauliflower, or brussel sprouts) with a dash of olive oil and ground turmeric, along with any other seasonings you like. Roast at 400 degrees, tossing once until done, usually about 30-40 minutes. Here are some of my favorite recipes that I cook in my own kitchen with turmeric. Give them a try, I’m sure you won’t be disappointed!

https://foodbabe.com/5-ways-to-naturally-get-glowing-beautiful-skin/,"5 Ways To Naturally Get Glowing, Beautiful Skin",0,"Your skin is your largest organ. It covers and protects everything on your body. How you treat it is incredibly important to your health. However, the skin is one of the most unappreciated organs, and one that I used to totally take for granted, slathering products full of toxic chemicals on it day after day. I’ve since learned that many of those big-name skincare products were making my problems worse! It’s better to keep your beauty regimen simple and use natural techniques to fight wrinkles, eczema, acne, and other skin issues. There are some simple healthy habits you can do that help your skin glow from the inside out. Instead of slathering on expensive lotions and potions, add each of these to your regular routine and watch you skin get its glow back! The average American diet is full of refined carbs and chemical food additives, coupled with residues from plastics, pesticides, and antibiotics from factory farms – all of which destroy healthy bacteria in the gut. You see, not all bacteria is bad. In your gut, you want to have good bacteria to fight off bad invaders. An imbalance of healthy gut bacteria can show up in your skin, in the form of acne, eczema, rashes, or other ailments. When you get balance back, these skin issues can improve dramatically and your skin will glow from the inside out. Fortunately, you can easily increase the amount of good bacteria in your gut simply by eating fermented foods. The bacteria found in fermented food is likely more varied, and more easily assimilated in the body than what you can get from most probiotic supplements. Adding these foods to your diet restores healthy bacteria in your gut, which can help improve your skin (and other health benefits as well!) Fermented foods like kombucha, kimchi, and yogurt are inexpensive to make at home. It can be as simple as making homemade sauerkraut with just cabbage, water and salt. You also might want to try store-bought organic miso paste or tempeh. Dry brushing from head to toe rejuvenates the skin and stimulates the lymphatic system. It helps make skin glow and keeps it soft without needing to use very much moisturizer. Dry brushing has also been known to improve the appearance of cellulite (temporarily), increase circulation, and unclog your pores. It’s like a spa treatment, without the expensive spa! You only need to do it about three times per week to see the benefits. Do this technique with a large dry brush before you shower on completely dry skin. In small circular motions, brush your skin starting at your feet and move up towards your head. Dry brush your stomach last. After you’re done brushing all of your skin, hop in the shower and use a mild natural soap to cleanse your body. After showering, moisturize with organic sesame oil, olive oil or coconut oil mixed with a little bit of organic body lotion. Eating refined sugar (the white stuff) makes us age faster than we should and destroys the look of our skin. In a process called glycation, sugar molecules attach to collagen and elastin, two proteins that keep skin looking young, and create Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs). AGEs weaken your skin’s support structure and lead to lines and wrinkles. Refined sugars processed from cane, corn, or beets, such as table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are the baddest of the bad. These sugars have been chemically stripped of their minerals, so when you indulge in these sugars, you get no nutrition and your body becomes more acidic. Because these sugars are devoid of minerals, they are acid-forming causing inflammation – which leads to skin disorders. Instead of processed white sugar – use natural sweeteners that don’t cause this skin-wrecking inflammation. These include dates, coconut sugar, honey, maple syrup, or monk fruit. They don’t call it “beauty sleep” for nothing. Your skin cells renew themselves while you sleep, at almost double the rate as during the day. This is when your skin is repairing itself from the stressors of the day. During deep sleep phases, growth hormones rise in the body that help repair damaged cells and rejuvenate the skin, fighting the aging process. As you sleep, the hydration in your skin is replenished, which plumps it up, hiding fine lines. When you don’t get enough sleep, not only does your skin not get to properly repair itself, but it doesn’t recover moisture – which leads to dry skin, visible wrinkles, and bags under the eyes. Lack of sleep also causes your cortisol levels (a stress hormone) to rise, triggering inflammation in the body. This inflammation can make skin look dull, and acne, eczema, psoriasis and other skin issues may start to pop up. Aim for getting 8 to 9 hours of quality sleep each night. To help you get a good night’s rest, turn off the electronic devices and avoid big meals at night – and make your bedroom cool, comfortable, and quiet as possible. Your skin will thank you in the morning! Collagen is a unique protein that plays an important role in our skin as we age. It’s naturally found in the skin, ligaments, and connective tissue throughout your whole body. It functions like a scaffolding that supports our skin, keeping it nice and smooth. As we age, our body’s collagen production slows down and research shows that collagen in your skin drops by about 1% every year. Seems small, but this means that by the time you turn 40, you’ve lost more than 30%! You can start turning back the clock by eating collagen-rich foods. Cutting-edge research suggests that getting more collagen into your system can promote youthful looking skin by supporting skin elasticity.* Collagen fights the signs of aging by helping to maintain the skin’s youthful tone, texture, and appearance.* This is why I make sure to eat a collagen-rich diet by adding Truvani Wild Caught Marine Collagen Powder to my breakfast. One of the best ways to add Truvani Collagen to your diet is to mix it in with your morning coffee or tea. You won’t taste the powder. It’s virtually tasteless and dissolves smoothly without clumps in cold or hot water. Of course, you can also blend it into your smoothie, oatmeal, yogurt, and more. I love adding it to whatever I’m having for breakfast. It’s now become part of my morning routine so I don’t forget to take it. I hope these tips help your skin shine bright and radiant! As it turns out, beauty does come from the inside – literally. Because when you’re healthy, you feel great about yourself. And when you feel better, it shows.

https://foodbabe.com/the-best-wild-caught-marine-collagen-source-revealed/,The Best Wild Caught Marine Collagen Source Revealed!,0,"I’m turning 40 soon. And even though I feel better than when I was in my 20’s (yes, really), the subtle signs of aging have caught me by surprise… The other day I asked my husband, “Did I always have this wrinkle on my forehead?!” And I couldn’t help but think… “Wow. I really am getting older”… even if no one else seems to notice. I now know more than ever that sticking to healthy daily habits is worth its weight in gold when it comes to aging gracefully. That’s why I start my mornings with lemon water…exercise…a green drink…and fit in as many superfoods into my diet as I can. This includes a few incredible health supplements. Truvani Wild Caught Marine Collagen is the newest product in my arsenal that helps me look and feel my best. Why do I love it? Let me count the ways… Wondering how collagen can help you? You see, as we age, our body’s collagen production slows down. Like WAY down. Cutting-edge research suggests that getting more collagen into your system promotes youthful looking skin, healthy hair, stronger nails, and provides support to the body’s connective tissues and joints.* And these are just SOME of the amazing benefits. But before you run out and buy a jar of collagen pills, remember this… Not all collagen supplements are equal. Truvani’s Marine Collagen Powder comes from the skin of wild-caught fish, fresh off the coast of France and the waters surrounding Iceland as well as the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea, and other cold, Northern waters. The skin is a valuable source of collagen that often goes to waste. So, using it is good for you AND the sustainability of our food system. Some brands use farm-raised animals, that come contaminated with antibiotics and nasty substances. We don’t use shellfish or jellyfish, and we don’t source our collagen from questionable “Aquafarms.” This ensures our Marine Collagen is Non-GMO, and you don’t have to worry about forbidden chemicals or antibiotics being present that may have been used by fish farmers. Mercury-contaminated fish is a serious concern too. That’s why we test each source – before it even gets to our facility. Then we test our formula in-house and send the final product out for 3rd-party testing. This is how we ensure our product is safe and contains no harmful contaminants. These rigorous checks are simply part of The Truvani Standard. And don’t worry – just because Truvani Collagen comes from the skin of fish, it doesn’t mean it will taste fishy! In fact, you can barely taste it at all when you mix it in your coffee, smoothie, or food. It’s EASY to mix, too. The powder dissolves smoothly and without clumps in hot OR cold liquids. Plus, there’s no need to pop one of those big, nasty “horse pill” supplements: Add our powder to your morning coffee, tea, or smoothie, and you won’t forget to take it! Easy peasy. I love that I am finally able to create the healthy products I always wanted to see in stores, not just for myself – but for you too. My ultimate goal is to give you the tools you need for a healthy and organic lifestyle, allowing you to look and feel your best – for life. I can’t thank you enough for your support! Xo, Vani P.S.

https://foodbabe.com/clean-up-your-beauty-routine-how-to-find-safe-makeup-cosmetics/,Clean Up Your Beauty Routine: How To Find Safe Makeup & Cosmetics,0,"Years ago I took a hard look at all the beauty products I was using daily… everything from my shampoo, to my lotion, to my lipstick. I found that not only were most of them filled with controversial chemicals, but I was using way too many products that were not even necessary. That was a big wake up call. That’s when I decided to majorly clean up my beauty product routine. I started getting rid of risky products and slowly replaced them with the safest (and simplest) products I could find. I’m happy to say that now my daily routine is super simple and I feel so much better knowing I’m not slathering potentially cancerous chemicals on my skin day after day. Next time you’re walking down the makeup aisle at the drug store, pick up any cosmetic off the shelf – and you’ll likely find at least one ingredient that is linked to cancer. Some cosmetics contain ingredients that damage the skin and end up making you look older. Pretty ironic for “beauty” products, right? That’s because cosmetics are not regulated as strictly as food products. Companies can get away with using these risky ingredients because they have been used for years and there is not enough pressure for them to change their ways. There are safer alternatives, but it all comes down to using the cheapest ingredients to pad their bottom line – even though it comes at the expense of our health. Just take a look at what’s in some popular products, like Maybelline Great Lash Mascara, which is made with some very risky ingredients linked to cancer… Quaternium-15 slowly releases small amounts of formaldehyde, a substance which can cause cancer. The triethanolamine (TEA) is known to react with other chemicals found in beauty products, creating the nitrosamine NDELA – a carcinogen. Parabens (methylparaben and butylparaben) are endocrine-disrupting chemicals linked to breast cancer and reproductive problems. You’ll also find parabens in CoverGirl’s Clean Professional Loose Powder, but I’d say the worst ingredient in this product is the first ingredient: Talc. Talc in cosmetics can be contaminated with asbestos, a carcinogen that is especially dangerous when airborne. Talc containing asbestos is linked to lung cancer (when inhaled) and to other cancers near where it has been placed on the body. That’s why you want to avoid using talc-based makeup powders, as it can easily get into the air where you inhale it right into your lungs. Not all talc is contaminated with asbestos, and I don’t know if CoverGirl’s powders are contaminated, but I would avoid makeup made with talc as a precaution. There are safer alternatives (which I will tell you about below). Talc is a very common ingredient in powders, eye shadows, bronzers, and highlighters… so keep an eye out for it! Here you’ll find talc as a main ingredient in Neutrogena “healthy skin” concealer – but it also contains a couple other ingredients linked to cancer… “PEG” compounds in makeup can be contaminated with Ethylene Oxide and 1,4 Dioxane, which are both linked to cancer. Also, the preservative BHT is a suspected endocrine disruptor that can mess with hormones in the body – another risk for cancer. The preservative methylisothiazolinone is believed to trigger eczema and allergic reactions. According to the EWG, some research suggests that it may be neurotoxic. One of the most sneaky ingredients you’ll find in cosmetics is “fragrance”. Just like “natural flavors” in our food, cosmetic companies don’t tell you everything that is in these fragrances and they can include highly toxic ingredients, hormone disruptors, and carcinogens. They often contain alcohols, which can irritate sensitive skin and make you appear older. L’oreal’s True Match Lumi Foundation is filled with FOUR different parabens: methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, and ethylparaben… One study published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology found that methylparaben dried the skin and made it appear more wrinkled, because it decreases collagen levels in the body (which is what makes the skin look young and supple). This foundation also includes Octinoxate sunscreen, which is an endocrine disruptor that can interfere with thyroid function and may increase risk of breast cancer. Simple lip balm can be laden with risky chemicals too… Baby Lips by Maybelline is made with ingredient Petrolatum (petroleum jelly) – a byproduct of petroleum refining. If petrolatum is not properly refined, it may be contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) – a group of chemicals that are widely linked to cancer. This ingredient is commonly found in lipsticks, so make sure to check the ingredients in yours. Be careful about what you wash that makeup off with too… Most face washes use various sulfate ingredients which create that lathered up foam that makes you feel like you are getting clean… but are not exactly safe. Ingredients like sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) and ammonium laureth sulfate (ALS) may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, which is linked to cancer. You won’t see 1,4-dioxane on an ingredient list because it forms during manufacturing and the FDA doesn’t require a warning label. The preservative DMDM hydantoin slowly releases small amounts of the carcinogen formaldehyde every time you use it. Another substance you won’t find on the label. I believe exposure to carcinogens even at low levels is unnecessary – especially in products I use daily or often. Here’s how to clean up your beauty routine: All 100% PURE products are made with organic ingredients and no synthetic chemicals. Here’s why I love this brand: Even if you don’t wear makeup, they’ve got amazing shampoo, bath products, body scrubs, soaps, face creams, and moisturizers too. 100% Pure is now a partner of Food Babe and I am so happy to give you a chance to try their products (or continue using them) at a great deal.

https://foodbabe.com/why-baby-toddlers-hate-vegetables-and-what-to-do-about-it/,Why Babies & Toddlers Hate Vegetables (and what to do about it!),0,"This post might be a rude awakening for some parents and it’s not meant to be a slap in the face, but I think it’s important to share the truth about foods that are marketed towards babies and toddlers. Especially since eating a processed food diet is the #1 reason why kids don’t like vegetables. When my daughter started eating solid food, I didn’t buy any jarred baby food. I never bought a single jar of pureed peas, pureed bananas – or any of those other jars of pureed baby food. I also didn’t blend up pureed fruits and veggies at home to make my own homemade “baby food”. When I tell some people that, I can tell they are confused and wonder what in the world I fed my daughter when she first started on solids. There is an entire industry dedicated to selling jarred and pureed baby food and parents are led to believe that this is what you are supposed to buy for your baby (unless you make homemade pureed foods). Yet in my experience, babies can start with small soft finger foods and become eaters on their own. Letting a baby feed themselves after the age of 6 months is called Baby-Led Weaning, and this has worked amazingly for Harley. Harley eating green beans for the first time My Advisory Council member, Dr. Jonathan Aviv, studied the ingredients and composition of jarred baby food and discovered that even organic versions are surprisingly acidic compared to whole foods. For instance – a jar of banana baby food contains the additives “citric acid” and “ascorbic acid”, which can turn the entire jar of food acidic About 100 times more acidic than a regular banana! This increased acidity can have an effect on the digestion of food and give your baby acid reflux. Jarred banana baby food is not the same as a mashed banana. Dr. Aviv says if you see the ingredients “citric acid” or “ascorbic acid” to be wary, as it can turn the entire contents of the food acidic. You’ve got Pasta Pick-ups, Lil’ Crunchies, Arrowroot Cookies, and Lil’ Meat Sticks. With these products, the industry is helping put young children on the processed food bandwagon so that it only seems natural to them to eat food from box, bag, or jar. This is the stage that my daughter is at now – and just like I never bought her jarred baby food – I don’t buy these products either. When she sees me or her Dada pick up anything processed, she’s curious and wants a bite too – this is more motivation not to eat processed foods in front of her and keep the junk out of our house. I was pretty shocked looking at the number of ingredients on the back of this package of this Gerber toddler food…and even more shocked Gerber is allowed to produce food for small children with hidden MSG that stimulates your taste buds to the point of addiction – not to mention the mysterious “flavoring” which could mean anything and the carrageenan linked to digestive issues. Sheesh! Instead of the additive monosodium glutamate (MSG), the food industry sneaks in other additives – such as “autolyzed yeast extract” and “torula yeast” which contain free glutamic acid – the main component of MSG that makes food addicting. This is a super shady trick by the food industry that allows them to use MSG right under our noses and get us hooked on processed food. These Gerber Lil’ Crunchies are nothing more than Cheetos for babies. They seriously have almost identical ingredients to Cheetos. Instead of using monosodium glutamate in Cheetos, they sneakily use “Autolyzed Yeast Extract”. This is one of the most infuriating products out there. I’d take heed of that warning to “Keep Package Away From Children” a bit further and run… run far away from these products. I’m not the only one appalled. A reader sent me this note about Gerber ‘Lil Sticks: “I found this while grocery shopping for my baby. This was in the baby aisle and can not possibly be healthy. I can’t wait to see what your investigations turn up with baby products… What is Gerber trying to feed our kids?” Yep… just more MSG-like additives, flavors, and sugar added to conventional processed meat. Yikes. Gerber should be ashamed. Babies and toddlers can be exposed to a wide variety of vegetables from a young age without having to resort to help from processed food. This isn’t just common sense, it’s backed by science too. Researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine found that a big reason kids don’t seem to like green vegetables is because they are not nurtured to like the flavor and bitterness of them from a young age. While babies naturally love sweets, they need to be exposed to dark green vegetables on a regular basis to learn to love them. The researchers further found that a major contributor to the problem was all of these prepared baby foods out there that don’t prominently contain vegetables. Out of 548 foods they found only 52 of them were single-vegetable products and NONE of them were dark green vegetables. It’s best to start introducing vegetables right when they begin eating solids, as babies between 4-7 months are the most receptive to new tastes. When very young children eat processed baby and toddler foods they are reinforcing a love for sweet and heavily processed foods instead of for the healthiest foods on our planet… vegetables. And, I can speak from some experience. I’ve been giving Harley vegetables at nearly every meal since the beginning and she already really loves just about every single one… she even picks the kale out of her pasta and eats it before anything else. A lot of parents love squeezy packs, and I can see why. They are super convenient to travel with, don’t require a spoon, kids love them, have simple ingredient lists, and are easy to find organic. That being said, I don’t buy them for Harley. From a very young age, children develop habits and start to form opinions about food. Think about this… squeezing pureed pear into your mouth from a sanitary pouch with a spout is nothing like picking up pieces of fresh pear and putting them in your mouth. When you eat real pears, you can see it. You can feel the juicy texture in your fingers and smell it. This helps you to learn more about what you are eating and learn to love real food (versus food that comes in a shiny package with a cartoon character on it). When they see pears in the grocery store, they will start to associate them with the real pears they have been eating at home. If they’ve been sucking pears through a pouch, it’s unlikely they’ll make that connection. Offering real whole foods (whenever possible) is how you help foster healthy eating habits for life. Quite simply, even if the ingredients are simple, these are not the same as eating real food and not something I would rely on a regular basis. What is “added refined sugar”? This is processed sugar that is added to a product that isn’t part of a whole food (So, it wouldn’t include the sugar naturally found in a whole banana, for instance). Here are some common examples of added refined sugar you may see on an ingredient list: You may have heard the guidelines that say that adults are supposed to eat fewer than 25 grams of added sugar per day for good health. Well, it’s even more strict for young children. In fact, it’s recommended that toddlers under the age of two not eat ANY added sugar per day, and that the only “sugar” in their diet should include those naturally found in whole foods. Yet, the processed food industry doesn’t care – they still add refined sugar to virtually everything. Almost all of the store-bought toddler snacks out there have added refined sugar… even organic ones! Of course I always preach the gospel of eating mostly homemade, whole foods – and it’s no different when feeding my baby or toddler. But, ever since Harley was born I’ve been getting lots of baby food questions from other new parents out there looking for healthy store-bought options: “Hi Vani, My name is Tania and I am a first time mom of a beautiful 14 month old girl. Until now she has been enjoying her breast milk and solid foods 3x a day, but as she is getting older and we spend more time outdoors and with other kids, she has gotten really interested on snacking 😕 as she sees all the other kids with Cheerios and cookies… I honestly want to stay away from giving her snacks, but at the same time I want to be able to have options. It is beyond sad to see organic and non-gmo kids food brands to have “natural flavors” to their puffs, bars, etc. Therefore, I wanted to ask you (as a first time mom yourself to such a beautiful baby girl) if you have any recipes for such things or if you have discovered any store brands that you would feel comfortable giving to your daughter! Also, do you use any Food storage containers to keep her baby food warm other than what you shared on a recent post you had? Your help, as always, is greatly appreciated.” ~ Tania “I was wondering if you had any information about food choices in general for toddler diets (brand to avoid and which ones you recommend)… Any and all info on what to feed our kids would be awesome. Reality is we can’t always travel and be on the go with fresh foods and time is truly a barrier to making my own food for my child. Thank you for everything you do!” ~ Amanda Thankfully, there are some packaged options that are a better choice and are more convenient than making everything from scratch yourself. And, there are some processed foods that I buy for Harley on occasion. Here are some good options I like: “My daughter will be going to daycare come September and the daycare she will be attending provides the AM/PM snack. This would be great, however the snacks they provide include cheerios, goldfish, nilla wafers, pretzels, etc. I do not want my daughter eating processed snacks on a daily basis, and I am hoping I can send in my own snacks. However, I don’t want her to feel like she will be missing out. I was hoping you could recommend some alternatives to the snacks listed above that would be better for her but appear similar so she wouldn’t know the difference (she is only 15 months)? Thanks in advance.” ~ Alicia Whole real fruit should always be an option at day cares and if it’s not, I would lobby the management to start allowing it. But, if you’ve got no other option than packaged food, give these a try (but don’t rely on them on a regular basis when at home and have the choice): I shared a recipe for healthy Mini Muffins with vegetables that Harley absolutely LOVES. They are so quick to make and stash in the freezer for snacks… it’s almost as easy as processed food! Get the recipe for Harley’s Mini Muffins here. I hope this helps you find better choices to feed your little ones healthy foods, which will set them up for a lifetime of loving real whole food (instead of heavily processed products in a can, bag, or box). If you know anyone who has a baby, toddler, or is expecting… please share this post with them.

https://foodbabe.com/scientists-said-monsanto-chemical-was-safe-they-were-wrong-it-causes-cancer/,"Scientists Said Monsanto Chemical Was Safe, They Were Wrong. It Causes Cancer.",0,"This is Shocking news. Monsanto was ordered to pay $289 million in damages after a jury found them liable for failing to warn that their weedkiller Roundup causes cancer. This lawsuit was filed by a California man, Dewayne Johnson, who is suffering from Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma at the young age of 46. He was a school groundskeeper who regularly used Roundup, and the jury decided that Roundup caused his cancer. The jury also decided that Monsanto KNEW how dangerous Roundup was and failed to warn people about the risk. As Carey Gillam reported, the jurors found “there was “clear and convincing evidence” that Monsanto’s officials acted with “malice or oppression” in failing to adequately warn of the risks.” The judge echoed that Monsanto “acted with malice, oppression or fraud and should be punished for its conduct”. Monsanto has tried to hide the dangers of Roundup from the public and regulators for years. In 2015, the World Health Organization’s cancer arm (International Agency for Research on Cancer – IARC) declared the active in ingredient in Roundup, glyphosate, a probable human carcinogen. When this happened, Monsanto’s PR machine went into full effect. They immediately tried to discredit IARC’s decision and spin the story in their favor. The media played right into Monsanto’s hands, painting a picture that “experts” around the world believe Roundup is “safe” and that the scientists at IARC were wrong in linking Roundup to cancer. Perhaps you read this in the news… “Glyphosate has been widely considered among the safest pesticides” – NPR, March 2015 “You can drink a whole quart” of glyphosate “and it won’t hurt you” – Dr. Patrick Moore in the Huffington Post, March 2015 “Weedkiller suspected of causing cancer deemed ‘safe’” – The Guardian, July 2015 “I can tell you glyphosate is safe. The data that they look at, they cherry pick it and then they interpret the studies completely different than research who actually did it” – Monsanto scientist Donna Farmer to CBS News, June 2016 “U.S. EPA says glyphosate not likely to be carcinogenic to people” – Reuters, December 2017 “Agencies across the world say glyphosate is safe and the IARC report is a flawed analysis” – Gordon Stoner from the National Association of Wheat Growers to Reuters, December 2017 “The chemical is not carcinogenic” and it’s “less toxic than common chemicals like aspirin” – Slate, January 2018 Less toxic than aspirin? REALLY? How did so many news publications miss the truth? When the World Health Organization revealed how dangerous Glyphosate (and Roundup) could be to humans, the media quickly took ahold of Monsanto’s talking points. They listened to the lies fed to them by “experts.” Experts that may have been “paid for” by Monsanto. I’ve written about Monsanto’s Roundup and its link to cancer numerous times in the past – warning consumers that this chemical has been found in Cheerios and Ritz Crackers, and how Monsanto has been working behind the scenes to cover up its dangers… in cahoots with the EPA… ghostwriting news stories… setting up front groups… hiring trolls on social media… and enlisting “independent” scientists to further their agenda. All of these moving pieces have been working together with one goal in mind – to fool the public and our regulators so that Monsanto can keep making BILLIONS off of Roundup sales. It. Is. Disgusting. This is a personal issue for me, because I’ve been dragged through the mud by people calling me an ignorant fearmonger for writing about the dangers of Roundup and conventional agriculture (which uses Roundup extensively). Critics of mine have been saying that scientists disagree with my work and that we should trust them because they are the real experts. They branded me “Pseudoscience” because I avoid GMOs grown with Glyphosate and trust information from The World Health Organization. The truth is: Science is always evolving. How many times has something been deemed “safe” only to later find that it is making people sick? Scientists are not always right. Science is sometimes riddled with industry corruption. Scientists sometimes make big, horrible, mistakes. Just look at what Big Tobacco has done during the last 80 years, as they tried to hide the grave dangers of cigarette smoking from the public. One unethical tactic was advertising with doctors, dentists and nurses recommending packs of Camels and Lucky Strikes. The tobacco industry did this because they knew the public trusted these medical experts and would fall for the tobacco-industry talking points in these ads (the “doctors” weren’t even real doctors!) Monsanto’s playbook is the same, they use many of the same tactics – and the media has been falling for it… hook, line, and sinker. Roundup is the new tobacco. Only this time we are all smoking and don’t have a choice. Roundup is the most widely used weed killer in the history of our world – and because of this, we are being exposed to Roundup daily. It’s in our food. It’s in our water. It’s in the air. It is contaminating our environment on a grand scale. It has now been decided in court that it can indeed cause cancer and that Monsanto has known about this risk for DECADES. Sure, this $289 million dollar judgment is a drop in the bucket for a multi-billion dollar company like Monsanto… but the tipping point is HERE and I truly believe the END of this company is on the horizon. The roughly 4,000 pending Roundup lawsuits now have this amazing precedent to back their claims. These cancer victims have a better shot at winning their cases – and could cost Monsanto millions more. It starts a valid discussion around banning Roundup use in our schools, parks, communities, stores, and even nationally. More people will now be aware that Roundup is indeed dangerous and will stop buying it. That is the biggest win of all. After years of being an activist, I realized that big companies will NEVER change. They will continue to line their pockets at the expense of human beings. And that’s why I started my new company Truvani. Over the last few years, the Food Babe Army has made tremendous progress against big corporations. But I was tired of sitting back and waiting for them to change. The world needed a company that cared about the ingredients in their products, and whether or not these ingredients are safe. And my company Truvani will join the ranks of companies leading the charge. Every Truvani product will be certified organic (where applicable), because Roundup is not permitted to be sprayed on organic crops. As I know organic crops can still be contaminated with Roundup (it’s so prevalent in our environment), I’m taking it a step further in testing Truvani products for glyphosate to make sure they do not contain excessive levels. I want to do everything in my power to ensure my products are as clean as possible. This is the standard I believe EVERY company should have… Don’t you? And that’s why it’s so important to find good companies… doing the right thing… and vote with our dollars. Companies that do the right thing need our support, and maybe, one day, these big conglomerates will finally start caring about humans. I also urge you to buy certified organic food as much as possible. This is currently the most viable way to protect yourself from glyphosate – and other harmful chemicals that are used in conventional food products. It may be more expensive, but I believe it may save you thousands in medical costs down the road. Health is wealth, right?"

https://foodbabe.com/the-differences-between-artificial-flavors-natural-flavors-organic-flavors-and-other-added-flavors/,"The Differences Between Artificial Flavors, Natural Flavors, Organic Flavors and Other Added Flavors",0,"I bet if you go to your kitchen cabinet right now and pick up the first food package you see, you’ll find the word “flavor” somewhere on the ingredient list. Am I right? Yep, the processed food industry adds flavors to almost EVERYTHING. When a food is heavily processed with machinery in a factory, pumped full of preservatives, and poured into a package that gets shipped across the country to get stored on a shelf for months it loses flavor. That’s why there is a multi billion dollar flavor industry dedicated to creating chemicals that make all that processed food taste like… well… real food. Not only do these flavors make fake food taste real, they also give it a special “kick” that keep you coming back for more. The natural and artificial chemicals that flavor manufacturers engineer are contributing to what David Kessler (former head of the FDA) calls a “food carnival” in your mouth. The inability to stop eating because the flavors they have synthesized trick your mind into wanting more and more. Why do Americans eat more calories than any other industrialized nation? It’s not because we have more money or are more hungry. It’s because our food supply is chemically produced and enhanced with these “flavors” and it’s EVERYWHERE and we are being TARGETED. You see, they don’t want you to have the full essence of the strawberry – they want you to only experience the best 1 millionth part of the taste – so you get “addicted” and keep having to go back for more and more, searching continuously for gratification – eating more of that product which in turns fills Big Food Companies pockets. The Big Food Companies are “hijacking” your taste buds one by one. The term “flavors” on a package highly misleading. It sounds innocent and is on SO MANY products that we are desensitized to it. Flavor companies own these proprietary formulas… making it near impossible to find out exactly what’s in them. You’d like to think that “natural apple flavor” is just some juice extracted from an apple and inserted into the food. Nope. That “natural apple flavor” needs to preserved and stabilized and has agents added to help it mix well into a product. This is why flavors can contain upwards of 100 ingredients like propylene glycol, polysorbate 80, BHT, BHA… all considered “incidental additives” not required to be labeled by the FDA. The FDA doesn’t require companies to tell you what is in the flavors they use. It’s a complete mystery ingredient. The fox is guarding the hen house. You see, a governmental or independent agency does not approve or oversee the safety of the food flavors. Instead, a flavor industry trade group, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA), has assembled their own “independent” panel of scientists who review and approve new flavors as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS). These scientists are paid by the FEMA trade group (who ultimately get their funding from flavor companies). And, of course, these FEMA panel scientists are supposed to be independent and free of conflicts of interest, but many questions have been raised about their closed-door evaluations and lack of transparency with the public. The fact that this panel is assembled and paid for by a flavor company trade group is concerning to say the least, don’t you think? Public advocacy groups have questioned FEMA’s processes and called on the FDA to ban certain flavor substances that have known links to cancer, but little has been done. Some chemicals used to make flavors, like Diacetyl (which is used to make buttery flavor), are highly dangerous for those that work around them… but we are supposed to eat them and be okay? Consumers want to know what’s in these flavors and what research has been done proving their safety, but we essentially get the door slammed in our faces when we ask. The laws surrounding these flavors are lax to say the least, and companies don’t have to tell you much about what they really are. Labels on food typically just say “natural flavors” or “artificial flavors” and don’t explicitly tell you what differences are between them. It’s good to know that there are some stark differences between artificial flavors, natural flavors, natural strawberry flavors, organic raspberry flavors, natural essences, organic extracts, etc… And while these are all largely the same, some of the flavors added to food are better than others. So, if you’re like me and want understand exactly what you’re eating and to know more about what these labels all mean, I created this Flavor Cheat Sheet below to break it all down. Now let’s go over some real world product examples, let’s start with the worst flavors in our food… Artificial Flavors. (Note: “X” stands for a specific flavor such as “Strawberry” or “Vanilla”) Artificial flavors are chemical mixtures made with synthetic (not natural) ingredients in a lab. They’re produced by fractional distillation and chemical manipulation of various chemicals like crude oil or coal tar. Artificial vanilla flavor can be made from wood pulp. With artificial flavors, chemists can make anything taste like a strawberry without any actual strawberries (or any actual food for that matter), which is a really horrible thing if you care about health. But it’s a great thing for food manufacturers because artificial flavors are much cheaper than using real food (or even natural flavors). Natural Flavor is practically the exact same thing as Artificial Flavor, but it’s derived from substances found in nature (plants, animals, etc). So, the flavor is DERIVED from natural things, but it’s important to remember that this isn’t all it contains. Remember, flavors typically contain preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other “incidental additives”, which can make up 80% or so of the formulation. Some of the most common incidental additives in flavors include: sodium benzoate, glycerin, potassium sorbate, and propylene glycol (none of which are labeled). Chemists create these complex formulations in a lab, isolating and blending specific flavors extracted from upwards of hundreds of compounds, some of which may be GMOs. These compounds can come from substances that are nowhere close to the actual thing. For example, they might take some castoreum from a beaver to make a flavoring that resembles a raspberry – without ever using any raspberries. But, hey, it’s “natural” because it’s from a beaver. In general, if you see something like “Natural Cinnamon Flavor” this means that the flavor is derived solely from the named fruit, vegetable, animal or plant, which in this case is cinnamon. In other words, if you see “Natural Raspberry Flavor” on a product, the flavor didn’t come from a beaver, but actual raspberries. The reason food companies use this kind of flavoring is because it’s cheaper than using the actual ingredient in it’s raw form. The flavor also can be synthesized to be the best “one millionth” part of the taste of a substance – something definitely not found in nature. Incidental additives still apply, of course. You’ll see a label like this when there are both natural and artificial flavors in a product. It doesn’t necessarily mean any of the named source (ie. a cherry) is used. Sometimes on the front of a package you’ll see the statement “Raspberry Flavor With Other Natural Flavor”…which sounds redundant. This means the food contains a flavor derived from raspberries, but ALSO other natural flavors that don’t come from raspberries. This doesn’t need to be disclosed on an ingredient list, but is required on the front panel of package if they want to describe the flavor on the front. A lot of people have told me they’re surprised that organic foods can contain natural flavors. While it’s not ideal, at least “Organic Natural Flavor” is made just like other organic ingredients and needs to follow the same regulations. That means that organic flavors won’t contain synthetic solvents or preservatives, and no GMOs. Some the the “incidental additives” banned from organic flavors include propylene glycol, mono and diglycerides, BHT, BHA, and polysorbate 80. Sometimes you’ll just see “natural flavors” listed on a certified organic product (instead of “Organic Natural Flavors”). This means that the flavor itself is not organic, but it is compliant with organic regulations – such as no synthetic ingredients or GMOs. So, ultimately, these flavors will have a cleaner profile than the average natural flavor in a conventional product. In products that don’t carry the USDA Certified Organic label, but are made with some organic ingredients, they still need to use organic “compliant” flavors. This means the flavors in any product labeled as “Made with Organic” ingredients can only contain flavors that are compliant with organic regulations as far as no GMOs, sewage sludge, or ionizing radiation used, and also cannot contain synthetics or artificial preservatives. However, the flavors themselves do not need to be certified organic. An essence captures the hint of flavor from a fruit or vegetable. To make a strawberry essence for instance, they may start with a strawberry juice concentrate and heat it to collect the steam and that becomes the essence. It should contain no additives or other ingredients. An extract is as pure of a flavor you will get and the closest thing to real food. It’s similar to how you could make homemade vanilla extract by putting vanilla beans in an alcohol solution to extract out the flavor. Due to how extracts are produced, they can have some nutrients in them too. Organic Lemon Extract is derived solely from organic lemons and is in compliance with organic regulations (no GMOs, no synthetic preservatives, etc). I hope this helps you sort out all the added flavors, essences, and extracts in our food."
https://foodbabe.com/ultimate-breakfast-on-the-go-easy-protein-oatmeal-packs/,Ultimate Breakfast On-The-Go! Easy Protein Oatmeal Packs,0,"When I used to travel a lot for work, I’d always pack my own food to bring with me…While others ate junky fast food and hotel buffets (loaded with preservatives, additives, sugar, etc), I ate healthy. And it was super rewarding. Especially when it came to breakfast. I don’t like starting my day with a sugary processed breakfast. It puts me into a food coma. I need something full of nutrients to keep me focused and ready for the day. And that’s why I loved these easy “On-The-Go Protein Oatmeal Packs.” Watch This Video To Learn How I Made My Favorite “Travel Breakfast Food” Now that I’ve created my very own protein powder that is the cleanest on the market, I always use it to make these packs. Truvani’s Plant Based Protein is organic, non-GMO, and has only six simple ingredients. You won’t find nasty additives, sugar, or harmful chemicals in our protein. And, it tastes better than any other protein powder I’ve tried! But, don’t take my word for it. Here are real reviews from people who had the opportunity to taste it: “The fact that my 2 year old loves it should say everything about this product! He kept asking for “mo.” – Corinn T. “I’d give 2 thumbs up to this chocolate protein powder – all natural, very minimal ingredients, no artificial sweeteners and yet it tasted sweet and delicious. I’d definitely be happy to drink this for breakfast every morning!” – Stefani M. “I’ve tried a lot of vegan protein powders and I am very impressed with Truvani protein powder. It taste great, mixes well and the texture is nice. I’ve had protein powders that tasted chalky before and was pleasantly surprised to find that this one is not chalky or gritty at all.” – Melinda A. I know it tastes great. And that’s why we also offer a no questions asked “Love The Taste” Guarantee. Meaning, if you try our Protein Powder, and dislike the taste, just email our team and refund your order. Easy. As you see, the entire Truvani team worked meticulously for months to get our protein powder just right, and we’re happy to say it tastes AMAZING mixed in only water – it’s not chalky or lumpy like other brands. Even though it’s great on it’s own, I love to use it in healthy recipes like these Protein Oatmeal Packs. Here’s the printable recipe: I love how you can use Truvani Plant Based Protein Powder in more than just smoothies and protein drinks. Use it to bake protein muffins, pancakes, and even desserts! Knowing that I have my own clean organic protein powder makes me so happy! As I was involved in every step of its production, I know all about what went into it and how incredible this new product is. This is something that I never dreamed would happen. Remember, I never set out to create my own product line, but after years of fighting against Big Food and forcing big companies to change, I knew I had to take matters into my own hands. The only real way to make lasting change in our food system is to fight them head-to-head as a competitor. So, when you buy a Truvani product, you should know this: You will get a remarkable product, with some of the best ingredients available, and you’ll also be helping us build a company that has a big vision of changing the food industry. Truvani is still in its infancy (we have three products so far!) and those of you who have supported us this early on are helping us make more healthy products a reality. That’s why we like to reward our early supporters with preferential pricing: If you know anyone else who would be interested in trying the cleanest, best-tasting protein powder on the market, please share this post and recipe with them. Maybe you can blend up a Radiant Recharge Smoothie together and go relax at a pool. That sure sounds like a nice way to enjoy your Truvani Protein, doesn’t it? So, what’s your favorite breakfast on-the-go? I’d love to hear about it in the comments below!"
https://foodbabe.com/the-horrible-stuff-in-protein-powder-is-it-in-yours/,The Horrible Stuff In Protein Powder (Is it in yours?),0,"My favorite protein powder got recalled. And you’re never going to guess why… Unlike most recalls, it wasn’t contaminated with an allergen… And they also didn’t find some deadly bacteria in it… Nope, it was much worse. Okay, maybe not worse, but I was completely disgusted. They found rat droppings in it. Gross, right?!! This was years ago, before I really got deep into investigating food. I’ve since learned that rat droppings are not the only crazy, disgusting (and super unhealthy) substance found in protein powder. After I did a deep dive into protein powders, I realized that most of them were full of nasty things that I never want to eat. Which is really surprising for something that’s considered a health food, right? Almost everyone has a tub of protein powder in their house, do you? Go grab it and let’s go over what to watch out for… Over 90% of the soy produced in this country is GMO and contaminated with Roundup herbicide. And if that’s not bad enough, there’s another reason why you should avoid it: When soy is isolated to just its protein state, it becomes severely denatured and can cause hormonal disruptions because of the excessive amount of estrogen contained in it. Soy also contains an abundance of phytic acid, which leaches calcium and other vital minerals from your body. There are healthier forms of plant-based protein, which I’ll get into later in this post! Whey protein isolate is highly processed, and that’s why I suggest you avoid it. Here’s how they do it: Most whey protein isolates start from ultra-pasteurized “Monsanto Milk” raised on GMOs, antibiotics, and other drugs. This milk is then exposed to acid processing, which strips out alkalizing minerals and naturally occurring vitamins and lipids. This processing makes whey protein isolate overly acidifying in the body. And, chronically consuming whey protein isolate without appropriate balance of alkalizing foods can acidify your body, which over time can increase your vulnerability to degenerative disease. Artificial flavors are chemical mixtures made with synthetic (not natural) ingredients in a lab. They’re produced by fractional distillation and chemical manipulation of various chemicals like crude oil or coal tar. Artificial vanilla flavor can be made from wood pulp. Want your protein drink to taste like strawberries? Blend it with some real strawberries! Natural Flavor is practically the exact same thing as Artificial Flavor, but it’s derived from substances found in nature (plants, animals, etc). But that’s not all! Flavors typically contain preservatives, emulsifiers, solvents and other “incidental additives”, which can make up 80% or so of the formulation, even the “natural” ones. None of these are disclosed on the ingredient list. All of the top 10 plant-based protein powders on Amazon contain natural flavors, so this is hard to avoid… but I’ll show you how, keep reading! Sugar is addictive, makes you fat, tired, depressed, age faster, makes your skin dull, weakens immunity and when consumed in excess causes all sorts of diseases. It’s added to protein powders in many different forms – you’ll see ingredients listed like corn syrup solids, fructose, maltodextrin, dextrose, and sometimes just sugar. The good news? You don’t need sugar to make a protein drink taste sweet. Real food does the trick too… read on for more info on that! Acesulfame Potassium and Sucralose are the two most common found in protein powders. Although they have no calories, research finds they stimulate your appetite, increase sugar cravings, and promote fat storage and weight gain. Both of these additives have been linked to cancer in animal studies too, so it’s really not worth the risk. To make erythritol most manufacturers start with genetically engineered (GMO) corn and put it through a complex fermentation process to come up with chemically pure erythritol. Sugar alcohols like this can harm healthy gut bacteria and function, which leads to a whole host of diseases and if you’re trying to lose weight or stay slim, keeping your gut healthy is vital! Erythritol is also known to cause diarrhea and stomach upset. This thickener and emulsifier is widely known to cause digestive problems and intestinal inflammation. It’s also linked to cancer, as tests have found as much as 25% degraded carrageenan in “food-grade carrageenan” (the kind used in protein powder and other foods). Degraded carrageenan is classified as “Possibly carcinogenic to humans” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. This anti-caking agent and thickener is usually made from wood, because it’s cheap. Research links consumption of this additive (not naturally occurring when found in whole food) to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. Refined vegetable oils like soybean oil, canola oil, and sunflower oil are added to many protein powders as a defoaming and thickening agent. These oils go through an insane amount of processing with chemical solvents, steamers, neutralizers, de-waxers, bleach and deodorizers, and unless organic, are extracted with the neurotoxin hexane – it’s literally bathed in it. Brown rice is often contaminated with arsenic, a highly toxic substance classified as “Carcinogenic to Humans” by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Arsenic is even found in organic brown rice, so you need to be very careful about the source and make sure it’s been tested. You’ll find brown rice in many plant-based protein powders, but there are safer plant-based protein sources, which I’ll tell ya all about in a minute! Vitamins are healthy, right? Not if they are made in a lab from a variety of sources like coal tar, petroleum or GMOs. These vitamins differ from their natural counterparts, in that they aren’t believed to be absorbed by your body as well as naturally present vitamins that you get from whole food. You’ll see these listed on the ingredient list like: Vitamin A Palmitate,Thiamine (vitamin B1), Riboflavin (vitamin B2), and Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C). Want vitamins in your shake? Blend in some leafy greens and berries. Real food is always best. Most protein powders are packaged in plastic tubs that contain toxins like bisphenol A (BPA), which can leach into the food. This was evidenced in recent tests that found BPA in 55% of protein powders. This substance is linked to birth defects, cancers, and neurological disorders. What kind of packaging does your protein powder have? Most protein powders on the market are not certified organic. That means they likely contain GMO ingredients and most definitely are tainted with synthetic pesticides that are potentially toxic with long-term exposure. Pesticides used on conventional farms are hormone disruptors, neurotoxins, or reproductive toxins which are strongly linked to many diseases and health issues. The whole basis of organic farming is to produce food without the need to use toxic pesticides. Crops are managed in a way that prevents the need to use these risky chemicals. This is why choosing certified organic protein powder is very important. Heavy metals (like lead, cadmium, and mercury) accumulate in the body when you are repeatedly exposed to them and are highly toxic, particularly to the brain. This isn’t an ingredient that you’ll find on an ingredient list because heavy metals are substances that contaminate ingredients, similar to pesticides. Certain ingredients are more likely to be contaminated with heavy metals, and plant-based protein sources are often contaminated… and not always labeled as such on the packaging. I know this from personal first-hand experience (keep reading, as I’ll tell you what happened!) Remember how I told you they found rat droppings in my old favorite protein powder? At the time I remember thinking, “Maybe one day I’ll make my own protein powder.” Well… That day has come! Truvani Plant-Based Protein Powder is here… Truvani’s new protein powder is made with 6 simple ingredients… In this short video, I explain what makes these ingredients so special… Our unique protein blend of organic pea, hemp seed, and pumpkin seed protein creates a complete plant-based protein that is easy to digest and is smooth (not chalky and lumpy like the other brands!) We also avoid the plastic tubs that other protein powders use to avoid BPA contamination. Let me tell you, creating this clean protein blend has been an exhaustive process… it was near impossible to find plant-based protein sources that met my standards. Even though so many of you asked me to create a protein powder, I actually thought we’d never be able to create this product. Here’s why… We have strict criteria each ingredient supplier must meet before we’ll consider using them and then we hold them accountable by independently testing their ingredients. For instance, our ingredients need to be not only be certified organic and non-GMO, but they need to pass heavy metal testing as well. We reached out to 52 ingredient suppliers and most of them failed our initial questioning. The few that did pass sent over a sample for testing… and each source failed the heavy metals test. And there was one ingredient in particular that gave us the most trouble… Organic Pea Protein. Every sample was coming back contaminated with LEAD. I couldn’t believe it. This was a COMMON ingredient found in many other Plant Based Protein Powders. Why was it so hard to find a clean version? I felt so defeated. Pea protein was essential to the protein blend I wanted to create and so we kept searching and testing. I’m happy to say that my tenacity paid off! We FINALLY found a pea protein that passed. Can you imagine how relieved I was? And, you’ll NEVER guess why it passed! I explain how our pea protein is different and passed the heavy metals test right here. The bottom line is: No one tests ingredients like Truvani does. And that’s good news because that means our protein powder is the cleanest you’ll find anywhere. And unlike other clean protein powders you may have tried in the past, it tastes GREAT– even when it’s just mixed with water! But don’t take my word for it. Here are real reviews from people who had the opportunity to taste it: “The fact that my 2 year old loves it should say everything about this product! He kept asking for “mo.” – Corinn T. “I’d give 2 thumbs up to this chocolate protein powder – all natural, very minimal ingredients, no artificial sweeteners and yet it tasted sweet and delicious.

It’s fantastic in recipes too and when you place an order for the new Truvani Plant-Based Protein Powder – It’s not just for smoothies and protein drinks. I’ll show you how to use it to bake protein muffins, pancakes, and even desserts.

I created Truvani on the belief that we should have real food without added chemicals, products without toxins, and labels without lies. Simple, really. You shouldn’t have to compromise on health. Or taste, for that matter. Other companies claim to be “clean” or “natural.” At Truvani, we really mean it. Our new Plant Based Protein is: Lock in the lowest price and order our new Plant Based Protein powder with free eBook here.

https://foodbabe.com/the-cleanest-organic-plant-based-protein-powder-is-here/,The Cleanest Organic Plant-Based Protein Powder is here!,0,"People always ask, “Vani, what protein powder do you recommend?” I have tried so many, and none of them met my ingredient standards. And they tasted bad, too. Some were chalky. Some were way too sweet. Some were just plain gross. I knew I eventually wanted to create my own protein powder, and I’m proud to say the time has come. I created an organic Plant Based Protein Powder that I fully stand behind, and I LOVE IT. It’s the best tasting powder I’ve ever had, and I know it’s the healthiest. In this video, I share what inspired me to start working on this product in the first place. Something awful was found in a protein powder I used to like… it’s a weird (and disgusting) story… Read all about the ingredients in Truvani’s Plant Based Protein here + learn how you can save up to 35% with special Launch Pricing! It has just 6 simple ingredients that are certified USDA organic, non-GMO, and vegan. Each ingredient was hand selected by me and the Truvani team. We tested each of them for heavy metals, and they lived up to our standards. And believe me. This testing is important. Many companies claim to use high quality ingredients, but I’ve discovered this isn’t always true. Even though many of the ingredients found in our Plant Based Protein Powder are relatively common, the quality of our ingredients are much better. I’ll prove it… When I was sourcing ingredients for this product, I contacted 52 separate sources. Most of them failed our initial questioning, and the few that passed sent over a sample for testing… and each one failed the heavy metals test. And there was one ingredient in particular that gave us the most trouble… Organic Pea Protein. I couldn’t believe it. This was a COMMON ingredient found in many other Plant Based Protein Powders. Why was it so hard to find a clean version? Each time another failed source came back I felt so defeated. Then we finally found ONE supplier who did something unique with their Organic Pea Protein, and it made all the difference. It has a much better texture that mixes perfectly in water with no chalky feel in your mouth. What makes our Organic Pea Protein different? I tell the rest of the story here. The bottom line: No one tests their ingredients as thoroughly as Truvani does. It’s just that important to us. I never set out to create my own product line, but I got sick and tired of playing “whack a mole” with these Big Food companies. The world needs a company that actually cares about the products they create. And even though it means I have to be careful in some ways, it also means I can start hitting these companies where it hurts the most… their bottom line. Remember, at Truvani we believe in real food without added chemicals. Products without toxins. Labels without lies. We will be transparent with our ingredient sourcing and pick the best ingredients available. Always. So, when you buy a Truvani product, you should know this: You will get a remarkable product and you’ll also be helping us build a company that has a big vision of changing the food industry. Be one of the first to try Truvani Plant Based Protein Powder right here. I can’t thank you enough for your support!"
https://foodbabe.com/announcing-my-next-book-feeding-you-lies/,Announcing My Next Book: Feeding You Lies,0,"My mom called yesterday and said “Have you turned it in yet?” – I responded with a big “YES! It’s done.” And we both rejoiced. I have been heads down for the last year working on something very important. I’m so thrilled to announce that I just turned in the manuscript for my next book!!! My new book, Feeding You Lies: How to Unravel the Food Industry’s Playbook and Reclaim Your Health, will officially hit stores in February 2019. The research in this book is cutting edge and I couldn’t be MORE EXCITED to get this information in your hands. This book is very different from my first, The Food Babe Way… In Feeding You Lies I expose the shameless lies we are being fed about our food by the very people we should be able to trust for health information… lies about its nutrient value, effects on our health, label information, and even the very science on which we make our food choices. It’s investigative, hard-hitting, and scandalous. If you love my food investigations, you definitely will love this book. Here’s what it covers: Want to be one of the first to read it? You can pre-order a copy now. Get it locally near you here or at Barnes & Noble or Amazon When you pre-order, the book will be shipped to you to arrive on the release date – so you’ll be one of the first people to get it and won’t even need to make a trip to the store. Your early support means a lot – it will send a message to bookstores everywhere to carry this important book. We’ve got to get this out there so we can expose the food industry lies once and for all. If the food industry felt threatened by my first book, they aren’t going to know what hit ‘em when Feeding You Lies hits stores. This book will change you forever. It did that for me, I’ll never look at food the same way again."
https://foodbabe.com/mini-zucchini-banana-muffins-no-added-sugar/,Mini Zucchini Banana Muffins (No Added Sugar!),0,"I’ve been wanting to share this recipe for a long time! Harley’s been eating these Zucchini Banana Mini Muffins up and the best part? They have no added sugar! I always have a batch of these ready in the freezer for a quick snack or to add to one of her meals. They take minutes to thaw out in a toaster oven and she loves them! They are super moist, taste absolutely delicious and perfect for kids and adults. Did you know toddlers under the age of two are supposed to avoid ALL added refined sugar? The only “sugar” in their diets should come from the sugar found in whole foods (like the sugar in a whole banana for instance). Yet, the processed food industry doesn’t care – they still add refined sugar to virtually everything. Almost all of the store-bought toddler snacks out there have added refined sugar, natural flavors and other processed ingredients I don’t want my daughter eating on a regular basis… even organic ones! I try to give Harley vegetables with every meal, and thankfully she loves them. If your kids aren’t veggie lovers yet, the zucchini in these muffins is a great way to sneak in some veggies, you don’t even know they are there. Just make sure to buy organic zucchini to avoid those that are GMO. When I bake for Harley, I often use organic oat flour – it is unrefined and a good source of fiber and nutrients. Oat flour is made from just 100% whole oats. In fact, if you can’t find oat flour at the store you can make your own by placing organic steel cut or rolled oats in a food processor or spice grinder and pulsing until it has become a “flour-like” consistency. To make these Zucchini Banana Muffins, start by preheating the oven to 350 degrees. Then measure out one and half cups of oat flour into a medium-size glass bowl. Whisk in a teaspoon each of cinnamon and baking soda, a quarter teaspoon of baking powder, and half a teaspoon of sea salt. Mix until well combined… In a larger separate bowl you’ll add all the wet ingredients… two eggs, half a cup of applesauce, a mashed banana, a cup of grated zucchini, and a third cup of organic butter or coconut oil… I haven’t tried it, but you can use “flax eggs” to make these muffins vegan. For each egg (remember there are two in this recipe) simply mix together one tablespoon organic ground flaxseed with three tablespoons water (Let it sit for 15 minutes to thicken before using.) Whisk the wet ingredients just until combined… Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until just combined. Resist the urge to overmix the batter… Using a small ice-cream scoop makes this next step super easy. Line a mini muffin pan with non-bleached paper liners or grease your muffin pan with coconut oil. Fill each cup only three-quarters the way full so they don’t overflow… Place them in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes until done. You could probably make these in a regular-size muffin pan too. For that, the baking time will be about double (I would say 20-22 minutes). Let cool slightly before eating to ensure the muffins stay together. I know it’s hard to wait… but it’s worth it! Store extra muffins in the freezer. You can reheat them in a toaster oven or oven… or let them thaw overnight in the fridge or on the counter the day you want to eat them. I hope your family loves these muffins as much as we do. If you know anyone looking for healthy snacks for their kids, please share this recipe with them!"
https://foodbabe.com/how-i-lost-the-baby-weight/,How I Lost The Baby Weight,0,"First of all, I should let you know that I debated calling the title of this post something different. In fact, the title of this post makes me cringe a little. The Food Babe lifestyle has never been about the number on the scale, nor do I ever want it to be. I also don’t want to encourage any feelings of self-doubt about body image for new Moms. Feeling good after having children should not come at the price of obsessing about weight, or trying to get your “pre-baby body back” because if you are a mom – you know your body (and mind and spirit) has been changed forever. Becoming a mom has been the greatest thing I have ever achieved in my life – nothing will ever come close and no extra weight on my body will ever take away the joy I have from giving birth and getting to spend time with my little girl. But there is a reality of wanting to look and feel like your best self again and this post is all about that. When I became pregnant I didn’t know what exactly would happen to my body. I spent so much time over the years cultivating habits that made me feel healthy, energetic and vibrant… and then all of the sudden I was nauseous, had the burps, and was tired all the time. Although I had a great pregnancy – I felt pretty good and didn’t really have much to complain about – let me tell you, I was no longer feeling my best! For example, I suddenly found myself hating to cook because everything smelled funny (only in my first trimester – thank goodness) and hating to travel (my favorite hobby!) Sitting in an airplane seat was the most uncomfortable position ever! I realized that the symptoms I was experiencing were just caused by everything the body goes through while creating a little human. You know, you’re making a baby after all… and so of course you’re not going to feel like your normal self. This was a bit of an adjustment for me, but of course was all worth it. Fortunately, I was able to workout all the way up until I gave birth which I know helped keep my mood stable, digestive system happy, my circulatory system working great and kept any swelling down. I did a mixture of weight-lifting, walking and light cardio throughout my pregnancy. I was around 155 pounds when I gave birth, gaining about 35 pounds during my pregnancy – I also developed varicose veins and had new cellulite on my legs. After I gave birth, I was head over heels obsessed with my baby (and still am!). That obsession took priority and helped me not worry too much about how I looked after giving birth – although to be honest, it was always in the back of my mind, I wanted to get back into my old clothes. I always envisioned myself as an active and fit mom – someone that will be able to keep up with my kids, climb mountains and run around. Instead of going on a fad diet, I kept my focus on making sure I was getting appropriate nutrition so that my breastmilk would be as nutrient dense as possible without harmful chemicals. Making sure my breast milk was clean of processed chemicals and other toxins kept me from eating badly. The health of my baby comes first, so it was great motivation. I did this by eating an organic and unprocessed diet, avoiding packaging as much as possible – and as a result, the extra pounds I gained during my pregnancy came off without having to do anything special (the varicose veins and cellulite vanished too). By 5 months postpartum, I was already back into my pre-pregnancy clothes which I was very happy about but at the same time, my hair started falling out. This was FREAKY. Every time I took a shower and washed my hair, it was like a murder scene! I had to wear my hair up for weeks so my daughter wouldn’t be covered in it while she breastfed. I had a lot of postpartum hair loss on the top front of my head, but thankfully after two months, it stopped falling out and started to grow back. All that lush pregnancy hair was gone but thankfully my hair is almost back to normal and it was only temporary (and completely normal according to my doctor). And now a year later, I’m down another 10 pounds, but that wasn’t my goal. My goal wasn’t to be thin, it was to feel good. Feeling good as a mom means I have good energy, a good mood and can do all the million things I need to do without getting stressed out. Eating clean, unprocessed food makes me feel so good! If you would have asked me over 10 years ago, “Can I lose 40 pounds after pregnancy?”, I’d tell you that I thought it would be MUCH more difficult and maybe not possible. I’d be counting every calorie and caught up in the old mentality that I had about food. Focusing on the quality of my food helped my weight struggles vanish for good and stopped that yo-yo state of dieting I always used to find myself in. Above are candid selfies of 40.5 weeks pregnant and 1 year later in the same nursing bra. I also debated not sharing these, considering the comments I might receive, but nothing can be worse than what I have already experienced online sharing my life. I am proud of my healthy body post-pregnancy that continues to nourish my baby through breastfeeding and no one can take that away from me. If you are wondering how and what I ate, I’ve put together a free E-Book for you. I hope this helps all you new Moms out there feel the best you can feel! Here’s a sample of my after-pregnancy life, along with recipes and a meal schedule. Simply enter your email below: 1. Consistency 2. Take Walks And Exercise 3. Make Good Use Of Your Slow Cooker To make your prep and cleanup time as quick as possible, use a small slow cooker. For breakfast, I would throw all the ingredients in a slow cooker the night before and wake up to a delicious and nutritious meal. Once you clean out the slow cooker from the morning, feel free to do the same with soup for dinner. Add some chopped vegetables, spices, protein and stock to the pot and set on low for 8 hours. Get over 50 of my favorite slow cooker recipes here. 4. Plan Out Your Snacks One of the easiest ways to sabotage your success is lack of planning. Snacks are one of those areas where if you’re not careful you can easily overeat or eat foods that will promote weight gain. Take 5 minutes at the beginning of the week to ensure you have stocked your pantry or refrigerator with healthy snacks such as chopped vegetables, nuts or nut butter, brown rice crackers, etc. 5. Soup Is Your Best Friend If you know anyone who’s struggling to lose the baby weight or is currently pregnant and worrying about it, please share this post with them. I want all mothers out there to know that this is nothing to focus on other than getting the best nutrient dense food into your body!"
https://foodbabe.com/healing-turmeric-hummus-10-more-turmeric-recipes/,Turmeric Hummus + 10 Healing Recipes!,0,"As you know I launched my new product company Truvani this year. It’s been a wild ride and very exciting – not to mention, seriously stressful at times. To source the best ingredients, it takes time, money and a lot of trial and error. We are in the process of developing new products, but in the meantime, I wanted to share this brand new amazing free eBook we put together about Turmeric (full of brand new recipes!) It’s my gift to you. You can download it right here. I’ve been getting a ton of questions about turmeric lately. Like, how I cook with it… what makes it healthy… what are different ways to use it… etc. In this new 35-page eBook, called The Ultimate Guide to Turmeric, I answer your questions and give you 10 New Recipes that make it easy to add it to your everyday diet. I also explain why turmeric is an ingredient that I like to eat daily! I’ll also give you 8 simple ways to use turmeric at home and in your food, some of which you’ve probably never considered (…like using it to whiten teeth!) Plus, you’ll learn the 12 core benefits of turmeric that help to make me feel amazing and vibrant. This eBook is jam packed with valuable information! I hope that you learn to love turmeric as much as I do. To give you a little taste of some of the beautiful recipes from this eBook, I’m sharing the Healing Everyday Hummus recipe below. Doesn’t it look amazingly delicious?!… I’ve been making my own hummus for many years. I don’t buy the premade stuff for lots of reasons… namely, most brands are made with inflammatory soybean oil or canola oil and simply don’t taste anywhere near as good as fresh homemade hummus does. Hummus is very nutritious if made fresh and can be a great pick me up that replaces processed junk in vending machines at work or pre-packaged “health” bars. It’s got a combo of protein and fiber to keep you from craving junk. I love to snack on hummus with red bell pepper, carrots, or celery sticks almost every day. It’s too easy. The best part? This turmeric hummus just takes 10 minutes to make. You just throw it all into a food processor or blender and blend! I love healthy recipes that are quick and easy… don’t you? After you make this hummus (or any of these new turmeric recipes), I’d LOVE it if you’d share a pic on social media by tagging me @TheFoodBabe with the hashtag #Truvani. I can’t wait to see your creations and all the beautiful pictures."
https://foodbabe.com/you-wont-believe-this-new-fast-food-packaging/,You Won’t Believe This New Fast Food Packaging!,0,"When I first started this blog (7 years ago), I had no clue what an adventure it would be. I had no idea that anyone besides my own friends and family would read what I wrote. I certainly never knew that my investigations would inspire some of the largest companies in the world to change their ingredients and become more transparent. I was shocked when I investigated the food I was eating and saw what was really in it. And once I realized the food that I was eating, wasn’t actually real food but full of processed chemicals, my health began to soar! Reading ingredient lists and knowing what’s in your food is one of the most important things you can do to protect your health. When we ask what’s in our food – companies should tell us. Period. We all deserve to know exactly what we are eating. That’s why I was pumped to hear what the new restaurant chain The Organic Coup is doing. The Organic Coup was the first certified organic fast food chain and has quickly grown to 12+ restaurants. It is even in Levi’s Stadium where the San Francisco 49ers play. I can’t wait for them to be on my side of the country! The founders Erica Welton and Dennis Hoover are formerly from Costco and spearheaded bringing organic offerings there, helping to make it the largest organic retailer in America. Although The Organic Coup had their ingredients published online since inception, now when you eat there, there will be no question about what you are eating as it will be RIGHT THERE when you get your food. I know of no other restaurants who are doing this, and I think this is remarkable. Wouldn’t it be awesome if all chains did this? If a restaurant wants to be a leader in the industry, they should have nothing to hide. Unfortunately that is not the case. Many big restaurant chains refuse to tell you what is in their food if you ask, let alone publish the ingredient list online. The FDA doesn’t require restaurants to disclose this information, so they are given a free pass to hide their ingredients from consumers. Restaurants will tell you that they won’t disclose ingredients for “Proprietary” reasons… as if they’re worried a competitor will steal their recipes. We all know this isn’t the real issue. The biggest restaurant chains like McDonalds, Subway, Taco Bell, and Burger King have had full ingredient lists published on their websites for years. Nonetheless there are some big holdouts. Big chains like Bojangles, Shake Shack, Quiznos, Panda Express, and Sonic Drive-In downright refuse to disclose what’s in their food (except for allergen info). When we called Little Caesars corporate offices last week, they told us they wouldn’t disclose the full ingredient list in their pizza unless we had a DOCTOR contact them. Isn’t that ridiculous?!! Is there a doctor in the house who wants to give them a call and get the ingredients for us? Other big restaurant chains like Red Robin will eventually provide ingredients if you call and pester them to death… but most customers don’t have that kind of tenacity. These restaurants serve millions of customers who have no clue what they are really eating. Years ago, one of my first big investigations was into Chipotle. They called themselves “Food with Integrity” – yet at first, they blatantly refused to tell me what was in their food. I found this astonishing, and of course, felt compelled write about it. I made it loud and clear on my blog that no one should trust a company that is not willing to disclose their ingredients. I wrote, “How can we trust Chipotle’s definition of ‘Food with Integrity’ when they refuse to post their ingredients or send the information to customers who ask?” People got so angry and frustrated that they stormed Chipotle’s social media pages. Someone even started an online petition on my behalf to pressure the company into being honest about how their food was prepared. We gathered 2,000 signatures almost immediately. Ultimately, this petition came to the attention of Chipotle’s corporate offices and the next thing I knew they were contacting me and agreed to publish their ingredients on their website. This was a huge win for consumers! As you can see – putting pressure on companies to change their practices leads to actual results. Consumer activism and demanding transparency is very effective. We together are changing the food system and I could never do this alone. This simple action can make sweeping change and takes very little effort. To give you an example… here’s a message that I just sent to Shake Shack this morning. I will be sending similar messages to the entire list of chains below. Feel free to copy what I wrote, or make it your own… but please take a minute to ask your favorite restaurants to do the same: “Please publish the complete ingredient list for your food on your website. Customers are increasingly seeking ingredient information because they are concerned about food additives and their relation to health, or have other allergies and food sensitivities that are not provided on your allergen statement. Without full ingredient disclosure, consumers are left in the dark, which prevents them from eating at your restaurants. Most big restaurant chains like KFC, Subway, McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Burger King, publish their complete ingredient lists online. I simply ask that you do the same. I thank you in advance for listening to your customers and doing the right thing.” Here’s a list of contact information for popular chains that refuse to publish their ingredients online. Pick one (or a few) and join me in asking them to be transparent and publish their ingredients: Over the last few years, we’ve convinced some multi-billion dollar corporations, like Chipotle, Starbucks, and Anheuser-Busch, to finally publish their ingredients for the first time in history. And, we can do it again! Everyone deserves to know exactly what he or she are eating and our job will not be done until we all have this information. Also, take a moment to thank The Organic Coup for spearheading the transparency movement by putting their ingredients right on the package. You can find them on Facebook here. Thank you for being warriors of change along with me!"
https://foodbabe.com/carrot-cake-muffins/,Carrot Cake Muffins,0,"These carrot cake muffins make a fun breakfast or snack on the go, but you can also frost them like cupcakes to make a festive Easter treat! They’re gluten-free and have no added refined sugar, but are super moist and delicious. I can’t wait to bake another batch… they don’t last long in my house! These Carrot Cake Muffins are a great replacement for those heavily processed carrot cakes found in supermarket bakeries, which are loaded with sugar and additives. Sugar, Carrots, Cream Cheese (Pasteurized Milk And Cream, Cheese Culture, Salt, Carob Bean Gum), Bleached Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Soybean Oil, Vegetable Shortening (Palm Oil, Soybean Oil, Mono- And Diglycerides, Polysorbate 60, TBHQ and Citric Acid, Eggs, Pineapple, Pecans, Raisins, Semi-Sweet Chocolate (Sugar, Chocolate Liquor, Cocoa Butter, Butter Oil, Soy Lecithin, Vanillin, an Artificial Flavor), Modified Food Starch, Baking Soda, Cinnamon, Natural And Artificial Flavors, Salt, Baking Powder (Corn Starch, Bicarbonate of Soda, Sodium Aluminum Sulfate, Acid Phosphate of Calcium), White Syrup (White Syrup (Corn Syrup, Water, Fructose, Natural And Artificial Flavor, Salt, Potassium Sorbate, Natural Color (Glycerine Nd Beta Carotene), Yellow 5, Yellow 6. Yikes. It’s really not worth your health to buy pre-made cakes like that. Oat flour is unrefined, full of fiber and compounds that help to reduce inflammation in the body. Oat flour is made from just 100% whole oats. In fact, if you can’t find oat flour at the store you can make your own by placing organic rolled oats in a food processor and pulsing until it has become a “flour-like” consistency. I also use almond flour in these muffins, but if you want the recipe to be nut-free, you can omit the almond flour and increase the oat flour to 2½ cups. They’ll be just as delicious! To get started, turn your oven on to preheat up to 350 degrees and get out a large mixing bowl. Add all the dry ingredients to the bowl (oat flour, almond flour, baking soda, baking powder, sea salt, and ground cinnamon) and whisk it all together until well combined… Pull out a smaller mixing bowl and crack in one pastured egg. Or, you can use a “flax egg” to make it vegan. Simply mix together one tablespoon organic ground flaxseed with three tablespoons water (Let it sit for 15 minutes to thicken before using.) Whisk in one mashed banana, half a cup of maple syrup, 3/4 cup almond or coconut milk, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. One quick way I use to mash the banana is by breaking it into chunks and placing it in a measuring cup. I then use a whisk to mash the banana down. Mix it all together well… Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix gently, just until combined… Take about three medium sized carrots and shred them until you have 1¼ cups. Fold the carrots into the batter… Line a cupcake pan with liners and fill each cup until it’s about three-quarters of the way full… Before I stuck them in the oven I topped each muffin with shredded coconut and pecans, but you can use any toppings you like. You can make a homemade streusel or top with cream cheese frosting after baking for a more decadent dessert. Bake in your preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. I know once you smell ’em, you’re gonna be excited to take a bite, but it is best to let these muffins sit for a little while after taking out of the oven to cool completely so they don’t fall apart… don’t say I didn’t warn ya! Are you going to enjoy these muffins for breakfast or frost them for a treat? Let me know in the comments! And, please share this recipe with your loved ones."
https://foodbabe.com/lush-bath-bombs-not-think/,Lush Bath Bombs Are Not What You Think,0,"If you read ingredient lists like me, I hope that doesn’t stop at just food. Food chemicals are nasty, but the skincare and cosmetics industry is even worse. The FDA doesn’t regulate cosmetics as rigorously as pharmaceuticals or food – allowing companies to get away with using potentially harmful ingredients that are banned in other countries. Many cosmetics, lotions, soaps, and body scrubs contain toxic petrochemicals made from oil, known carcinogens, reproductive toxins, and neurotoxins. If you’ve got teen girls at home, it’s a pretty safe bet you’ve heard of Lush bath bombs. It’s not just teens going crazy for their wide array of colorful bath bombs, lotions, and soaps, but adults are too. Lush has a full line of products all claimed to be “handmade”, “fresh”, “natural”, “cosmetics with nothing to hide”… Unfortunately when a company markets themselves like this, many people buy up their products without considering what the ingredients are, and that can be a huge mistake. Do you have any Lush products or have kids begging you for a bath bomb? A member of my team was telling me how she’s freaking out about the Lush bath bombs her daughter’s buying because she doesn’t think they’re safe. “Please reinvestigate Lush boutique. There is such a craze going on with our preteens and even adults at that bath/body boutique. The salespeople are usually uneducated on what the products contain. They just say they are “all natural” blah blah blah and stick to their script. I read the ingredients of some products quickly that contained carrageenan and food dyes. Please educate everyone on this.” ~ Jonna H. “I am constantly working to change the products in our home into something healthier with no chemicals, but that isn’t always easy. I have become so frustrated lately at how deceiving products are. I used to love the company Lush until I found out they use parabens and sulfates and gosh knows what else. I feel like they are so misleading because you walk into the store and supposedly everything is natural and fresh.” ~ Wioletta I was instantly suspicious the first time I saw what a Lush Bath Bomb does to a bathtub full of water. You throw that chalky bomb into your bath and watch it slowly dissolve and fizz, while it releases a rainbow of swirls and glitter into your bathwater. It’s pretty cool looking…but the idea of soaking my body in a brightly colored concoction of chemicals isn’t my idea of a good time. To me, a bath should be a healing experience and not one that could put my health in jeopardy. Artificial dyes made from petroleum – Those famous Lush Bath Bombs are loaded with synthetic dyes like Yellow 10, Blue 1, and Red 28, which are readily absorbed by shaven skin where they can go right into your bloodstream. These dyes can be contaminated with carcinogens. Blue 1 has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and some research suggests it’s a neurotoxin. Do you really want to soak your entire body in potential carcinogens and neurotoxins? You’ll find these in some: Lush Bath Bombs, Soaps, Lipsticks, Fresh Face Mask, Luxury Bath Oil, Massage Bars, Bubble Bars, Shampoo Bars, Shampoo, Shower Jelly, Scrubs, and Fun. Parabens – Preservatives like propylparaben and methylparaben are endocrine-disrupting chemicals linked to breast cancer and reproductive problems. Parabens can be absorbed by the skin. There are brands using safer preservatives, and there’s no reason Lush can’t too. Using a small amount doesn’t protect you because endocrine disruptors are known to have a big effect at very low levels of exposure. You’ll find these in some: Shampoos, Conditioners, Cleansing Lotions, Eye Creams, Shaving Cream, Lotions, Masks, Scrubs, Eyeliners, Moisturizers, Skin Tint, Eyeshadows, Mascara, Hair Treatments, and Toner. Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) – May be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, which is linked to cancer. You won’t see 1,4-dioxane on an ingredient list because it forms during manufacturing and the FDA doesn’t require a warning label. I don’t like the idea that something I wash my body with can potentially cause cancer over time. I believe exposure to carcinogens even at low levels is unsafe – especially in a product you wash your entire body in or use daily, like shower gels and soap. You’ll find this in some: Shampoos, Shampoo Bars, Shower Gels, Bubble Bars, Shower Jelly, Fun, Bath Bombs, Shower Creams, and Soaps. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) – If you have dry itchy skin and dandruff, this could be the culprit. SLS irritates the skin and scalp by stripping away the natural oils that protect it. You’ll find this in some: Soaps, Shampoo Bars, Conditioners, Solid Conditioners, and Hair Treatments. Triethanolamine (TEA) – Particularly dangerous when combined with products that contain SLS (see above). That’s because when SLS combines with TEA it creates the nitrosamine NDELA – a carcinogen. This is a chemical cocktail that you don’t want to combine on your skin (such as using soap with SLS and then spreading on moisturizer with TEA). You’ll find this in some: Body Conditioners, Shaving Creams, Scrubs, Skin Tint, Color Supplements, Styling Creams, Eyeliners, Eyeshadows, Mascaras, Scrubs, Lotions, and Eye Creams. PEG Compounds – When you see “PEG-100” or other “PEG” compounds on the label, these can be contaminated with Ethylene Oxide and 1,4 Dioxane, which are both linked to cancer. You’ll find this in some: Shampoos, Shampoo Bars, Bath Bombs, Bath Oils, Solid Conditioners, Hair Dressings, Facial Scrub, and Beard and Facial Wash. Fragrance – It sounds so innocuous, but it’s not. Just like “natural flavors” in our food, cosmetic companies don’t tell you everything that is in these fragrances and they can include highly toxic ingredients, hormone disruptors, and carcinogens. My team contacted Lush and they said when you see “fragrance” listed as an ingredient on their website in black this means it contains some synthetic ingredients – but they could not disclose what they were. You’ll find this in some: Bath Bombs, Soaps, Shampoos, Conditioners, Shampoo Bars, Fun, Bubble Bars, Lotions, Masks, Cleansers, Shower Gels, Hair Treatments, Shaving Creams, Bath Oils, Scrubs, Deodorant, and Dusting Powder. “The fragrances we use in our products are our very own unique creations, so for that reason we don’t provide an ingredient list for them on our website. They’re never petroleum or alcohol-based and we blend each fragrance by hand, using the highest-quality and most ethically-sourced essential oils and synthetic fragrance components (such as Synthetic Musk) to achieve our products’ unique personalities. Anytime you see the word “fragrance” printed in black that indicates that some part of it has a synthetic component. If it is a blend of purely natural or organic oils, it would be written in green.” ~ Email from Lush Customer Care If you’re worried about the chemicals in your food, the skincare and cosmetics industry is even worse. You’ve got to be your own advocate when it comes to what you slather on your skin. The FDA doesn’t regulate cosmetics as rigorously as pharmaceuticals or food – allowing companies to get away with using potentially harmful ingredients that are banned or not used in other countries.

https://foodbabe.com/whats-healthiest-fast-food-burger-chain/,What’s The Healthiest Fast Food Burger Chain?,0,"If you’re careful about what you eat, you probably don’t frequent chains like McDonald’s or Burger King, but where do you go when you want a burger? There are several higher-end and “farm-to-table” burger chains popping up, advertising their “all natural”, “organic” and “grass-fed” burgers. So I had to find out, are they really legit? Are they serving GMO ingredients? Do they really serve grass-fed burgers? Or, is their meat really just from a filthy factory farm with a slick marketing campaign? After investigating how food is produced and raised in this country, one of the first commitments I made was to stop eating “factory farmed” meat. That’s why I usually opt for veggie burgers and vegan dishes when eating at restaurants, where almost all the meat is “conventionally” grown on a factory farm. Whether I’m eating at home, a friend’s house, or at a restaurant – I try my best not to eat meat unless I know it wasn’t grown in some dirty feedlot in horrible conditions. Most cattle in this country live crammed together in inhumane living conditions (aka “factory farm”), subsisting on a diet of chemical-laden GMO grains (instead of grass) which makes them bulk up fast for mass production and an early slaughter. They are further fattened up with added hormones (linked to cancer), growth stimulating drugs, and antibiotics – a system fraught with numerous environmental and health problems. When you eat conventional meat, you’re probably eating hormones, antibiotics, resistant bacteria, steroids, and chemicals created by the fear and stress suffered by the animal during slaughter. This is NOT how we should be raising animals for food. These animals are not healthy. And when we eat animals that are not healthy – we become unhealthy. If you want to change the food industry, your body, and get healthy, you have to make the commitment to stop eating conventional (factory farmed) meat. Raising cattle on grass takes too long for the typical factory farm. When cows are raised on grass, they aren’t eating “Roundup Ready” GMO corn and candy like Skittles to fatten them up insanely fast. Cows’ digestive systems are not designed to easily process starchy foods like corn and candy, and these can make conventional cows sick. That’s one reason why grass-fed cows are rarely given antibiotics. They are less likely to get sick, spending more time outdoors and not in a crowded and filthy feedlot. Sustainably raised grass-fed beef is also less likely to harbor deadly bacteria, such as E. coli and S. aureus (a bacteria that produces a toxin that is not easily destroyed by cooking). 100% grass-fed cows are fed grass and forage that grows on the pasture during the growing season, and during the winter they’re fed hay and compacted grass. This has a major effect on the nutrient composition of their meat. These cows produce meat with significantly more omega-3 fatty acids and almost twice as much CLA (a fatty acid that is good for you and associated with fat loss). It’s also packed with more vitamins A and E than conventional beef. Sometimes “grass-fed cows” are moved off the pasture and into a feedlot where they’re fed GMOs and live in the same horrible conditions as conventional cows before slaughter. Meat from these cows can still be called “grass fed” because this term is not properly defined by the USDA. That’s why ultimately you want to look for meat that is certified 100% grass-fed and finished. Unfortunately most restaurants do not serve 100% grass-fed burgers and there is a lot of greenwashing going on – so you’ve really got to do your homework and search them out. You’ve got Shake Shack’s “100% all-natural Angus beef”… Five Guys “handcrafted” burgers… Red Robin’s “gourmet” burgers… Smashburger’s “fresh, never frozen beef”… That all sounds nice, but be aware that terms like 100% pure beef, all-natural, Angus, gourmet, free range, and handcrafted really don’t tell ya a whole lot. These terms DO NOT mean… According to USDA regulations, you can call your meat “Natural” if it’s minimally processed and has no artificial ingredients in the meat itself. This applies to most fresh meat, so that’s why the natural label doesn’t mean much. As for “Certified Angus”, this is just a breed of cattle that has met some quality requirements, none specifying how the cows were raised. When a hamburger has “100% pure beef” that simply means that no other meats were added to the burger patty – it’s just beef. In all these instances, this beef could be (and likely is) conventional. Don’t fall for these marketing terms! Instead, look for burgers made with organic ingredients and 100% grass fed and finished beef. Shake Shack – They admitted to us, “our beef is produced within the conventional farming industry and is not GMO free”. Although they never use hormones or antibiotics, it is still grain-finished. They refused to provide complete ingredient lists for their food, but confirmed the ShackSauce contains canola oil (high risk GMO ingredient) which is “not listed as “non-GMO.” Something to note: I always refuse to eat at any establishment that hides their ingredients from consumers. Smashburger – The beef at Smashburger is “pasture-fed corn finished”. That means it is not 100% grass-fed. And, it may have been raised with hormones and antibiotics. They told us, “There may be hormones used in the growth of the beef cattle. We do not specify or source hormone free beef. Antibiotics may be used in both our ground beef and chicken as a precautionary step to prevent illness. They are not used as part of a regular or routine process. We do not specify that either product be antibiotic free.” What they are sprinkling on top of those burgers is not very good either. Smashburger’s burger seasoning is packed hidden MSG additives like hydrolyzed proteins and yeast extract, which cause you to eat more than you should and are linked to health issues. They sent us the ingredients in their food (oddly listed in alphabetical order), but you can see their burgers are PACKED with controversial additives… (and see what’s in their fries here)… Five Guys – The beef is grain-fed. They told us via email their beef comes from cattle “mainly raised on corn” and “a diet… that includes vitamins, corn, and etc”, who “will be administered Anabolic Steroids only if the animal gets sick and needs to be nursed back to health”. When pressed for more information on antibiotics, Five Guys said animals may receive antibiotics if sick and not “without good reason”. They only provided a partial ingredient list for their buns, claiming their bread is “proprietary”, but admit it’s “not GMO free” and contains soy. Carl’s Jr. – Contacting Carl’s Jr. was like talking to a brick wall. They did not respond (at all) to multiple undercover emails and phone calls. They apparently do not want to discuss their meat which makes me want to run far away from this place and never look back. We were told when we called that they’re in the process of discontinuing their “All-Natural Burger” (which was made with grass-fed beef without hormones, steroids, or antibiotics) – so now you’ll only be able to buy their burgers made with conventional beef. No thanks. Just look at all those nasty additives and high fructose corn syrup in their burgers… Red Robin – According to Red Robin’s website, “Our Gourmet Burgers are made with all-natural, domestic, Government-inspected beef.” In other words – it’s conventional. They told us, “We do not mandate our suppliers to use GMO free food. We also do allow our suppliers to treat sick animals with antibiotics.” The Red Robin sesame seed buns are filled with high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil. The Habit Bar & Grill – The beef is “corn fed”, not grass fed and not organic. They refused to provide ingredients in their burger, but we were able to confirm that the seeded bun contains soybean and cottonseed oils (both high risk GMO ingredients). In-N-Out Burger – The meat comes from one of the largest factory farms. I posted a video of what it looks like on Instagram – check it out here. Critics call it “cowschwitz” because thousands of cows can be seen crowded and walking in their own excrement. After our investigation and working together with consumer advocacy groups, In-N-Out told the media that they’re phasing out routine antibiotics – but there is no timeline. They still do not publish their ingredients online and hide the ingredients in their burgers. Culver’s – I recently asked on Facebook where you like to get burgers, and this spot was the winner. I’m really sorry to say that Culver’s burgers come from cows that live in a feedlot during the last few months of their lives, where they are given hormones and eat corn/grain diets. They also may be administered antibiotics if deemed necessary. Culver’s buns are also made with high fructose corn syrup, soybean oil, and additives like DATEM and artificial flavors. Umami Burger – The beef is grass fed, but grain-finished. Umami said that although they have “antibiotic free” meats available from their supplier, they don’t request those and “most of them use antibiotics”. Although they don’t use MSG additives in their food, they wouldn’t provide us with a list of ingredients. Elevation Burger – They are doing the right thing as far as their meat goes in sourcing 100% organic grass-fed beef and organic chicken… but I hate to tell ya that the rest of their burger ingredients are pretty horrible. I was incredibly disappointed to find that only their meat is organic, and their buns and toppings are full of additives. Elevation’s buns and sauces are not verified Non-GMO, so they may contain GMOs. They really could do better by cleaning up the ingredients, stopping the use of soybean oil in practically everything, getting those artificial colors out of their sauce, and serving organic buns. Elevation Burger’s “Veggie Patty” isn’t a good option either because it’s not organic and spiked with “autolyzed yeast extract” a hidden form of MSG. A better option is their organic “Vegan Patty”, but ultimately if I ate at Elevation burger, I would stick with their Elevation Salad (sans their dressing) instead of a burger. You could top that with organic grilled chicken tenders or an organic burger without the bun and toppings. Another option would be a lettuce wrapped burger, without the Elevation Sauce. BareBurger – The meat is completely grass-fed and finished and not given antibiotics or hormones. But, where I really get hung up is on their buns. Corporate offices didn’t respond to several emails asking for the ingredients in their bun, whether it is organic, and if they use any GMO ingredients. One restaurant told us the buns are NOT organic. Another restaurant told us the brioche buns contain sugar, margarine, soy oil, and canola oil which are all high risk GMO ingredients. I’d say the healthiest option is to wrap your burger in a nutrient packed organic collard leaf (they have this option) and skip the bun. Beware that they serve the “Impossible Burger” as a vegan option which is made with SLH (soy leghemoglobin), a new protein made in a lab with GMO yeast. This protein has never been in our food before and even the FDA has questioned its safety. B.Good – They are transparent about their suppliers and use (partially) grass-fed beef without antibiotics or hormones. That being said, sadly they are not organic and their beef is grain-finished. Their buns are also not organic and contain GMO sugar. B.Good is doing some good things and are far better than most chains, but I would love to see them go organic and 100% grass fed. I personally love their salads and bowls. BurgerFi – The meat is grass-fed and grain finished, and they never use antibiotics or growth hormones. We have contacted them for ingredients and will update when we hear back from them. Next Level Burger – This vegetarian burger place uses organic buns and toppings, but beware that not everything is organic. Their “house-made” burger patties are organic, but the “meaty patty” is not. I want to love this place, but they said their ingredients are “confidential and proprietary”, so we have no clue what additives may be lurking in there. (We are still trying to obtain ingredients (we contacted the owner), and will update this post if they disclose). Amy’s Drive-Thru – This vegetarian 100% organic fast food place is pretty great (but with reservations). They provide ingredient lists at the register, so you can see exactly what you’re ordering. They are good in a pinch, but beware their burgers contain some unhealthy ingredients like hydrolyzed soy protein and soybean oil. Farm Burger – The beef is 100% grass fed and finished and never fed antibiotics or growth hormones. Their buns are not organic, but they are baked locally without additives. They also have amazing chicken burgers! I hope you’re lucky enough to have one of these in your area, I love this place. True Food Kitchen – For their beef burgers, they use sustainably-raised 100% grass-fed beef and an exclusive Dave’s Killer Bread bun. They did tell us though that the bun is not organic and that they follow the Dirty Dozen for their produce. When I’m traveling I love to eat here. I personally prefer to eat their turkey burger. Seek out local farm-to-table restaurants in your area. If that isn’t an option, your best bet is to buy some grass-fed beef from local farmers or Butcher Box (my partner) and make burgers at home. Butcher Box is offering an exclusive $10 off + 2 lbs grass-fed ground beef free (for a limited time to new customers). If the answer is NO, it likely was raised on some grains or GMO feed. You can also ask: Our demand for beef is escalating out of control and the only way that we can transition to more sustainable farming methods is for all of us to eat less meat. Let’s all stop eating factory farmed burgers together, okay?"
https://foodbabe.com/3-ways-use-truvani-turmeric/,3 Ways To Use Truvani Turmeric,0,"One of the most unique qualities of our Truvani Daily Turmeric Supplement is that the tablets are uncoated, so you can use them in recipes at home. This is great for people who have difficulty swallowing tablets, or simply don’t like popping pills. This supplement is REAL FOOD after all. This is just one way that Truvani Turmeric is so remarkable and different from other supplements on the market. Not to mention – the first USDA Certified Organic and Glyphosate Residue Free turmeric on the market! In this new video, I give you three delicious ways to enjoy your Truvani Turmeric… Simply pop a turmeric tablet in a mug and pour over it with hot water to instantly make hot turmeric tea. Tea is something that I enjoy daily and is one of my favorite rituals. This tea is great when you are traveling too – the tablets hardly take up any room in your bag and are so easy to drop in hot water at the airport or wherever you are! Add up to three tablets (per serving) to virtually any of your favorite smoothie recipes. I love adding superfoods like turmeric to my smoothies to get the most nutritional punch that I can. This citrus smoothie is satisfying and almost like a decadent creamy milkshake – but super healthy! This soothing drink is perfect before bedtime. It’s really relaxing and helps to take the edge off. I like to drink my golden milk like a little dessert after dinner and that’s why I add maple syrup to it. You can take out the maple syrup if you want, or use coconut sugar or honey instead – any of those would be equally delicious. You can buy just one bottle, but I’m also giving you an option to get a deep discount. When you set up a monthly subscription order, you’ll automatically get a new bottle of Truvani Turmeric every month – so you’ll never run out or have to go online to reorder. Here’s where you can set up a discount subscription order. At Truvani, we don’t want to “just” create a turmeric supplement. We want to create a complete line of products with ingredients you can trust. And your support is making this a reality without raising money from outside investors. If you’ve already ordered, I thank you immensely. It means the world to me. I am literally jumping out of my seat with excitement about the new products we’ve got in the works right now.

https://foodbabe.com/one-biggest-regrets-heres-im-now/,One Of My Biggest Regrets. Here’s What I’m Doing About It Now!,0,"I hope by now you’ve heard the big news. I’m launching my own product line called Truvani and my first product is officially available to purchase next Monday… Yeah!!! I chose our first product very carefully. I wanted it to be something that I already use and love. I wanted it to be something that was nutrient dense and could benefit health. I really wanted it to be something that could help a lot of people. These are some of the many reasons why I chose to create the first ever USDA certified organic, glyphosate residue-free turmeric supplement. Turmeric has been a normal, everyday part of my life for as long as I can remember. I grew up in one of the only Indian families in Charlotte, North Carolina. Turmeric was a staple in the many masalas my mom has made over the years… it’s stained our counter… and fresh turmeric root was often in our grocery shopping cart (even though most people I knew outside of my family probably didn’t know what it was!) Turmeric is at the foundation of Indian cooking and culture that has been passed down to me from my mother, which I hope to pass on to my daughter as well. I dug up some old family photos to help share with you how my love for turmeric has grown in recent years… First, it is anti-inflammatory*. The active ingredient in turmeric is curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory that helps maintain healthy inflammation responses*. This is my personal favorite reason why I love this product and plan to take it daily. It is also beneficial in promoting overall joint and heart health, while supporting weight loss and helping the body produce more radiant and healthy-looking skin*. Turmeric’s powerful antioxidant properties fight excess free radicals in the body that can damage cells and diminish health*. As you can see, there is a lot to love about turmeric! It helps me feel healthy and vibrant – and I plan to continue taking it for the rest of my life. My journey here at Truvani has led me down a path that I never dreamed I go. I am finally able to create the same healthy products that I always wanted to see in stores, not just for myself – but for you too. My ultimate goal is to give you the tools you need for a healthy and organic lifestyle, allowing you to look and feel your best – for life. Next week, we start out with the official launch of our Organic Daily Turmeric Supplement. Your support means the world to us."
https://foodbabe.com/im-launching-company-truvani/,Why I’m Launching My Company Truvani,0,"I’m embarking on something bigger than anything I’ve ever done in my life. I’m changing direction and Big Food isn’t going to know what hit them. As you know – I’ve spent the last few years being an activist. You stood by my side along with the entire Food Babe Army, and we helped shape a safer, more transparent food system. It’s been amazing. We’ve signed petitions. We’ve voted with our dollars. We’ve shared the truth about what’s in our food. We’ve forced some of the most iconic food brands into changing their ways. But, I’ve come to realize this isn’t how we win. As Mahatma Gandhi once said, “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” And he’s right. We will never get a truly safe and healthy food supply by simply demanding that Big Food change. And that’s why I decided to go head-to-head with Big Food. It’s a new direction, but it’s the right move. Here’s how I plan to fight the food and chemical industries in 2018: The food industry has treated us like idiots for far too long, and quite frankly, I’m sick and tired of it. When Big Food sees what we’ve got in store for them this year, they’ll be shaking in their boots. I wish I could be a fly on the wall in their board meetings as they discuss what we’re working on now… If you want to boycott Big Food, I’m making it easier for you. I’ve told you for years that voting with your dollars is one of the most important things you can do to change the food system. Now, I am finally able to create the healthy products that I always wanted to see in stores, not just for myself – but for you too. Your support will make this possible. Next week, we start out with the official launch of the first Truvani product. Are you as excited as I am?"
https://foodbabe.com/creamy-cauliflower-soup-toasted-pine-nuts/,Creamy Cauliflower Soup With Toasted Pine Nuts,0,"If you love creamy soups, but don’t care for all the butter and heavy cream… cauliflower is your new best friend! This is a dairy-free soup recipe that I re-engineered in a healthier way from a cookbook many years ago and it is still one of my favorites. When you blend cooked cauliflower with vegetable stock, it makes an amazing creamy base for virtually any soup without the traditional “cream” – and it’s extremely healthy and delicious… To make this soup a bit richer and creamier, I also added some culinary coconut milk. There is so much flavor from the spices and coconut that you won’t believe this soup is dairy-free! You just need a few basic ingredients, most of which you probably already have in your pantry. Start by dicing up a couple onions, a few cloves of garlic, and a large head of cauliflower. The soup will be blended later, so don’t worry too much about how pretty your chopping is! Saute the onions and garlic in coconut oil for a few minutes. Stir in the spices and cook a few minutes longer… mmmm… smells so good! Then you just throw in the cauliflower and steam it in the pot for about 15 minutes. Pour in the coconut milk and vegetable stock and simmer until all the veggies are completely cooked. It’s best if you have an immersion hand blender like this one to puree the soup. You just pop it in the pot and blend away, instead of pouring hot soup into a blender and making more dirty dishes. After it’s well blended, carefully ladle the soup into bowls and top with toasted pine nuts. I recommend that you don’t leave out the pine nuts. They add a depth of flavor to die for!!! This recipe is so versatile too. Feel free to add in some protein or diced veggies to make an even heartier soup. Here’s the printable version of the recipe… Have you ever made “creamy” soup without dairy before? What ingredients did you use? Let me know in the comments! If you know anyone who would love a healthy soup recipe that’s full of flavor like this one, please share this post with them."
https://foodbabe.com/healthier-birthday-cake-one-year-old/,Healthier Birthday Cake For My One Year Old,0,"This month we celebrated my daughter Harley’s first birthday. Watching her turn one has been the highlight of my life. She loves to read books, listen to music, is almost walking, still breastfeeding 6 times a day (sometimes more and still in the middle of the night) and took her first sips of organic raw green juice just recently (she loves it, of course!) I am such a different mom than I ever imagined being… To say I am attached to her is an understatement! I take her wherever I go, including business trips and can’t imagine ever leaving her. When it was time to plan her 1st birthday, I didn’t follow the “guidelines” they suggest in parenting books. They say not to invite a lot of people, or have too many decorations, and to keep it low key, etc. I did the opposite, oops! I invited all her friends, rented out one of our favorite organic restaurants (Pure Pizza) and decorated the whole place with her favorite barn yard animals she loves to play with and sound out. The whole birthday turned out beautifully, she loved seeing her family and friends and we had so much fun. Harley especially loved playing with the PIG balloons – her favorite part! (The balloons are still flying around our living room as I type and she wakes every morning excited to play with them). For her cake, I decided to make Harley her own special one-of-a-kind cake with organic ingredients that I knew she liked to eat. We haven’t introduced wheat quite yet, so the base was made with organic oat flour. To make oat flour, you can simply grind any kind of oats in a spice grinder or buy it pre-packaged. I also thought long and hard about whether or not to use “REAL” sugar for the icing on her cake, and instead of being completely obsessive and coming up with icing that didn’t have any refined sugar, I decided to go old fashioned and use powered sugar creamed together with butter and vanilla to pipe some flower like decorations onto her cake. I wasn’t planning on her eating that much of the icing but then of course I couldn’t predict what happened at the birthday party either. At the party, after we sang Happy Birthday and blew out her candle, Harley’s grandma (my Mom!) took the white icing off of her cake and put it directly into her mouth! And of course… Harley loved it. Haha. So my daughter had her first taste of refined sugar on her birthday – Something I bet you thought would never happen! At least it was organic homemade icing, right?! Which reminds me to say – the Food Babe lifestyle isn’t about deprivation or guilt – it’s about enjoying the foods you love the healthiest way you know how while living a normal fun-filled and stress-free life! Since, sharing this photo below earlier this week on Facebook and Instagram, a lot of you have asked me to share the recipe, so here it is! I hope your little ones love it too! I used this tiered cake pan for the mold of her cake. Harley loves feeding me… even on her birthday! If you know a mom or dad looking for a healthier cake for their child, please share this recipe! This recipe is great for adults too! I personally loved eating this cake with Harley and plan to make it again for my birthday coming up soon."
https://foodbabe.com/get-sugar-cravings-control-feel-better-fast/,How to get your sugar cravings under control and feel better fast!,0,"There is one ingredient that has been brought up to me many times that I haven’t spent a lot of time covering, but given the state we are in with so many food industry deceptions happening, I needed to do more than just write an article about it. This ingredient is considered “natural” too. I read your comments and emails to me every day and listen to the problems you’re having trying to break away from the processed food industry – and the NUMBER ONE issue you’ve expressed to me is your struggle to tame cravings and avoid SUGAR. Sugar is the most prevalent food additive – found in about 80% of food at the grocery store! Isn’t that insane? The industry adds sugar because they know it’s addicting and it’s a cheap way for them to hook us on their products. And are we ever! You might be thinking, “Well, I don’t eat very much sugar” and that what I’m saying doesn’t apply to you. Almost all of us have fallen for this trap – including myself! Even if you are eating an organic diet, you could still be sabotaged by sugar every day if you’re not careful about the foods you choose. That’s because even foods that you think have zero sugar added to them (like yogurt, salad dressings, a can of vegetable soup or tomato sauce) can be loaded up with added refined sugars. Also – you might be thinking – but, I only eat “organic sugar or honey, or maple syrup, etc”… Organic sugar of course is better to buy because it’s non-GMO and hasn’t been doused with synthetic chemicals linked to cancer – but organic sugar is still sugar. Just because it is organic sugar doesn’t mean you can throw caution to the wind! I asked them to write down how many grams of added sugar they are eating per day. Here are some results sent in: “Breakfast Coffee w. creamer – 10g sugar part of a bagel – 6g Snack candy – 28g Lunch Tortellini with marinara sauce – 8g orange – 9g tea w/ honey – 34 Dinner Hamburger on bun with ketchup – 6g sweet tea – 6 g green beans – 2g TOTAL – 109g WOW! I’m shocked.” – Leslie “Out of curiosity I counted my simple, what I thought was healthy, Organic Vanilla yogurt, Organic honey, & GF Chex granola breakfast…. wait for it…. 66 grams of sugar!!!!!!!!! What the???? Had NO idea! Never gave it a thought. Thank you! I think.” – Brooke “I was averaging about 45 grams of sugar a day, then today at work someone brought a ginormous gift basket of a variety of cookies (chocolate chip walnut, peanut butter, oatmeal, etc.). While I was still full from breakfast I was fine at turning it down. Then when lunch time hit and we were all on break I fought in my head back and forth and decided to let myself have one. Cuz I was hungry. And didn’t have any food with me. They were convenient, free, everyone was eating them, they looked, smelled, and tasted delicious, “I’ve been so good for so long,” etc. etc. I was done for. I ended up having 3 more. And then felt sick afterwards. Today my sugar count is at 105 grams. It’s crazy how addicting sugar and white flour is. And how slippery that slope is.” – Tristan “Just under 100. I believe that’s still more than twice what is recommended for men. From cheese, to bread to meats of any kind, try avoiding sugar. I believe it’s now being pumped into the air.” ~ Jon “I had my 8th grade students write down everything they ate and drank for the entire day. We looked up sugar content for these foods and added it all up. Only after getting their totals did I ask them to look up what was recommended for their age group. I had students with over 200-250 grams of sugar! Yikes.” ~ Deborah “Wow, my appetite is down and I must have had almost 46 grams of sugar today! Some of that was from a teaspoon of raw honey in my tea and from a smoothie made with 1/2 a 450ml Bolton Farms Blueberry Goodness and a banana. I also had 14 oz of lentil soup with a tsp of balsamic vinegar added. For dessert, a Kashi Oatmeal Dark Chocolate Cookie and two coconut wrapped date rolls and 12 oz of unsweetened almond milk.” ~ Ted “Approximately 1 million, lol!” ~ Emily “How much sugar did you have today?” “Too.” “Two what?” “Too much.” ~ Glenn When I tracked my own sugar intake a couple years ago, it was a real wake up call! I was SHOCKED at how much added sugar is hidden in everyday “healthy” foods in my own house. I honestly couldn’t believe the results and it freaked me out considering how carefully I eat. I’m human, just like you, and I love sweets! For most of my life, I was addicted to sugar. As a result, my health suffered a lot too. My teeth were awful, my skin was a mess, my body was inflamed, my energy was low and I was overweight. I’ve found that eliminating added sugar from my diet to be the fastest way to lose weight and get super healthy, but that is just scratching the surface. What added sugar does to your body is scandalous. All the excessive sugar in our diets is one of the biggest perpetrators increasing the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, liver disease, and cancer – but its detrimental effects can take years to surface. It’s the hidden link to so much pain and suffering – AND it makes you feel and look awful!!! Asking you to eliminate every type of “sugar” from your diet is just crazy – any person trying to do this will fail in the long run. The key is to still include sugar in your diet but get it in forms that your body can easily assimilate and from whole food sources that also provide nutrients, minerals and vitamins your body will use. If you develop this habit and practice it on a regular basis, you’ll be less likely to go overboard when presented and tempted with refined sugary desserts. Even more, you’ll naturally eat less sugar in the long run because your body is getting real nutrition from the food that hasn’t been chemically altered. Eventually… you’ll develop a distaste for refined sugar and your desire for ultimate nutrition will become intuitive. I know from personal experience… once you eliminate added sugar from your diet, your health soars. You have more energy and your skin glows. Your risk of chronic disease decreases greatly. Getting rid of this ingredient could literally save your life! Sugar is an enemy that prevents us from achieving optimal health and the fit bodies we want. If you care seriously about your health (and if you don’t you should!) it’s time to put on the brakes and focus on how much sugar you are really eating. If you’ve tried to quit sugar in the past with no luck, it’s not your fault or a lack of willpower on your part. Sugar is HIGHLY addictive. In one scientific study, scientists compared the addictive properties of sugar and cocaine. They put groups of rats in two different mazes. In one maze, the rats could choose to go to a room filled with sugary Oreos or a room filled with bland rice cakes. In the second maze, the rats chose between a room where they were injected with cocaine or a room where they received saline injections. Can you guess which rooms the rats chose? As you’d expect – the rats chose the rooms filled with Oreos and cocaine. But the scientists were shocked by what happened next… When they examined the brains of the rats at the end of the study, they found that the rats who indulged on Oreos experienced MORE activation in the pleasure center of their brains than the rats injected with cocaine (well known to be one of the most addictive drugs in the world). I developed an innovative program with my team to help you detox from all that toxic and addictive sugar in your diet. I will show you that you can take control of your cravings, enjoy more energy, fewer mood swings, and even lose weight. The best part? It only takes 7 days!

https://foodbabe.com/food-revolution-wins-2017-happened-whats-next/,Food Revolution Wins in 2017… What Happened and What’s Next,0,"This year has been LIFE CHANGING and full of adventures and surprises. Two big developments happened in 2017, in case you missed it… #1 – First and foremost in my heart, I became a mom. Harley was born in January and being her mom has brought me the greatest joy I’ve ever experienced. My biggest hope is that when she’s all grown up, our food will not look like it does today – full of synthetic additives and dangerous pesticides. This has strengthened my resolve to keep fighting for a safer food system. #2 – I (finally!) launched my own product line, called Truvani. This is how I will fight the food industry in 2018. Keep reading below for more on this! One thing I like to do at the end of the year is remember all the great things that the last 12 months have brought us and how far we’ve come. All the work we are doing, sharing information, asking companies to change, spreading the word about the dangers of GMO crops, synthetic pesticides, and chemical additives, and choosing to buy organic food at the grocery store is working. I’m so proud of my fellow activists and the Food Babe Army! At times it can seem like our food is just getting worse or that good changes take FOREVER, but the truth is that we are winning the battle and I truly believe we’ll win the war. Girl Scouts launch first non-GMO cookie (January 2017) – The Girl Scout S’mores sandwich cookie sold in some markets is made with verified non-GMO ingredients. Will there be more next season? They also added a GMO label to their other cookies, giving more transparency to consumers. Along with other amazing activists, we called them out in 2016 for their use of shady ingredients and GMOs and it’s time for them to clean up their act! Frito-Lay makes Organic Doritos (February 2017) – Two years ago, we asked Frito-Lay to go organic and over 20k of you signed this petition. Organic Doritos still contain “natural flavors”, so although I won’t be eating them, I am super excited that the industry is creating more organic products and heading in the RIGHT direction. Earth Fare removes GMOs from store-brand products (February 2017) -They transitioned more than 500 products to non-GMO and are launching hundreds more. In-N-Out Burger nixes cottonseed oil in some locations (February 2017) – The Food Babe Army called out In-N-Out for using cottonseed oil last year and this post was shared thousands of times because of you. They have since replaced cottonseed oil with non-GMO sunflower oil in some locations. Bojangles’ Chicken & Biscuits is stopping routine antibiotics (February 2017) -Thousands of you signed this petition asking Bojangles’ to disclose their ingredients and stop using chicken raised on routine antibiotics. I joined arms with consumer advocacy group U.S. PIRG to deliver our combined petition signatures totaling more that 12,000 to Bojangles’ headquarters in Charlotte. The following day, they sent us an email and told the press that “tremendous progress is being made toward eliminating their use of antibiotics important to human medicine by 2020.” A whistleblower inspired by our petition contacted us and we were able to publish never before disclosed ingredients for Bojangles here. Nestle commits to dropping artificial colors (March 2017) – They announced plans to remove artificial food dyes from all their products (not just candy) by 2020. Chipotle becomes the first national restaurant chain with no added colors, flavors, or preservatives (March 2017) – They have really come a long way since I first wrote about them in 2012. Papa John’s begins testing organic ingredients (April 2017) – Back in 2014 when I first investigated pizza chains, Papa John’s was VERY secretive about their ingredients and used some very controversial additives. Since this investigation went viral – Papa John’s has removed some of these additives and started sourcing antibiotic-free chicken for their pizzas. They also published ingredients on their website (although it is not entirely complete). And now they’re testing organic ingredients! Let’s keep pushing them to go organic all the way – their cheese and meat should be a top priority. KFC finally moves to eliminate antibiotics (April 2017) – KFC commits to eliminating antibiotics important to human medicine from its chicken by the end of 2018. Given that they’re such a huge chain, this will make a big impact! KFC would not have taken this action if it wasn’t for the hard work of fellow activists at the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), U.S. PIRG, Food Animal Concerns Trust (FACT), Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), Consumers Union, and the Food Babe Army, who have been asking them to make this change. Fazoli’s restaurants removes synthetic additives from all their food (April 2017) – Say bye-bye to artificial food dyes, nitrates, artificial sweeteners, sodium benzoate – and all the other 81 artificial additives that Fazoli’s got rid of. They completed this move in April at all of their ~220 locations. New food label launched to help you avoid glyphosate weedkiller in your food (April 2017) – I’m so excited about the new Glyphosate Residue Free label by my partner The Detox Project. In 2016, tests found glyphosate in many popular American foods…Cheerios, Stacy’s Pita Chips, Ritz Crackers… even some products that are organic and non-GMO! My reporting on this was my most shared post of 2016, with millions of views. It struck a chord with so many of you and for good reason. That’s why this new food label is a real game-changer! Baskin Robbins and Dunkin Donuts move to ditch artificial colors (May 2017) – All those brightly colored donuts and ice creams may not be healthy, but at least they no longer will contain artificial colors derived from petroleum like Yellow #5 and Red #40 which are linked to hyperactivity in children, cancer, and other health problems. Both brands will remove artificial dyes by the end of 2018. Caribou Coffee eliminates caramel color, artificial colors, flavors, high fructose corn syrup from their brand (May 2017) We called out Starbucks for the use of caramel color and synthetic additives in their drinks and our reporting went viral, causing them to change… and now other big coffee companies are cleaning up their act too. California to slap warning labels on Roundup weedkiller as a substance known to cause cancer (July 2017) – Following the ruling by the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic to humans, California added it to added to California’s list of chemicals that can cause cancer. This is the active ingredient in the world’s most popular herbicide Roundup. Hopefully this warning label brings more awareness and that Roundup becomes ancient history! Campbell’s leaves the biggest food industry lobby group – the Grocery Manufacturer’s Association (July 2017) – Campbell’s CEO said the move was “not financial” but rather “driven by purpose and principles”. She also said they want to be “the leading health and well-being food company” who provides transparency to their customers. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, is guilty of spending millions of dollars fighting GMO labeling campaigns and lobbies for policies that support junk food brands who fill their foods with artificial additives. Looks like their actions are starting to bite them! Glyphosate weedkiller found in Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream samples (July 2017) This may not sound like a win… but in a way it is. This campaign by the Organic Consumer’s Association has raised massive public awareness about how out of control the use of Roundup has gotten and how it is contaminating popular foods that millions eat every day. Target ditches artificial additives from their line of foods aimed at children. (August 2017) – They’ll be free of artificial flavors, artificial preservatives, artificial sweeteners, artificial food dyes, and high fructose corn syrup by the end of 2018. Triscuits get Non-GMO Project verified (August 2017) – This just goes to show that the demand for non-GMO food is mainstream. Hy-Vee grocery stores start to eliminate more than 200 artificial additives and synthetic chemicals (August 2017) – They’re removing ingredients like high-fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors and colors and partially hydrogenated oils from their store-brand products. The move should be completed by July of next year. McDonald’s moves to limit antibiotic use in their beef and pork (August 2017) – As the biggest purchaser of beef in this country, this is huge! However, they have yet to set a timeline. Monsanto is EXPOSED in groundbreaking book Whitewash (October 2017) – Carey Gillam wrote this brave book about Monsanto and the dirty tricks they play in an attempt to keep Roundup weedkiller on the market, despite all the threats it poses to our health and environment. Just as Rachel Carson started the environmental revolution which led to getting the dangerous pesticide DDT banned over 40 years ago, I believe Carey’s book will have the same impact on our world. Pick up a copy here. Nestle and Dean Foods join Campbell’s in leaving the Grocery Manufacturer’s Association (October 2017) – Big brands are leaving this corrupt organization in droves! General Mills cuts artificial flavors and colors from baking products (November 2017) – Let’s take this headline with a grain of salt, as General Mills went back on their word and started selling Trix with artificial colors again this year (after they had removed them with big fanfare last year). We really can’t trust Big Food to keep their promises. Since our official launch, I cannot believe all the incredible thoughtful messages from you Food Babe Army – your support means the world to me! I can’t thank you enough for having such profound faith in me to see this through. Many people have asked… why did it take you so long? The reality of starting your own product line is that it’s expensive. We thought about raising outside capital to fund the creation of Truvani. But, outside money comes with outside expectations that put profits over people. At our core, we believe in real food without added chemicals, products without toxins, labels without lies, and we never want outside money to try and “dictate” what we include in our products. So, our path was clear. Instead of raising outside money, we knew we could accomplish the same effect by pre-selling our first product, the Truvani Daily Turmeric Supplement. This is expected to begin shipping in February 2018. We are starting with turmeric because it is something I personally wanted to consume immediately – but we plan to create a wide variety of products. The vision for Truvani is extensive and we have several new products in development right now! We’ve accomplished so much in such a short period of time. This is the next step and your continued support will help! Here’s to an INCREDIBLE 2018! I know it will be our best year yet. Onward!"
https://foodbabe.com/happy-holiday-chocolate-goji-sea-salt-drops/,Happy Holiday Chocolate Goji Sea Salt Drops,0,"This is a recipe that my best friend Nicole shared with me several years ago and I’ve since made it every single year for the holidays. The combination of flavors in these treats are deadly! The smooth texture of the chocolate against the chewiness of the goji berries married with the crunch of the almonds and spike of sea salt is an EXPLOSION in your mouth. If you’re not big on baking, no worries… You can throw this treat together in a matter of minutes without turning on an oven and you only need 4 ingredients! Start by pouring 2 bags (20 ounces) of organic chocolate chips in a large glass mixing bowl. Make sure your chocolate is organic because it’s made with one of the most heavily sprayed crops, and non-organic chocolate can be laden with synthetic chemicals. Now you’ll want to melt your chocolate. To do that, simply fill a small pot (a bit smaller than your bowl) about 1/4 of the way full with water and heat it up to a simmer. Place your glass bowl full of chocolate chips onto the top of the pot… this creates “double boiler”. You can add about 1 teaspoon of butter (optional) to make it easier to melt and lessen your chances of over-cooking it. Slowly stir occasionally until the chocolate is creamy and completely melted… mmmmmm…. and try not to be tempted into licking the spoon…. but I’m sometimes guilty! Spread a sheet of unbleached wax paper on a cookie sheet. Using an ice cream scoop (or spoon) drop about 1 tablespoon of the mixture onto the sheet. You can add a few goji berries and almonds to the top of each one to make it look more festive like I did here… Sprinkle a touch of sea salt on each drop and put the sheet pan in the fridge. Allow them to set up in the fridge for at least an hour. Keep them stored in the fridge, because they melt (and disappear in your mouth) quickly! Know anyone who loves chocolate? Share this recipe with them and give them a plate of these delicious goodies… they are too good not to share!"
https://foodbabe.com/12-healthy-holiday-baking-swaps/,12 Healthy Holiday Baking Swaps!,0,"Baking season is in full swing, and if you’re anything like me you’ll be making some delicious goodies for your friends and family (and yourself!) in the weeks that come. Most holiday recipes call for refined bleached flour… refined white sugar… food coloring…shortening… and all kinds of unhealthy ingredients. The good news is that you don’t need to sacrifice your health this time of year while still enjoying holiday treats. It’s all about making better choices, and this same philosophy applies any time of the year. Ignore all those holiday baking displays full of GMOs and controversial additives at your grocery store and try these easy and healthy holiday baking swaps instead… I call conventional non-organic butter “Monsanto Butter” because it comes from cows fed almost entirely genetically engineered or GMO grains and Monsanto is the largest producer of GMOs. Conventionally raised cows are most commonly fed GMO corn and soy, however, some farmers fatten up their feed with additional sugar from GMO sugar beets. The harmful pesticides used on GMOs (like glyphosate) is also being eaten by these cows too and can end up in their milk – and thereby, butter. In the alternative, grass-fed or pastured raised cows produce more nutritious milk than cows raised with grains. The highest amounts of the most beneficial CLA and Omega 3 fatty acids naturally come from grass-fed cows. Also grass-fed cows produce butter with up to 50 percent more vitamin A and E and 400 percent more beta carotene (which gives the grass-fed butter a deeper yellow color). Many people bake with margarine instead of butter. Margarines like Imperial and Blue Bonnet are made with inflammatory oils like soybean oil that are most surely GMO (unless specified otherwise). They also can contain hidden trans fat additives, artificial ingredients made from petroleum and unnecessary preservatives. Good alternatives: Organic Valley Cultured Pasture Butter, Nutiva Buttery Organic Coconut Oil (for vegans) Flour can be treated with any of the 60 different chemicals approved by the FDA before it ends up on store shelves – including chemical bleach. The industrial processing destroys nutrients, such as Vitamin E and fiber. It has no nutritional value and is essentially dead food, so they “enrich” it with synthetic vitamins (niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid) that are not from nature. When wheat is not organic, it is often sprayed with Roundup weedkiller pre-harvest and residues can remain in the flour. The active ingredient in Roundup, glyphosate, is linked to cancer. Roundup is banned on all organic crops. Choosing an organic flour made with whole white wheat (not bleached, this is a variety of wheat) is a good alternative because it has a light texture for holiday baking. Sprouted flour is much more easily digested than starchy flour, and contains more vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Phytic acid is destroyed when the grain sprouts, so your body is able to absorb the nutrients in these grains – which makes them that much better for you! Good alternative: Thrive Market Organic Sprouted White Wheat Flour While popular brands like Domino and C&H are made with cane sugar (instead of GMO sugar beets), any sugar that is NOT organic could have been sprayed with Roundup weedkiller pre-harvest. These powdered sugars also contain non-organic corn starch, which may come from GMO corn. While sugar is not a healthy ingredient by any means, some holiday recipes require a little powdered sugar and by choosing an organic version will ensure that it is not made with GMO sugar beets or laced with synthetic weedkillers and GMO corn. Good alternative: Wholesome Organic Powdered Sugar Popular brands like Reddi Wip are filled with factory farmed milk, mono-and diglycerides (hidden trans fat), carrageenan (linked to gut inflammation and cancer), and some also contain cellulose (linked to inflammation and digestion problems). Cool Whip is even worse made with high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, and a concoction of chemicals ranging from artificial flavors to numerous synthetic emulsifiers. Yikes. Good alternative: Use Natural Value Coconut Cream to make homemade whipped cream. Recipe here. Similar to dairy, most eggs are raised in factory farms where the chickens are raised on GMO grains, antibiotics, and they never eat grass. Ideally, you’ll want to source your eggs from local farmers who raise the chickens on pasture and never use unnecessary antibiotics or drugs. There are a few good organic pastured options in stores. You can also make a “Flax Egg” as a good vegan option that works well in most baking recipes. Simply mix together 1 tablespoon organic ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons water per egg. Let it sit for 15 minutes to thicken before using. Good Alternatives: Vital Farms Organic Pastured Eggs or Homemade “Flax Egg” Crisco used to be made with partially hydrogenated oils and since they revamped their recipe to make it with “0 Grams of Trans Fat” it’s more toxic than ever. It’s primary ingredient is now soybean oil – one of the most unhealthy oils out there which increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and almost always comes from GMO soybeans. Crisco is also filled with fully hydrogenated oils, hidden trans fat additives, and is preserved with TBHQ (linked to increased risk of food allergies). Good Alternative: Nutiva Organic Vegan Superfood Shortening Many of the non-organic spices we find on the shelves are treated with chemicals and pesticides before they end up in the bottle. Organic spices cannot have genetically engineered ingredients (GMOs), artificial colors, preservatives, and other synthetic anti-caking agents. Good Alternative: Red Ape Organic Cinnamon Avoid “imitation” vanilla extracts that are made with vanillin, as this is typically sourced from petrochemicals and wood pulp. It is fake food and as an artificial flavor it tricks your brain into believing you’re eating real vanilla. It also doesn’t contain the antioxidants found in real vanilla extract that are good for the body. Many of these fake vanilla extracts are filled with controversial additives like caramel color (linked to cancer) and propylene glycol as well. Good Alternative: Simply Organic Vanilla Extract Those food colors by McCormick and Betty Crocker are made with artificial food dyes made from petroleum (Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1). These are linked to several health issues, including allergies and hyperactivity in children. Dyes have also been found to be contaminated with carcinogens. Europe requires any food containing dyes to carry the warning label, “May Have an Adverse Effect on Activity and Attention in Children.” McCormick’s colors are suspended in a solution made with propylene glycol and preserved with parabens – endocrine-disrupting chemicals linked to breast cancer and reproductive problems. There are natural coloring kits available made from real food like beets, spirulina, and turmeric. This goes for holiday sprinkles too! Good Alternative: India Tree Natural Decorating Colors Refined white sugar has zero nutritional value. Eating refined sugar is addictive, makes you fat, tired, depressed, age faster, makes your skin dull, weakens immunity and when consumed in excess causes all sorts of diseases. Unless a sugar says it is “cane sugar” it is probably made from GMO sugar beets. Any sugar (including Cane Sugar) that is NOT organic could have been sprayed with Roundup pre-harvest. You can replace white sugar with organic coconut sugar. It’s a perfect 1 to 1 substitute for any recipe that calls for regular old sugar. It’s completely unrefined and not bleached, helping to preserve all of its vitamins and minerals. Good Alternative: Nutiva Organic Coconut Sugar Brown sugar is simply white sugar with molasses added to it. So, like all other types of sugar (see above), unless it’s organic it may have been treated with Roundup. It’s best to either choose an organic brown sugar, or better yet, use organic coconut sugar as a replacement. The flavor of coconut sugar is richer than white sugar, so it works well as a replacement for brown sugar and is more nutrient dense. Good Alternative: Nutiva Organic Coconut Sugar or Wholesome Organic Brown Sugar Most baking powders contain aluminum, which is linked to alzheimer’s. The popular Clabber Girl brand is also made with GMO ingredients. Good alternative: Rumford Aluminum-Free Baking Powder (non-GMO and aluminum free) Wouldn’t it be amazing if everyone made these healthier baking swaps? If that happened, our stores would stop carrying all those toxic products and give us more good options! If there is anything on this list that your local grocery stores do not carry, I encourage you to talk to them and request that they do. In this post I tell you EXACTLY what to say, to make it really easy for you. Please share this post and show your friends and family why it is important to make better decisions when we shop for food. Let’s all vote with our dollars and protect our health – even during the holidays."

I cannot wait to watch Harley grow up over the years and see the excitement in her eyes on Christmas morning too.

https://foodbabe.com/iced-cranberry-scones/,Iced Cranberry Scones,0,"These Iced Cranberry Scones are a perfect treat to have around during the holidays! When you make them with organic ingredients, they are a healthier alternative to the Cranberry Orange Scones at Starbucks made with Monsanto Milk (from cows raised on GMOs) and lots of refined conventional sugar (26 grams per scone!) My scone recipe calls for a very small amount of sugar… I just add a couple tablespoons of coconut palm sugar to the entire batch of dough, plus a little organic powdered sugar to the glaze. I use organic coconut palm sugar in my baking often. You can use it as a 1:1 substitute for any recipe that calls for regular old sugar. It’s completely unrefined and not bleached like typical white sugar, helping to preserve all of its vitamins and minerals. To ensure your scones are fluffy and tender, you’ll want to use cold butter – so keep it in the fridge until needed. Also put the coconut milk in the refrigerator the night before (or at least 20 minutes before) making the recipe. This will keep the butter from melting while you are mixing and rolling out the dough, and will help you make perfect scones! When you’re ready to bake up some scones, start by heating your oven up to 350 degrees. In a large glass mixing bowl, measure out 1½ cups of organic sprouted wheat or spelt flour. Add two tablespoons of coconut sugar, a couple teaspoons of baking powder, and a dash of sea salt. Mix well… Take the cold butter out of the fridge and cut in 6 tablespoons of organic butter with the back of a fork or pastry cutter, until it forms little pea-sized crumbles… Using a citrus zester, grate about a teaspoon of zest from an organic orange. Stir in the orange zest along with at least ¼ cup of dried cranberries. Add more if you like lots of cranberries! In a separate bowl, whisk one egg with ¼ cup plus two tablespoons culinary coconut milk. (This is the type of coconut milk that is intended for cooking and generally found in a can. Just make sure you choose a BPA-free version) Add this to the flour mixture and mix gently – only until combined. Do not overmix, as this will create tougher scones! If you find the dough is dry after mixing in the egg and coconut milk, keep adding coconut milk (one tablespoon at a time) until the dough just comes together but is not sticky. If you add too much simply sprinkle the dough with a little more flour. Add some flour to your favorite cutting board and a good rolling pin to prepare it for rolling out the dough. This will keep the dough from sticking. Remembering not to over handle the dough, place it on the floured cutting board and gently roll each side out until it is 1” thick. Cut the scones into your desired shape and place them on a large baking sheet lined with unbleached parchment paper… If you want a more golden brown finish to the top of your scones, brush them with extra coconut milk before baking. Put the scones in the oven and set the timer for 25 minutes. While they’re baking, you can quickly mix up the glaze. All you need to do is whisk together three tablespoons of coconut milk with a couple tablespoons of powdered sugar. Add another tablespoon of sugar if you want it a little thicker. Put the glaze in the fridge to keep it cool. When the scones are done baking, pull them out of the oven and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes before adding the glaze. After they’re cool, drizzle each scone with a bit of glaze… Now, call up a friend and enjoy your fluffy scones with a cup of hot tea! Yum! If you have any leftovers, keep them in an airtight container to keep them moist. They are best heated until warm before you serve them… If you know anyone who is a scone-lover too, wrap some up on a plate with a bow for them. Also share this recipe with them. I’m sure they’ll be thankful! Happy Holidays!!!"

https://foodbabe.com/announcing-product-line-truvani/,Announcing My Own Product Line: Truvani,0,"Over the last few years, the Food Babe Army has accomplished a lot… We have influenced Chick-fil-A, Chipotle, Kraft, General Mills, Subway, Panera Bread, and many other big food companies into changing for the better… But here’s the truth: Big companies don’t change fast enough. And most companies don’t value our health over profits. How many times have you fallen in love with a product, and then a big conventional company buys the brand and the product changes? This story has played out so many times over the years. Just last week, I was looking over the label of my favorite grass-fed vanilla yogurt and noticed a bunch of “gum” additives when previously it had very simple ingredients. A company starts out with great intentions. A company gets acquired. Then, the company changes their ingredients to cut costs. It’s frustrating. We work hard here at Food Babe HQ to find great products and recommend them to you. But we can’t predict acquisitions. So, there I was. Mad that I had purchased another brand I thought I could trust. And that’s when I decided that this would happen FOR THE LAST TIME. Here’s what we are all about… Since our official launch, I cannot believe all the incredible thoughtful messages from you Food Babe Army – your support means the world to me! I can’t thank you enough for having such profound faith in me to see this through. Many people have asked… why did it take you so long?

https://foodbabe.com/take-daily-organic-turmeric-supplement/,Why I Take A Daily Organic Turmeric Supplement,0,"I am careful about what I eat, but I am also careful in other aspects of my life too. I seek out things that are healing to my body… such as drinking clean filtered water, laughing with good friends, and taking exercise classes. I don’t want to just live… I want to be healthy. Can you blame me? I want to feel amazing and have lots of energy. I want a clear mind, free of anxiety and sadness. And I want to live a long, happy life. Don’t you? The problem is that there are toxins in many products and in our environment that can lead to disease. This is why I try to surround myself and my family with the purest, most natural products (including supplements). I don’t feel comfortable ingesting synthetic substances invented in a lab by a team of scientists… especially when these synthetic substances come with a long list of potential adverse side effects. Many over-the-counter medications contain “inactive ingredients” that I wouldn’t normally put into my body – and most definitely don’t want to subject my body to when I’m trying to recover from something. I personally like to heal my body naturally with treatments like acupuncture and some herbal remedies whenever possible. Some people think it’s crazy… but herbs and spices have been used for centuries in Ayurvedic (a medical system that originated in India) and Traditional Chinese Medicine to help a number of conditions. These natural remedies go way back in our history and have been used for a very long time to support good health. Several years ago, I had a bad fall and injured my tailbone. When I fell, all the nerves surrounding my spine and lower back felt like they were on FIRE! I was traveling for work at the time, and had to be pumped full of painkillers just to get on the plane back home. I was bedridden for 3 weeks and miserable. And to top it off, my doctor said I only had one option for relief – surgery to remove my tailbone. Hearing his prognosis was devastating to me, because it meant that I would be unable to sit for at least 3 months and endure lots of physical therapy to regain muscle and strength in my body. Not to mention having a very expensive surgery, taking lots of prescription drugs, and missing work and life. So instead of going under the knife, I chose to try a different path. And I did it through rest, lots of anti-inflammatory foods like turmeric and ginger, and regular acupuncture treatments (yes – needles right into my butt!). But then I decided to go to an amusement park, got on some really bumpy rides and re-injured the same spot. Oops. Needless to say, I went straight back to acupuncture, started taking daily turmeric supplements, and continued on the same path of recovery – and guess what? I got better again. I like to juice turmeric – and really love to drink turmeric shots! I sometimes make turmeric lattes and cook vegetables with turmeric. And, I also like to take a daily organic turmeric supplement. That’s the easiest way to know I’m getting my turmeric in every day. I can travel with it, keep it in my purse, and never forget to take it. Turmeric’s beneficial properties have been the subject of thousands of peer-reviewed and published studies. Turmeric is full of nutrients and antioxidants, which are ingredients in food that fight excess free radicals in the body that can damage cells and diminish health*. When I consume turmeric regularly, I feel better overall. Most recently, I began suffering from intense pain in my thumb and wrist, which many new mamas get from picking up their babies (which is why it’s called “Mommy Thumb”). In addition to acupuncture treatments and wrapping it, turmeric has helped with the inflammation*. Research indicates that curcumin is an anti-inflammatory*. Chronic inflammation is a sneaky condition in the body and you may not even realize if it’s affecting you. It can be brought on by a number of factors… diet choices, environmental pollution, food allergies, stress, lack of sleep, hormonal changes… and, understandably, affects a lot of people. Chronic inflammation is thought to increase your risk of several conditions*, Turmeric is just one of the tools I use to feel healthy and vibrant – and I plan to continue taking it for the rest of my life. Unfortunately the turmeric supplement I was taking was acquired by a conventional chemical company that I could no longer support. This is why I chose to create a Daily Turmeric Supplement as the first product in my new company Truvani. Check out all the details here – we are taking pre-orders until Tuesday (early-bird pricing ends tomorrow). Remember we believe in real food without added chemicals, products without toxins and labels without lies.

https://foodbabe.com/broccoli-salad-will-make-want-eat-veggies/,This Broccoli Salad Will Make You Want To Eat All Your Veggies!,0,"Eating lots of veggies is one of my secrets for stopping junk food cravings dead in their tracks. Once you start pumping your diet up with veggies at every meal, you’ll start craving them instead of junk foods and desserts. It may sound crazy, but it really works! When your body gets the nutrition it needs, your body becomes satisfied! I eat “cruciferous” veggies like broccoli, cabbage, and kale often because they are superstars in the vegetable family. They’ve been shown to help remove toxins from the body by boosting the liver’s own detoxifying enzymes. There is ample research out there that shows cruciferous veggies help to stave off cancer and heart disease too. So, if you’re not already… it’s time to add broccoli (and other cruciferous veggies) to your diet STAT. If you’re not a fan of broccoli, this flavorful Asian Broccoli Salad just might change your mind! It makes an incredibly healthy lunch that’s easy to make ahead and pack for work. It also is amazing for dinner served alongside a hearty bowl of Carrot Ginger Lentil Soup. Talk about an awesome meal full of antioxidants and compounds that fight inflammation!!! I love recipes like this that require so little time in the kitchen. You can put this salad together in less than 15 minutes! Here’s how easy it is to make… Bring a large pot of water to boil while you chop a large head of broccoli into bite-size florets. Once the water begins to boil, add the broccoli and cook quickly for just a couple minutes. Pour the broccoli into a colander and rinse under cold water until cool… To assemble the salad… chop up a couple scallions, a small handful of raw nuts, and thinly slice half of a red onion. Add them to a large bowl along with the broccoli. Sprinkle on a couple tablespoons of sesame seeds and give the salad a little stir until combined. Now it’s time to make the delicious peanut (or almond) dressing! Essentially any high quality nut butter would work and if you have a nut allergy, you can use sunflower seed butter. When shopping for nut butter, look for those that are labeled organic and raw. Most store-bought versions have added refined sugar, so check the ingredient list. Watch out for the “no stir” versions that contain added oils (usually palm oil) to keep them blended on the shelf. Ideally, it should just contain nuts and stir it yourself. My favorite brands are Once Again and Artisana. To make the dressing, start by adding the nut butter to a small bowl. Add in the tamari, rice wine vinegar, raw honey, filtered hot water, and a dash of sesame oil. Whisk it all together until smooth. Grate a teaspoon of fresh ginger and whisk it into the dressing until it’s well blended. Add a couple dashes of sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper… and now it’s ready to assemble your plates! Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to combine. Dig in and enjoy your veggies! I’ll instantly send you a guide full of brand new Food Babe Recipes along with a Monthly Meal Plan. This comes with a detailed Food Babe Starter Guide which includes the “Terrible 20” ingredients that keep you from losing weight, where to spot them, what to eat instead, and my tried-and-true tips for life’s many eating situations.

https://foodbabe.com/flourless-chocolate-chip-cookies-gluten-free-and-amazing/,Flourless Chocolate Chip Cookies {Gluten-Free and Amazing!},0,"If you’ve tried a million chocolate chip cookie recipes out there trying to find the best one, look no further. Not only do these blow other cookies out of the water, but they are made entirely without flour! It’s pretty amazing that you can make a crispy, chewy, tasty cookie without any flour, but you really can. One ingredient I try to limit from my diet is refined flour. Typical flour is milled discarding all the essential nutrients the original grain contained. The heat that is generated to crush the grain into flour destroys any vitamin or mineral normally found in the the grain, leaving a white powdery product devoid of any life. It’s essentially dead food. So they have to “enrich” it back by adding in synthetic vitamins and minerals. The next part is even scarier because fresh milled flour usually isn’t acceptable for consumption because of the look, feel and smell of it. The FDA has approved over 60 chemicals for manufacturers to use to help these aesthetics and the shelf life of flour. Chlorine is used to bleach conventional flours to remove the smell and change the color. The flour is put into a gas chamber and treated with chlorine dioxide which leaches all the vitamin E out of the flour and leaves a chemical called dichlorostearic acid that remains in the flour. Additionally treating flour with chlorine can create more chemical byproducts that have been known to react to other proteins and cause nervous system damage in humans. The good news is that refined flour is pretty easy to avoid if you know what to look for. If you see “wheat flour”, “enriched flour”, “bleached flour” on an ingredient list, this is refined flour – so stick it back on the shelf and look for alternatives. This standard applies to other flour-based foods like breads, crackers, rolls, bagels, and any commercially baked food. When it comes to gluten-free cookies, they are often made with replacements for wheat flour, like rice flour or tapioca starch. Rice is known to contain 10 to 20 times more arsenic than other grains, as it tends to absorb more arsenic due to the way it’s grown. Arsenic is a powerful carcinogen that promotes the risk of several types of cancer. It’s also linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, problems in pregnancy and infant development. Tapioca flour can skyrocket your blood sugar (more than whole wheat does) and has zero nutrient value – just empty calories. I get that you don’t eat a cookie to be healthy, but I’m all for packing as much nutrition into all the foods I eat, even cookies! They have a texture and taste very similar to cookies made with regular flour. They won’t crumble all over the place like other gluten-free cookies you may have tried, and are rich with flavor. Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees and lining a large baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper. This makes cleanup super easy! Crack an egg into your favorite glass mixing bowl and give it a little whisk. Stir in the date sugar, molasses, real vanilla extract, and a touch of baking soda. Mix it all up well… Measure out a cup of almond butter into the bowl and stir well to combine… Fold in the organic chocolate chips (make sure they are gluten-free if you can’t eat gluten!)… Using an ice-cream scoop, drop tablespoon-sized balls on the parchment-lined pan. You should get about 12 cookies out of this recipe. If the batter is somewhat loose, gently shape them into nice little circles… Put the pan in the oven and check them at 10-12 minutes to see if they’re done. Bake for up to 15 minutes if you want a crispier cookie… My cookies came out perfectly crispy around the edges and bit softer on the inside. They are amazing dipped in homemade coconut milk! You might want to hide a few of these cookies away for yourself before letting anyone know you made them – they will be gone in a matter of minutes! If you know anyone who loves chocolate chip cookies, bake them up a batch. Who knows, maybe someday they’ll return the favor!"
https://foodbabe.com/whitewash-book-get-monsantos-roundup-glyphosate-banned-forever/,Whitewash Book Could Get Monsanto’s Roundup (Glyphosate) Banned Forever,0,"There is a chemical that likely causes cancer being sprayed on 80% of the food in this country and residues have been found in popular foods like Cheerios and Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream. This chemical is Roundup Weedkiller (Glyphosate) made by Monsanto. Even though the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer deemed glyphosate probably carcinogenic to humans, Roundup has NOT been banned. This chemical continues to be used on food crops, parks, playgrounds, and by homeowners everywhere. Glyphosate is now so rampant in our environment that it’s found in honey, cereals, meat, drinking water, breast milk, infant formula, chips, cookies, air samples… the list goes on. Since our regulatory agencies are not taking action, this carcinogen continues to proliferate and is contaminating virtually all of the food that we and our children are eating. It’s maddening! Some food brands are taking notice – Ben & Jerry’s recently announced that they’re launching glyphosate-free ice cream by 2020 and other brands are getting certified as glyphosate residue free. This is a huge step in helping to clean up our food supply, but much more needs to be done. My dear friend Carey Gillam expertly delves into this issue in her new must-read (and courageous!) book, Whitewash: The Story of a Weed Killer, Cancer, and the Corruption of Science. Just as Rachel Carson started the environmental revolution which led to getting the dangerous pesticide DDT banned over 40 years ago, I believe Carey’s book will have the same impact on our world. You’ll find Carey’s information very well researched with a wealth of evidence, full of references and background material. I plan to keep this on my bookshelf to use as a reference. In her book, she breaks down how Monsanto has been able to keep Roundup on the market for decades, despite the dangers it presents to our health and environment. She covers… Monsanto and big chemical companies may have money and great influence, but as consumers, WE have the greatest power of all. The public at large may not be paying attention now… spraying Roundup in their yards and eating Roundup-Ready GMOs but books like this can open up their eyes so they stop buying and using these products. The public needs to know the truth about what is going on – and it’s up to us to spread the word! Carey goes where most journalists don’t dare to go. In my own experience, I know it takes guts to stand up to billion dollar corporations. It also takes an Army! The vicious attacks can be relentless, and I could never do this work without you by my side. I urge you to pick up a copy of Whitewash and maybe one or two extra to give as gifts to your loved ones."
https://foodbabe.com/marketing-artificial-color-children-illegal-amazing-story/,Marketing Artificial Color To Children Should Be Illegal (Amazing Story),0,"I’ve got some real idiotic news about Trix Cereal… but first let me explain why I’m so angry about it. If you’re part of the Food Babe Army, I doubt you’re filling your carts up with Trix and Lucky Charms at the grocery store. That’s because you are some of the smartest consumers out there when it comes to your food. You know what to look for on an ingredient list, what additives to avoid, and how to keep the GMOs out of your diet. People sometimes criticize me for writing about processed junk foods like Trix because they think it’s obvious how unhealthy it is… but there are still a lot of people out there who do not know this information. They do not know what additives like Yellow #5 and TBHQ could be doing to their health or the health of their kids. They do not know that there could be Roundup weedkiller in their Cheerios, silly putty in their french fries, or wood in their cheese. We still need to reach these people! That’s why it’s important to keep raising awareness of these issues. I also want to keep y’all informed as to what’s happening in the processed food world so that you can spread the word to your own friends and family who need to know this information. Our movement is growing, but there are still SO MANY people we need to reach… and this sad news about Trix really helps make my point… General Mills just announced they’re putting the artificial dyes – Yellow #6, Blue #1, Red #40 – back into Trix Cereal because they were “besieged” by customer complaints since they removed these dyes two years ago. You may recall, General Mills announced with big fanfare a couple years ago that they’d remove chemical dyes from all their cereals and replace them with natural colors like turmeric extract, vegetable and fruit juices. They later claimed sales of the dye-free Trix “exceeded expectations” along with great feedback from customers, which makes it even more perplexing as to why they suddenly pulled a 180. They’re going to start selling their original version of Trix with “neon bright” fake colors as soon as next month (both versions will be available). Who is asking General Mills to put artificial dyes in their children’s food? Are you or anyone you know actually calling up General Mills and complaining about the color? Do the fake colors really make Trix taste better? I really want to know the reasons why anyone would want their children to eat Blue #1 and Yellow #6. I truly believe if consumers knew that these colors are derived from petroleum, what they do to their bodies and how they have been shown to affect children, they would not want to eat them. We clearly still have so much work to do and need to keep spreading the truth. The Feingold Association recently thanked us in their newsletter for our successful petition which got the artificial dyes out of Kraft Mac n’ Cheese, along with a story about how one little boy’s life was changed forever when artificial dyes were removed from his diet (following our petition). They graciously granted me permission to publish the entire story here to reach more people and impact as many lives as possible. When I launched the Kraft petition, I received countless letters like this one, and I know that thousands of you are having the same experiences. I hope you read and share this story below with your loved ones and keep sharing the truth about artificial food dyes. From birth, Cameron was “different.” He was very moody, angry, hated being touched and would not sit still —EVER. He hated car rides, being in a stroller, being carried, sung to; you name it. Other than video games, he hated everything. He never slept for more than a few hours at a time and averaged about five hours. He woke up at night for no obvious reason 5-15 times a night until the age of 5. He spit up every time he ate until he was 3 years old, and he would break out in hives all over his body. At 1 1/2 we took him to an allergist, who said it was food sensitivities and he would outgrow it. He didn’t. Cameron’s behavior was horrible. In stores, he would run away and hide. In the car, he would scream until he vomited and he gave me two black eyes before he was three years old. He couldn’t speak; he would make sounds but no distinguishable words. We took him for a hearing test, which was fine, and they recommended occupational therapy. He was very uncooperative, but we continued with it two times a week for a year. When Cameron was four he started speech therapy, but he hated it. He would scream until he began vomiting. He wouldn’t participate with his speech therapist but would kick, hit and spit at her. She suggested medication to help subdue his outbursts. He didn’t know the alphabet or colors but was very good at math. We started thinking he was mildly autistic. He still was not sleeping and was getting hives daily. He craved food with dyes like a junkie craves heroin. Cameron started 4-year-old kindergarten, and it was horrible. He hated it as much as his teacher hated him. He was the worst-behaved kid in a classroom of thirty-five 4-year-olds. His teacher also suggested looking into medicine, as she didn’t think he would be able to function in mainstream school. But I was firmly against medicating him and started considering homeschooling. Here is a sequence of pictures I took as Cameron ate a blue lollipop (before I learned about additives). I can now see how he became progressively more miserable. In the last two pictures, there are tears rolling down his cheeks. That final picture gets me every time I look at it! The following day, I took him for his first allergy appointment. The allergist said he had sensitivities. “Nothing to worry about. It won’t kill him. He should outgrow it by age 4.” My “Ah-ha moment” In the spring of 2013, I saw an online petition calling for Kraft to remove dyes from its mac & cheese because the additives could cause ADHD, mood swings and hives. This was my “ah-ha” moment! The previous night, Cameron had eaten Kraft Mac & Cheese and he didn’t sleep and was covered in hives. I decided to try taking out food dye for a week to see if his hives went away. They did! We were amazed that after only a few days, he didn’t severely itch. After a few weeks, when he had had very limited exposure to food dyes, I noticed his behavior was different. I thought maybe he was getting sick. Then, Cameron gave me a hug all on his own! This had never happened before. What’s more, he was waking up only a few times a night instead of ten. He wasn’t so angry, and he wasn’t as itchy. And, after thirty days of being dye-free, he could SPEAK! Nearly perfect, clear words that everyone could understand. For the first time ever, he said, “I love you.” I spent most of that month in tears because of the life-changing miracles that came from removing dyes. He literally learned his colors overnight. I spoke with him about these changes, and he said his body didn’t hurt as much as it used to and his head didn’t buzz as much. I then realized my son spent the first five years of his life in constant pain and didn’t know he was supposed to feel any different. We were dye-free for three months and doing great; then, we went to a 4th of July parade. He was perfectly behaved until I let him have some cotton candy, and all hell broke out! He was yelling, crying, screaming, curled up in the fetal position having a complete breakdown. This reaction to dye took five days to wear off. How the additives affect him If Cameron ate the petroleum-based dyes, artificial flavors or preservatives eliminated on the Feingold Diet he would experience these reactions: anger, body & joint pains, hives, impaired learning, ringing/buzzing in his ears, stomach pain, anxiety, rapid & loud speech, bipolar tendencies, and the inability to follow simple directions. I decided it was all or nothing. No food coloring, ever! Things were much better that winter, and I also noticed a major change in Cameron’s dad. He cut back on his dye consumption. (He was completely addicted to Jolly Ranchers, Sour Patch Kids and Mountain Dew.) But now, he wasn’t as angry at the world like he had always been and was just nicer in general. Who knew that dyes could affect adults? (They also affect pets. My dog will rip up toys if he eats anything with dye in it.) He had felt miserable so it’s no wonder he acted miserable as well. By March of 2014, we were about one-year dye-free, and Cameron was complaining about body pain again, and he had what doctors kept referring to as eczema. That’s when I stumbled across the Feingold Diet and thought, “This sounds like the symptoms Cameron is having now right down to the ADHD and behavioral issues.” I ordered the membership materials and have never looked back. The Feingold Association provides a long list of brand-name foods that are free of dyes, artificial flavors and the three worst preservatives. They also show how to test for salicylate sensitivity. We removed all preservatives from Cameron’s diet, and things slowly began to improve. (Preservatives are hard to identify because of loopholes in labeling laws. Chemicals like BHA, BHT and TBHQ can be hidden in the ingredients in a product or sprayed on the insides of the packaging and do not need to be listed.) I kept a daily food & behavior journal for Cameron; if it went in his mouth, it was written down. This was a huge help in identifying a possible culprit. After being dye-free for just thirty days, Cameron experienced the following: 1. Hives subsided 2. Anger diminished 3. Started speaking 4. Learned his colors 5. Slept better at night 6. Body pain lessened 7. Developed compassion & empathy 8. Began to socialize (He couldn’t handle being in public places with any number of people prior to this.) Cameron started kindergarten, free of artificial colors and flavoring at the same school where two previous teachers “suggested” medication. Three months into the school year, he was awarded “Student of the Month.” He no longer needed speech therapy or an IEP. The therapist had no explanation as to why he suddenly could talk, but I am 100% certain it is from removing the additives. His occupational therapist contacted me three years after her last meeting with him, saying she couldn’t believe the progress he had made. She said she assumed he would always have major issues. Food sensitivity avoidance has become our way of life. We follow the Feingold Foodlist almost 100%. Cameron still has “eczema” flare-ups occasionally, but they are not as severe. There are zero behavior issues that we deal with now. Cameron sleeps an average of eight hours a night, seven days a week. He has never been sent to the principal’s office, and he actively & willingly participates in school. We still need to tweak his diet on a regular basis and watch for things, but it is much easier now. We also found Cameron can have reactions to dyes in soap, shampoo, temporary tattoos, toothpaste etc., so, all of that must be dye-free also. The last accidental food coloring exposure was in May 2014. Within twenty minutes of ingesting a microscopic amount of red dye 40, he was curled into the fetal position, lying on the floor, under the table in a restaurant, experiencing severe body pain & itching. An hour after ingestion, his speech became loud and rapid, and he was unable to hear us when we tried to speak to him. For two hours after exposure to the dye, he repeatedly used the word “what.” His behavior became manic, but while this subsided quickly, the body pain lasted several days. We have found that soaking in a bath with baking soda can lessen some of the symptoms as it helps draw out toxins. We went dye-free in 2013, to try and clear up the hives issue. I never in a million years would have thought additives in food could be linked to Cameron’s behavior, but after seeing the cravings for and withdrawal from food coloring, I can honestly say it should be illegal. It is addictive and mind-altering, just like any other drug. Success at last! After consulting many allergists, dermatologists, pediatricians & pediatric rheumatologists for more than five years, and not getting help, we finally figured out my son’s issues. It began with an online petition and continued with the help and guidance of the Feingold Association. Happily, Kraft removed the synthetic food coloring from its Mac & Cheese in 2016. ~ Feingold Association Pure Facts Newsletter, September 2017 I am so moved by this story and would love to see these dyes banished from our food forever. I hope this information helps every family out there who is affected by the dyes in our food. Please share this post and Cameron’s story with your loved ones. You never know who it may help!"
https://foodbabe.com/best-air-purifier-health/,The Best Air Purifier For Your Health,0,"Have you ever been near a window inside your home when the sunshine was coming in just right and saw little particles floating in the air? I’m sorry to tell you that this isn’t just dirt… and that there is a lot more lurking in those little particles (carcinogens, hormone disruptors, bacteria, developmental toxins), which go right into your body every time you breathe. Even if your house is super clean and although you can’t always see these particles in the air, we’ve all got some level of dust in our home – which is just the reality of modern day life, full of industrial chemicals. Everyday household items like your furniture, carpets, flooring, window shades, cleaning products, beauty products, paint, clothing, and beds, are emitting microscopic chemicals into the air, which float around and settle onto surfaces as dust. Researchers at George Washington University tested household dust samples and found 45 toxic chemicals, many of which were floating in the air before settling on the ground and other surfaces as dust. They found everything ranging from flame retardants, fluorinated chemicals, and phthalates. Breaking new research has found that some of these particles can alter hormones, triggering the body to store fat. While outdoor air pollution has been classified as a carcinogen (causes cancer) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer – the air we breathe inside of our homes can be even worse! The EPA says that indoor air pollution is about 2 to 5 times greater than the air outside, and is sometimes 100 times worse than the air you breathe outside. I was shocked when I found that out! Many of these pollutants are also developmental toxins, and now that I have a little one at home who will be crawling soon, this is one of my #1 concerns. The last thing I want is for my daughter to crawl around on flooring contaminated with toxic dust and breathing in these chemicals. Her tiny body is more susceptible to these toxic invaders. “The findings suggest that people, and especially children, are exposed on a daily basis to multiple chemicals in dust that are linked to serious health problems” ~ lead study author Ami Zota at The George Washington University Even if I’m eating the purest, most organic food in the world and drinking the cleanest filtered water around, I know that the air I breathe is just as important! I started using this air purifier in my home and cannot believe the difference in how well I feel and sleep. We obviously can’t all live in a bubble, but we should do our best to make sure the environment we live in isn’t toxic. Using this air purifier has really given me the peace of mind that the air in my home is safe, especially for my daughter! As I always want to share with you what works for me, I partnered up with Intellipure to make it easier for you to try the same air purifier I’ve been using.

https://foodbabe.com/natural-flavors-really-bad-must-watch/,Are Natural Flavors Really That Bad? (MUST WATCH),0,"I have a confession to make. My once in a while processed food meltdown is with Annie’s Chocolate Bunnies. Once I crack open the box, I literally cannot stop eating them. (And thinking about them right now, is making my mouth water.) It’s insane! I’ve noticed when I make homemade cookies I don’t get the feeling that I need to eat the entire plate… but with those Annie’s Bunnies, man, I really can’t stop. Why is it that they’re so addicting? Is it all the sugar? There’s actually more to it than that. I recently sat down with Mark Schatzker, the author of The Dorito Effect – a must read book for all you foodies out there who read ingredients and care about what you’re eating. You know how addicting Doritos are…well, the stories he tells in this book about food and flavor are out of control incredible. I highlighted my copy like crazy and immediately reached out to Mark because I was so impressed with the investigative work he has done. You can watch my complete interview with Mark here: The main topic of our discussion was “natural flavors”. If you read ingredient lists you know these are EVERYWHERE…listed on almost every package in the aisle at the grocery store. Here are some highlights from our interview… LaCroix is mostly just carbonated water… but I don’t consider food and drinks that are synthetically flavored (vs. being flavored with real food) a healthy everyday item. I don’t want to screw up the signals in my body that allow me to crave something because it has the nutrients I need. I also don’t want to eat foods that trick my tastebuds into downing almost a whole box in one sitting (like those Annie’s Bunnies!) I like to know exactly what I’m eating, and with “natural flavors” I’m left in the dark. Sticking with real food is just simpler, healthier, and oftentimes cheaper too. If you’re really hooked on RX Bars, I’m joining GMO Inside and asking them to go organic and to remove natural flavors!"

Just look at some lives who have changed forever… “We started out with being very concerned about all the additives and preservatives that food companies are ALLOWED to put in our food and we did a lot of research on what they are doing to us everyday we eat those foods. We were determined to make a change in our lives and help those around us to become more aware. Then we found Food Babe. Food Babe was the person who was going to help us complete our mission: To live a long healthy life together! We wondered how we would make such a drastic, BUT IMPORTANT, change with there being so much information we needed to understand about additives, preservatives, going organic, reading labels, looking for symbols and numbers, etc… We always say it is like learning a new language. Then we saw the Food Babe membership and it provided all the information we needed to transition by providing us with a Starter Guide AND it provided us with a Monthly Eating Guide, which helped us when going to Earth Fare. THIS MEMBERSHIP IS THE BEST MONEY SPENT! Our health is priceless and this membership is our Bible. Since purchasing the annual membership and transitioning to a more healthy lifestyle, we feel so much better and we have both lost 15 pounds each! Not only are we living a healthier life because we are eating better, but we are decreasing the chance of developing ailments!!! We felt so much better eating healthy and avoiding all the processed food, junk food, and all unhealthy foods. Our bodies felt lighter, not bloated, and the healthy habits like lemon water and dandelion tea….they make us feel so great! Between the healthy food and healthy habits, we lost so much weight!

https://foodbabe.com/the-food-industry-needs-to-stop-treating-us-like-a-bunch-of-idiots/,The Food Industry Needs To Stop Treating Us Like A Bunch Of Idiots,0,"There’s a war going on inside the food industry right now and I’m sitting on the edge of my seat… watching each play… and seeing who makes the right moves. Some of the changes we are seeing are good and some are bad. The food industry is responding at rapid pace – Papa John’s is getting into organic food, Kraft created organic Lunchables, General Mills removed BHT from most of their cereals, Frito Lay is selling Organic Doritos and Amazon bought Whole Foods! After decades of using the cheapest and easiest ways to create products to maximize profits, brands now have to face the thousands of Americans (including the Food Babe Army!) who are more aware of the crazy additives they are sticking in our food and are demanding change. There are a growing number of us who are no longer willing to buy pickles with yellow #5… almond milk with carrageenan, chips with MSG… or drinks colored with caramel coloring. But some players in the food industry are making all the wrong moves and our trust is going to continue to decline – unless they wake up and realize that there is a new generation of smart, savvy, health conscious, and educated people out there to hold them accountable. Basically, they need to stop acting like we are a bunch of idiots. How Kraft, General Mills, Kellogg’s, Pepsico, Coca-Cola, Campbells, etc. are reacting to the “clean food” revolution and changing marketplace is very telling. They can either choose to side with consumers who overwhelming want to buy real food without unnecessary and risky additives… or they can continue locking arms with the big chemical companies in how they will formulate and label their products. There’s a “mounting distrust of so-called Big Food, the large food companies and legacy brands on which millions of consumers have relied on for so long” ~ Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell’s Campbell’s just announced they’re dropping out of the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), not for financial reasons, but rather “driven by purpose and principles” as they want to become “the leading health and well-being food company.” The GMA is a top industry trade group with a shady history who lobbies for policies that support junk food brands and has spent millions fighting against GMO labeling. Could it be that Campbell’s wants to rise above the fray and base their brand on ethics and trust? Or, are they trying to pull a quick one on us? It’s too early to tell, but you can bet I’m keeping a close eye on their next move. I sent a member of my team to the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) Annual Meeting & Food Expo last year, which is essentially where major chemical companies and scientists converge to discuss their latest inventions in the food industry and present them to food companies. Many of the food additives I’ve campaigned against… artificial food dyes, Class IV caramel color, BHT, TBHQ, artificial and natural flavors are all showcased here. They also discuss the growing organic and “clean food” movement (including the Food Babe Army) and what they need to do to continue profiting off of chemical food additives and GMOs. DOW Chemical’s French Fries? Don’t worry, we didn’t eat them 😉 New food additives being presented by Tate & Lyle at the IFT Expo. New “Clean-Label” additives seen on the IFT Expo floor. While many of the biggest food additive manufacturers were showcasing their new “natural”, “non-GMO”, and “clean-label” additives designed to replace synthetic colors, flavors, and preservatives, the word on the street focused on how they want to change customer perception so that Americans would come to accept food chemicals and GMOs in their food. They don’t like the sweeping changes that food brands are making to remove chemical additives from their food, as this is costing them a lot of money and possibly more. If consumers stop buying packaged foods full of additives, their market will disappear. They’re pleading with their members to curtail our movement by recruiting more “science communicators” to gain the public’s trust in their food technologies. Their mindset is that consumers “fear what they don’t understand” and that if they could only explain their food chemicals in a warm and fuzzy way, we would accept them. But, they’re way off target. We don’t trust the brands who use these chemical additives for good reason, and there may be no coming back. Last week I asked on social media if you trust the Big Food brands like Kraft, Kellogg’s, General Mills, and Coca-Cola, and the overwhelming consensus was NO. And, I don’t blame you. Here are five reasons why these brands have lost our trust… Many brands reformulate their products with healthier ingredients in other countries and also don’t use GMOs overseas where labeling is required. I’ve written about this many times before and exposed the shocking double-standard of how many brands serve one set of ingredients here in the U.S. and remove controversial additives in other countries that have stronger regulations. The examples are seemingly endless… Over the years we’ve watched Kraft, Pepsico, Coca-Cola, General Mills, Nestle, Kellogg’s, and ConAgra give millions to fight GMO labeling laws, even resorting to money laundering to hide their contributions to anti-labeling campaigns. They have spent insane amounts of money to hide the GMOs in their food, despite the fact that poll after poll shows that roughly 90% of consumers want to see GMO labels on packages. As I wrote about in The Food Babe Way, Pepsico spent over $8 million, Coca-cola spent nearly $6 million, Kraft spent nearly $4 million, and ConAgra, General Mills, and Nestle each spent over $2.5 million to fight GMO labeling initiatives. Why spend this much money to fight something that consumers overwhelmingly want? It really has felt like a stab in the back. The new nationwide “labeling” law that passed in 2016 is giving these companies a way out. They can simply use a QR Code instead of the words “Produced With Genetic Engineering” on the package (and they won’t even need to do that for several years). Since this law passed, some brands who had begun labeling their products – like Kellogg’s – are now removing them. It’s so outrageous, and just goes to show they never did this with their customer’s best interests in mind in the first place! Photo Credit: GMO Free USA The same goes for restaurants who refuse to disclose their ingredients like In-N-Out Burger. Everyone deserves to know what is in the food they are buying, and there is NO REASON for restaurants to withhold ingredient lists and claim that it is “Proprietary” just because there are no regulations requiring them to disclose. We all know that is a load of you know what… Back in 2014, Pepsico announced they would remove Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO) from Mountain Dew following a successful petition by activist Sarah Kavanagh. However, they still have not removed it THREE years later. And before you believe they’re still working on the formula – they already sell BVO-free Mountain Dew in the U.K. What’s the holdup? Likewise, over TWO years ago Kellogg’s told the media they were looking for an alternative to BHT in their cereals, but they sell cereals overseas without BHT already! Why not just sell us the exact same cereal? This is not rocket science. The same goes for companies like In-N-Out and Bojangles that have publicly vowed to remove antibiotics from their animal feed – but haven’t given a time to the public and have continued their horrendous factory farming practices. The Co-CEO of Whole Foods once asked me what I thought the new trends in food packaging would be considering the food revolution we are in. I told him we’d start seeing ingredient labels on the front of packaging because consumers care about ingredients. Well, one company – RX Bars – started doing that and when I saw their protein bars in stores I thought my prediction had come true. However, when I examined the bars closer and read the ingredient list on the back of the package, I saw natural flavors listed. The front of the package is not the whole truth and it’s misleading consumers. This is what angers me about new food companies trying to give us more real food. If you want to gain consumers trust – tell the truth. As you can see from my recent interview with Mark Schatzker of The Dorito Effect, “natural blueberry flavor” is a way for the food industry to use fewer real blueberries and trick consumers into thinking they are getting more nutrition and flavor that isn’t there. The pop of taste from added flavors is made in a laboratory and makes food that we wouldn’t otherwise eat taste like something good. Is that why RX Bar chooses not to put the ingredient on the front of their package like the rest of their ingredients? When Kraft removed the artificial dyes from their Mac n’ Cheese they came out with a marketing campaign which made it sound as if they came up with the decision all on their own – instead of just saying THE TRUTH: You asked for it and we delivered. They make no mention of the countless concerned parents who have been asking them to remove these unnecessary dyes for years. They make no mention of the adverse health effects that have been attributed to these dyes and as to why they don’t use them overseas. They make no mention of the over 365,000 of you who signed a petition asking them to make this change. They make no mention of the meeting they had with me in 2013 when they told me that we’d just have to “agree to disagree” and that Kraft was going to keep Mac & Cheese just the way it was. We all know the truth, but they are not owning up to it, which is quite simply ridiculous. I received the following email from a reader, which expresses my sentiments! “Have you seen the new Kraft Mac and cheese commercial? I’m just wondering if you are as offended as I am. They make it seem like all the crap they were adding before the change would somehow affect the quality or taste and that people didn’t even notice the change. I haven’t eaten Kraft Mac and cheese in years but am thankful for your work on getting them to change the way they make it. It’s just sad they think it’s appropriate to make a commercial that makes the consumer feel as if they’re “missing out” instead of apologizing for all the poison they had put in their food previously.” – Jaime My visit to Kraft HQ delivering petition signatures in 2013. Some of brands try to pull the wool over our eyes by announcing they’re cleaning up their food, while they are really just swapping one poison for another. McDonald’s was quoted all over the media saying how they removed the artificial flavors in their ice cream as if this was a major step towards improving their food, but all they did was replace it with natural flavors. Anyone who’s been reading this blog for awhile knows that natural and artificial flavors are essentially the same thing (and their ice cream still contains lots of nasty ingredients like carrageenan, mono and diglycerides, and cellulose gum!) Food brands have bankrolled scientists and created front groups to attack organic food and defend the continued use of food produced with synthetic pesticides, antibiotics, GMOs, and chemical food additives. Groups like the “American Council on Science & Health” and the “Center For Consumer Freedom” sure sound like independent and scientific organizations, but they are funded heavily by food companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s. These groups and scientists they work with are often quoted in the media without any mention of their ties to the industry and are given a free pass because they present themselves as independent experts. “Joseph Perrone, chief science officer at the Center for Accountability in Science — part of a larger tax-exempt group run by the Berman and Co. public relations firm — said industry needed to mount a coordinated effort to paint the risks of common chemicals as acceptable to the public and boost trust in federal regulatory agencies that evaluate them… Perrone’s message is that customers don’t trust chemical companies, and they need “a good PR plan, which is external to the company, which is a third party. Because, quite frankly, whether we like it or not, they don’t believe you.” ~ E&E News Presentation by the front group The Center For Food Integrity at IFT Expo. Trust is really important and after it’s been broken, it can be hard to come back from. We have wised up to the dirty tactics they use. If food brands want us to buy their products they really should listen to us – their prospective customers – and stop hiding behind antiquated regulations and paid-off “experts” to justify selling us chemicals instead of food. I truly believe the only way they can gain our trust is by siding with consumers who overwhelmingly want them to sell real food that is healthy and sustainably grown. We are fed up with the chemical additives they use. We are fed up with the double standards. We are fed up with their misleading marketing and deceptive front groups. We are fed up with their lack of transparency. We are fed up with their support for factory farms. We are fed up with the great lengths they go to hide GMOs in their products. We are fed up with how they continue to hide behind our government’s lax standards and claim the additives they use are “safe”… We’ve heard it a million times and know the truth! I want you to be the smartest consumers out there. I want you to change your life, and the lives of your families. Be in charge of your destiny. The first step is to stop being hijacked by all the processed foods out there that look better – but really aren’t. And to eat whole, real foods that will give you the most amazing health of your dreams. You’ll get a chance next week to join a special group of people, along with the support of myself and my entire team, that will help you do just that! Make sure you are subscribed to my email newsletter, so you get your invite! The industry has done some things that have demolished my trust and I’m sure you feel the same… but they have made some changes that give me hope that maybe they can turn it around and do the right thing."
https://foodbabe.com/never-pack-childs-lunch-back-school-recipe/,Never Pack This In Your Child’s Lunch + Back-To-School Recipe,0,"The quality of food served by school lunchrooms across the country is appalling. Although my little one isn’t in school (yet), I am saddened that many school districts feed children hot dogs, greasy pizza, and nachos for lunch. How this has even become acceptable is the subject of a future investigation… but in the meantime, do whatever you can to take control of the situation by packing your own lunches. People who eat homemade food avoid thousands of unnecessary food additives they’d otherwise be exposed to. If your kids are away from home during lunchtime Monday through Friday – that adds up to about 22 lunches a month… or 22 opportunities to choose something healthy and homemade. Think of all the GMOs, preservatives, and other chemicals your children can avoid by packing a lunch. But… don’t go down the path of buying all those conveniently packaged “Back To School” snacks and drinks that line the shelves at the grocery store. Not only do they get expensive, but they’re just as unhealthy (maybe worse) than what they serve in school lunchrooms, filled with GMOs and additives to avoid like BHT, TBHQ, artificial colors, flavors, and tons of added sugar… It’s especially ridiculous they keep selling products with yellow 5 and red 40 which are linked to hyperactivity in children (requiring a warning label in Europe). How are children expected to pay attention to learn in school after eating food like this? Even organic packaged foods can be extremely processed and unhealthy without any real nutrition. Take the new Organic Lunchables for example. These might be certified organic, but I’d NEVER buy them… When children grow up eating processed foods regularly, they grow up less likely to crave fresh foods like fruits and veggies. I want to teach my daughter to love all that real food has to offer, the tastes, the textures, and the amazing nutrition that it provides her body – and not trick her tastebuds with processed foods full of added sugar and fake flavors. The main course in this lunchbox recipe are some fun Hummus Roll-ups that you can put together the evening before so it’s all ready to go in the morning. I like to make my own hummus because most store-bought versions are made with GMOs and inflammatory oils (like canola and soybean) instead of olive oil. This is my go-to hummus recipe. If you buy store-bought hummus, just look for one that is organic and made with olive oil. To assemble your Hummus Roll-ups, start out with either an organic sprouted grain or coconut wrap (I like to use wraps by Food For Life, found in the freezer section at most natural food stores). Spread on a couple spoonfuls of hummus and top it with a couple slices of cheese and crunchy romaine lettuce. Thinly slice a cucumber lengthwise and layer it on top… Then just roll it up tightly and cut into pinwheel slices that are easy for little hands to hold and eat… All you do is thinly slice a couple fresh parsnips and spread them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment… Drizzle them with a touch of coconut or olive oil, sprinkle on some salt and pepper, and bake at 375° for about 10 minutes. Take them out when the edges start to get brown and crispy. If you know anyone who would love some back-to-school lunch tips like this, please share this post with them!"
https://foodbabe.com/bottle-water-not-think/,Bottled Water Is Not What You Think,0,"Last week on Facebook I asked whether you drink soda, and if not, what you drink instead. I was overwhelmed with all the awesome responses!… and am sooooo happy to see how many of you have broken up with soda forever and are mostly drinking water, homemade tea, and kombucha instead. Yeah!!! Bottled water sales have FINALLY surpassed soda sales in the U.S. as more people ditch drinks like Diet Coke and Pepsi. While I’m happy to see people make better choices – bottled water is crazy expensive. Depending on how many bottles you buy for yourself and your family every week, the cost adds up quickly. The average person who buys bottled water is spending over $400 a year for a family of four – and that’s being conservative. Drinking filtered tap water is so much cheaper… bottled water costs almost 2000x more! While you might think that your bottled water is from a pristine mountain spring full of minerals, that’s almost never the case… Popular brands like Aquafina (by PepsiCo) and Dasani (by Coca-Cola) are just straight up purified tap water. They take their water from city water systems, run it through more filtering, bottle it, and sell it at a huge markup. Look for the terms “public water”, “municipal source”, or “community water” on bottles, which indicates it’s filtered tap water – but brands aren’t required to disclose this. Those that say “artesian” or “spring” water are typically not from the tap, but are typically MORE expensive and still packaged in plastic that is horrible for our environment. Plastic water bottles create an estimated 1.5 million tons of trash per year! As I’m sure you’re aware, most tap water that isn’t properly filtered is tainted with contaminants like… You don’t want to be drinking any of those substances… or using tainted water to make coffee and tea at home. That’s why a good home water filter is so important, and will save you literally hundreds of dollars in bottled water costs every single year. I’ve partnered up with the brand Aquasana because I know how crucial clean water is to my health. I’ve been so impressed with the many inexpensive filter options they offer – their water always tastes great, the NSF certified filters last a long time, and are easy to replace. All Aquasana drinking water filters are certified to remove and reduce… If you’re on a tight budget you can start out with their Countertop Water Filter. This is perfect if you are living in a rental too! A step up are their under the counter models, which install easily under your sink… If you’d like to make sure to filter out fluoride, they have a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system that is certified to filter all the above contaminants + fluoride. For the most complete solution, you can get a Whole House Filter. This gives you the peace of mind that the water from every tap in your home is filtered for up to 10 years. I personally love knowing that I can get clean water from every tap in the house, including the bathroom for brushing my teeth and showering. (Simply click on each filter option to learn about its features and compare here) Best of all, most of their filters are 50% off right now (expires soon) and they have a 90 day return policy if for any reason you don’t like the filter…which is perfect, so you have enough time to see how much money you are saving when you quit buying bottles. Your purchase also supports the work we do here at Food Babe, so thank you! I only partner with the best companies I personally have used and trust. If you know anyone buying bottled water, please share this post with them and let them know how much money they can save! I’m sure they will thank you! Here’s to healthy clean water for everyone – and to saving big bucks on this healthy habit too."
https://foodbabe.com/monsanto-caught-ghost-writing-pieces-published-forbes/,Monsanto Caught Ghost-Writing Pieces Published In Forbes,0,"There are a couple breaking stories that I want to make sure you know about… Newly released emails show how Monsanto infiltrated a scientific journal and persuaded them to retract a published study which revealed tumors on rats who were fed GMOs and Roundup. This has been coined the “Seralini Study”, which Monsanto has attacked since its initial publication in 2012. Over the years, many people have been misled to believe this study was a farce. This is one of the reasons why the dangers of GMOs coupled with Roundup continues to be questioned by the press and public. Monsanto will do anything to cover up the health risks of using their chemicals. The website Forbes just ended their relationship with writer Henry Miller after discovering that Monsanto ghost-wrote his article that was trying to downplay the cancer risk of Roundup. Forbes took the article down from their website yesterday but you’ve got to wonder how many people it misled since that article was up for over two years. Nowhere in the article did Miller disclose his relationship with Monsanto, nor the fact that they wrote for him! Monsanto admitted to the New York Times, “Our scientists have on occasion collaborated with Dr. Miller on other pieces” – so this wasn’t an isolated incident. Miller has been writing pro-GMO articles for Forbes for over 10 years. Who else at Forbes is hiding conflicts of interest like this? I have my own hunches on that. This is a good reminder to be our own health advocates and pay close attention to who is writing what we read. Look into who they are, who funds their work, and what types of claims they’ve made in the past. This is something I do when reading health-related articles – and in today’s age of political and industry propaganda and manipulations, it is imperative that we all take this step. After I outed the website Snopes.com for trying to squash the lab results showing Roundup in products like Cheerios, Stacy’s Pita Chips and Ritz Crackers, a member of the Food Babe Army forwarded me a copy of an email response they received from Snopes (I’ve highlighted the interesting parts in red): See my tweets to Snopes here and here… feel free to retweet them! It’s awful that a “fact checking” website like Snopes would make such defamatory statements about me and what we do here at Food Babe. As you can see, there are some serious detractors that do not want the truth about our food to be heard and these are just a few examples. It’s thrilling for me to see these relationships exposed, and I’m working on a HUGE project on this topic that I can’t wait to reveal to y’all in coming months. Until next time…"
https://foodbabe.com/healing-iced-turmeric-latte/,Healing Iced Turmeric Latte,0,"Turmeric is a powerful anti-inflammatory root and I’ve been trying to eat some every single day for the last few months to help me recover naturally from a wrist injury. This Iced Turmeric Latte recipe makes it so easy and delicious to add to your diet! Turmeric has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat a number of conditions and scientists believe that one of the reasons why turmeric is so powerful is that it contains curcumin. Its beneficial properties have been the subject of thousands of peer-reviewed and published studies. The biggest benefit that I’ve personally witnessed is turmeric’s ability to fight inflammation. If you are suffering from any injuries (as I was several years ago in my tailbone and now with my wrist), turmeric can help reduce inflammation. I was amazed at how well it worked for me back then, and to this day – whenever I have an injury – I turn to turmeric. This recipe is similar to Golden Milk, served over ice with a touch of honey, coconut water, and cinnamon. The coconut oil in this drink is essential, as this is what helps your body absorb all the goodness from the turmeric (which is fat-soluble) – so don’t skip this ingredient! I incorporate coconut oil in my diet often as it has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body and can assist in weight loss. Pour a couple cups of coconut or almond milk into a small pot and stir in one tablespoon of raw honey and two teaspoons of coconut oil. Turn the heat on low and warm the milk for a few minutes, stirring it every so often until the honey and oil is well incorporated and it’s warm to touch… Pour half a cup of coconut water into a blender and add three tablespoons of grated fresh turmeric (only use 1½ teaspoons if using ground turmeric) and a pinch of cinnamon. Give it a really good blend for a couple minutes… To serve, fill a couple tall glasses halfway up with ice. Spoon a few tablespoons of the blended turmeric mix into the glass and pour the warm milk over the ice until the glass is full. Kick back your heals and enjoy it with a friend! When you pick up your first bottle of Truvani Turmeric, I’ll send you two complimentary eBooks: Our mission at Truvani is to choose the absolute best ingredients, as nutrient-dense as possible, without processed chemical ingredients invented by the food industry to increase their bottom line. We enjoy food the way it was meant to be – real, whole, organic, and full of nutrients. Experience it for yourself! Share this recipe with anyone in your life who could use a healing drink like this!

https://foodbabe.com/coconut-oil-healthy-controversy-explained/,Is Coconut Oil Healthy? The Controversy Explained,0,"You probably read the recent headlines… And wondering to yourself “What the heck is going on?”… “I thought coconut oil was healthy”…”Crap, coconut oil is another fake health fad?” Well you are not alone, it seems the entire Internet freaked out at this “news” and for good reason. As you can probably imagine, my email and phone has been blowing up about all this – even my Mom sent me a text wondering if it was true. I know it’s frustrating when there is so much conflicting health information being fired at us from all directions. How can we know what to believe? How can we know we’re getting accurate advice? Who should we listen to? How can we expect to get healthy? It’s no secret that coconut oil is a regular part of my diet and I consider it one of the best oils to consume period. (I even partnered with the top organic coconut oil on the market as a result). Not everyone agrees with me, and that’s fine. But I’d be remiss if I didn’t remind you to all be very careful about health advice reported in the media – because some well-meaning reporters fall for basic industry tricks like this one that has just happened. Even if advice seems to come from a perfectly respectable organization on the surface (like the American Heart Association) – research who they are, who funds their work, and what types of health claims they’ve made in the past. This is something I do when reading health-related articles – and in today’s age of political and industry propaganda and manipulations, it is imperative that you take this step to be your own health advocate. The American Heart Association released a new Presidential Advisory recommending that everyone AVOID coconut oil, stating that it is high in saturated fat and raises “bad” cholesterol levels – which they believe leads to heart disease. In their press release, the lead author of the report recommends that we all stop using coconut oil and cook with “canola, or corn oil or soybean oil, or extra virgin olive oil.” And, he thinks it’s perfectly healthy to deep fry your food… ummm, what?!… “There’s nothing wrong with deep frying as long as you deep fry in a nice unsaturated vegetable oil” ~ Frank M. Sacks, lead author of American Heart Association’s Presidential Advisory. The American Heart Association (AHA) is the same organization who told us for years to eat margarine (which was notoriously high in trans fat) calling it “more heart-healthy” than butter because it contains “no dietary cholesterol”. They started this recommendation back in the 1960’s and continued it for decades while the primary ingredient in margarine was partially hydrogenated oil full of trans fat. Well, we now know that the trans fat in partially hydrogenated oils are responsible for upwards of 20,000 heart attacks every year – which spurred the FDA to finally ban it from our food (effective in 2018). It’s rare for the FDA to ban anything! Boy, I’d say the AHA was way off on that recommendation, wouldn’t you? “Of the half million Americans who die prematurely each year from heart disease—the leading cause of death in this country—at least 30,000 are killed by trans fats.” ~ Harvard epidemiologist Walter Willett Cans of Bruce’s Yams In Syrup with 18 grams of added sugar per serving, Prego “Heart Smart” Sauces made with added sugar and canola oil, Starkist Ranch Tuna Creations with added sugar and MSG, and Pepperidge Farm Whole Grain Honey Wheat Bread with added sugar, soybean oil, and two additives that contain trans fats (DATEM and monoglycerides) all get their official seal of approval. In the past, they’ve certified Fat-Free Chocolate Milk, Cocoa Puffs, Lucky Charms, and Trix cereal… yikes. Processed deli meats full of sugar, salt and preservatives (like heavily processed Boar’s Head!) get a big thumbs up from them as well. All of these products and dozens more insanely processed foods with the “American Heart Association Heart Check” Seal of Approval have each paid thousands of dollars in fees (up to $7,500 + annual renewal fees per product) to use the certified seal. “Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) have found that eating processed meat, such as bacon, sausage or processed deli meats, was associated with a 42% higher risk of heart disease” – Harvard School of Public Health, May 2010 “Over the course of the 15-year study on added sugar and heart disease, participants who took in 25% or more of their daily calories as sugar were more than twice as likely to die from heart disease as those whose diets included less than 10% added sugar.” – Harvard Medical School, Feb. 2014 They’ve even partnered up with “Healthy Dining Finder” which directs you to eat at Denny’s, Sizzler, and Red Robin… do they really believe these restaurants serve healthy food? Think of all the people who relied on the AHA’s endorsements and ate foods full of sugar, nitrates, and trans fat for years – and ended up sick as a result. How many people are still being misled? It. Is. Sickening. This is not where the AHA’s ties to industry end. Over the years, their sponsors have included a who’s who list of the worst Big Food brands out there, who fill their foods up with soybean oil, canola oil, processed meats, and sugar: The AHA is also raking in upwards of $15 million dollars per year from drug and healthcare companies – including over $3 million from Pfizer (the maker of the statin drug Lipitor that reduces cholesterol). Could this be why the AHA recommends that millions more Americans be prescribed statins, even healthy older people with no history of heart disease? The members of their research committee are raking in industry dollars too… receiving tens of thousands from drug companies to fund research, make trial appearances, and serve as consultants – which is a blatant conflict of interest. One author, Penny M. Kris-Etherton, discloses significant funding from Ag Canada, Canola Oil Council, and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. Could this be why she recommends “lean beef” as “heart healthy” and canola oil as a way to cut belly fat? In the past, she also served on the advisory board at Unilever (maker of I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter, Country Crock, Brummel & Brown, and Imperial Margarine). Another author, Jennifer G. Robinson, disclosed research funding from numerous drug companies, many of whom make cholesterol pills… Amarin, Amgen, AstraZeneca (maker of the statin Crestor), Eli Lilly, Glaxo-Smith Kline, Merck, Pfizer, Regeneron/Sanofi, and Takeda. Various conflict of interest disclosures reveal that Frank M. Sacks (lead author) has been paid by the industry to testify in court cases involving POM Wonderful, Hershey, Unilever, and Keebler. He also testified for or has received consulting fees from several drug companies including Abbott, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Merck, Roche, Sanofi and has received lecture fees from AstraZeneca. These previous associations were not disclosed as conflicts in the AHA’s report, but I consider this significant, don’t you? It’s important to recognize squarely where the AHA’s loyalty lies. They are protecting industries from which they receive millions of dollars. When their primary sources of revenue come from Big Food and Pharmaceutical companies, you’ve got to question the veracity of their opinions on what constitutes healthy food. The AHA’s recent statement on the saturated fat in coconut oil is NOTHING NEW coming from them. They have long held the position that processed vegetable oils (like canola, corn, soybean oils) are healthy and discredit any information to the contrary, while demonizing all saturated fats as detrimental to our health. This belief has persisted thanks to intense influence and lobbying by the Institute for Shortening and Edible Oils (ISEO), an industry trade group that protects the interests of vegetable oil manufacturers like Cargill, Bunge, and ConAgra. “As far back as 1968, the ISEO was mentioned in an internal memo written by the medical director of the American Heart Association: According to the memo, the ISEO objected to the AHA’s intention to include a warning about trans fats in its dietary guidelines; subsequently, the AHA took it out.” ~ Mother Jones, August 2012 Furthering this belief, in the 1960’s the sugar industry funded research that would hide the link between sugar consumption and heart disease, while promoting the idea that fat is the real culprit. The public didn’t find out the truth until internal sugar industry documents were released in 2016. There is well documented evidence that saturated fats do not increase your risk of heart disease. A recent meta-analysis in the British Journal of Medicine came to this conclusion. Another meta-analysis of 21 studies published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition has also come to this conclusion. Another meta-analysis published in 2017 found that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats (like corn oil) is not likely to reduce risk of heart disease. I could go on and on and on and on. A 2015 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that saturated fats may increase risk of heart disease, but NOT if they come from fish, dairy, or plants – such as coconuts! If you look at the countries that consume the most coconut oil, they’ve also got the some of the lowest rates of heart disease… what does that tell you? “For many years we have been told that to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD), we must lower our intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and instead eat more carbohydrates and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Backed up by the National Cholesterol Education Program, the National Institutes of Health, and the American Heart Association, the medical profession has promoted this idea eagerly, although the number of contradictory scientific reports is almost endless. There is in fact much evidence that doing the opposite is more relevant… There is no evidence that a lower intake of SFA can prevent CVD and a high intake of PUFAs without specification may result in a high intake of omega-6, which is associated with many adverse health effects. Because there is much evidence that saturated fat may even be beneficial, we urge the American Heart Association…to consider the aforementioned evidence when updating their future guidelines”. ~ The Questionable Benefits of Exchanging Saturated Fat With Polyunsaturated Fat, Mayo Clinic Proceedings, April 2014 If the AHA truly believes saturated fat is so bad, why do they have “heart healthy” recipes for beef and pork on their website, given these are the biggest sources of saturated fat in the American diet? Could it be because the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, the National Pork Board, Tyson, Hormel, and Smithfield have all paid money to have their meats and recipes “heart check” certified? This sure raises my eyebrows. We now know that cholesterol does some amazing things for your body and isn’t all bad as once believed – but it’s highly complex. Even if coconut oil raises cholesterol levels, this doesn’t tell you the whole story. According to Dr. Mark Hyman, what you want to watch out for is the type of cholesterol that is getting raised and particle size, along with high triglycerides: “As a doctor, I tell patients that abnormal cholesterol can become a problem when it is the small dense LDL particles, accompanied by high triglycerides. In fact small LDL particles actually triple your risk of heart disease. This is caused by high-carb, low-fat diets and is improved when you add fat back to the diet, including saturated fat.” ~ Is Coconut Oil Bad for Your Cholesterol? Mark Hyman, M.D. It’s also been shown that saturated fat in coconut oil increases “good” HDL cholesterol and increases the size of LDL particles (making them less likely to promote heart disease). On the other hand, low cholesterol can be harmful, linked to increased risk of cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and morbid depression. These oils go through an insane amount of processing with chemical solvents, steamers, neutralizers, de-waxers, bleach and deodorizers before they end up in the bottle. Corn and soybean oil are very high in omega-6 fatty acids which are known to promote inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation is a real killer, increasing the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. These oils are also strongly linked to cancer and are typically derived from GMO crops contaminated with Roundup herbicide. It could be that the AHA is just stuck in the 50’s and can’t come to grips with all the new research out there. But I have another theory which seems more plausible – the AHA is protecting the profits of the drug industry (their sponsors) who rely on us being unhealthy enough to need a prescription and the food industry who prefers to use cheap oils in their food and doesn’t want to spend more money for healthy ingredients. It’s all about the bottom line. Now that the general public is learning the truth about saturated fats and sugar, the industry is freaking out. They needed to find a new angle. They need to win their way back into the public’s hearts… and what better way to do it than to scare us… “Hey, you know that coconut oil in your cabinet that you thought was healthy? Well, it’s going to give you a heart attack”. For someone to die from a heart attack was virtually unheard of 100 years ago, it was extremely rare! In just a few short decades it became the leading cause of death in the ‘50’s and now heart disease remains as the #1 killer of Americans. The drugs pumped out by pharmaceutical companies and all those new “trans fat free” foods are doing nothing to stop this. What changed so dramatically during the last hundred years? One of the most significant changes to our diets was the switch from natural fats to processed and refined vegetable oils. Americans moved away from eating real butter and fresh foods, while increasing consumption of sugary processed foods made with vegetable oils. Data shows that in the last several decades Americans cut the fat from their diets by 25% while increasing intake of carbohydrates by more than 30%. The majority of these carbohydrates aren’t healthy fruits and vegetables either – but mostly refined breads, crackers, cereals, pastas, and other low-fat processed foods packed with added sugar. Where has cutting out the fat and gorging on refined grains and sugar gotten us? If you ask me, the health of our nation has tanked. It makes me incredibly sad, because I know most people are trying to eat right and do what their doctors and experts from organizations like the AHA tell them to do. No one wants to be overweight and sick, yet that is the reality for most Americans. I personally love coconut oil and all of the health benefits it provides. The tropical saturated fat in coconut oil contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), which have been shown to increase your metabolism and to REDUCE body fat (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4), while retaining muscle mass. It works to bring down chronic inflammation in the body and is an amazing source of energy. As a bonus, it’s also associated with increased antioxidant levels in the body that can slow aging! I use a variety of cooking oils in my kitchen. Read my investigation with a list of which oils I personally like to use here. If you know anyone who is wondering if coconut oil is dangerous (or is trusting the American Heart Association for health information), please share this post with them and keep spreading the truth! Even two members of my Advisory Council, who are both physicians that I greatly respect, are on opposite sides of this issue and do not agree. Dr. Joel Kahn agrees with the American Heart Association’s conclusions (because he is generally against all oils) and Dr. Mark Hyman does not… “My advice is to not get lost in the jungle of discussion over coconut and its oil. Without a doubt the AHA Advisors were responsible in highlighting the lack of data for a health benefit to adding coconut oil to the diet and the likely risks”. ~ Joel Kahn, M.D. “First, there is not a single study showing that coconut oil causes heart disease. Not one. Second, the whole case against coconut oil is founded on a hypothesis that has been proven wrong”. ~ Mark Hyman, M.D. I greatly appreciate this difference of opinion, and of course, I have my own."
https://foodbabe.com/curried-cauliflower-salad/,Curried Cauliflower Salad,0,"Back when I was a kid, I really didn’t like cauliflower. It had zero flavor to me! Looking back, I think I just didn’t give myself enough courage to try different dishes and now I really love it. I make all kinds of things with cauliflower… soups, “rice”, roasted veggies, and I even sometimes blend it into breakfast smoothies! This new salad recipe is quickly becoming a favorite around here because it’s packed with flavor and only takes a few minutes of prep work in the kitchen to throw it all together. While many white foods (like bleached flour, sugar, and refined pasta) are heavily processed and leached of nutrients, don’t let the fact that cauliflower is white fool you into thinking it’s not good for you… Here’s why you should add it to your diet ASAP if you haven’t already: Another great way to use cauliflower is to pulse it in a food processor to make a healthier substitute for rice – so it’s easy to add to your everyday diet. I use cauliflower “rice” to make a light and filling Lemon Asparagus Quinoa Risotto (recipe here) and a delicious taco salad (recipe here). I also love to make these AMAZING Buffalo Cauliflower Bites (recipe here) that taste like buffalo wings without the chicken! I hope this encourages you to add a bit more cauliflower to your life!

https://foodbabe.com/body-slimming-italian-turkey-kale-soup/,Body-Slimming Italian Turkey Kale Soup,0,"One of my favorite meals is soup! It’s economical, easy to pack with lots of veggies and protein, and the leftovers keep well in the fridge. This Italian Turkey Kale Soup recipe has been in heavy rotation at my house this year ever since having the baby. Not only is it super easy to make but it really helped me to shed the extra baby weight (more on this topic in a post to come!). You probably already have most of these ingredients in your kitchen right now too, which makes it even easier to put together on a busy weeknight. Here’s how I make it… Get out a cutting board and dice up your veggies. I use three celery stalks, a couple carrots, and one yellow onion – but you could use other vegetables here (like zucchini, cauliflower, etc) instead if you’ve already got them on hand. You’ll also want to mince up a couple garlic cloves and set aside for later. Swirl about a tablespoon of olive oil into a large soup pot and warm it under medium heat. Stir in the ground turkey and cook for a few minutes until it is slightly browned. Remember to only choose organic turkey to avoid meat that was raised with growth-promoting drugs like antibiotics and ractopamine. Add your diced celery, carrots, and onion to the pot and give it a good stir. Sprinkle everything with a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, a tablespoon of italian seasoning, a few dashes of black pepper, and a couple teaspoons of salt (you can add less salt now if you prefer and then add it right before serving to taste)… Continue cooking for about five minutes until the veggies are tender. Stir in the minced garlic and cook a couple more minutes just until fragrant… Your kitchen should smell really good about now! Pour in a couple cups of homemade chicken broth along with two cups of filtered water. I pretty much always make my own chicken broth because most store-bought versions contain flavors, hidden MSG flavor enhancers (such as yeast extract) and added sugar – even some organic versions! You can see how I make my simple broth here. Turn up the heat and put a bay leaf in the soup. As soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the heat down to low and simmer the soup for 20 minutes… While it’s simmering, roughly chop up a couple big handfuls of kale – about two cups worth. Five minutes before serving, take out the bay leaf and add the kale to the pot. Allow the kale to slowly wilt for a few minutes… Enjoy this beautiful soup now or store in a glass container in the fridge for several days. It’s so filling and comforting… You’ll find more weight loss recipes like this in my membership meal planning program.

https://foodbabe.com/zero-calorie/,These Zero Calorie Drinks Promote Weight Gain Not Loss,0,"I’m so happy to see that sales of Diet Coke and Pepsi keep plummeting… more people are wising up to the fact that these drinks are ridiculously horrible for the body and looking for healthier options. In their place, new zero-calorie drinks and flavored waters are flooding the market, and are now taking up some serious shelf space in major grocery stores. Some of these fruity waters and fizzy “sugar free” drinks are being promoted as health drinks – but are they really? Unfortunately, many of them are filled with controversial additives that can be sabotaging your weight and your health – even if they have no calories, look like bottled water, or have really short ingredient lists! Let’s take a closer look at what’s in some of the most popular brands like Sparkling Ice and Cascade Ice. They sell these by the case at Costco, but are they truly any better than soda? These drinks have “zero calories” because they are sweetened with Sucralose (an additive linked to cancer). The artificial colors in these drinks (Yellow 5, Red 40, and Blue 1) are derived from petroleum and linked to several health issues, including allergies, cancer, and hyperactivity in children. Europe requires any food containing dyes to carry the warning label, “May Have an Adverse Effect on Activity and Attention in Children”, but that’s not required here in the States. If that’s not bad enough, they’re also preserved with Potassium Benzoate, which can form the carcinogen Benzene when combined with vitamin C (which is present in some flavors). This is a toxic combo in a plastic bottle! Perhaps they purposefully make the ingredients so hard to read on a bottle of Propel because they are so horrible! Propel Flavored Water Black Cherry: Water, Citric Acid, Sodium Hexametaphosphate, Natural Flavor, Salt, Potassium Sorbate, Potassium Citrate, Sodium Citrate, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Sucralose, Acesulfame Potassium, Calcium Disodium EDTA, Calcium Pantothenate (Vitamin B5), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), Vitamin E Acetate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6). Propel, Nestle Splash, Dasani Flavored Water, Diet Snapple, and PowerAde Zero contain artificial sweeteners like sucralose, acesulfame potassium or aspartame. Although these have no calories, artificial sweeteners have been shown to contribute to weight gain by encouraging sugar cravings. Research finds they stimulate your appetite, increase sugar cravings, and promote fat storage and weight gain. Researchers from the University of Texas discovered that drinks made with artificial sweeteners will expand your waist girth, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. When you drink something sweet – even when it has no calories – your brain is tricked into wanting more calories because your body is not getting enough energy (i.e. calories) to be satisfied. So you keep craving sweets, eating sweets, and gaining weight. This is why a lot of people never reach their full health potential or weight loss goals, because they are constantly being pushed around by these chemical artificial sweeteners that trick the brain and body. Sodium Polyphosphate and Sodium Hexametaphosphate: These preservatives are full of phosphorous, which can create a mineral imbalance in the body. When you eat (or drink) phosphate additives like these often (which is really easy to do in our processed food world) it can put you at risk for kidney damage, increased mortality, heart disease, and accelerated aging. Calcium Disodium EDTA: This preservative is made from of formaldehyde, sodium cyanide, and ethylene diamine… yikes! Is this something you really want to drink every day? It has the ability to build up in the body, becoming more toxic if you drink it for several days in a row, which could possibly lead to health problems. It’s also known to lower your body’s ability to absorb vitamins (making all those B vitamins added to Propel pretty worthless). Potassium Sorbate: This preservative has been shown to be genotoxic to white blood cells, which could lead to cancer. It has also been shown to induce DNA damage when combined with vitamin C (this combo is in Propel). Citric Acid: Although this is naturally found in lemon and other fruits, the additive used in these drinks is typically derived from mold made with GMO corn (not from fruit). Frequent consumption is linked to an increase in tooth decay and also can irritate the gut. Bai, Core, Hubert’s Diet Lemonade, Blossom Water, and Vitamin Water Zero are sweetened with the sugar alcohol erythritol. This sweetener can wreak havoc on healthy gut bacteria, which can lead to a whole host of diseases and if you’re trying to lose weight or stay slim, keeping your gut healthy is vital! Erythritol is also known to cause diarrhea, stomach upset, headache when consumed in “normal amounts”, is a powerful insecticide, and can also increase appetite just like artificial sweeteners do so you’ll end up eating more food. Research by Cornell University shows that the body metabolizes erythritol and associates high levels of erythritol in the blood to weight gain, which has spawned more studies. Although this is a naturally occurring sugar that is sometimes found in fruit, food manufacturers don’t actually use the natural stuff. Instead they usually start with GMO corn (unless organic or non-GMO verified) and then put it through a complex fermentation process to come up with chemically pure erythritol. These drinks are better than a Diet Coke – but are they really as clean as they seem? I try to avoid natural flavors, especially if it’s in something that I’d consume often and in large amounts – like a drink. {Picture of natural flavors on display at the IFT Expo} Although the ingredient label on Hint Flavored Water just states purified water and natural flavors, Hint has been sued because their drinks contain propylene glycol – a synthetic ingredient. Propylene glycol is one of the hidden ingredients that was (and may still be) used in their natural flavors and doesn’t need to be listed on the label. This goes back to my point that whenever you are drinking something with natural flavors, it is not necessarily natural and you don’t know what’s really in the bottle. {Excerpt from complaint filed in the court case: Lisa Kim Madrigal, et al v. Hint Inc.} {Excerpt of test results showing propylene glycol in Hint flavored water} LaCroix states their flavors contain no artificial ingredients, but they also are not under any obligation to disclose exactly what’s in them, so we just have to take their word for it. “There is no legal requirement to disclose what’s in the natural flavor. So customers have no choice but to believe companies when they say they don’t use artificial additives in their flavors.” ~ The Mysterious Allure of LaCroix’s ‘Natural Flavor’ – WIRED, December 15, 2016 I don’t consider it safe to drink out of cans often because of the BPA that is usually present in them. This is what LaCroix says about the presence of BPA in their cans, which I don’t find reassuring, especially since I know how inefficient the FDA is at setting “guidelines” for the chemicals in our food… “All LaCroix products meet the guidelines set by the FDA and are completely safe to drink. Recently, media reports have raised questions about the use of bisphenol A (BPA) by can and bottle manufacturers. While can linings may contain trace amounts of BPA to prevent spoilage and protect food and beverages from direct contact with the can, these trace amounts are virtually eliminated during the curing process.” ~ Source: http://www.lacroixwater.com/nutritional-faqs/ I feel like if something tastes like lemon, then it should actually contain lemon! And it honestly just takes two seconds to squeeze some fresh lemon juice (or grapefruit or whatever fruit you’d like) into sparkling water and know exactly what you’re drinking. That’s not to mention all the nutrients that you are getting from the lemon juice as well…because natural flavors may have zero calories, but they also have zero nutrition and provide zero health benefits. My main go-to drink is plain filtered water. I filter my own water at home and always carry a stainless steel or glass container of filtered water around with me – to the gym, in the car, to meetings, and even to some restaurants! Drinking toxin-free water makes a major difference in the way I feel and I consider it a vital part of my everyday life. But, it can be boring to just drink water all the time! These are some other healthy drinks I personally enjoy: For more healthy and refreshing drink recipes, consider joining my meal plan program here – you’ll get a new set of recipes each month.

https://foodbabe.com/really-healthy-ice-cream-brand/,Is There Really A Healthy Ice Cream Brand?,0,"I love ice cream! When I want a treat, ice cream is one of my favorites! But take a walk through the typical ice cream aisle and you’ll find a minefield of risky (and sometimes dangerous) additives mixed with factory farmed milk. I’m a firm believer that everyone should still enjoy treats from time to time, but don’t consider it a treat to poison myself with heart-wrecking trans fats, carcinogenic poisons like glyphosate, and additives linked to gut inflammation. I’ve learned that you can enjoy treats (even ice cream!) that won’t destroy your health and pack on the pounds, but you just need to know what to look for. There are now some brands that seem healthier like Halo Top and Arctic Zero, and many people have been asking me if they are TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. I’ll get to them in a moment, but first let’s check out what you’ll find in the major ice cream brands. Gut wrecking emulsifiers: Most ice creams are full of emulsifiers that have been shown to disrupt the good bacteria in your gut and can lead to disease and obesity. Companies use these because it’s cheaper than filling their product with 100% whole food ingredients. Of course the main ingredients in ice cream (cream and sugar) are also linked to obesity, but when you eat the real thing you feel more satisfied and are less likely to down an entire pint. Artificial Colors: Whenever you see a color like Red 40, Red 3, Yellow 5, or Blue 1, these are derived from petroleum and linked to several health issues including allergies, cancer, and hyperactivity in children. Mono and Diglycerides (or Partially Hydrogenated Oils): These contain trans fat which is strongly correlated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The CDC has linked trans fat to at least 20,000 heart attacks per year and the Institute of Medicine says there is no safe level to eat. This additive is often found in low-fat ice creams where they are trying to make up for what they took out, but you’ll find it in many others too! Sugar Alcohols and Zero-Calorie Sweeteners: “No Sugar Added” and “Carb Smart” ice creams are packed sugar alcohols like maltitol syrup and sorbitol. These are associated with destroying gut heath, and a healthy gut is the key to good health and a slim waistline. Artificial sweeteners like sucralose (Splenda) and acesulfame potassium have been shown to contribute to weight gain by encouraging sugar cravings. When you eat something sweet – even when it has no calories – your brain is tricked into wanting more calories because your body is not getting enough energy (i.e. calories) to be satisfied. So you keep craving sweets, eating sweets, and gaining weight. They also come with serious health risks! Artificial flavors: These synthetic flavors are made from proprietary chemicals to make fake food taste real. This is not a single ingredient – each flavor may contain of up to 100 ingredients, including synthetic chemicals, solvents and preservatives such as BHA, propylene glycol, MSG, parabens, and more. Natural Flavors: The only difference between natural and artificial flavors mentioned above, is that natural flavors are derived from things found in nature (such as beaver glands). Just like artificial flavors, they are created in a lab by a team of scientists and can contain up to 100 hidden ingredients. The bottom line: You have no idea what you are eating – and it might be propylene glycol, BHA, and parabens. Soybean Oil: This unhealthy oil increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. When it comes to organic Soymilk ice creams, an abundance of soy itself is not healthy in the diet as it can disrupt hormones and lead to disease. Soy also has an abundance of phytic acid that leaches calcium and other vital minerals from your body. Cottonseed Oil: I was shocked to find cottonseed oil in LaLoo’s Capraccino Almond Fudge Ice Cream. This oil generally comes from GMO cotton crops that require an intense application of agricultural chemicals and have been called the “World’s Dirtiest Crop”. Residues from these pesticides can remain in cottonseed oil and cottonseeds are subjected to intensive chemical refining with toxic hexane, bleach, and deodorizers. I consider it one of the worst ingredients in food. “Sugar” Instead of “Cane Sugar”: The majority of sugar in this country comes from GMO sugar beets and not from cane. These sugar beets are Roundup-Ready, which means they are sprayed with the herbicide Roundup (glyphosate) and don’t die. Whenever an ingredient list just says “sugar” instead of “cane sugar” that indicates it’s from GMO sugar beets. When my team contacted LaLoo’s Goat Milk Ice Cream they said their ingredients are “clean” and that they’re currently working on getting verified by the Non-GMO Project. But, unless you see that label on there, consider it unverified! Conventional (not organic) Dairy: Some brands like Breyer’s, Tillamook and Häagen-Dazs have some flavors with cleaner ingredient lists with fewer additives, but they don’t use organic cream or milk. I outline all of the reasons to only choose organic dairy products in this post. Häagen-Dazs has a non-GMO claim on their ice cream, but that doesn’t apply to the cream, milk, or eggs, in that the animals were likely raised on GMO feed. Their non-GMO claim is 3rd party verified by SGS and their standards don’t apply to animal feed – and a rep from Häagen-Dazs confirmed this with us. Ben and Jerry’s is another brand that uses non-GMO ingredients, but admits the cows are still fed GMO grains (but are trying to transition and hopefully will). Why to avoid dairy from GMO-fed cows: Organically raised cows are only permitted to eat organic non-GMO food and organic grass. Ultimately, you want to look for certified organic ice cream to avoid dairy raised with herbicide-laden GMOs, hormones, antibiotics and all the drugs that are prohibited on organic farms. I’ve gotten a lot of emails about Halo Top because they market themselves as a healthier alternative to regular ice cream that’s low-calorie, high-protein, and low-sugar… and they are REALLY POPULAR right now. This brand has a real “Health Halo” around it (haha), but I’m not buying it. They’ve done such a great job marketing it as healthy ice cream that some people are even treating it like a diet food and the founder says he eats it every morning… which sounds just crazy, but who wouldn’t like to have ice cream for breakfast, LOL. Here’s why that really isn’t a good idea (sorry guys!)… “Email from Halo Top (May 2017): “We do use only non-GMO ingredients in Halo Top, and the cows from which we get our dairy ingredients are never treated with growth hormones (like rBST). We’re not yet at a point, though, where we can guarantee the makeup of the grain for the cows’ feed across the supply chain. Working on it though!” “Hey Vani I felt like this was something that needed to be shared. Halo ice cream that I feel like has been pitching themselves as a healthier ice cream won’t disclose what their “natural flavoring” is. Thought you’d like to know their cop out response: Hi Alyssa! I inquired into the flavorings for you, and it turns out that apparently the flavorings industry is highly competitive, and the flavoring makers we work with keep their exact formula proprietary to themselves for competitive reasons. Even so, we of course require confirmation that the flavors are indeed all-natural, gluten-free, kosher, etc. I know it’s not exactly the answer you were looking for but I hope it helps a little!” Arctic Zero is another “healthy” ice cream that really isn’t. They claim their whey comes from a “GMO-free region” but that doesn’t guarantee how the cows are fed: Email from Arctic Zero (May 2017): “We have no control over what the cows are fed, but please know we get all our whey protein from a GMO-free region. Our whey protein is GMO-free certified before added to our product and our final product is tested for GMO and it is GMO-free. Please know that our whey protein is not produced from genetically modified organisms, and does not consists of, or contain genetically modified organisms. Therefore, our whey protein is certified GMO-free”. Arctic Zero is not 100% organic, the whey isn’t from organic cows, and it also contains processed “functional fiber” additives and not-so-natural flavors, so I don’t consider this a good choice. Is it certified organic? Is it flavored naturally with vanilla bean, lemon, cinnamon, cocoa, etc.? Or, did they take a shortcut with “natural flavors”? Is it made entirely with whole food ingredients? Or, does it contain additives you don’t have in your kitchen like carrageenan, yellow #5, erythritol, and mono and diglycerides? NOTE: Not every flavor by these brands is perfect and you still need to read the ingredient list to make sure you know what you are eating. What’s your favorite ice cream brand? Tell me in the comments!"
https://foodbabe.com/marinated-cannellini-bean-salad/,Marinated Cannellini Bean Salad,0,"This chilled bean salad recipe is perfect for a backyard BBQ on a hot day or for a simple protein-packed lunch! I’ve always loved to eat tangy bean salads, but never the stale store-bought versions that are usually made with inflammatory soybean oil and added sweeteners. If you’ve never been a fan of bean salads, this recipe is so fresh and flavorful that it might change your mind! I regularly include beans in my diet for several reasons. Beans are an amazing source of protein and soluble fiber – so they keep you feeling full for hours and can help you lose weight. They are full of nutrients that fight heart disease and there’s ample evidence that beans reduce the risk of cancer and enhance longevity. When it comes to buying beans, I typically buy dried organic beans (which are often found super cheap in the bulk section!) When you cook them yourself, you can avoid BPA and save money too. If you do buy canned to save time, remember to choose brands that are BPA free like Eden Foods."

If you’ve heard that “detoxing is a myth”, then you have to read this post where I share the science behind detoxing. The truth is that our bodies are working overtime every day to process all of the substances that come in and to expel toxins – but they are being pushed to the brink. When our organs are overtaxed and overburdened with toxins, symptoms can creep up such as fatigue, digestion problems, bloating, weight gain and muscle aches. When these symptoms go unchecked and our bodies are not able to detox optimally, we are at risk for greater health problems down the road. Dr. Mark Hyman, M.D. (a member of my advisory counsel and a trusted mentor) says that detoxification starts in the diet. Dr. Hyman is a huge advocate of supporting the natural detoxification processes in the body with specific foods, such as lemons, garlic, and cruciferous vegetables."

Now Genevieve is taking her mission to the next level with a beautiful new book that is out this week, The Mama Natural Week-By-Week Guide to Pregnancy & Childbirth. She was kind enough to share an excerpt from the book below. ❤️❤️❤️ First off, I’d like to thank Vani for the opportunity to share an excerpt from my book with you! I’ve been a part of the Food Babe Army since the very beginning, and I’m so grateful for all of your world-changing work! So, what’s everybody yelling about? Until the advent of modern medicine, babies were typically born at home, and mamas-to-be were attended to almost exclusively by women—either female relatives or, in most cases (even as far back as antiquity), hired midwives. By the mid- to late 1800s, however, a kind of turf war broke out. Midwifery became associated with old-world folk medicine, whereas newly licensed physicians—exclusively men, many of whom had never even seen a live birth—began to advertise their more “modern” and “sophisticated” techniques. A few decades later, an American obstetrician by the name of Joseph DeLee called for a ban on the use of midwives altogether—he referred to them as “evil” and “barbaric.” DeLee also put forth a bold new notion: that pregnancy, rather than a natural process, was “pathogenic” in nature. In other words, pregnancy was like a sickness or a disease, and he thought it was best treated as such. By the 1930s, hospital birth had replaced home birth as the norm. And things continued that way, with midwife-attended birth declining year after year after year. Before we get ahead of ourselves, it’s important to point something out: in the old days, the practice of medicine—in all fields, not just obstetrics—was pretty brutal. There is plenty of evidence, for example, that the earliest doctor-attended births did not exactly go well. Back in the day, giving birth in a hospital was far more dangerous than giving birth at home, and the maternal death rate actually increased at the beginning of the twentieth century. (Infection rates in hospitals were sky-high, for one thing, in part because doctors didn’t know to wash their hands between patients.) Those early, hard-won discoveries, however, paved the way for astonishing medical breakthroughs. Doctors learned about the transmission of infection and disease via bacteria. They developed smarter and safer surgical techniques. They helped make pregnancy and childbirth—once a pretty serious health risk—exceedingly safe for most women and babies. Case in point: the ideal Cesarean rate is between 10 percent and 15 percent, according to the World Health Organization. Yet 33 percent of American women—more than double the recommended rate—are currently giving birth via C-section. Why? There are plenty of theories, including the idea that some women are just “too posh to push.” (Total myth, by the way. Only 1 percent to 2 percent of women just “decide” to have a completely elective, medically unnecessary C-section.) The most likely culprit is the modern, medicalized approach to labor and delivery. These days, a standard hospital birth may go a little something like this: Guess what? Every single one of those totally standard, commonplace procedures is associated with a higher likelihood of eventual C-section. Well, first, let me make it very clear: C-sections save lives and thank God we have them. Epidurals, when used judiciously, can actually prevent some moms from ending up in the operating room. However, with a 33% c-section rate and over 60% epidural rate, we have gone off course for the original intent of interventions. While I do support an informed mama’s desire for an epidural to help her during labor, not all moms are told about the side effects and risks of getting said interventions. If you’re wondering why that matters—who cares if the C-section rate is kinda high?—well, there are a whole host of reasons. For one thing, it’s easy to forget that a Cesarean is serious, invasive abdominal surgery; the associated risks and side effects are considerably higher than in uncomplicated vaginal births. Babies born via C-section, meanwhile, have a higher chance of developing asthma, allergies, obesity, and diabetes later in life; they’re also less likely to successfully breastfeed. While it’s certainly true that not every woman can or should deliver vaginally (C-sections can be life-saving for mamas and babies who need them! I was a c-section baby myself.), it seems to me that we should be doing what we can to lower the rates. Unfortunately, other forms of medical intervention are on the rise, too. The use of Pitocin, for example, has doubled since 1990, even though it may be less safe than we previously thought: a 2013 study at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York found that Pitocin was associated with lower APGAR scores (a test to evaluate a newborn’s health), as well as unexpected admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Epidurals—administered to roughly 60 percent of laboring women—can mess with mama’s natural production of oxytocin, thereby extending labor and increasing the risk of perineal tear. (Ouch!) The further we get from the idea that women were designed to give birth—the more we treat mamas-to-be like sick people—the more likely they are to accept interventions they neither want nor actually need. We have so sanitized and anesthetized the birth experience that many women have no idea what their bodies are actually capable of doing. And no awareness of the potential side effects of all those “modern” medical services. You can see how quickly this becomes a vicious cycle. In fact, it’s called the “Cascade of Intervention.” And once it starts, the birth experience you may have planned for can begin to slip through your fingers. Before you know it, the baby is in distress and you’re being prepped for an emergency C-section. Rather than something you did, it can feel as though childbirth was something that was done to you. When that happens, mamas might feel anything from overwhelmed and scared to violated and depressed. In 1989, midwives were the lead care providers at just 3 percent of American births. These days, the number is closer to 9 percent, and it’s been rising steadily for the last twenty-five years. Consistent midwife care throughout pregnancy is associated with better birth outcomes for both baby and mama. While you can reap plenty of rewards by sticking with a natural-minded obstetrician in a hospital setting—women who give birth naturally recover faster and go home sooner—there are benefits to getting out of the hospital, too: among women who choose to deliver at birth centers, only 6 percent do so by C-section. The most compelling reason to go natural, however, might be the simplest to understand, as well as the easiest to overlook: women were designed to give birth. When mamas are encouraged to trust the ancient wisdom of their bodies, when they’re allowed to focus on the process without distraction, they don’t just have shorter labors and deliver healthier babies—they feel empowered regardless of how their birth unfolds. And that’s the whole point. That women can make the right choices for their bodies, their births and their babies. It starts by getting informed. I’ve just published the first week-by-week pregnancy guide from a natural perspective. Featuring insights from a certified nurse midwife (who happened to deliver both of my children), as well as a registered nurse and doula, the book is packed with helpful info on: This book is evidence-based, empowering and entertaining. ? (No boring text books over here!) If pregnancy is in your future, or if you know anyone who’s pregnant, please consider picking up a copy. My goal is to get the book into Babies R Us and Walmart, where we can reach moms who may have never heard about skin-to-skin contact, delayed cord clamping, or gentle cesarean. But in order to get into mainstream retailers, we need to show those stores that there is a groundswell of interest in natural childbirth – and a demand for this natural guide. Would you consider ordering a copy and…. Thank you so much for your support, Food Babe Army! While some mamas do get the birth of their dreams, I know firsthand that it doesn’t always work out that way. But if we come from an informed place, we can feel good about the experience no matter what. I hope every mama out there gets the support and resources she needs to have an empowered and grace-filled birth. ❤️"
https://foodbabe.com/the-worst-ingredient-in-starbucks-unicorn-frappuccino-why-you-shouldnt-drink-it/,The Worst Ingredient In Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino & Why You Shouldn’t Drink It,0,"When I first saw the new Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino I just knew that kids everywhere were going to be drinking this – I mean what kid isn’t going to want a drink that looks like this! But of course…the first thing that popped into my mind was what the heck is it made out of? Well, we found out, and it’s not pretty. Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino Ingredients: Ice, Milk, Crème Frappuccino Syrup [Water, Sugar, Salt, Natural And Artificial Flavor, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid], Whipped Cream [Cream (Cream, Mono And Diglycerides, Carrageenan), Vanilla Syrup (Sugar, Water, Natural Flavors, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid)], Mango Syrup [Sugar, Water, Mango Juice Concentrate, Natural Flavor, Passion Fruit Juice Concentrate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Turmeric, Gum Arabic], Blue Drizzle [White Chocolate Mocha Sauce (Sugar, Condensed Skim Milk, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Natural Flavor, Salt, Potassium Sorbate, Monoglycerides), Classic Syrup (Sugar, Water, Natural Flavors, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid), Sour Blue Powder (Citric Acid, Color [Spirulina, Water, Sugar, Maltodextrin, Citric Acid])], Pink Powder [Dextrose, Fruit And Vegetable Color (Apple, Cherry, Radish, Sweet Potato)], Sour Blue Powder [Citric Acid, Color (Spirulina, Water, Sugar, Maltodextrin, Citric Acid)]. Considering the average ADULT male isn’t supposed to be eating more than 36 grams of sugar in an entire day (and only 25 grams if you’re a woman) – just one of these drinks is going to put you WAY over the edge – making it even worse for kids. The Unicorn Frappuccino grande has 59 grams of sugar and a shocking 76 grams in a venti size. It’s totally outrageous that Starbucks is promoting this drink at all, and especially to children! Entire bag of Hostess Powdered Donettes (75 grams of sugar). This is 20 donettes! Four large scoops Baskin Robbins Chocolate Chip Ice Cream (72 grams of sugar). I hope this makes you think twice before you buy this for yourself or your kids. Please share with everyone you know!"
https://foodbabe.com/slow-cooker-southwest-black-bean-dip-homemade-chips/,Slow Cooker Southwest Black Bean Dip With Homemade Chips,0,"This time of year we love to get together and spend more time outside at parties and BBQ’s with friends and family. If we’re heading out, of course it’s customary to bring a dish and so I always do (and often bring several). This way I know that I’ll have something healthy to eat and can also share with my loved ones how delicious healthy eating can be. This fun recipe for Slow Cooker Southwest Bean Dip is going to be put to big use this year for sure! As crazy as it has been around here with a new baby, I’m always looking for ways to keep my food simple and even when I’m busy I don’t want to go down the road of buying processed foods full of health-wrecking additives. When I recently checked out the ingredients on bean dips at the store, my mind was reeling. Way back in the day, I used to love Fritos Bean Dip and actually thought it was good for me because it’s low fat and had fiber. Boy was I wrong! This ingredient sounds clean and innocent, but isn’t what it seems! This is how food manufacturers can get away with putting all kinds of hidden ingredients in your food and just mask it under the name “natural flavors”. Companies use them because it’s cheaper than using real food ingredients and they help make heavily processed food taste good (and addicting). Natural flavors are highly complex chemical concoctions that can contain up to 100 ingredients, including substances like propylene glycol and BHA – and none of these need to be identified on the label. Since I like to know exactly what I’m eating, natural flavors are a no-go for me! Tostitos Bean Dip is even way worse with artificial colors (yellow #5 and #6) derived from petroleum, controversial preservatives, and MSG. This is no way to party!! Beware that almost all tortilla chips and pita chips are made from GMOs and inflammatory oils like corn and cottonseed oils… That’s not the only reason to avoid conventional chips like these… as I reported previously, some Stacy’s Simply Naked Pita Chips (non-GMO and non-organic version) were tested and found to have over 800 ppb of glyphosate weedkiller (aka Roundup) in them – and that’s more than what’s permitted in drinking water. Yikes! If you’re going to use store-bought chips, make sure that you only buy certified organic chips to avoid GMOs and greatly reduce your risk of glyphosate exposure. Instead of buying a bag of chips from the store, I prefer to make chips at home with sprouted grain tortillas or pitas. Nothing beats the flavor of these homemade chips! This Southwest Black Bean Dip is so super simple to make, you just basically throw the ingredients in your slow cooker and when you come back in a couple hours it’s practically ready to go. A lot of people just pull out their slow cookers in the winter, but I think they’re perfect for summer cooking so you don’t heat up your house. If you are trying to eat a healthy diet but are limited on time, using a slow cooker makes it virtually effortless to stick to eating unprocessed food on a regular basis. This recipe comes from my Real Food Slow Cooker Guide, which has over 50 slow cooker recipes that are all incredibly delicious and easy. These recipes are so simple and hassle-free that they make a healthy lifestyle a breeze!"
https://foodbabe.com/this-new-label-on-food-will-keep-you-from-getting-poisoned-by-monsantos-weedkiller/,This New Label On Food Will Keep You From Getting Poisoned By Monsanto’s Weedkiller,0,"A large body of peer reviewed research links glyphosate (which is sprayed on the majority of crops in this country) to cancer, reproductive problems, liver, kidney and skin cell damage, antibiotic-resistance, and more. The WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer has deemed it a probable carcinogen. One of the biggest sellers of glyphosate, Monsanto, has been colluding with the EPA to keep it on the market. It’s truly outrageous and I’m as angry as you are. A few months ago when the story broke that popular foods like Cheerios and Stacy’s Pita Chips contain glyphosate weedkiller – we were outraged. If you didn’t hear the news, Food Democracy Now! and The Detox Project commissioned these tests which found glyphosate in many popular American foods… even some that are organic and non-GMO! My reporting on this was my most shared post of 2016, with millions of views. It struck a chord with so many of you and for good reason. Since all of this has come out, I’ve received thousands of comments and emails from people who want to know how to avoid glyphosate and know if the food we buy at the store contains it. I’m right there with ya, I want to know too. The only way to find out if the food you are buying contains glyphosate is to literally send it to a lab and get it tested. It’s ridiculous. We are totally in the dark and have no clue whether the food we are buying is tainted with this poison. There could be an insane amount of glyphosate in the food we are eating every day, and we’d never know. When Henry Rowlands from The Detox Project told me about his latest project and this label, I was bursting at the seams and couldn’t wait to tell you all about it! The “Glyphosate Residue Free” verification program has begun labeling products that have been tested and are free of glyphosate. They are working with food manufacturers and grocery chains, so that soon we will see labels like this on products! Although we already have the Non-GMO Project label to avoid GMOs, that’s the only information that it provides. The “Non-GMO Project” label only verifies that a product doesn’t contain GMOs. While that is good, it’s limited to GMOs only and unfortunately won’t tell you if those non-GMO Cheerios you are buying are free of glyphosate. The new Glyphosate Residue Free label takes this a step further and just offers more transparency and information about the food you are buying. This label applies to any GMO, non-GMO, or organic food. This is important because glyphosate doesn’t discriminate. No matter how healthy we eat or how much we try to protect ourselves from it, this weedkiller is being used on most major conventional food crops – such as wheat, tomatoes, sugar, nuts, oranges, apples, beans, and corn. It isn’t just used on GMOs but on 70 different food crops in the U.S. – and winding up in practically everything Americans eat. Glyphosate is also so rampant in our environment that it is contaminating even food that isn’t directly sprayed with it – such as organic food. It’s been found in honey, cereals, meat, drinking water, breast milk, infant formula, chips, cookies… the list goes on. There is only so much glyphosate-free food out there and it is going to take awhile to rid it from our food system. That’s why this label is such a game-changer. When brands start testing their food and finding glyphosate, they will take steps to clean up their supply chains. This will improve the integrity of the organic label and our food system as a whole. The very first product to be verified “Glyphosate Residue Free” is Leaf & Love Organic Lemonade, which you can find at some natural grocery stores and also online. This is just the beginning and many more products are in the process of getting verified right now! I’ve partnered up with The Detox Project to help spread the word about this new label and verification program, but I need your help. The success of this label is going to depend on us. We need to spread the word to food companies and let them know that we want them to verify their products and why. We need to educate our favorite food brands as to why this label is important and why they’d want to make sure that their products don’t contain glyphosate. I can’t wait to start seeing this label in stores! Share this post with your friends and family and tell them about this exciting new label. Spread the word!"
https://foodbabe.com/worst-diets-follow/,The Worst Diets To Follow,0,"Recently a friend showed me the annual ranking by U.S. News and World Report of what they consider the “Best Diets” in America. Taking a quick glance at their rankings, I knew that something wasn’t right. Why are they promoting diets that rely almost solely on unhealthy processed food full of additives linked to cancer and heart disease? Why did they rank diets that advocate for giving up processed food in favor of fresh, whole foods AS THE WORST on their lists? They’ve gotta be kidding, right?!? Who is benefiting from rankings like this? Will this help Americans become less obese? Will this make us healthier? I’d argue that many of the “diets” in America are outrageously unhealthy and diet rankings like this are seriously misleading people about what it means to eat healthy. Jenny Craig This diet relies almost 100% on processed food. With a diet like this, you are sure to be eating insane amounts of preservatives and added sugar, which are both linked to major health risks. Jenny Craig uses some of the worst additives in their food, like carrageenan (linked to cancer and intestinal inflammation), cellulose (linked to inflammation and weight gain), and the artificial sweetener sucralose (linked to leukemia and weight gain). How could anyone call this diet healthy? This diet isn’t supposed to rely on processed foods, but Weight Watchers sells a huge line of majorly processed foods and officially endorses processed food brands like Jolly Time Popcorn and Progresso Light Soups. You’ve probably seen the new commercials that chant “Bring on the food!” while they talk about how NOTHING is off limits on Weight Watchers…. bacon, pizza, chips… “You can have whatever you want”. So, it sure sounds like they are advocating for the continued use of processed junk food full of additives, instead of creating healthier habits that will teach your body to crave fruits and vegetables instead. Some of the recipes on their website call for processed foods like reduced fat vanilla wafers and even chocolate cake mix! Say Whaaaah? It blows my mind that this is considered an acceptable diet by ANYONE. On this diet you essentially drink chemical-filled processed drinks for two of your meals, along with three of their processed snacks every day – and then you get just one homemade meal per day. You’ll basically be gulping down tons of artificially thickened sugary drinks every day. Gross. On this diet you eat five of their “100 calorie” products every single day and then one home cooked meal. So, the majority of the time you are eating food full of heavily processed proteins, excitotoxins, artificial thickeners and sweeteners, synthetic vitamins and amino acids (instead of naturally-occurring ones). This is nowhere near real food! Medifast products are LOADED with hidden MSG additives like textured proteins, sodium caseinate, yeast extract. On this diet you’ll be eating boxed up and processed Nutrisystem food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner – all filled with of dozens of chemical additives (some of which are addicting) blended together with the “correct” ratios of protein, carbs and fats, with some synthetic vitamins and fiber mixed in to make them look healthy on the “Nutrition Facts” label. Unfortunately, the “Nutrition Facts” label doesn’t tell the real story, and you’ll get a whole lot more than you bargained for when you choose to eat fake food like this. For instance – on the Mayo Clinic Diet, you can spread your toast with a “margarine-like spread” full of chemicals. On the DASH Diet you can start your day with a bowl of Shredded Wheat preserved with BHT or “light” yogurt sweetened with sucralose and acesulfame potassium. On the TLC Diet you can snack on low-fat microwave popcorn with TBHQ. On the Biggest Loser Diet, you can make a sandwich with processed deli meat and sprinkle your plate with fat-free cheese coated in cellulose. On the Volumetrics Diet, you can eat sugar-free pudding every day for dessert. This is not real food! Any diet book will tell you to eat right and exercise, but what does that really mean? I’ve seen people “eat right” by eating unlimited amounts of red meat and fat, and I’ve seen people “work out” daily for more than four hours, exhausting their body and pushing themselves too far. I decided to search for some answers. My search was inspired not by any diet book, but rather by an eye-opening article, “Science Compared Every Diet, and the Real Winner is Real Food.” The article summarized an independent study, published in Annual Reviews in 2014, that reviewed every major diet and concluded that, “A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature, predominantly plants, is decisively associated with healthy promotion and disease prevention.” I was pumped by reading this! It supported and validated what I had been doing and preaching for years: a natural, whole food, and predominately plant-based diet is the secret to staying in shape, feeling vital, and being healthy. Other diets just don’t cut it, and one reason is that they induce you to eat a lot of chemical calories and lock you into habits that kill your ability to maintain your weight. The old motto, “Garbage In, Garbage Out”, is so true! There is no doubt about it – you feel horrible when you feed your body fast and processed food. The way to create lasting change in your body is to eat food as close to nature as possible – the least amount of processed food, the better!!! After I began eating this way, I have never had to diet again, despite the challenging environment we live in with an abundance of tricky marketing and addictive food additives. I’ve learned that the only way to feel great is to stop outsourcing my food to corporations and spend more time preparing meals at home. When I began cooking and eating whole foods, my health soared as a result – and now I never look back. After I spent years juggling meal planning, food shopping and cooking, I consulted with a nutritionist and worked with my team to create an Food Babe Meal Plans for Health program – not only for myself, but for all of you. This is more than a meal planning service, it will keep you on track, and help you develop HEALTHY HABITS so you can finally shed unwanted pounds or have an easier time maintaining the healthy lifestyle you may have already built. This program makes eating healthy food and losing weight practically mindless (and delicious)! When you sign up, you’ll get recipes for new Food Babe meals every month (easy to make green drinks, breakfasts, lunches, dinners), a meal schedule, and a shopping list. These are brand new recipes that the Food Babe Team cooks up every month just for you that are absolutely delicious! You will actually LOVE the food you are eating, which makes creating new habits so easy. You’ll also get my Starter Guide full of budget tips, diet strategies, and a list of the “Terrible 20” ingredients that keep you from losing weight, where to spot them, and what to eat instead. You can download these guides and recipes to your computer and keep them forever. Dozens of pages of knowledge at your fingertips INSTANTLY. See everything that comes with the program here. You’ll gain control your eating habits, while this program shows you how to eat wisely and well. As you continue eating this way, which will quickly become second nature, you’ll naturally start losing weight and keeping it off. You won’t have to count anything or obsess over calories or carbs, either. You just have to read labels, change some food-buying and food-prep practices, and enjoy food the way it was meant to be – natural and whole. The only reason I’ve been able to maintain my ideal weight for over 10 years now and feel amazing is because of my habits, food choices, and routine, which is outlined in this program. If you haven’t already heard my personal story about what happened when I started eating this way and how much my health improved, read my story and see my before/after photo here. When I took a hard look at what I was really eating and changed my eating habits and food choices, things dramatically shifted in my life. I went from someone overweight and sick to a new being of vibrant health, and I want everyone to feel this way. I have helped thousands of people develop new eating habits, lose weight, and feel their best. You can read a few of their stories here, here, and here. YOU can do this too and I can’t wait to hear your success story. I hope you get on board!"
https://foodbabe.com/super-c-beauty-smoothie/,Super C Beauty Smoothie,0,"When people tell me they don’t have time to eat healthy, I yell the word – SMOOTHIE at them! Smoothies are the ultimate fast food and they are a superb way to add more veggies to your diet. I’ve found, too, that they alleviate bad food cravings because they provide a burst of nutrition – one that’s not usually present in the typical American diet. When your body doesn’t get what it needs nutritionally speaking, cravings kick in. And if you give in to those cravings, you’re on the road to gaining weight. Once you start to pump your body with greens, you’ll start craving them instead! I love all of the beautiful ingredients in this Super C Beauty Smoothie – strawberries, red bell pepper, cauliflower, spinach – not only do they make a delicious tasting smoothie, but all these superfoods are PACKED with vitamin C! This amazing vitamin fights cell damage and chronic inflammation, strengthens your immune defenses, and accelerates wound healing. Eating foods rich in vitamin C has helped keep me from catching a cold or the flu and has kept me going strong. It’s also excellent for your skin because vitamin C helps the body create collagen and rejuvenates aged skin, helping you look younger! First, you’ll want to remove the leaves from your strawberries and wash up all of your ingredients. Roughly chop up half a cup each of red bell pepper and cauliflower and add them to a high-powered blender along with one cup of strawberries. Add one cup of spinach (or any leafy green), a banana, and two tablespoons of chia seeds to the blender. Then, pour in up to a cup of almond or coconut milk. If you like a thinner smoothie, add more milk… You can also add in a few cubes of ice if you want your smoothie colder and thicker. Blend all ingredients on high until it’s smooth and creamy… pour into two tall glasses and enjoy with a friend! I include recipes just like this in my Monthly Meal Plans, which are part of the Food Babe Eating Guide Program. When you sign up, you’ll get hundreds of pages of my tested tricks and tips to make healthy eating mindless, and a monthly meal plan full of Food Babe approved recipes and guidelines to help you detox naturally every day. I hope to see you in the private member forum! Sign up and download your guides here. Encouraging everyone to choose healthier food options is changing the world."
https://foodbabe.com/emails-epa-monsanto-now-revealed-contents-sickening/,Emails between the EPA & Monsanto now revealed (The contents are sickening!),0,"I have made it my life’s mission to raise public awareness about what’s really in our food, how it can affect our health, and how a handful of large corporations are poisoning us for profit. These corporations use big bucks and unethical tactics to influence regulators into playing their game to keep Americans in the dark about the dangers of their products. Along with so many of you and fellow activists, we have been spreading the truth about GMOs and hazardous chemicals used in conjunction with them like Roundup (glyphosate). This weedkiller isn’t just used on GMOs but on 70 different food crops in the U.S. – it’s in practically everything Americans eat. So, if glyphosate is causing cancer and other diseases, I want to know about it and get it out of our food – don’t you? Stating the obvious: Monsanto makes billions off of Roundup sales, so they don’t want anyone to question its safety. Some never-before-seen confidential documents just released in a court case against Monsanto give us a glimpse into how they are working to influence the EPA (who is in charge of determining whether they are allowed to sell Roundup anymore) and undermine any efforts to ban its use. These documents show what many of us have known and suspected for quite some time… Monsanto is manipulating scientific research and has gotten some EPA officials on their side who seem to be helping them cover-up the health dangers of Roundup so they can keep it on the market. While Monsanto is being sued in California by dozens of people who claim Roundup caused their non-hodgkin’s lymphoma, Monsanto had to provide over 6 million pages of internal emails and documents to the court and attorneys, and marked the majority of them as “confidential” so they’d be hidden from the public. When the plaintiffs asked the court to make the records public, both Monsanto and the EPA objected. The judge didn’t agree with their objections and threatened to sanction Monsanto if they continued trying to seal documents and found it in the best interest of the public to release them for all of us to see,“even if Monsanto doesn’t like what they say”. The public interest group U.S. Right To Know is publishing these documents in their entirety on their website here. This is just the beginning and more are coming out. Here’s what we have uncovered in these documents so far… They are feeding us lies and these secrets are poisoning us! Most Americans are eating glyphosate every day… No matter how healthy we eat or how much we try to protect ourselves from it, this weedkiller is being used on most major conventional food crops and is so rampant in our environment that it is contaminating virtually all of our food. It’s been found in honey, cereals, meat, drinking water, breast milk, infant formula, chips, cookies… the list goes on. Our government agencies (FDA and EPA) know this and are allowing corporations to poison Americans for profit. It’s truly disgusting! Monsanto is stooping to corruption to continue selling their poisons. Everything from seeking to keep their correspondence with the EPA secret, to intimidating scientists at the WHO International Agency on Cancer (IARC) who found Roundup’s active ingredient glyphosate “probably carcinogenic”. A large body of peer reviewed research links glyphosate to cancer, reproductive problems, liver, kidney and skin cell damage, antibiotic-resistance, and more – but Monsanto doesn’t want the public to know the truth! Ask your favorite companies to test for glyphosate and get certified. Wouldn’t it be nice to know if the food you buy contains glyphosate? I have an exciting announcement! The Detox Project just launched a new “Glyphosate Residue Free Certification” program and will begin labeling products that have been tested and are free of glyphosate. I’ve partnered up with them to help spread the word – They are working with food manufacturers and grocery chains, so that soon we will see labels like this on some products – send this link to your favorite companies and ask them to go glyphosate free. Everyone deserves to know exactly what they are eating and have access to safe, affordable food. My job will not be done until this is a reality. I’m so happy to have so many of you by my side and I know we can make this happen!"
https://foodbabe.com/is-organic-food-a-scam/,Is Organic Food A Scam?,0,"I choose to eat organic food whenever possible because I believe it’s better for my health, the environment, and the farmers who grow our food. But not everyone agrees with me. There are a lot of people who think organic food is too expensive, a waste of money, and a scam. Do you feel that way? “Buying organic veggies at the supermarket is a waste of money” – Quartz “The USDA ‘Organic’ Label Misleads And Rips Off Consumers” – Forbes “Organic Foods Are Just A ‘Marketing Label” – Business Insider “Don’t Believe the (Organic) Hype” – NPR “Is organic food worth the higher price? Experts say no” – Portland Tribune One of the biggest perpetrators of these beliefs is Monsanto (and other big biotech companies like Syngenta and Bayer). Think about it: their best-selling products like Roundup and GMO seeds are banned on organic farms. If all farms were organic their biggest products would bite the dust! Any messaging that organic food is better than conventionally grown food is harmful to their business and they have deep pockets to fight against this type of information. Just like the millions of dollars that big food and agrochemical companies spent to fight GMO labels, it’s easy for them to put big money into advertising and ag front groups to spin the message that organic food is a scam. They don’t want Americans to question how our food is produced in large industrial operations. And, they don’t want to spend more money buying and growing organic ingredients, because that cuts into their bottom line. You owe it to yourself to take a hard look at what you choose to eat every day and how it can affect your health. Do the research it takes so you can make an informed decision about whether organic food is worth it to you, and don’t just blindly believe what anyone (including me) tells you. I want you to feel informed and empowered! One of the most fascinating reports about organic food comes from a large project recently commissioned by the European Parliament. Experts from throughout the world were asked to study whether organic food and farming is healthier for us – and their conclusions counter everything that you may have heard about organic food. The researchers concluded (quoting Harvard): The whole basis of organic farming is to produce food without the need to use toxic pesticides. Crops are managed in a way that prevents the need to use chemicals. When produce from farms has been tested, organic has far less pesticide residue compared with conventional (non-organic). By eating organic you can significantly decrease your exposure to pesticides! “Organic is a strictly regulated term, so you can trust that you’re getting produce grown with minimal if any synthetic pesticides.” – Consumer Reports: Pesticides In Produce, 2015 Many of the pesticides used on conventional farms are hormone disruptors, neurotoxins, or reproductive toxins which are strongly linked to many diseases and health issues: Pesticides are even MORE damaging to children because their metabolism is different than adults and toxins remain longer in their body. The damage starts in the womb! “Epidemiologic evidence demonstrates associations between early life exposure to pesticides and pediatric cancers, decreased cognitive function, and behavioral problems… Recognizing and reducing problematic exposures will require attention to current inadequacies in medical training, public health tracking, and regulatory action on pesticides.” – American Academy of Pediatrics Tens of thousands of farm workers are poisoned by pesticides each year in the U.S. according to EPA reports – and there are likely many incidents that go unreported. The effects on farmers and nearby communities are devastating! If this is what happens on the farm, what are these chemicals doing to our bodies when we eat them in small amounts day after day? “The entire U.S. population is exposed on a daily basis to numerous agricultural chemicals… Many of these chemicals have known or suspected carcinogenic or endocrine-disrupting properties.” – President’s Cancer Panel When it comes to endocrine disruptors, chronic small exposures are the MOST damaging – “the dose makes the poison” mantra does not apply! What about just peeling and washing the pesticides off? It’s not that easy. Many of the chemicals used on conventional food are systemic – meaning they’re absorbed into the food and you can’t simply just wash it off. When it comes to non-organic packaged food, almost all of it is filled with GMOs that absorb and contain glyphosate weedkiller strongly linked to cancer and numerous diseases. This weedkiller is used on non-GMO crops too – but banned on organic! Several pesticide residues are usually found and there’s no legal limit on the number of different pesticides allowed on food. And, the problem is getting worse: “One sample of strawberries contained residues of 20 pesticides, according to the “Pesticide Data Program” (PDP) report issued this month by the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service… Notably, the agency said only 15 percent of the 10,187 samples tested were free from any detectable pesticide residues. That’s a marked difference from 2014, when the USDA found that over 41 percent of samples were “clean” or showed no detectable pesticide residues.” ~ Carey Gillam, U.S. Right To Know, November 2016. Experts at the U.N. recently warned that pesticides end up in our water systems, damage our ecological system, contaminate soils, are responsible for bee deaths, and are a huge environmental threat to the future of food production. The issue of world hunger is due to poverty, inequality and distribution – not lack of food. “It is time to overturn the myth that pesticides are necessary to feed the world and create a global process to transition toward safer and healthier food and agricultural production.” ~ U.N. Special Rapporteurs on Toxics and the Right to Food, March 2017 Are pesticides used to grow organic food? It’s true that organic food is not always pesticide free – but that doesn’t mean you should throw the baby out with the bathwater. The best way to keep toxic chemicals out of your food is to choose organic. Critics argue that “horribly toxic pesticides” are used on organic crops, and that they’re used in much greater amounts. One of the pesticides they routinely bring up is rotenone – but this pesticide isn’t even being used! It was once approved for organic crops, but the EPA has banned it from U.S. crops. Some other countries still use rotenone, but the National Organic Standards Board has passed a recommendation to prohibit it outright. Another one that gets brought up is copper sulfate. This can be used by both organic and conventional fruit farmers as a fungicide – but conventional farmers reportedly use more of it and their versions contain riskier “non-active” ingredients. Organic farmers are required to monitor copper sulfate use and aren’t permitted to continue if it accumulates in high levels in the soil. By choosing certified organic food you’ll automatically avoid many dangerous food additives – like TBHQ, BHT, artificial sweeteners (aspartame, sucralose) and artificial food dyes (yellow #5, etc) which are all banned from certified organic products. Carrageenan is on the organic chopping block as well. Although you ALWAYS need to read the ingredient list – even on organic products – it’s easier to find products without a crazy long list of additives and that actually contain real food! Conventional meat, eggs, and dairy can be contaminated with even more synthetic pesticides than plant-based foods. Pesticides used on feed accumulate in animal tissues over time – and pesticide residues have been found in conventional beef, egg, milk, pork, and poultry samples. Using only certified organic feed is required when raising organic animals. Most conventional animals are also raised on growth-promoting steroids, antibiotics, and other drugs – and these residues have been found in meat too. The overuse of growth-promoting antibiotics is creating superbugs that contaminate the meat, putting us at greater risk of antibiotic-resistant infections. These drugs are prohibited in the raising of organic animals! With bigger food companies moving into organics, they are surely trying to water down the system. There are some bad guys out there not following the rules and some organic food is contaminated, but we all have to eat and organic food remains the lowest risk. Ultimately, it’s best to buy organic food grown on small local farms where you can shake the farmer’s hand and ask questions. Your local farmers market is perfect for this and you can also check the Local Harvest website for local growers. Organic can be more expensive, but it’s worth it. I believe that buying quality organic food and eating the most nutritious foods on the planet will save you big bucks down the road in medical costs, prescription drugs and doctor visits – It’s totally up to us to make it a priority. I’ve got over 75 organic budgeting tips here to help. When I switched to eating primarily organic whole foods, everything changed in my life. I went from someone overweight and sick to a new being of vibrant health. I want everyone to feel this way! I’ve learned to be careful about who I trust for health information and seek out experts who don’t use Monsanto’s talking points and aren’t muddled with industry ties. Ultimately, the only person you can trust is yourself. Make the switch to organic food and see how you feel. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised!"
https://foodbabe.com/top-pregnancy-questions-answered/,Your Top Pregnancy Questions Answered!,0,"I have been slowly cataloging all the pregnancy questions I received while pregnant…what prenatal vitamins I took… whether I’m vaccinating my baby… what foods I avoided… how did I prevent stretch marks…did I do a birth plan? I answer all these questions (and more!) This list will be updated regularly so if you have more questions, please ask in the comments below and I’ll update this list and let you know! My sweet Harley at one week old Photography by Little Nest Portraits What preparation did you go through before getting pregnant? I have been on a journey for over 10 years to get my health back on track, which helped to prepare my body for pregnancy. Over the years, acupuncture has helped tremendously to balance my hormones and heal my body. I also stopped taking birth control pills years ago, because they were preventing my body from doing what it is naturally supposed to do. I’ve restored my gut bacteria back to normal with a whole foods diet, supplementing with effective probiotics, and eating fermented food daily. My books The Food Babe Way, Feeding You Lies, and Food Babe Kitchen will show you how to provide the cleanest foods for your body to prepare it for pregnancy. Another great book that I love and read (twice!) was How to Conceive Naturally: And Have a Healthy Pregnancy after 30 by Christa Orecchio, a member of my advisory council. This book is spot on about the nutrition you want to put into your body if you are trying to conceive. Overall, I stuck with the same diet that I had before pregnancy full of whole nutrient-rich foods with a few indulgences into those cravings – organic grilled cheeses and pizza to be exact! However, there are a few foods that I didn’t eat during pregnancy… Yes, smoothies and juices made with mostly vegetables are full of vitamins and minerals that help to keep your immune system strong during pregnancy. As always, I take care to thoroughly wash my vegetables before making a juice and fill up my blender or juicer with greens like romaine lettuce, spinach, turnip greens, mustard greens, parsley, and collard greens. I tried not to overdo the beet juice though! I did that once in my first trimester and let’s just say it did not stay down! It’s always good to remember natural foods when juiced can be very potent too. I’ve never had such a roller coaster of cravings before in my life (I know you other pregnant women can relate!). Read more about that here. One of my obsessions was frozen grapes to curb that sudden sweet tooth. I took my commitment to staying on track with my eating principles even more seriously while pregnant, even while indulging in the occasional treat. I’d indulge – but I made sure the ingredients were organic. If I wanted cookies – I’d eat them, but they need to be organic first to avoid any unnecessary toxic pesticides and chemical additives! I didn’t drink any alcohol, but did have some soft cheeses on occasion when I knew they were either heated or pasteurized. I continued my habit of drinking lemon water with cayenne pepper first thing in the morning, drank kombucha on occasion, reduced the amount of caffeine I used to have in half (from 8 ounces of coffee or tea to 4 ounces), and tried to eat fermented foods everyday (See more important info on pregnancy habits from my advisory council member Dr. Amy Shah here). As always, my diet consists mostly of plants like fruits, vegetables, seeds, beans and nuts, but there are some specific foods that I ate more of during pregnancy. This is such a big topic that I wrote an entire post about it with links to my favorite recipes! Check it out here. These drinks (also known as “Glucola”) are essentially sugar water with hazardous artificial colors and preservatives for a VERY LONG shelf life. They are no better than most sodas on the market – and truly not something you’d want to consume while pregnant. While it’s certainly important to monitor your blood glucose during pregnancy, there are safer alternatives to drinking this toxic sugar water. I simply asked my doctor what my options were and she was ready with 5 alternatives! I was able to monitor with simple blood tests and it was reassuring to see that my blood sugar was on track. Specifically, I took my blood sugar two times a day for 3 days over one week and reported the results back to her. Be sure to ask your health care provider for options! In my opinion there is no way in hell any doctor could convince me to drink something with flame retardant, artificial dyes made from petroleum, controversial preservatives and GMOs, pregnant or not! Only on my toes since it lasted longer and I didn’t need to paint them as often. I am generally doing the same thing while breastfeeding and handling my newborn as well – although I do occasionally paint them for events and here is a link to some safer nail polish brands I’ve used. One of the things that I absolutely could not live without during pregnancy was my Belly Armor Belly Blanket. I worked from my laptop almost every day, but knew that it wasn’t safe to expose my baby to all of the radiation that emits from laptops and wifi. Radiation exposures during pregnancy can increase risk of miscarriage and are also linked to developmental issues – and there was no way I was willing to take that risk. So I found an amazing solution! I just placed this Belly Blanket over my pregnant belly whenever I was working at my computer or using my phone for an extended period of time. The blanket is made with special fabric that neutralizes electromagnetic waves and blocks the radiation from reaching my belly, keeping my baby safe. This really gave me peace of mind! Now that she is born, I continue to use my Belly Blanket to protect her while I’m on my computer. As a new partner of Food Babe, Belly Armor is offering you a special deal: Get a free baby hat ($19 value) if you spend $50 or more in their online store with the code “foodbabe” at checkout. (Note: the code will only work once you have the baby hat in your cart! These are found in their “Nursery” section.) Before getting pregnant, I couldn’t remember the last nap I took! But once I became pregnant, I needed at least a 30 min – 1 hour nap almost every day, otherwise I would fall asleep at 8pm. Your body needs more sleep during pregnancy, so don’t fight it. I also drank unsweetened iced tea or kombucha to perk myself up on occasion! I didn’t take prenatal supplement formulas because the ones available on the market are one-size-fits-all and not everything in those supplements work well with my body. I worked with my doctor to come up with a supplement regimen that worked for me. I took a whole food based organic multivitamin with no fillers and synthetics, following these guidelines. I also took extra probiotics, calcium, vitamin D, magnesium – which helps with sleep. Of course, I also eat The Food Babe Way and have been limiting the amount of sugar in my diet. I was able to sleep pretty well throughout my pregnancy, which I’m thankful for. The vitamin and mineral supplements that I took (see above) were helpful, but I also took nightly baths with epsom salts. This really helped me to relax and ease discomfort! I did not buy any special pillows, I just used a king size pillow between my legs while I slept on my side. This simple remedy worked wonders for me: 1 tsp apple cider vinegar with 8 ounces of water. Take up to 2 doses, as needed. I also slept at an angle propped up on two pillows and took a 10 min walk after eating to help prevent heartburn. Getting out in the fresh air makes a huge difference in everyday life! Although I didn’t go at it as hard as I did before I was pregnant, just doing a little bit of something improved my mood. I kept it part of my routine and made sure to get up and go – showing up to my exercise class every day, whether I could do everything or not! For example, I took a pilates barre class (Hilliard Studio Method) all the way up to my due date. I loved spinning in my first and second trimesters. And I lifted heavy weights with my trainer and took long walks the entire pregnancy. I drank ginger tea, woke up and ate first thing in the morning and had smaller meals spaced out through the day. Exercise always helped too! I found the most effective thing to do to avoid stretch marks is eat lots of fruits and vegetables and avoid processed foods while your tummy is growing. All those vitamins and minerals strengthen the skin’s elasticity! I also used organic coconut oil and/or sesame oil on my body every day. I don’t normally take the flu shot because it has shown to be not effective (so I don’t take the risk) and I would personally never consider it as a pregnant woman. I want my body to react naturally to the environment and to fight viruses on its own. I take steps to prevent the flu – wash hands often, reduce stress, exercise, drink lots of filtered water, eat fermented foods, and avoid industrial toxins. I believe that living a healthy lifestyle sets you up for a healthy pregnancy. Yes, you can read my birth story here. No, I did not. I discussed this with my doctor and doula, researched options and there was not enough convincing evidence for me, although I have heard it does benefit some women. The awesome women throwing me the shower put my preferences on the invitation. I had an eco baby shower, for example, instead of bringing a card with a gift, they requested guests bring an inscribed book instead. I also registered for a lot of eco-friendly items at Sprout San Francisco. My birth plan is below, this is highly personalized and you should talk about these choices with your family and health care providers before determining your own. This list is intended to express our preferences under normal conditions. Labor Preferences: A Natural Birth. I will use natural pain relief techniques. Please do not offer any medication, I will ask if needed. I have an adverse reaction to most pharmaceuticals. Interventions only following opportunity to discuss options with husband and doula. I prefer minimal internal exams. A vaginal exam only when I ask to be checked. I prefer to move freely during labor and eat and drink as needed. I prefer only intermittent monitoring when needed. I prefer to have no IV but will consent to a saline lock, if medically necessary. I prefer no induction of any kind. I prefer the bag of waters to break on its own. I would like perineal support with massage, hot compresses and various positions to avoid a tear. I prefer no episiotomy unless required for baby’s safety. I prefer that no vacuum or forceps are used. Birth Preferences: Please place baby on my bare chest immediately. Please do not cut cord for 15 minutes or until it stops pulsing. Father will plan on cutting cord. Please allow placenta to expel on its own. Newborn Preferences: Please conduct newborn procedures in arms, at least 2 hours after birth. We have chosen to DECLINE: erythomycin, Hep B vaccine (baby will follow up with Pediatrician), and Vitamin K shot (baby will be taking liquid Vitamin K per Stanford University Protocol). We consent to: newborn screening (including PKU), necessary emergency treatment. Please conduct all in room. Father will accompany baby for hearing test. Afterbirth Preferences: Baby will be breastfed exclusively. Please do not offer sugar water or formula. I wish for baby to remain with me following birth. Father will accompany baby out of room if needed. I do not wish to receive any medication post labor, including stool softener. I prefer to leave the hospital as soon as possible after birth. Should a transfer be necessary for baby, please allow me to accompany baby. In case a Cesarean becomes necessary: Husband and doula present in operating room. Father holds baby immediately for skin-to-skin and stays with baby continually. Doula present continually during recovery. Newborn reunited with mother as soon as possible. Yes! I did the Mama Natural Birth Course from start to finish and loved it so much. This is a digital course that you watch from home on your own time, and on your own schedule. It is super informative and I left each lesson feeling empowered and confident. I can honestly say that I don’t believe I’ve ever enjoyed an online course as much as this one. You can sign up here for free and Mama Natural will send you weekly pregnancy updates and you can find information on the Mama Natural Birth Course here. The most powerful thing you can do for your health is become educated about everything you put in your own and your family’s bodies – whether it be the food you eat or the pharmaceuticals you inject. Vaccines are not one-size-fits-all and I feel that is way too simplistic of a view – and my doctor agrees. Not all vaccines are created equal. It is really important to recognize that what can help one person, has the ability to hurt another. Each vaccine needs to be evaluated individually for its benefits and risks relative to your personal situation. Understand that I’m not an expert on vaccines recommended by the CDC for children, but now that I’m a parent I feel that it is my obligation to become as educated as possible on the subject… so I’ve been doing A LOT of reading! I have checked out or ordered just about every vaccine advice book under the sun and am doing a thorough personal investigation to become as educated as possible about my choices. I have also been taking the time to talk to my own doctors and trusted advisors to make the best decisions. I encourage you to do the same and make the decision for yourself as to what you feel comfortable with. Join us in the Food Babe Meal Plans For Health Program. I’ll stick with you day after day to get rid of the food additives, chemicals and extra baggage that can weigh us down in this over-processed food world. If you are looking for more help in the kitchen or are struggling with figuring out what to eat, the best brands to buy, and how to follow a non-GMO, organic diet, then this program is the perfect fit for you. Sign up and download your guides here: https://foodbabe.com/eat While I was pregnant, I did a pregnancy Q&A on Facebook Live with my great friend and doula Latham Thomas of Mama Glow – you can watch the entire video here. I’m so excited to share my pregnancy journey and now on to motherhood with you. This has been the most amazing time of my life.

https://foodbabe.com/importance-gut-bacteria-pregnancy-destroy-modern-practices/,The Importance Of Gut Bacteria In Pregnancy (and how we destroy it with modern practices!),0,"This is a guest post written by Dr. Amy Shah, a member of my Advisory Council. Dr. Shah is a practicing physician, specializing in Allergy & Immunology and Internal Medicine. Dr. Shah is also a mom, and as we were recently discussing my pregnancy she brought up a topic that I believe will be very helpful to all of the other mamas-to-be out there! How can you nurture the bacteria in your gut to protect the future health of your child? {Photo credit: Brad Olson photography} Nurturing bacteria in pregnancy and childbirth may be the key to unlocking the mystery behind the modern American crisis of diabetes, autoimmunity, asthma, allergies, obesity and more! Here is how we in medicine think this happens… There are 2 basic arms of the immune system: Th1 and Th2. These are white blood cells known as T-helpers that recognize and combat pathogens. Th1 fights bacteria, and viruses; Th2 takes on parasites, allergies and, we think, does not have much of a role these days. During pregnancy the body is weighted towards Th2. The hypothesis is that is so the body does not activate the immune system against the growing fetus. When the baby is born it is also predominantly Th2. Because of the lack of bacteria (good and bad) and viruses in the modern world, the baby stays weighted towards the Th2 immune side instead of shifting back to Th1 side. This, we think, is why we have seen such an increase allergy, asthma and autoimmune disease! So what is the take away? I know it’s hard to believe, but there is more bacteria in our body than our cells! Here’s what you can do to grow your gut garden: I can’t tell you how many times I see new mom’s slather hand sanitizer over themselves and anyone who comes close to their little one. The logic is there – of course you don’t want pathogens near your sensitive newborn. But – AND A BIG BUT – is this sterilization may be doing more harm than good by blocking the colonization of nurturing bacteria. More concerning – ingredients in hand sanitizers are known endocrine disruptors that adversely affect sex hormones, especially in infants and new mothers. Endocrine disruptors are also found abundantly in common triclosan-based cleaning products. Use natural cleaning products when possible (or have someone else clean!) Tip: Don’t let sick people go near your newborn but for others gentle washing with natural soap and water is preferred. Of course this isn’t always possible and a C-section is necessary, but if it can be avoided, it should be. Immense difference has been reported in the microbiological constitution of babies born vaginally vs. C-section babies. C-section babies don’t get microbes from the birth canal, which are different than those colonized by the skin, nipple and milk. A diverse microbiome is significant, as a less diverse microbiome means more chance the immune system will stay in the TH2 – meaning a higher probability of asthma, allergies and obesity related immune disease later in life. Tip: If C-section is absolutely medically necessary, don’t fret – skin to skin contact, breast feeding, and other techniques to improve baby’s microbiome exist. Again, of course, sometimes antibiotics are necessary and can’t be avoided but we may be overly reliant on them as a panacea for every ill. Generally avoid antibiotics for gut health, but especially for your infant and when pregnant or breastfeeding. They wreak havoc on the gut garden, destroying good bacteria with the bad, decreasing bacterial diversity and even creating a leaky gut and mood disorders. Foods containing antibiotics can be assumed to have the same effect. Avoid conventional meats and dairy and instead look for products labeled organic – federally regulated to only come from animals never given antibiotics. You may have heard of the so-called Hygiene Hypothesis that speculates children raised in overly sterile, germ-free environments develop hypersensitive immune systems. Though it may sound counter-intuitive (and gross), exposing infants in their first year of development to pets, household germs, microbes found in soil, rodent dander and roach allergens appears to lay foundations for a robust immune system, lowering risk of asthma and allergies, according to research from Johns Hopkins. However, after the first year, the protective effects of exposure to dander, germs and droppings disappear. Playing in the dirt, on the other hand, seems to improve gut health no matter what age you are, so don’t be afraid to be a little dirty! Don’t be too quick to wean off breast milk and introduce formula or solid food. Colonization and proliferation of an infant’s microbiota can be distressed when exclusive human-milk feeding is stopped. Formula especially incorporated into the diet while breastfeeding can undesirably alter the structure of baby’s gut. Skin to skin contact, especially right after birth (even for preemies), exposes the newborn to the mother’s bacteria, creating a more diverse gut garden. Kangaroo Mother Care – basically oodles of naked baby skin on skin exposure several hours a day – has a myriad of additional benefits for baby’s overall health. For example, breastfeeding maybe easier as it aids baby to seek out and latch on to mom’s nipple, reducing soreness. Studies suggest that babies deprived of skin contact can contribute to mood issues like depression and learning disabilities later in life. Obviously diet is top on the list of effectors to the intestinal microbiome. Sugar and processed, chemicalized, artificial foods don’t just upset gut equilibrium but can lead to leaky gut, IBS and other digestive issues you don’t want. Eat an organic whole food diet rich in nutrient dense foods like vegetables, fruits, and healthy fats. Steer clear of GMOs, artificial sweeteners, ibuprofen/NSAIDs, preservatives like TBHQ, etc. Eat and drink an abundance of superfoods like algae, seaweed, aloe vera, and cacao. Get plenty of probiotics and fermented foods like kefir and sauerkraut as well as prebiotics like tubers and alliums. The healthier your gut flora while pregnant and breastfeeding, the healthier your baby’s constitution – establishing their health now and for the rest of their life.

https://foodbabe.com/buffalo-cauliflower-bites-perfect-healthy-appetizer/,Buffalo Cauliflower Bites: The Perfect Healthy Appetizer,0,"There’s a vegetarian restaurant here in Charlotte called Fern that makes ah-maze-ing buffalo cauliflower. Every time I go there, I have to order it, they are just mouthwateringly good. I love re-creating my favorite restaurant foods at home so I asked my team if they were up to the challenge and that’s how these homemade Buffalo Cauliflower Bites were born… We tested and tested, and finally came up with something very close! These make a great alternative to buffalo chicken wings, and I think you’ll be surprised at how hearty and delicious cauliflower can taste. Unlike buffalo wings that are almost always from factory farm chicken and packed with artificial ingredients, these are actually HEALTHY and packed with fiber and nutrients… yeah! Eat a few of these and you’ll instantly zap away cravings for processed junk food filled with MSG and added sugar. This recipe (of course!) has no MSG and is free of junky ingredients. Start by preheating your oven to 425 degrees and chopping up one head of cauliflower into florets. You don’t want the florets to be too small, just good bite-sized pieces. Wash the florets well in filtered water. In a large bowl, stir together half a cup of almond flour, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Whisk in half a cup (plus two tablespoons) of either almond milk or water, and a dash of hot sauce. Mix well… Add the cauliflower florets to the bowl and dredge them in the almond flour mix until they are really well coated… Grease a baking sheet lightly with coconut or avocado oil and spread the cauliflower out onto the pan. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Now is a good time to mix up the buffalo sauce. Whisk together 1/4 cup of hot sauce, a couple tablespoons of white vinegar and a pinch of paprika. To make the yogurt dill topping, just mix half a cup of plain yogurt with one tablespoon of fresh dill and lemon juice. You can also use yogurt made from coconut or almond milk to keep it vegan! Stir in a pinch of salt and pepper. Dice up some crunchy toppings too – I like carrots, celery, and some fresh parsley… After they’ve cooked for 15 minutes, pull the pan out of the oven and pour that buffalo sauce all over the cauliflower. Give it a good toss, so it is evenly covered in the sauce. Put it back in the oven to bake for 5 minutes… Your house should be smelling really good right about now! Pull the buffalo cauliflower out of the oven and carefully place them on a large plate or platter. Drizzle the yogurt dill sauce over the cauliflower and sprinkle with your toppings. Dig in… Yum! Serve these Buffalo Cauliflower Bites next time you are having a party or watching a big game, they’d be great for all the big games coming up!

https://foodbabe.com/bojangles-chicken-n-biscuits-whistleblower-sends-us-never-released-ingredients/,Bojangles’ Chicken ‘n Biscuits Whistleblower Sends Us Never Before Released Ingredients.,0,"It’s absolutely appalling to me that we have been asking the restaurant chain Bojangles’ Famous Chicken ‘n Biscuits for their ingredients for over a year, and they refuse to provide any information to us. They have over 600 restaurants and no one has a clue what they are eating. Bojangles’ serves food in some of our schools and won’t even tell the parents or administrators what is in their food, which is just unacceptable. Thousands of you signed this petition asking Bojangles’ to be transparent about their ingredients and to stop using chicken raised on routine antibiotics. Last week, I joined arms with consumer advocacy group U.S. PIRG to deliver our combined petition signatures totaling more that 12,000 to Bojangles’ headquarters in Charlotte. Although we gave Bojangles’ notice that we would be arriving and requested to set up a meeting, Bojangles’ refused to open the door when we arrived, and refused to make any communication with us in person. The following day, they sent us an email and told the press that “conversations with our protein suppliers leave us confident that tremendous progress is being made toward eliminating their use of antibiotics important to human medicine by 2020.” This is not a strong commitment. Bojangles needs to publish a strong policy on their website to show that they intend to take action. They anonymously sent me complete ingredient lists for many of Bojangles’ most popular menu items…. their cajun chicken, their fries, their mac n’ cheese… and when you see what’s in their “made from scratch” biscuits you’ll be mad. I don’t know anyone using the very controversial additive TBHQ in their homemade biscuits! I contacted Bojangles’ corporate by email immediately after receiving this list of ingredients and asked them to confirm its authenticity. This is how they replied… “Unfortunately, I am unable to verify the accuracy of the ingredient information I was sent yesterday. Like most restaurant companies, Bojangles’ does not disclose its ingredients for competitive reasons, but complies fully with all related laws and regulations.” “Any alleged disclosure of the ingredients in our food by unauthorized third parties should be viewed with tremendous skepticism, and may be in violation of the law.” ~ Brian Little, Bojangles’ Corporate Communications Director, February 21, 2017 Most fast food chains do publish their ingredients online for the public and there is no reason for Bojangles’ to not do the same. KFC, McDonald’s, Chick-Fil-A, Burger King, Wendy’s, Jack In The Box, Taco Bell, Subway, Starbucks, Panera Bread, Chipotle, Dunkin Donuts, Pizza Hut, Papa John’s, Domino’s, Carl’s Jr. and Arby’s all publish their ingredients online for the public. Why does Bojangles’ think they are any different? This is the kind of transparency that consumers expect. There are a growing number of consumers who seek out ingredient information because we are concerned about food additives and their relation to health, or have other allergies and food sensitivities that are not provided on their allergen statement. All of Bojangles’ competitors release ingredients when asked – and it surely seems bizarre that Bojangles’ refuses to release even basic details about what is in their food – and won’t confirm or deny whether the whistleblower’s ingredient list is accurate. I really appreciate this whistleblower’s incredible courage to reach out. Bojangles’ gives the impression they use better and more authentic ingredients than other chicken restaurants like KFC, but when you see what this whistleblower says they are putting into their food, I think you’ll be surprised. The whistleblower let us know that those aren’t even made with real blueberries! They are artificially colored pellets! Partially Hydrogenated Oils (Artificial Trans Fat): The FDA finally banned “partially hydrogenated oils” from our food and companies have until June 2018 to comply. This is a VERY long time coming – because the consumption of artificial trans fat has been strongly correlated an increased risk of heart disease for quite some time and hundreds of processed foods contain this ingredient. The Institute of Medicine says that trans fats have “no known health benefit” and there is no safe level to eat. No safe level! It’s sad that some companies continue to use this harmful ingredient. Listed in: Grilled Chicken Breast, Biscuits, Dirty Rice, Brown Gravy, Mac n’ Cheese, Pork Chop Cottonseed Oil: This oil is made from a byproduct of the industrial waste from the cotton farming industry, which isn’t a food crop. Despite being one of the most prevalent GMO crops (designed to produce an insecticide), cotton crops still require an intense application of agricultural chemicals and that’s why cotton has been called the “World’s Dirtiest Crop”. Residues from these pesticides can remain in cottonseed oil according to data collected by the FAO/WHO Joint Meetings on Pesticides Residues in Food. If that isn’t bad enough, to extract the oil the cottonseeds are subjected to intensive chemical refining with toxic hexane, bleach, and deodorizers. Listed in: Fries, Grilled Chicken Breast, Biscuits, Brown Gravy, Pork Chop, Fries, Dirty Rice, Cinnamon Pecan Twist, Sweet Potato Fried Pie, Liquid Margarine TBHQ: This synthetic preservative has been linked to vision disturbances, liver enlargement, childhood behavioral problems, stomach cancer, and most recently, to the rise in food allergies. It’s also banned for use in food in other countries including Japan, and is on the Center For Science in The Public Interest’s list as one of the worst food additives to be avoided. Listed in: Biscuits, Mac n’ Cheese MSG & Hidden MSG: Besides the additive monosodium glutamate (MSG), the food industry sneaks in other additives – yeast extract and hydrolyzed proteins – that contain free glutamic acid, which is the main component of MSG. These “hidden MSG” additives are purely used to make you crave their food and eat more than you should, and are excitotoxins that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Listed in: Fries, Dirty Rice, Brown Gravy, White Gravy, Ranch Dressing, Southern Style Chicken Filet, Homestyle Tenders Caramel Color: There are 4 different types of caramel color used by the food industry and this Bojangles’ ingredient list does not specify which one they may use. Class IV caramel color is the one most commonly used by the food industry. Class IV caramel color is made from ammonia and contains the byproduct 4-MEI, a known cancer risk. Listed in: Fries, Southern Style Chicken Filet, Dirty Rice, Brown Gravy, White Gravy, Honey Mustard Sauce BHA: This preservative is on EWG’s Dirty Dozen List of Food Additives to avoid and is also banned in other countries. BHA has been shown to be an endocrine disruptor which is also believed to be a carcinogen, causing tumors in animal studies. Listed in: Sausage Patty, Brown Gravy Monoglycerides and Diglycerides: This emulsifier is a byproduct of oil processing – including partially hydrogenated canola and soybean oils – which contain the same artificial trans fat that is detrimental to our heart health. Listed in: Flour Tortilla (Wraps), Pork Chop, Liquid Margarine, Mac n’ Cheese, Cinnamon Pecan Twist Artificial Color: The “processed cheese” listed in Bojangles’ Mac n’ Cheese says it contains “artificial color”, but doesn’t specify which specific color is used. At this point I can only presume it is the same artificial yellow dyes that Kraft used to use in their Mac n’ Cheese which is linked to behavioral problems in children and requires a warning label in Europe. Listed in: Mac n’ Cheese Soybean Oil: One of the most unhealthy oils out there which increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. It’s almost always made from GMO soybeans. When researchers tested GMO soybeans they found that they contain high levels of residues from the herbicide glyphosate (Monsanto’s Roundup) compared to non-GMO soybeans. This is a huge issue, as glyphosate has been linked to cancer and other diseases in many studies – so this is not something I want to be eating and why I avoid GMOs like the plague. Listed in: Biscuits, Fries, Brown Gravy, Grilled Chicken Breast, Pork Chop, Fries, Flour Tortilla (Wraps), Mac n’ Cheese, Liquid Margarine, Cinnamon Pecan Twist, Sweet Potato Fried Pie, Ranch Dressing Sodium Phosphate: This preservative is so commonly used that if you eat processed food, you likely eat it daily. That doesn’t mean it’s safe. When you eat phosphate additives often, it can lead to excessive levels of phosphate in the blood and puts you at risk of chronic kidney disease, increased mortality, heart disease, and accelerated aging. The EWG also warns that sodium phosphate is an additive to avoid. Listed in: Grilled Chicken Breast, Mac n’ Cheese, Pork Chop Natural or Artificial Flavors: Any time you see flavors on an ingredient list be aware that you don’t really know what you are eating. According to the EWG, every flavor has their own secret list of up to 100 ingredients, including “synthetic chemicals such as the solvent propylene glycol or the preservative BHA” as well as GMO-derived ingredients. Flavors can also include excitotoxins like MSG that cause your taste buds to experience irresistibility when it comes to food. Listed in: Brown Gravy, White Gravy, Southern Style Chicken Filet, Grilled Chicken Breast, Homestyle Tenders, Mac n’ Cheese, Pork Chop, Liquid Margarine, Cinnamon Pecan Twist, Scrambled Egg, Ranch Dressing, Honey Mustard Sauce Cellulose: Ground breaking research links this additive to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. Listed in: Flour Tortillas (Wraps) Dextrose or Corn Syrup: These heavily processed forms of sugar are typically made from GMO corn that produces its own insecticide. Listed in: Brown Gravy, Southern Style Chicken Filet, Grilled Chicken Breast, Chicken Supremes, Pork Chop, Fries, Cinnamon Pecan Twist, Sweet Potato Fried Pie, Honey Mustard Sauce Methyl and Propyl Parabens: These preservatives are endocrine-disrupting chemicals linked to breast cancer and reproductive problems. EWG also includes propyl paraben on their Dirty Dozen Guide to Food Additives to avoid. Listed in: Sweet Potato Fried Pie Bojangles’ continues to source their chicken from farms who routinely feed their animals antibiotics. Low-level doses of antibiotics are routinely fed to farm animals who are not sick to promote growth and prevent disease. When animals are constantly fed low levels of antibiotics, they become a breeding ground for superbugs (aka antibiotic-resistant bacteria) which are spreading to humans. Antibiotics are becoming far less effective, and some infections that were previously treated easily are now difficult or impossible to treat. This issue hits home for me personally as my dad was once infected with bacteria that was resistant to antibiotics and very hard to treat. I don’t want my daughter to grow up in a world where antibiotics are no longer effective at treating simple infections, and that prospect is quickly becoming a reality. I’m sure many of you can relate to these fears. Until Bojangles’ changes their ways, the most effective thing we can do is vote with our dollars by not eating there and choosing to spend our money elsewhere. When we vote with our dollars we not only help strengthen the companies that are doing the right thing by supplying healthy products and sustainably grown food, but we also send a clear message of disapproval to those companies who are putting harmful products into the marketplace. By sending a clear message of what we want, we are actively shaping the world around us. Consider further action: February 21, 2017 – Petition Delivery At Bojangles’ With U.S. PIRG Bojangles’ may not want to change right now, but if they receive enough consumer pressure to change – I know they will like so many other companies have! When we work together, we are very powerful."
https://foodbabe.com/do-you-trust-snopes-you-wont-after-reading-how-they-work-with-monsanto-operatives/,Do You Trust Snopes? You Won’t After Reading This.,0,"The big players in the GMO and agrochemical industry – Monsanto, Bayer, Dow, Syngenta, DuPont – are engaging in an extensive public relations, advertising, lobbying and political campaigning to make sure that genetically engineered crops (GMOs), and the chemical pesticides they require, continue to proliferate in the U.S. To improve their public image, they are attempting to manipulate everything we see and hear about GMO crops and pesticides in the media and on TV, the internet and print articles – using propaganda-laden commercials, “mommy-blogger” articles, farmer endorsements, hired operatives to change Wikipedia, and front group websites. The biotech industry is feeling threatened, and their profits hang in the balance. They are trying to silence the truth! A lot of people trust the website Snopes.com and use it to fact-check things they hear on the internet. For no reason whatsoever, this mom-and-pop website has been put on a pedestal as if they are the be-all and end-all of truth on the internet. Facebook recently teamed up with Snopes, allowing them become an arbitrator of fake news circulating on their network, essentially elevating them as an authoritative source of information. I find this development alarming on many levels: Monsanto has made BILLIONS off of the weedkiller Roundup (aka glyphosate) along with their Roundup-Ready GMO seeds, but sales have been plummeting since the truth about this toxic product is coming out. They are doing everything they can to keep those profits coming in! Did the facts really change? Why would they call this information FALSE? It’s as if Monsanto edited it themselves and sent it off to Snopes for publication. Entire sentences and paragraphs were removed that were hurtful to Monsanto. Important data was removed entirely. The wording was changed to make the findings of an independent FDA-registered laboratory seem less scientific or credible… The data about how Cheerios and Stacy’s Pita Chips were found to have MORE glyphosate than the level permitted by the U.S. government in drinking water (700 ppb) was completely removed! Apparently Snopes believes it’s not factual or important to mention that some foods were found to have more weedkiller in them than even our lax regulations allow… In this first revision, Snopes makes a huge mistake in stating that the World Health Organization’s International Agency For Research on Cancer’s (IARC) finding that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic to humans was “overturned in March 2016”, which is NOT TRUE… IARC’s 2015 assessment has NOT been overturned, this is just what Monsanto dreams would happen. In reality, the team of international independent cancer scientists at IARC who made the finding that glyphosate “probably causes cancer in humans” are defending their decision, while being attacked by Monsanto with their lobbying group attempting to cut off IARC’s funding. The 17 independent scientists at IARC came to an unanimous decision that isn’t muddled by industry ties, and Monsanto is trying to shut them up. The subsequent 2016 Joint FAO-WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) is not reliable as the scientists on the panel have a giant conflict of interest in working with ILSI Europe, a group funded by Monsanto, CropLife, and big food companies, along with a board of trustees comprised of industry execs from Monsanto, Syngenta, DuPont, Nestle and others. Snopes is WRONG to say their finding is the “current consensus amongst the world’s regulatory agencies”. That’s the industry-funded view! A large body of peer reviewed research links glyphosate to cancer, reproductive problems, liver, kidney and skin cell damage, antibiotic-resistance, and more – but Monsanto doesn’t want the world to know the truth. The industry has a long history of of concealing health risks about their products from the public. “Historically, the same thing happened with tobacco, the same thing happened with asbestos, the same thing happened with arsenic. It’s not junk science.” ~ Aaron Blair, PhD, MPH, internationally renowned epidemiologist and the author of more than 450 scientific papers, who spent thirty years at the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Blair led the IARC panel. Which just goes to show they don’t properly research the facts before publishing stories! The FDA has been caught having closed-door meetings with industry representatives several times in the past. There is evidence that Monsanto met with the FDA specifically to discuss glyphosate residues in food in 2016: “In April of this year, Monsanto’s international regulatory affairs manager Amelia Jackson-Gheissari emailed FDA asking to set up a time to talk about “enforcement of residue levels in the USA, particularly glyphosate.” ~ Huffington Post, September 2016 Monsanto also had secret talks with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about glyphosate and are trying to hide the documentation from the public. “The plaintiffs’ attorneys say at least four specific documents they have obtained are clearly in the public interest and “illuminate that one of Monsanto’s chief business strategies is its secret and untoward influence on EPA.” – Huffington Post, January 2017 Likewise, the industry group CropLife (which represents Monsanto and agrochemical companies) tried to stop the EPA from convening their scientific panel to review the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate. Read their August 24, 2016 letter to the EPA here. (The meeting took place in December, and the EPA’s findings have not yet been made public.) Yet, my post was called “unsubstantiated”… Advertisements on Snopes website for Monsanto/Bayer: It was brought to my attention that after Snopes first called our piece a “MIXTURE” of truth, Monsanto’s operative (aka Kevin Folta) swept in and started bullying the reporter at Snopes into changing his article to claim that the information we presented was “FALSE”. Kevin Folta tweeted Snopes and their reporter (Alex Kasprak) multiple times, again, and again, and again, and again, until they agreed to listen to him… He is NOT independent and works right along with Monsanto executives, industry consultants, and lobbyists to spread their propaganda… In other words, this is how Monsanto quietly paid Kevin Folta to advocate for them… Just as I had reported, Monsanto is scrambling to bury this story and Snopes is just one channel that they are using to make people believe that any story speaking negatively about Roundup and GMOs is false. This is a dirty fight and Monsanto’s propaganda is in full force. This Snopes piece is all marketing. Marketing for Monsanto! Snopes response to Food Babe: “The change in rating was mainly the result of my narrowing the focus of the claim to the alleged conspiracy to suppress residue data. This was in response to criticism from ‘both sides’ about a lack of clarity my original approach took. The issue with the FDN study, of course, is that its methods have not been peer-reviewed or even made public, outside of the fact that the report states the tool was an LC-MS-MS in an FDA-certified lab… My approach is to take the totality of these data, which argues that at environmentally relevant concentrations there is no harm through diet, while allowing that debate still exists within the the scientific community. That remains my position.” After all of this… Kevin Folta admits that the glyphosate tests that we reported on were 100% CORRECT… That’s right. He contacted Anresco Laboratories and found that their testing was done 100% correctly and obtained honestly. In fact, in his podcast he admits he should have contacted them first. Yet Snopes still calls this report FALSE. Isn’t this ridiculous? Read Anresco Laboratories test results here and the statement on the validity of their testing here. If you have friends or family that use Snopes as a factual source of information, please share this post with them! This is how we cut the legs off of Monsanto’s propaganda machine. We need to expose who Snopes really is and what they stand for. The truth will set you free!"
https://foodbabe.com/create-safest-organic-natural-nursery-child/,"How To Create The Safest, Organic and Natural Nursery For Your Child",0,"When I first became pregnant, I knew right away I wanted to create a safe environment and nursery for my baby. There was so much to research and it all was very overwhelming. Cribs, mattresses, clothes, diapers, toys, strollers, car seats – the list goes on and on and on! I remember walking into Buy Buy Baby for the first time and walking right back out because it was too much to handle! But all my frustration quickly went away after I met the founder of Sprout San Francisco, a natural and organic children’s store in CA. Suzanne Price is a mother of two who has devoted her life researching toxic chemicals in children’s products and their effects on their bodies. When we met while I was on a business trip last year, we instantly hit it off. Her passion was contagious! Suzanne created Sprout to be a one-stop-shop for new parents who want to outfit their nursery with the safest and healthiest products. Sprout has done all the research for us and only stocks their store with products that get their seal of approval. I loved how I could walk in to their store and feel comfortable as a new mom who wants to do the very best for my baby, knowing that everything on the shelves is non-toxic and safe for my newborn. Shopping at Sprout was SO FUN! I didn’t have to stress out researching every little thing myself! The staff made it so simple to outfit my entire nursery and set up a baby registry for my friends and family. I was so impressed with everything they did for me and Harley, that I asked Suzanne to share her top tips and recommendations for a safe, natural and organic nursery in this special guest post. Also, to help all the other moms and dads out there, I partnered with Sprout to offer a 15% discount on your purchase when you use the code “FOODBABE” at checkout here. These pictures were taken by Little Nest Portraits (highly recommend them!) during Harley’s one week old photo shoot. Still working on commissioning some low VOC art and picture frames for the walls, but Harley’s nursery is almost done! At Sprout, we try to provide everything a family needs for a new baby in the healthiest and most natural way possible. We offer a gift registry so people can let their friends know what to buy them, an app to register on their iPhone, and a registry checklist so that parents can make sure they have not forgotten anything they might need. We even provide Healthy Baby Guides on our website that help parents to learn everything they should be looking out for in every category. However, I sometimes forget how overwhelming this can be to parents who are learning about all of it at once for the first time. I decided to break down the main things you need to make sure you have in order to bring your baby home, and what Sprout looks for in each category to make sure it is as healthy for your baby as possible. Crib and Dresser / Changing Table: Try to find solid wood with low VOC paint. Most cheap cribs are made with particle board that’s stuck together using glue that emits formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. Vani’s Skylar Crib is made in the USA using solid hardwoods (pictured above). You’ll also want a bookshelf to store all the adorable books and picture frames you’ll receive as gifts, as well as a comfortable place to change the baby, such as the top of a dresser with a secured organic changing pad. Crib Mattress: This is the most important thing to buy organic. Traditional mattresses are made of foam that release particulars into the air (VOCs) that are not good for your baby’s lungs. They are also sprayed with flame retardant chemicals, horrible for a baby to breath and known to cause lots of different health issues. Putting an organic mattress pad cover on a regular mattress does NOT solve the problem. But you should also have an organic mattress pad cover. Sprout sells a variety of organic mattresses. Vani chose Naturepedic (pictured above) and a fully organic co-sleeper here. Crib Bedding: Since your baby will spend so much time lying on these sheets, it is important to have organic crib sheets. Consider trying a solid white sheet with a patterned crib skirt to add some decoration to the crib if you do not fall in love with any of the organic patterned sheets. Clothing: You are going to get tons of clothing as gifts, and from everywhere, but you should definitely register for things you like. At the very newborn stage, it’s nice to have organic cotton touching your baby’s skin since it has been shown that pesticides can rub off of a finished garment. (Cotton is the most heavily pesticided crop in the country.) I would suggest registering for some layette sets like kimono tops (so they don’t have to be pulled over the head) and pants in organic cotton and let people buy you all the other cute fun outfits for the older sizes. The first few weeks the baby will basically be in a shirt or bodysuit and a swaddle all the time anyway. Baby Carrier: Our favorite carriers are the adjustable, backpack-style Beco or the wrap-style Solly. Whichever you choose, prioritize organic, since it’s shocking how much the babies suck on the fabric and straps. Baby Bath: Make absolutely sure that it is free of BPA, PVC, and phthalates. These are 3 terrible chemicals in plastics that will leach into warm water. Car Seat: Many car seats are sprayed with toxic flame retardant chemicals. Find one that is GREENGUARD or OEKO-TEX® certified, or that promises it does not use any of the worst flame retardants, like Tris. The only infant seat we carry is one we have had tested and know to be free of Tris, the Nuna Pipa. Toys: I always opt for wood or organic cotton over plastic. Phthalates in plastics were outlawed in toys for kids under 3 in 2009, yet nobody really knows this (so don’t take hand-me-downs) and from what I have heard, it is not really enforced, especially for products made overseas. Glider / Rocker: A glider or rocker isn’t an absolute must-have, but many find it extremely helpful in those early days of nursing your baby in the middle of the night. Make sure to look for one that does not have foam sprayed with flame retardant chemicals. Our exclusive gliders do not have flame retardants or polyurethane foam. Vani has our Como Pure in her nursery (pictured above). Rug: Many rugs are backed with formaldehyde emitting glue. Find a rug for your nursery made of natural fibers with no glue backing, so that your baby will be safe laying on it during tummy time. Art: To finish off your nursery, add some cute artwork to walls to give the room a personal touch. Just make sure that anything with paint is low VOC. Vani used Natura by Benjamin Moore. I think this is a good place to start and not get overwhelmed. Of course you can always call or come into one of our stores to ask as many questions you like of our knowledgeable sales team. Good luck! I know when you are expecting you have so many things to think about, so I hope this helps you out as much as it did me! And if you know someone who needs safe baby products, please share this post with them."
https://foodbabe.com/five-minute-healthy-chocolate-mousse/,Five-Minute Healthy Chocolate Mousse,0,"It feels like the holidays just got over, but the Holiday Death Aisle is BACK…. and this time we are bombarded with store shelves filled with red, pink and white junk and pretty heart-shaped boxes filled with toxic chocolates by brands like Russell Stovers, Godiva, and Hallmark. Take a look at the ingredients in these Valentine’s Day chocolates below and you’ll quickly realize that they’re just selling cheap ingredients wrapped up in fancy-looking packages. Why would you give your Valentine a “gift” filled with heart-wrecking partially hydrogenated oils, high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors derived from petroleum, nasty preservatives, artificial flavors, GMO oils, sugar from GMO Roundup-Ready sugar beets, and the absolute worst ingredients you can put in food? How do these companies keep getting away with this? Unfortunately, our food system’s top priority is the bottom line so we need to pay attention to the ingredient label on every single product we buy. Chocolate can provide a daily dose of much needed antioxidants or it can be a chemistry experiment full of man-made artificial ingredients. I do not like supporting brands that try to trick me into buying questionable ingredients. Voting with your dollars is one of the only ways to voice disgust for the unhealthy chemicals in food, and it can also directly influence change by hitting the bottom line of the food companies that continue to sells us cheap, harmful, and potentially dangerous ingredients. And, I don’t know about you… but when I’m presented with a box of chocolates it’s really hard for me to eat just one.. or two.. or three… I tend to really overindulge! That’s where this super simple and healthier chocolate treat comes in… This Five-Minute Creamy Chocolate Mousse is one of the recipes included in the Maintaining Your Success After Detox Guide from my 7-Day Sugar Detox Program, which shows you the healthiest ways to enjoy sweets without sabotaging your health. Expecting to live without sweets and desserts for the rest of your life is just crazy, and no one would ever be successful trying to maintain a diet like that! The key is to only choose treats that are both sweet and nutritious. That way you’ll satisfy your cravings but still get a dose of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Eventually you’ll develop a distaste for processed refined sugars and your desire for ultimate nutrition will become instinctive. Nutrient-dense whole food sweeteners include: Not only is this chocolate mousse lightning-QUICK to make, but it’s sweetened with a touch of maple syrup and the natural sweetness found in coconut and vanilla. When you top it with some high-fiber berries, such as raspberries or blackberries, you’ll help to slow the absorption of those natural sugars into the body – which is MUCH healthier than eating a few Valentine’s Day chocolates (and actually more delicious than those chemical-filled things anyway)! You can buy coconut cream on its own, or what I typically do is purchase 1-2 cans of organic BPA-free coconut milk and scrape off the thick cream that has settled on top of the can. Just throw these five ingredients in a good high-powered blender along with a handful of ice cubes and blend on high for a few minutes until nice and creamy. Adding a pinch of sea salt helps to bring out the sweetness and balances the flavor… And voila!!! That’s it. In just five minutes, you’ve got a decadent, creamy, chocolatey dessert that will satisfy any chocolate craving without any nasty refined sugar or additives! I like to top mine with strawberries and cacao nibs, but you can use either or neither… whatever you prefer. A sprinkling of chopped raw nuts would be good too! Letting it sit in the fridge for a few hours helps thicken it up too if you like your mousse to be denser. If you know anyone who is a chocolate fanatic and would love a recipe like this, please share this post with them! Let’s spread the word that we can still enjoy dessert without unhealthy processed ingredients!"
https://foodbabe.com/favorite-organic-non-gmo-party-food/,My Favorite Organic Non-GMO Snacks and Party Food!,0,"I know many of you are watching sports these days where traditional Doritos, Lays and Ruffles are being served but you don’t have to eat those dirty processed chemical filled GMO snacks! There are so many new alternatives brands and organic versions available that you can bring. Although I don’t recommend packaged snacks often – and preach the gospel on whole real foods – if you are going to gather around and watch the big game you’ve gotta have some snacks, right? Some other favorites: One thing I love about these alternative snack brands, is that they do not contain MSG, an ingredient that keeps you going back for more and more and more. Which is why some of the GMO snack brands like Doritos are so addictive and have become “popular” as a result. Take back your food and get your friends and family involved! Have a fun weekend!"
https://foodbabe.com/look-what-happens-when-you-resist-sweets-for-7-days-whoa/,Look What Happens When You Resist Sweets For 7 Days! Whoa!,0,"I don’t believe in using quick fixes and shady supplements to lose weight and feel my best. Instead, I strongly believe that by instilling healthy habits you can make a significant impact on your health in a very short amount of time. On a personal level, there is one healthy habit that POWERFULLY changed the way I feel, helped me lose unwanted pounds for good, made my skin glow and improved my overall health. AND it was the #1 thing you wrote to me about when I asked you what you were struggling with to accomplish this year! “I want to be able to resist all sweets, when they are in my face. I am a sugar addict. Can’t seem to resist even though I know that it will make me sick and fat, especially when I am feeling low or stressed.” – Debra “I have a sweet tooth and have trouble staying consistent and steady on my path to success.” – Afshan “I need help REALLY cutting out sugar. It is the hidden sugar that is problematic for me. I try to make most things my family eats from scratch but it is unrealistic all of the time. That’s it for me!” – Elizabeth Asking you to eliminate every type of “sugar” from your diet is just crazy – any person trying to do this will fail in the long run. The key to this healthy habit is to still include sugar in your diet but get it in forms that your body can easily assimilate and from sources that also provide nutrients, minerals and vitamins your body will use. If you develop this habit and practice it on a regular basis, you’ll be less likely to go overboard when presented and tempted with refined sugary desserts. Even more, you’ll naturally eat less sugar in the long run because your body is getting real nutrition from the food that hasn’t been chemically altered. Eventually… you’ll develop a distaste for refined sugar and your desire for ultimate nutrition will become intuitive. What a wonderful habit to develop and keep for life, no? I’ve found this to be the fastest way to lose weight and get super healthy, but that is just scratching the surface. What added sugar does to your body is scandalous. That’s why I worked with my team to create an impactful and effective program – The Food Babe 7-Day Sugar Detox. Since I came out with this program last year, the success stories keep coming in from people (some of which you’ll see below) who have dramatically improved their health and nixed their sugar cravings in just 7 days. I’m confident you can do this too. I’ve made it easy! Check out all that’s included in the program here – the Quick Start Guide, the exclusive videos, the delicious recipes, the private forum – all designed to make your transformation a piece of cake! You can start the detox anytime you’d like – next week, next month, next year. I don’t want you to miss this opportunity and your health deserves it. Sign up for the Food Babe 7-Day Sugar Detox here – the entire Food Babe Team will be cheering you on in the forum! We shared several success stories last summer, and now have a few more to share with you below… Are you next? “I am feeling lean, energetic and so great! I am going to continue eating this way as it has spurred a weight loss that I’ve been struggling to ignite. I’m down almost 5 pounds, and paired with seeing a personal trainer I’m experiencing big changes already. I know I will continue to make significant progress if I keep this up. The cruciferous detox salad is quite the meal; that salad alone has helped me drop weight overnight and reset my system. I have been a follower of Vani / Food Babe for years now and have purchased meal plans and books in the past, as I love to know as much as possible about food & nutrition. This sugar detox has been the BEST plan yet for having an immediate and wonderful impact on my health!” ~ Diana “I am 85 and my husband is 87 and we have both just completed our 7-Day Sugar Detox. At this age, we obviously don’t expect boundless energy and glowing skin but to date he has lost 5-lbs. and I have lost 2.5-lbs., although I have more to lose than he, proportionately. As we age, we’ve found that things take much longer to work and this applies to diets as well as everything else. We have both noticed our desire for sweets has pretty well disappeared and I, in particular, have been addicted to sugar my entire life. I find I have more control over my appetite, which is a change! My friends tell me I have lost weight and have expressed interest in the program. Also, strangely enough, my arthritic hip seems to be much better. Instead of lying awake for hours during the night, I now get a full 8 hours sleep and it’s wonderful.” ~ Greta “I think I can say that the Sugar Detox was a success! There are a few reasons I can say that. From a physical aspect not only have I lost a few pounds but my clothes are looser and my rings come off a lot easier. I have also noticed that my complexion seems smoother and clearer. I have actually tamed the “sugar craving beast” in me! While in the middle of my detox week there was a party and I had to have the cake or face scrutiny (I wasn’t ready to explain to everyone why I was doing a “sugar detox program” yet). Not only did I NOT finish the whole thing, I didn’t really CARE to finish the whole thing. That is how I know I tamed the beast! This program has changed the way I think about the processed baked goods. There are other healthier options out there. The Food Babe’s recipe collection has those options. I always seem to have the strongest craving for sweets after a meal, the Refrigerator Almond Fudge bars definitely satisfied that craving. I feel so empowered to have conquered the sugar demon that now I can tell everyone about it! I am so happy to have discovered this program and this way of life. I appreciate all of the Food Babe’s hard work and I am grateful for all the resources. Thank you, Food Babe!” ~ Julia"
https://foodbabe.com/craving-sugar-night-heres-stop/,Craving Sugar At Night? Here’s How To Stop!,0,"It takes time, but I try to read every single email you send me and when I get an email like this one below from Claire, it makes me want to help ASAP! “I am SUCH a late night snacker… It comes to the point, where the cereal box is on my nightstand while I’m watching a movie when I could just be asleep. This obviously worsens when I drink alcohol. However, I don’t want to give up alcohol because that is not the lifestyle I’m after, rather I would like to cut down and also cut down the late night binges on unhealthy processed food since my days are usually full of whole foods that are good for me.” – Claire S. I think nighttime sugar cravings are the absolute worst and I know many of you can relate! If you have ever tried to go “cold turkey” to simply stop eating sugar – and failed – don’t despair! While it can truly seem as if the odds are against us – there is hope! There are several strategies that I’ve used over the years to curb my own sugar cravings (I used to be a major candy ADDICT!) and hopefully these little tricks will help you too… Sugary foods release endorphins that make you feel more relaxed and after you’ve had a long day sometimes it can be hard to refuse a sweet treat to “reward yourself” with that great feeling. The processed food industry knows how addictive sugar is, and carefully engineers their products to hit what they call “the bliss point” to make us crave their foods more and more. They even add sugar to salty foods – it’s reprehensible! If it’s not there, you can’t eat it! But once you bring the bag of cookies into the house you have made it ten times harder to keep your cravings at bay. Willpower will not last, and sooner or later you will come home exhausted, stressed, and the first thing you will reach for are those cookies! Clear any sweets and processed food from your pantry and refrigerator and replace them with simple one-ingredient REAL FOOD snacks – apples, bananas, vegetable sticks, nuts, seeds, boiled eggs. Tell everyone in your family to not bring any sugary junk into the house either, so you won’t be tempted! One of my all-time favorite rituals is drinking tea – especially at night! I drink hot tea almost every night before bed and it really relaxes me and takes away any cravings. I love mint, ginger, or spicy cinnamon teas, as these are amazing at blasting away sugar cravings. That’s because they are naturally sweet without the sugar, and warm and comforting. Exercise releases feel good endorphins that can provide a similar “high” as a sugary or junk food treat can. Not only will you feel better about yourself and the decision you made to be active, but you are also creating new healthy habits by immediately inserting an activity when you feel a craving coming on. I love to take walks outside before the sun sets in the evening, right before dinner. I find that this is when some of my best ideas come to the surface and it really clears my head. Other outdoor activities like raking leaves and tending to a garden are great ideas as well! When you’re spending time in the sun, the added Vitamin D will lift your mood and hopefully take away bad food cravings. So really make an effort to bundle up if necessary and make it outside every day. But if the weather is horrible or you can’t make it out, another good option is to pop in an exercise video at home and get those endorphins pumping! When I don’t get enough sleep I want to eat everything in the house! I notice that I’m way more hungry throughout the day and my cravings are through the roof! So, do whatever you need to do to make sure that you’re sleeping enough each night. This will naturally boost serotonin levels, turn off the hunger hormones, and when your body has enough time to recharge you will probably find that your cravings are not as intense. Having a newborn in the house, this is definitely a tip I’ll be personally working on! Sometimes just talking about your cravings with someone in the same situation is all you need to stay on track. If you know that someone is holding you accountable and rooting you on, it’s much easier to stick to your goals and be successful! That’s why I built a support system like this into the Food Babe 7-Day Sugar Detox Program. As soon as you join here, you’ll be welcomed into our Private Forum with open arms, where you can connect with other members on the sugar detox.

https://foodbabe.com/birth-story-little-angel/,My Birth Story. Our Little Angel Is Here!,0,"Our little angel is here and we are so crazy in love. Meet Harley Diane, 6.5 pounds and 20 inches. Every time I look at her, my heart feels like it is going to explode! This is my birth story… When I became pregnant back in April 2016, I knew right away I wanted to have a natural birth and my commitment became even stronger after talking to several experts, reading many books about child birth, taking a natural birth course and talking to my doctor & doula about the risks associated with some interventions and drugs. Hearing all my friends and family’s birth stories, as well as reading and watching many online, there was one big common theme – there are no two births that are the same and things don’t always go as planned! So I decided to go into all of this with a very easy going attitude and not get too worked up if things did not turn out the way I expected them to go. I said to myself “whatever happens, happens, as long as I have a healthy baby at the end, nothing else matters.” And I also repeated the mantra “My body was designed to do this” to prime my brain to stay focused on the goal. One of the biggest reasons I wanted a natural birth was because I know how my body reacts to foreign substances and pharmaceutical drugs – I don’t feel good after taking them and often feel the bad side effects for weeks. Not only did I not want those substances to get to my newborn baby, but I wanted to have the fastest recovery possible after birth. I also have undergone two different abdominal surgeries in my lifetime and know the recovery is not for the faint of heart. These experiences have given me a very strong conviction to do what I can in my power to avoid medical interventions. Feeling the way I do now – a week later – I know I made the right decision for me to focus on a natural birth. I remain in awe that everything worked out the way I envisioned it to. The month leading up to the birth, I started to get Braxton Hicks contractions and at first they didn’t hurt at all, and then suddenly on Christmas Eve (38 weeks) they began to hurt. The entire day on Christmas Eve, I was having contractions and even contracting at my brother’s Christmas Eve party that evening. It was nothing too painful at this point, but I for sure thought I would have a Christmas baby (and my family thought so too!). A doctor friend at the party even wanted me to go to the hospital to get checked but I didn’t go and eventually on Christmas Day all the contractions fizzled out. When you hit your due date everyone in the world starts calling and texting you, wondering when you are going to give birth. This can be stressful if you let it… but after she didn’t come early during the holiday break, I became super patient leading up to her birthday. “Babies are born on their birthdays” is one of my affirmation cards that I read every night and this kept me focused on taking care of myself, staying calm and relaxed before birth, knowing that my baby would arrive when she was ready. The extra week, gave me time to continue organizing closets and cabinets throughout the house – which I am so glad to have done now! I have been using acupuncture for years as preventative medicine, but when I became pregnant, I started to go to acupuncture almost every week. Not only did this help my pregnancy symptoms (just ask my best friend, who said I never complained during my pregnancy!) but it primed my body for the best birth possible. When I hit 39.5 weeks, I had 3 acupuncture treatments over the course of one week to get my body ready for big day. Acupuncture can help start labor if your baby is ready! After these treatments, I started a type of early labor on Tuesday and Wednesday – both nights I woke up at around 3am with painful contractions that hit every 20 mins or so but would tinker on and off throughout the day. On Thursday, the day before 41 weeks, I saw my doctor and we did a quick safety ultrasound check just to make sure I still had enough amniotic fluid and to see if the baby was doing well in there. As long as everything looked good, she was going to just let me keep going in my late pregnancy until the baby was ready. This was very exciting – I hadn’t seen my baby for over 24 weeks! Everything turned out perfectly! She also checked my cervix and reported that I was 3 cm dilated and 75% effaced, all that early labor was working! This put me at so much ease and I was relaxed enough to go to the Bechtler Museum of Modern Art that afternoon (even though I was still contracting!) to walk around and keep my body moving. We bought the baby an art book to remember the moment and eventually my contractions fizzled out again to relax a bit for dinner. 41 weeks pregnant! Last belly shot before the hospital… The big day… After 2 nights of no sleep, I finally went into REAL labor late Thursday night – actually at about 2:30am Friday morning. The contractions had sped up significantly to every 8-10 minutes all night long. At about 5:30am I texted my doula and she wanted me to keep her posted on progress and we kept in touch throughout the morning. I labored at home finding any position to get me through – hands and knees and bending over with my arms on a wall were the best positions. At around noon, I knew it was time for my doula to come over, it was getting intense and I was having contractions every 5 minutes. For those of you who have never given birth or experienced contractions, it feels like the worst stomach cramp you have ever experienced, and like a wave of sensation with a strong peak that you absolutely have to breathe to get through if you want to be able to handle the pain. It takes all of your focus and concentration during the contraction just to get to the next one. The key is to relax in between the contractions as much as possible so you can get through the next one. I had been in my bedroom all morning by the time my doula arrived. She got me up out of bed and said “take me on a tour of your house” and so we went through and walked my entire house – going up and down the stairs in my house, I contracted on each wall! I had to hold on to her or the wall and bend down for every contraction. After the tour, I thought it would be a good time to eat something, my doula suggested soup and my husband warmed me up some butternut squash soup I had made for our freezer meals after the baby was born. I ate that with some crackers and water. It was so good! I was starving! Then it was finally time for the tub. This was my doula’s “last resort” before getting to the hospital, getting from the stage of early labor to active labor so I would not be in the hospital for too long before giving birth. According to many natural birth experts, if you get to the hospital too early, there is more time for interventions, so the key is to get there at just the right time to avoid that. My doula was very experienced in knowing when to go and without her, I probably would have left earlier… my husband was definitely getting antsy and a bit nervous at this point! I had a ginger blackberry popsicle in the bath – it was delicious, but I couldn’t finish it – the contractions were coming too strong! The bath helped me get through them until about 5:00pm, and then I started feeling an intense amount of pelvic pressure that made me want to push. When my doula witnessed this, she knew it was time to head to the hospital. My husband put the last minute things in the car, handed me my labor robe and nightgown to wear and walked me down the stairs to the car. I was worried about the car ride to the hospital, because even though we were close to the hospital, I was contracting every two minutes. I didn’t want to get out of the bath either because it was such an amazing feeling and the soothing warmth of the water was helping so much with the intense contractions. Once I got to the hospital, I completed a cervical exam (my least favorite thing to do while being pregnant!) – I was at 6 cm and a midwife had to double check it because they thought I had broke my water already too. My doula and I were stunned that they said that I broke it because I didn’t feel anything at all! That same day, I had lost my mucus plug however, which I had been looking forward to seeing as a sign of labor. It was one of those things I was looking for every time I used the bathroom but never found prior to that day. As soon as we got settled into the delivery room, one of my first contractions broke my water. It was the loudest pop I’d ever heard inside my body and it brought on a flood of emotions (no pun intended!). It still baffles me that they thought I had already broke it! My doula whispered to me, things are about to speed up, so let’s get the tub ready. The tub in the delivery room had these magical massaging jets that I didn’t have at home and I was really excited about that. My contractions were coming really fast and very hard in the tub. So hard that the jets no longer felt good and after a few minutes, I begged and screamed to turn the jets off. It got so hot, I thought I was going to melt. Thank goodness for the cooler of coconut water my husband brought to the delivery room – I think I drank about 4 bottles within just a few hours. And this whole time, my sweet nurse was trying to monitor the baby’s heart beat which for some reason really made me uncomfortable, the tiny bit of pressure from the hand held doppler on my pelvis was driving me nuts! I screamed like an animal for a couple of hours (my throat hurt so bad the next day – so remember to bring some organic throat drops with you mamas!). Giving birth is such a primal experience, and I never thought I would hear the sounds that would come out of my mouth. I was in full gorilla ape mode! Leading up to my birth, I thought I would be a quiet birther but heck no! Making the animal sounds really helped me get through the intensity. My doctor, who is a huge advocate for natural birth and very supportive of my birth plan, arrived at the scene. I was SO HAPPY to see her. I was progressing so fast and when I got out of the tub, I couldn’t believe it – I was fully dilated and ready to push about 8:45pm. I got back to the delivery bed and tried to find some positions that would be the best to push in. As many mama’s know, laying on your back is not really the most comfortable position during contractions or pushing, and my birth team had some other tricks up their sleeve. It ended up being that a squat bar and laying on my side were what worked best for me. So I used both of those positions throughout my pushing. At this point, I had been laboring for about 18 hours and I was tired! But the pain was not that bad, nothing worse than what I had already experienced up until that point. At first it took me awhile to get a hang of pushing. I had been breathing heavily through contractions, and my birth team really wanted me to push through contractions while holding my breath – the opposite of what I had been doing all day long! That was difficult for me and really stressed out my body. I felt intense pain on my chest, holding my breath and almost like I was drowning from the lack of oxygen! The final pushes were really athletic and it took everything in me to focus – I felt the ring of fire, but it wasn’t as bad as I expected. When she finally came out, I heard the doctor do something (but didn’t really know what was happening at the time because I couldn’t believe I just pushed her out…) and then she checked to see if I tore, and said everything looked great – no tears to stitch! I was so stunned and so in awe when my daughter was born… the sense of accomplishment… the excitement of seeing her for the first time… everything that you dream about. It is so magical and the feeling of relief is so instant that everything you did up until that point becomes a BILLION times worth it! For every birth video I had seen since I became pregnant, I cried at the end when the baby was born. Even reading a birth story, I would cry at the end. But when my own baby came, I didn’t cry. I was just so happy and I felt my heart exploding with love! I will never ever be able to equate giving birth to anything else I’ve ever accomplished in my life. It is definitely my greatest achievement and was so thankful everything went as I had hoped. After the birth, we waited until the cord stopped pulsating and my husband cut the cord, I got to spend a lot of time skin to skin with my baby and breastfeeding, but the baby nurse did take her away to weigh her, measure her, clean out her nasal passages and mouth and take a blood sample to test her blood sugar (which in hindsight – I wish I would have waited for). It felt like an eternity those few minutes she was out of my arms! The next morning, I really just wanted to take my baby in my arms and say peace out, but I had to stay to monitor my blood pressure that was high after birth. Thankfully it has been treated naturally since leaving the hospital and is back down. They did prescribe me some pharmaceuticals for high blood pressure to take at home before I left (which I didn’t end up taking). I know my body, and knew it would be back to normal in a flash, if I rested and allowed my body recover from the lack of sleep and exhaustion! I also had a wonderful at home acupuncture treatment about 5 days later that worked like a miracle for my blood pressure and sore muscles. When my doula came over for a postpartum visit, I learned that my baby was born with the cord wrapped around her neck, this is what I heard my doctor taking care of, but didn’t see it when she was coming out. My doctor gently looped the cord back over her head before the rest of her body came out, and the cord was long enough that it didn’t pose any danger during the delivery, thank God! It was kinda scary learning about this days later, but it is a really very common thing to happen. It’s amazing that a safe natural birth is still possible in circumstances like this! I know I couldn’t have achieved a natural child birth without the coaching of a doula, a supportive doctor, and a very positive and helpful nurse – I had the A Team for sure! Giving birth is like a marathon. At a marathon, at every water stop along the way, you have people cheering you on with motivational signs and encouraging you to finish. You need the same support while giving birth because there are so many times you think to yourself that you can’t do it or you’re not sure if it is possible or if something will go wrong and you are tired! You need that positive energy in the room to get you through it. There were a few moments during labor where I asked the team “can I do this?” and they would say “yes, you can do this”, and that really motivated me. Taking drugs, however, did not enter my mind once! I credit this to my daily practice of birth affirmation cards leading up to the birth. There were times when I thought I will never, ever, ever have another child while I was going through the really tough parts of labor (the point where my water broke to the point where I started pushing), but that thought went 100% out the window after meeting my baby and the high that I felt of accomplishing my goal of a natural childbirth. I will take 10 babies please!!!! Mr. Food Babe, are you ready? haha. I want to thank my magical birth team: my dear husband who was 100% supportive of my decision to go natural and even more incredible now as a new Dad, all of the women in my life that shared their advice, birth stories and wisdom with me, Genevieve from Mama Natural for her amazing birth course and affirmation cards, Megan from Detoxinista, Latham Thomas from Mama Glow, my sister-in-law Judy who has given natural birth twice!, my trainers at Hilliard Studio Method and K.O. Fitness who kept me in tip top shape all the way to 40 weeks, Charlotte OB/GYN, Carolina Medical Center Maternity Center, my doula Melissa Fehr, my acupuncturist and prenatal massage therapist. I’ll be sharing much more about my pregnancy and motherhood in future posts to come, until then… if you know someone who is pregnant, a mom or wants some inspiration for a natural child birth, please share this post with them and feel free to ask any questions in the comments below! I want to help as many mamas as possible achieve a natural birth, if that is what they want to do. Thank you for all the sweet comments and well wishes you sent this week on social media when I announced our daughter’s birth. I love this community so much and it brings me so much joy to share this very personal story with you."
https://foodbabe.com/the-10-reasons-you-need-a-sugar-detox-right-now/,10 Reasons You Need A Sugar Detox Right Now,0,"One of the most insidious ways the food industry poisons us is by dousing all sorts of foods with “added sugar.” By “added sugar,” I’m talking about any sweetener that doesn’t occur naturally in a food. It may seem innocent, but what added sugar does to the body is scandalous. Added sugar is one of the biggest perpetrators of our current health crisis, and can be implicated in many cases of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer – but its detrimental effects can take years to surface. It’s the hidden link to so much pain and suffering. The food industry knows that sugar is addicting and that sugar makes heavily processed foods taste good, so that’s why they have added it to so many foods that you’d never imagine that it would be in – salad dressings, crackers, soups, pasta sauces… the list goes on. Sugar is in practically every packaged food in the store and at restaurants. It’s so bad now that the average American consumes about THREE POUNDS of sugar every single week in their regular diet. This is one food additive that we all should be paying more attention to when reading ingredient lists. Most recently, an industry front group funded by Coca-Cola, General Mills, Hershey’s, Kellogg’s, Kraft Foods and Monsanto was exposed for commissioning a scientific review that attacked health advice to eat less sugar. Perpetuating false nutrition and health information for the sole purpose of profits is absolutely appalling! These very companies are all big offenders of adding sugar to their products. Should we all just keep eating sugar-laden foods because the junk food industry says it’s okay? Of course not, and it’s time we all see right through this shady paid-for “science”. Sugar makes you gain weight by adding empty calories to your diet and jacking up your blood sugar – two processes that form excess body fat. It also screws with your appetite. According to Dr. Mark Hyman, sugar is different from other calories, “It scrambles all your normal appetite controls…driving your metabolism to convert it into lethal belly fat.” Ditching sugar is one of the fastest and most effective ways to lose weight! Sugar destroys your skin and makes your skin wrinkle. In a process called glycation, sugar molecules attach to collagen and elastin, two proteins that keep skin looking young, and create Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs). AGEs weaken your skin’s support structure and lead to lines and wrinkles. An influx of sugar in the diet increases levels of inflammatory messengers called cytokines. Refined sugars processed from cane, corn, or beets, such as table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are the baddest of the bad. These sugars have been chemically stripped of their minerals, so when you indulge in these sugars, you get no nutrition and your body becomes more acidic. As these sugars are devoid of minerals, they are acid-forming causing more inflammation. When your body stays in a state of inflammation, you are at a greater risk of developing various chronic diseases ranging from cancer, to heart disease, to digestive disorders. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease now affects approximately 90 million Americans (17% are children!) and sugar is to blame. Excessive sugar intake causes the liver to produce fat in a process called lipogenesis. This can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (in which your liver fills with fat), putting you at risk for chronic diseases. Continually exposing your teeth to sugary foods and drinks erodes away your teeth. The bacteria that is naturally in your mouth feeds off of sugars in your diet, producing acids that attack the enamel on your teeth and demineralizes them, eventually leading to cavities and tooth loss. After you break the cycle of endless sugar consumption, you will no longer feel like you are living on an energy-sucking rollercoaster. Added sugar makes your blood sugar go sky-high – a reaction followed immediately by plummeting blood sugar. That crash and burn triggers feelings of irritability, depression, and leaves you exhausted until you get your next sugar fix. A study conducted by the University of New South Wales concluded chronic sugar intake triggers changes to hippocampus the area of the brain, which is important for both memory and stress. Another UCLA study found a high sugar diet sabotages learning and memory ability. A 2012 Mayo Clinic study found that people who eat a lot of sugar have a much higher chance of cognitive decline as they age. Sugar intake weakens your immune system, so you’re at a greater risk of coming down with something. Increased insulin levels from consuming sugar also tells the body to release cortisol – a hormone that further weakens your immunity. A 2015 scientific review in Mayo Clinic Proceedings warns that refined sugar in the diet is a principal driver of heart disease. It’s been shown that those who eat high sugar diets are up to 400% more likely to have a heart attack! It’s now come to light that back in the 1960’s the sugar industry paid leading scientists to discredit claims about sugar and heart disease and to paint fat as the enemy instead. That is when the low-fat craze began, causing most people to correlate heart disease with excessive fat consumption. This belief perpetuated on for decades and unfortunately continues today. These dirty tactics played by the industry have literally destroyed the health of millions, and I’m so thankful that the truth about sugar and its role in heart disease is getting out! If you develop this habit to stay away from added sugar and practice it on a regular basis, you’ll be less likely to go overboard when presented and tempted with refined sugar desserts. Even more, you’ll naturally eat less sugar in the long run because your body is getting real nutrition from food that hasn’t been chemically altered. Eventually, you’ll develop a distaste for refined sugar and your desire for ultimate nutrition will become instinctive. What a wonderful habit to develop and keep for life! A sugar detox is the best way to finally stop sugar cravings dead in their tracks and kick refined sugar from your life for good! That’s why I worked with my team to create an impactful and effective program – The Food Babe 7-Day Sugar Detox “I have lost almost 5 pounds.

https://foodbabe.com/cilantro-rice/,Light & Delicious Cilantro Rice (or Quinoa!) Salad,0,"This Cilantro Basmati Rice Salad is zesty, really FRESH, and compliments almost any meal! It also happens to be one of the simplest recipes in the world. It’s just as easy as those boxes of Rice-a-Roni, but without the nasty additives – and it tastes a million times better too. Even if you are a beginner cook, this is a meal or side dish that will impress your friends and family with very little effort! I like to use brown basmati rice to make this dish, but you can also use quinoa if you prefer. Brown basmati rice hasn’t been stripped of its bran and germ (like white rice) where most of the nutrients are, and it still has a light and fluffy texture. Brown rice is one of the richest sources of manganese, a trace mineral that fights free radicals in the body. Basmati rice also has a lower glycemic index than white rice and won’t send your blood sugar surging! Refined carbohydrates (carbs) like white rice, processed grains, and refined sugar can spike blood sugar levels and tax your organs, slowing down healing and robbing the body from other important regulatory functions. Refined carbs can also cause weight gain that you can’t seem to get rid of (especially around the mid section). Since brown basmati rice isn’t refined and has its fiber intact, it is a more nutritious way to eat carbohydrates. To get started on making this dish, get out a medium sized pot and melt one tablespoon of coconut oil (or butter) over medium heat. Chop up half a cup of onions, mince a couple garlic cloves, and stir them into the pot. Cook until the onions start to turn translucent and the garlic is fragrant. It smells sooo good! Add 1 cup of dry brown basmati rice or quinoa to the pot and stir it around for one minute. Make sure to keep stirring so it doesn’t burn! Stir in two cups of chicken (or vegetable) stock, turn the heat down to low, cover the pot and allow it to simmer. After 20 minutes, take a peek at the rice and check to see if the liquid has evaporated and if the rice is cooked. It may need to cook for about 5-10 minutes longer. Use this time to chop up half a cup of cilantro and also to juice and zest one lime… When the rice is cooked, take the pot off of the heat and stir in the chopped cilantro, lime juice, and lime zest. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve warm and enjoy! This is an example of the types of recipes that are recommended after you complete the Food Babe 7-Day Sugar Detox Program. We all want to find a balance between feeling our best, finding our ideal weight and eating a diet that we can live with. One that doesn’t rob us of a guilty pleasure here and there or cut out so many foods that it leaves you wondering if there is anything left that you CAN eat! The Food Babe 7-Day Sugar Detox Program is a great way to begin to eliminate problematic foods from your diet without drastically slashing calories or having a long list of foods to avoid taped to your refrigerator. That is never fun! With this program I provide you with a simple plan to follow so that you can start feeling your best and see how even small changes can create big results. I am opening up this impactful and effective program at a special discounted price for limited time. If you know anyone who struggles with sugar or their health, please share this post with them. Let’s make this our healthiest year yet!"
https://foodbabe.com/my-favorite-moments-from-2016-see-which-food-companies-are-dropping-the-toxins/,My Favorite Moments From 2016 – See Which Food Companies Are Dropping The Toxins!,0,"We’ve come a long way Food Babe Army! 2016 was full of surprises and a lot of turmoil – but there was so much good to reflect on, these are some of my favorite moments of 2016… At a recent conference, executives from legacy food companies agreed that consumers want to buy clean, healthy food and that this isn’t just a fad – it’s here to stay. Iconic food brands are now on a “real food journey”, removing artificial additives and eliminating harmful farming practices (like routine antibiotics). They are moving in the right direction and they aren’t alone. The good food revolution is in full force thanks to the Food Babe Army, activist organizations and countless consumers that are taking back their health! When I look back on 2016, one of the things I’m so proud of is seeing the public become increasingly aware of the unethical tactics employed by the food and chemical companies to mislead consumers. Thanks largely to the work done by consumer interest groups like U.S. Right to Know, Food and Water Watch, Center for Food Safety and The Cornucopia Institute we now see exactly how companies use front groups, scientists, and other paid experts to conduct covert public relations for them. The Food Babe Army has been very instrumental in spreading the word and we are creating a better informed public! We now know why they are attacking us for simply asking for healthy food and how to fight back. There are some big revelations on this front to come next year, and I couldn’t be more proud of the amazing work that we are doing together. The Food Babe Army Rocks!!! The Most Loved Instagram Posts of 2016! Campbell’s labels GMO ingredients (January 7, 2016) – The new year started out with a bang when one of the largest food corporations in the U.S. announced they will begin labeling GMOs on all of their products, which include Pepperidge Farm, Prego, Plum Organics and V8, and they anticipate that labeling will be complete within “12 to 18 months”. We had previously exposed the GMOs in their products here, and the Food Babe Army showed our thanks to Campbell’s for being the first major brand to label the GMOs in their products in the U.S. All the letters you sent to Campbell’s thanking them for labeling GMOs – So nice of them to acknowledge our efforts! Vani Hari named one of “America’s 50 Most Powerful People in Food for 2016” by The Daily Meal (January 27, 2016) – I was honored to make this list as one of “the watchdogs, the inspirers, the facilitators” of the food movement in America. This is a win for ALL OF YOU in the Food Babe Army who share our posts, investigations, petitions, and vote with your dollars asking for a safer and healthier food supply. You are a force like no other! Starbucks publishes drink ingredients for first time in history – Sometime in January, we noticed that Starbucks quietly added ingredient lists for their drinks to their website. This is a campaign that we have been working on since 2012 (see here, here, here, and here) and these posts have been shared hundreds of thousands of times. Starbucks used to claim that their ingredients were “proprietary” and refused to disclose – so this is a huge win for transparency! Mars removes artificial colors from candies (February 5, 2016) – The maker of M&M’s, Skittles, and Starburst will remove all artificial colors from all of their products (excluding pet foods) within the next 5 years. Renee Shutters (an activist consumer) and The Center For Science In The Public Interest petitioned to remove the dyes from M&M’s, and received over 217K signatures! Vani Hari named one of “The 13 Most Powerful Women in Food” by The Daily Meal (February 19, 2016) – Pretty surreal a food activist was on this list with Oprah Winfrey and the CEOs of major food companies! Perdue’s chicken strips go antibiotic-free (February 26, 2016) – Perdue announced that they would eliminate chicken raised on antibiotics from their chicken strips and nuggets sold in grocery stores by June 2016. This just goes to show that it doesn’t need to take YEARS to accomplish this! This makes them the largest supplier of antibiotic-free chicken strips in the U.S. Yet, this is still only a portion of the chicken that Purdue produces, so I am still waiting for them to eliminate the routine use of antibiotics across their entire product line. We have campaigned along with dozens of consumer interest groups to to stop the dangerous routine use of antibiotics on farms and we are slowly chipping away at it (see here, here, here, here, and here). March The Food Babe Way is released in paperback! – My first book, The Food Babe Way, was a #1 bestseller & New York Times Best Seller – selling more books than any other book the week that it was released in 2015. I have continued to be astonished by all your support, generous love and am humbled and forever grateful for every single person that has read this book and have helped to spread the word and get this message out. The Food Babe Way is for anyone who’s tired of the food industry hijacking their taste buds and wants to take matters into their own hands and become their own food investigator, nutritionist, and food activist. There’s a way to survive and look good without dieting, and this book contains the 21 essential habits that I taught myself to take control of my health. It is now available in paperback online here. At The Natural Living Expo in Boston, MA In-N-Out Burger commits to stopping routine antibiotic use (March 2, 2016) – On February 24th, I joined over 50 public interest and consumer advocacy groups in sending a letter to In-N-Out Burger, asking them to phase out the routine use of antibiotics across all of their meat supply chains (as well as using beta-agonists and growth hormones) and also to provide a more healthful and sustainable grass-fed option on the menu. The following week, In-N-Out Burger responded by telling reporters, “Our company is committed to beef that is not raised with antibiotics important to human medicine, and we’ve asked our suppliers to accelerate their progress towards establishing antibiotic alternatives.” Although they stated they are moving in that direction, they have not provided a timeline, so this fight is not over. Here’s more about what’s in their food. General Mills labels GMO ingredients (March 18, 2016) – Two days after the DARK Act was initially defeated by the Senate, General Mills was the first company to announce that they will label GMOs on all of their products within the U.S. Their product line includes Yoplait, Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, Chex, Progresso, and Fruit By The Foot. Will they keep this commitment now that the DARK Act was revived and signed into law in July? Kellogg’s & Mars both label GMO ingredients (March 21, 2016) – Just a few days later, both of these companies followed suit by announcing they will also label GMOs in their products throughout the U.S. within months. ConAgra labels GMO ingredients (March 22, 2015) – Quickly on their heels, ConAgra said they will also begin adding labels to products nationwide by July – their brands include Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Hunt’s, and Marie Callender’s. Campbell’s eliminates BPA from cans (March 28, 2015) – Campbell’s announces they will transition to BPA-Free cans by the mid-2107 in the U.S. and Canada. They are the largest canned soup maker in the U.S., so this is huge! Del Monte joins the Food Babe Army (March 29, 2015) – Del Monte told reporters that they will begin to “move away” from GMOs and that they would add “non-GMO labels” to their products that don’t contain them. When I thanked Del Monte on Twitter for their decision – they told me: “We are happy to join your #FoodBabeArmy!”… these brands are listening to us!!! The biotech companies were not pleased and a fake grassroots movement (astroturf campaign) was launched – which I revealed here. This is the month I found out I was pregnant ! I can’t wait to bring little baby Food Babe into the world very soon. Follow @FoodBabeMama on Instagram for updates and lots of mama discussions! Showering Little Food Babe With Love (Nov 2016) Taco Bell ditches antibiotics (April 18, 2016) – Taco Bell issues a press release announcing they will no longer serve chicken raised on medically important antibiotics in the U.S. by 2017. This follows a letter that over 80 organizations (including Food Babe) sent to Taco Bell’s parent company (Yum! Brands) in January, urging them to commit to a strong antibiotics policy. Nestle removes GMOs and artificial ingredients from ice cream (April 20, 2016) – Nestle cleans up their ice cream as they ditch GMOs and growth hormones from many of their ice cream products – their brands include Dreyers, Edy’s, Haagen-Daz, Outshine, Skinny Cow, and Drumstick. They also said they’d eliminate other ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, carrageenan, artificial flavors and colors from many of these products. Dannon eliminates GMOs from yogurts (April 27, 2016) – Dannon announced that they are moving away from synthetic ingredients and would remove GMOs from Dannon, Oikos and Danimals yogurts starting in July. Instead of just removing GMO ingredients (like sugar from GMO beets) from their ingredients, they are taking it a step further to ensure that the milk comes from cows that are not fed GMO feed. This is a HUGE and outstanding commitment given that the vast majority of GMO crops are fed to farm animals. They also committed to labeling GMOs in their remaining products – and are holding strong, despite being attacked by the industry! Moms Across America Launched Organic Awareness Campaign (April 24, 2016) – This billboard was in 191 locations across 35 cities. “This is a health solution not only for consumers, but for our earth. 1 out of 2 U.S children have a chronic illness. Studies also show organic improves the health of farmers, the quality of the soil, water, plants and reduces climate change.” Pizza Hut removes controversial preservatives and switches to antibiotic-free chicken (May 31, 2016) – Pizza Hut began making big changes to their ingredients which include removing BHA and BHT from all of their meats and removing preservatives from cheese by March 2017. They also have plans to get rid of additional unnecessary additives and preservatives in their food by 2020. Most importantly, they will stop sourcing chicken (as a pizza topping) that was raised on human antibiotics by March 2017 – now they just need to include their chicken wings and other meats in this policy! We raised awareness of the preservative BHT when we petitioned Kellogg’s and General Mills to remove it from their cereals in 2015. Adweek names Vani Hari one of the 30 Most Influential People in Food! (June 5, 2016) – I was over the moon to be considered on the same list as my favorite foodies Anthony Bourdain and Ina Garten – even more so, considering the attention to our good food movement activism! In June, I completed a whirlwind book tour in Spain for the Spanish version of my book, The Food Babe Way (El método Food Babe). Overseas, Monsanto and pro-GMO proponents do not easily influence the government and the media with their propaganda – it was refreshing to be around people not scared to report the truth about the chemicals in our food. I was able to spread our message widely in Spain and reached so many people in a short amount of time! Here’s some of the press we received: Meeting the Food Babe Army all across Spain! Pepperidge Farm releases non-GMO Goldfish Crackers (June 2, 2016) – Pepperidge Farm introduces a new version of Goldfish Crackers made with organic wheat and non-GMO ingredients. They are still selling the old GMO-filled Goldfish though, so check those labels! Panera Bread removes more artificial ingredients (June 15, 2016) – Ditches artificial ingredients in their grocery store products (which include soups, breads, deli meats, coffee and salad dressings). These will no longer contain high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors, artificial sweeteners, artificial preservatives and artificial colors. This is in addition to the changes they started making in their restaurants last year, which includes stopping the routine use of antibiotics in their meat! Campbell’s plans for antibiotic-free chicken (July 21, 2016) – Although they didn’t disclose a timeline, Campbell’s announced that they will not allow their chicken suppliers to add antibiotics to their feed, water or vaccines. This will include their entire line of brands, such as Swanson. McDonald’s starts to clean up their buns and McNuggets (August 1, 2016) – Following their commitment to eliminate human use antibiotics from their chicken, they announced the removal of artificial preservatives – sodium phosphate, TBHQ – from their famous Chicken McNuggets and some breakfast items. They will also be removing high fructose corn syrup from all of their buns! They likely made this move after they received double digit sales increases when they reformulated their Egg McMuffin last year with simpler ingredients. This just goes to show that it pays off to improve their products with better ingredients! Cheez-It’s indicates they will remove TBHQ (August 26, 2016) – Our facebook post exposing the TBHQ in Cheez-It crackers went viral with over 12 million views and 185,000 shares. This synthetic preservative is a form of butane (a very toxic gas) and has been linked to vision disturbances, liver enlargement, childhood behavioral problems, and stomach cancer in animal studies. New research coming out of Michigan State University links it to the rise in food allergies, which has prompted more research. Although the FDA allows TBHQ in America, it is banned for use in food in other countries including Japan. Cheez-It took notice and responded that they are “actively testing a number of natural alternatives” to TBHQ – but how many more people will continue to consume TBHQ before they change it? September In September, I spoke at the Hawaii-Center for Food Safety’s event called the “Ethics of Eating”. The Center For Food Safety is a nonprofit organization that promotes organic and sustainable agriculture with work focusing on the public health impacts of the pesticides and herbicides used on GMOs, and because of this, they are heavily targeted by the biotech companies who are profiting off of these chemicals and technologies. Despite unethical efforts by the biotech industry to disrupt my talk, we had a packed house and standing room only! We streamed the event live on Facebook and it was a huge success. Thank you Hawaii-Center For Food Safety for the incredible hospitality and of course, for hiring additional security to keep the event on track! Ethics of Eating Talk at The University of Hawaii, 09/15/2016 Healthy Futures SALT Salon hosted by The Center For Food Safety, Honolulu, Hawaii Stouffer’s simplifies ingredients in their lasagna (September 6, 2016) – Nestle reformulated their recipe and removed autolyzed yeast extract (hidden MSG), carrageenan, dextrose and bleached wheat flour from their Stouffer’s Lasagna. I’ve highlighted the harmful effects of hidden MSG and carrageenan several times in the past and it’s nice to see companies are starting to remove these unnecessary additives from their products! Schuman introduces “True Cheese” without cellulose (September 6, 2016) – Schuman introduced a new “True Cheese” label that verifies a product is made only with milk, cultures, salt and enzymes. This was in response to the scandal regarding alarming amounts of cellulose added to some shredded cheeses. Ground breaking research links this additive to weight gain, inflammation and digestive problems. Jell-O ditches artificial colors in new line (October 5, 2016) – A new line of Jell-O gelatin and pudding mixes without artificial colors, artificial flavors, or preservatives was released. In 2014, I broke down the toxic ingredients in conventional Jell-O, including artificial colors like yellow #5 that requires a warning label in Europe, and the artificial preservative BHT. The Food Babe Army shared this investigation so much that it was read by millions of people over the last couple years. Informed consumers like us stopped buying JELL-O and look what they had to do! Beware that the old toxic version of JELL-O with artificial colors and BHA is still in stores and this is just a new line that they have created – so continue to check the ingredient list on any product you buy! Buitoni goes non-GMO (October 25, 2016) – Buitoni announced that they will remove the GMOs from their pastas and sauces. Carrageenan to be removed from organic food (November 17, 2016) -The National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) declares that carrageenan will no longer be permitted in organic food by 2018. I wrote about this additive in organic food back in 2012, which is commonly found in almond milks, coconut milks, soy milks, creamers, cottage cheese, ice cream, deli meat, and dozens of other products. It’s been shown to be a dangerous and potent inflammatory agent (and possible carcinogen), so it has no business being in our food. This is a HUGE win for consumers. Thanks goes out to The Cornucopia Institute for leading this charge and to everyone who campaigned to make this happen! The Food Babe Army storms the internet! Our most viral blog post of the year with over 5 million views exposed the alarming amount of the weedkiller glyphosate found in U.S. foods after it was tested by a FDA registered food safety laboratory, commissioned by Food Democracy Now and The Detox Project. The Food Babe Army really pulled through on this, and although the mainstream media failed to cover this very important information, you all shared this post so much that it spread like wildfire and millions of people are now informed. We are winning the fight for a safer and healthier food supply. Every time you purchase food, tell a friend something new you learned about food, sign a petition, read an ingredient list or contact a company directly, you are taking an act which makes you an activist. Together, with the power of our collective voices, we are shaping the marketplace and creating a new demand for real food. Let’s encourage each other to keep going! PLEASE SHARE THIS POST with everyone you know and ask them to join the Food Babe Army! When we work together to demand better food, companies have no choice but to change – and we need all hands on deck in the coming new year. Make sure that you are subscribed to the Food Babe email newsletter here, so that you are notified about our next big investigation and petition. This is the primary way I communicate with all of you and I don’t want anyone to miss out. I can’t wait to see what 2017 brings! Are you as fired up as I am?"
https://foodbabe.com/holiday-recipes/,How To Avoid The Holiday Death Aisle This Year And Beyond!,0,"If you do one thing this holiday season – avoid what I call “The Holiday Death Aisle” at the supermarket and discount drug stores. That aisle is filled with brightly colored JUNK made with bleached and heavily processed flour, artificial colors derived from petroleum, nasty preservatives, GMO refined white sugars, GMO oils, and the absolute worst ingredients you can put in food. This is no way to celebrate the holidays and food manufacturers know they can get away with selling you the cheapest ingredients during this time of year because they can tap into the nostalgia of the holiday season and the idea that “it’s just once a year” – but really it’s ALL YEAR. Almost immediately after they clear the Halloween candy from their shelves, grocery stores stock up on Christmas candy and all the fast food places come out with “holiday drinks”… and then comes Valentine’s Day… and then Easter… and it really just keeps going in an endless cycle of toxic seasonal treats. I’m not saying you shouldn’t have festive treats for the holidays, but it just baffles me that food companies and restaurants fill their foods with the worst possible ingredients in the name of the holidays. Just take a look at what’s in Chick-Fil-A’s popular Peppermint Chocolate Chip Milkshake for example… Gross, right? Just because it’s the holidays, you don’t need to subject your body to ingredients like this. Years ago, I stopped buying packaged and processed holiday candies, cookies and treats, and started the tradition of making seasonal treats with real whole food organic ingredients instead – and I’ve never looked back! Please share this list of recipes with your friends and family too! Let’s help everyone make healthier treats this year and beyond."
https://foodbabe.com/almond-butter-raspberry-thumbprint-cookies/,Almond Raspberry Thumbprint Cookies,0,"Almost every packaged holiday cookie out there is made with bleached and heavily processed flour, artificial colors derived from petroleum, GMO refined white sugars and GMO oils, and conflict palm oil. Just because it’s the holidays, you don’t need to subject your body to ingredients like this… There’s nothing that I value more than my health and the health of my friends and family, and I’m sure you feel the same way. That’s why I started the tradition of baking seasonal treats with real whole food organic ingredients. One of my new cookie recipes is sure to become a favorite around here, and they don’t even contain any refined sugar! I’ll be sharing these Almond Raspberry Thumbprint Cookies with loved ones during the holidays. They look a little fancy, but only take about 15 minutes of your time to put together – quicker than it would take to run to the store! I like to prep the chia jam the night before since it takes some time in the fridge to set up, but it really only takes one hour in the fridge if you don’t want to wait. All you need for the jam is a cup of raspberries, a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and a tablespoon of chia seeds. If you want it sweeter, you can stir in some honey or maple syrup, but you don’t need it! Just blend up the chia jam ingredients in a blender until smooth. Add in a tablespoon (or so) of water if you need to help it blend. Put the jam in a glass jar or bowl and refrigerate for at least an hour – or overnight. The chia seeds will expand and gel, transforming it into a delicious jam! When you’re ready to make the cookies, preheat your oven to 350 degrees and get out a large bowl and your favorite whisk… Whisk together 1/4 cup coconut oil, 1/2 cup coconut sugar, one egg, and a tablespoon of real vanilla extract until well blended… In another bowl stir together a couple cups of almond flour and a pinch (1/4 teaspoon) of sea salt. And slowly pour the almond flour mixture into the wet ingredients and blend together until it’s all mixed together like this… Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and scoop out 12-15 cookie dough balls. Press a thumbprint into the center of each cookie… Take your chia jam out of the fridge and scoop a teaspoon into each indent… Put the cookies in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes until slightly browned on the edges. Here’s to creating happy and healthy holiday memories with recipes like this! Please bake up a batch and share this recipe with your loved ones this season!"

Filtering my water was one of the least effort things I had to do to improve my overall health, hair and skin – but one of the most rewarding!

It’s truly a gift to yourself and/or others that keeps on giving and that’s why a water filter is my first Food Babe Favorite gift of the season.

https://foodbabe.com/one-pan-dish-lemon-rosemary-chicken-root-vegetables/,Make Dinner Easy With This One Pan Dish: Lemon Rosemary Chicken & Root Vegetables,0,"After investigating how food is produced and raised in this country, one of the first commitments to my health I made was to completely stop eating “factory farmed” meat. Whether I’m eating at home, a friend’s house, or at a restaurant – I try my best not to eat meat unless I know that it didn’t come from a factory farm. When you stop buying meat raised on factory farms you will feel SO MUCH better! You’ll no longer be eating meats with the accumulated toxins that come from living crammed together in inhumane living conditions, subsisting on a diet of chemical-laden GMOs and antibiotics, while being pumped full of hormones and drugs to make them grow bigger. These animals are not healthy! And when we eat animals that are not healthy – we become unhealthy! If you want to change the food industry, your body, and get healthy you have to make the commitment to stop eating factory farmed meat. That’s why I prefer to obtain meat directly from local farms or sources I trust where they are transparent about their practices. Knowing the source of my meat, gives me peace of mind that the animals truly had a “free-range” life and weren’t kept in a crate and pumped with antibiotics in some Big Ag operation. Ideally, I want all the meat I buy to come from a healthy, contented animal that grazed on an open, green pasture its whole life. From the mountains of emails I’ve received, I see that many of you desperately want to stop buying meat from factory farms too, and that’s why I have a new partner here at Food Babe that will help you (and everyone you know) do just that. Not only am I now using this service, but I’ve got my team and some family members on board too! We whipped up this incredible Lemon Rosemary Chicken with Root Vegetables in just one pan this week… and let me tell you… it’s an extremely satisfying meal and perfect for having friends over for dinner. When entertaining, I love making meals that only use one pan as I don’t have to worry about multi-tasking. This is one of those recipes you can throw together while chatting with your friends without missing a beat! I’ll definitely be keeping this Lemon Rosemary Chicken recipe handy during the holiday season. While preheating the oven to 400 degrees, prepare the rosemary spice mix. This flavorful dish is simply seasoned with a mix of fresh rosemary leaves, oregano, red pepper flakes, minced garlic, the juice of one lemon and olive oil. Just add all of this to a large bowl and stir it up! Salt and pepper 4 chicken thighs, add them to the same bowl with the spice mix and rub it all in evenly. Set this aside and wash up to prepare the veggies. Dice up half of an onion and three cups of root veggies into bite-size pieces. Here I used sweet potatoes, turnips and red and purple potatoes, but feel free to use any root vegetables you like such as yams, carrots, and parsnips. This recipe is flexible! Get out a large oven-proof skillet (I like to use a heavy cast iron skillet) and heat up one tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat on the stove. Saute the diced vegetables for 5-7 minutes and remove from the pan to make room for the chicken. Add your seasoned chicken thighs to the skillet and brown them on both sides for a couple minutes. Stir back in your veggie mix, along with 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary and half a cup of chicken stock (here’s how to make homemade stock!). Cut a lemon in half and toss it into the skillet. I added the already juiced lemon too! Stick the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes (or until chicken is cooked through) and then you’ll have this beautiful skillet of deliciousness!!!…… This dish will easily impress friends and family! Doesn’t it look so beautiful all plated up? Squeeze some of that lemon juice over everything before you dig in, the flavors are fresh and amazing!"

https://foodbabe.com/monsanto/,Monsanto Is Scrambling To Bury This Breaking Story – Don’t Let This Go Unshared!,0,"I am frankly shocked this information is not making front page news right now. Monsanto will do anything to bury this story… and as of right now, it’s working. Not a single mainstream media outlet has covered this appalling new report that shows millions of people being poisoned by a chemical that does not belong in our food. This chemical is ending up in processed foods like Cheerios, Ritz Crackers, and Oreos and being consumed by humans across the world. The health of millions of people is on the line and this news must go mainstream! That’s why I’m calling on every single one of you who reads this post to share this breaking story now. The only way this injustice will be corrected is if enough of us stand up and demand that something be done to stop the poisoning of our food supply. A FDA-registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (aka Monsanto’s Roundup) and found ALARMING amounts. {See the test results and full report by Food Democracy Now! and The Detox Project}. This chemical has gone so mainstream that glyphosate has infiltrated every facet of our environment – our water, air, soil. So, that is why it’s not just GMO-filled junk food that is laced with glyphosate. It’s contaminating organic and non-GMO foods, and it’s even in our honey! The FDA quietly found it in almost every single sample of honey that they tested (from mass produced to organic mountain honey). The media has been essentially silent and barely anyone heard this news! Even if you don’t personally eat the specific brands that were tested (I don’t), how many people are eating Cheerios and Ritz Crackers every day? A lot! There are still thousands of other brands and whole foods that have not been tested for glyphosate residues, so we can’t be so sure that our own organic, non-GMO, and unprocessed food is safe. Americans are effectively being forced to eat this poison until something is done to stop the rampant use of this chemical. Yes, I said poison. While there are now several manufacturers of glyphosate herbicides, Monsanto completely dominates the market and this is a best seller. They are raking in BILLIONS every year and certainly don’t want that to stop. They are clearly, without a doubt, using their prosperity to influence our government regulators. Why else would those entrusted to protect the public from harmful chemicals turn a blind eye to this? In 2013, the EPA massively increased the industry standard of what is considered a “safe” level of glyphosate on our food, in order to make enormous amounts seem A-OK. Instead of properly regulating, they effectively raised the “safe” level so that no one can blame the industry for poisoning us with unlawful amounts of chemicals. This is corruption at its finest. The EPA has a long and sordid history of doing whatever Monsanto wants and you have to ask yourself why this continues to happen and how we can make it stop. The EPA continues to pander to Monsanto, as they keep postponing and dragging their feet to evaluate glyphosate’s link to cancer in humans. The industry is fighting tooth and nail to make sure that the EPA “evaluation” will be in their favor and is trying to control who will be on the panel. Why won’t the EPA do their job to make sure that the world’s most widely used herbicide isn’t causing us all to get cancer? Don’t you think this should be a top priority? It’s time for the EPA to put the public health above the corrupt desires of corporations. When it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either. After announcing in February that they would FINALLY begin testing foods for glyphosate residues, they just decided to suspend their testing this week. Could it be that Monsanto didn’t like the results they started getting – especially since the FDA found glyphosate in foods that should be especially safe like BABY FOOD? Monsanto will do whatever it takes to keep that story out of the public eye. It is shameful that the American media has thus far failed to cover this breaking news, but WE HAVE THE POWER to make this information go viral. If you really want to stop the corruption perpetuated by Monsanto and the large chemical companies – this is how we shut them down! Remember the best way to avoid glyphosate is by choosing certified organic foods because it is prohibited on organic crops. Although contamination is a real threat, the levels on organic foods are minimal compared to what’s been found on conventional foods. It’s been shown that people who eat organic foods have less glyphosate and other synthetic pesticides in their system. The people of this country must be informed and this should be our top priority.

Whoomp Whoomp! That’s why I love to make my own! I also like to switch up my nut butters – sometimes I use almond butter instead of using peanut butter that is often used in Pad Thai recipes. Peanuts are more susceptible to being contaminated with Aflatoxin, which is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer – so it’s not a nut butter I eat on a daily basis. Besides, according to this analysis, almond butter has 69% more calcium, twice as much fiber, 86% more iron, and 169% more vitamin E than peanut butter.

Don’t you just love recipes like this? I’ve had SO MANY people tell me how shocked they were that it really doesn’t cost them more money at the grocery store to eat whole foods instead of processed foods, but the time they were spending in the kitchen was wearing them out. I’m right there with you! It seems all too easy to just pick up some take-out in the evening and relax on the couch. But, I’ve learned that even when I’m crunched for time, I can’t continuously outsource my health to restaurants if I want to maintain an ideal weight and stay in the best health that I’ve ever known. When you cook your own meals you are in control of the ingredients and know everything that went into them. It’s the only way to know exactly what you are eating! That’s why I prepare at least 15 home-cooked meals every week — and I’ve found that using a slow cooker is one of the easiest methods out there that makes it virtually effortless for me to stick to eating unprocessed food on a regular basis. Hands down… this is the easiest way to eat a healthy diet on limited time. That’s why I worked with my team to create a (newly expanded) Food Babe Real Food Slow Cooker Guide. We spent months carefully crafting OVER 50 healthy slow cooker recipes which are all incredibly delicious and easy. These recipes are so simple and hassle-free that they make a healthy lifestyle a breeze! To give you a taste, I’m sharing the Chicken Quinoa Chili recipe straight from this guide with you below. This recipe is not only healthy and delicious, but makes the house smell so amazing! If you’d like to, it’s easy to make this chili vegan by simply omitting the chicken and using vegetable stock. It will still be packed with protein and fiber from the beans and quinoa. Quinoa is a gluten-free seed that contains 8 grams of complete protein and 5 grams of fiber per cup (cooked). It’s also a good source of manganese and magnesium… just some of the reasons why I love adding it to my meals to bump up the nutritional content. Quinoa has a texture similar to rice so it really works well in stir-fry’s and soups! Here’s a recap of what you’ll receive…"
https://foodbabe.com/bojangles-ingredients/,What Are Bojangles Ingredients? (Let Me Warn You.),0,"Today I’m launching a petition asking the restaurant chain Bojangles’ Famous Chicken & Biscuits to: (1) formally prohibit the routine use of antibiotics for growth promotion and disease prevention in the production of their meat, with a concrete policy and timeline, and to (2) publish their complete ingredient list online. Here’s why… Last summer, I volunteered at a local elementary school and noticed that they were serving Bojangles’ for breakfast. I asked the school administrators if they knew what was in Bojangles’ food or if they had an ingredient list that they could share with me – and they told me they didn’t know the ingredients. Hundreds of kids were eating it, but no one had any idea what was in it. How does this happen? I asked myself. I grew up eating Bojangles’ and they have a really large presence here in Charlotte. You see their advertising everywhere – sporting events, local charities, and schools! I used to eat it every Friday in high school when seniors were allowed to leave the school campus for lunch. I’d get everything – the fries, the sweet iced tea, and that famous fried chicken! Obviously, I didn’t know or care about what I was eating back then – but given the health crisis we face in this country (especially here in the south), if we are going to make good informed decisions about what we are eating – we need to know what’s in our food! We initially reached out to Bojangles’ via their contact form to ask for ingredients in some menu items and didn’t receive responses. We tried this several times and received absolutely nothing back from them which seemed somewhat strange from a customer service standpoint. When we followed up with phone calls, the customer service agents told us they didn’t have any ingredient lists and couldn’t provide any information, but that they would ask someone from corporate to call us back. They never called or emailed us back – not a peep! In a news release Bojangles’ says, “I can’t give away all of our secrets, but I can say that we start every batch of biscuits with the freshest ingredients. It’s what our customers expect and deserve”. They’ve always claimed to make their biscuits “from scratch” and this is something that they are famous for. When I hear the words “from scratch”, I tend to believe that means that they’re made from ingredients that are typically used in the kitchen – no chemical additives and ingredients that you’d expect in biscuits like flour, butter, and milk. On the other hand, I also know that most restaurants – especially fast food restaurants – are notorious for taking shortcuts and add all kinds of synthetic chemicals like preservatives, MSG, artificial flavors, and colors to their food. For example, KFC lists the ingredients for their biscuits online and they are filled with partially hydrogenated soy and cottonseed oils, DATEM, natural and artificial flavors, and TBHQ. KFC also adds MSG to their chicken. When Bojangles’ refuses to share their ingredients, I can’t help but be skeptical and wonder if they are using ingredients like these too! In a last ditch effort, we contacted a Bojangles’ regional office (Tands, Inc. Bojangles’) and received an email back from their Area Supervisor with some very interesting information. We asked what type of oil they use in their fryers as this is used to cook a number of their items like their chicken, fries, country-fried steak and the cajun filet. The representative stated they use All Fry ZT (Blended Liquid Shortening Made from Canola Oil and Beef Fat) in their fryers. What else do we know about the food at Bojangles’? Until they agree to disclose ingredients, we are pretty much in the dark. A Bojangles’ allergen statement from 2013 found online indicates there is soy in their biscuits, which could mean that they use soybean oil instead of butter (but we won’t know for sure until they stop hiding their ingredients). Soybean oil is one of the most unhealthy oils out there which increases the risk of obesity, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. It’s almost always made from GMO soybeans. When researchers tested GMO soybeans they found that they contain high levels of residues from the herbicide glyphosate (Monsanto’s Roundup) compared to non-GMO soybeans. This is a huge issue, as glyphosate has been linked to cancer in many studies – so this is not something I want to be eating and why I avoid GMOs like the plague. Bojangles’ apparently uses MSG too. According to their 2013 allergen statement, MSG is in all of their kids meals. It also shows that MSG is added to their seasoned fries, green beans, dirty rice, country-fried steak, ranch sauce, and blue cheese salad dressing. Providing customers with full and transparent ingredient information shows that Bojangles’ is a trustworthy company that is proud of their products. Besides, there are a growing number of consumers that are seeking out ingredient information because we are concerned about food additives and their relation to health, or have other allergies and food sensitivities that are not provided on their allergen statement. Without full ingredient disclosure, consumers are left in the dark and this is preventing them from eating at Bojangles’. Most competitors release ingredients when asked – and it surely seems bizarre that Bojangles’ refuses to release even minute details about what is in their food. But, it doesn’t end there. Almost all chickens raised in factory farms are routinely fed antibiotics, day in and day out. This practice should be stopped and here’s why: I personally reached out to Ken Scott, the Director of Quality Assurance at Bojangles’ (and cc’d the CEO), last December and asked him to provide me with their ingredient list and their policy on antibiotics in the production of their meat. And, was told that many of their menu items are “proprietary” and that they couldn’t make that information available: I pressed for more information, especially since all major fast food chains publish their ingredients online and my question about antibiotics was ignored: As I did with McDonalds, Subway, In-N-Out Burger and KFC, I joined several consumer interest groups to formally ask Bojangles’ to prohibit the routine use of antibiotics in the raising of their meat. We sent a letter on April 29th, 2016 to ask for these changes. Our collective activism has worked in the past and we hope that it will again this time. What happens next? Here’s what you can do! When we work together, we have been able to move mountains. You can join us by asking Bojangles’ to improve their practices. You are joining over 10,133 supporters to make this happen!"
https://foodbabe.com/advice-from-a-cardiologist-critical-questions-to-ask-in-the-emergency-room/,Advice from a Cardiologist: Critical Questions To Ask In The Emergency Room,0,"This guest post reminds me of the time an emergency room doctor sent me home with the advice to take some Advil, only to find out the next day, my appendix was about to burst! I am so thankful for this advice from Dr. Joel Kahn, who serves on my Advisory Council. Dr. Kahn is a practicing interpreventional cardiologist who also writes for Reader’s Digest and has taught dozens of residents and cardiologists. I am thrilled to have him as a contributor here! I do not want to burst your bubble, but the medical system is under severe stress and serious mistakes happen daily. Some of these mistakes are lethal and I do not want you to be one of them. The latest report indicates that medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States exceeded only by heart disease. During the week I wear several different hats. One is my medical career where I currently practice an aggressive brand of preventive cardiology and heart disease reversal. Another is that I am asked frequently to review records from other doctors and hospitals where patients have experienced bad outcomes, often death. I serve as an impartial medical expert. Just this week I reviewed a file of a 50-year old male smoker who went to the emergency room with 2 days of new and intermittent chest pain. He had minimal testing and was released in an hour with instructions to see his family doctor in a week. Sadly, he died of a heart attack 3 days later. This is all too common. While not all deaths can be foreseen and prevented, I have created a list of questions to ask or testing to request from your health care providers in hopes that it will prepare you for dealing with this overtaxed medical complex and protect you from heart damage. In my 30 plus years of training and practice, you are likely to have the same lab tests at an annual physical now as in the 1970s. This is not acceptable as there have been major advances in assessing your physiology by labs. I would suggest you ask for the following tests: Advanced lipid profile: Rather than a calculated LDL cholesterol level, advanced panels measure LDL particle number and size which are more predictive of future heart and stroke events. Two individuals with a calculated LDL cholesterol level of 150 mg/dl can have widely different particle and size measurements and have very different risks. Lipoprotein a: This is a genetic form of cholesterol that is elevated in about 20% of those tested. It is rarely drawn even though hundreds of research studies indicate if it is elevated, the risk of heart attack and stroke skyrocket. There is even a foundation dedicated to educating the public of the risk. In my clinic, when lipoprotein a is elevated, I work to make sure all other risks for heart and stroke are managed but I also have a protocol to lower and neutralize the effects on arteries. Homocysteine: This amino acid is produced by an important process called methylation. It is important for artery and brain health along with decreasing risk of autism and cancer. When elevated, it may be due to a genetic defect in the MTHFR gene which is also easily measured. It can be treated with methylated B complex vitamins and the level will return to normal. Inflammatory markers: The best known is hs-CRP but there are 5 others I measure in my practice. If there are markers of inflammation in the blood, a hunt is on for infections, food allergies, skin conditions like psoriasis, a diet rich in processed foods, central obesity, gingivitis, and sleep apnea among others. Inflammation can be reduced by addressing these root causes. TMAO: This is a newly described marker of heart and kidney health and rises both by meat and egg heavy diets and an altered gut microbiome. It has now been conclusively shown to cause heart and kidney damage and is associated with a worsened prognosis. It may give an impetus to transition to more plant based diets. ECG: Years ago a routine physical included an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) but this may be skipped nowadays. I suggest it for one particular reason, the measurement called the QT interval. A segment of the population has a genetic defect that causes the QT interval to be prolonged. Some people are prescribed drugs that prolong the QT interval. A long QT can result in death from a cardiac arrhythmia and a number of medications have been pulled off the market due to this risk. Knowing if you have a prolonged QT interval before you are prescribed antibiotics, antidepressants and other medications is key. More can be learned at www.sads.org. Vascular screening: Many hospitals offer a vascular screening program using ultrasounds of the carotid arteries, abdominal aorta and legs. These may cost between $50-$100 although for about twice that similar screenings are done in churches and workplaces. Although they are rarely definitive, they can offer a good value if you are a smoker or have a strong family history of early heart disease or stroke of the status of your arteries. Arteries should have no plaque so the word “mild” plaque should prompt you to have a complete evaluation by a vascular expert. Coronary artery calcium scan (CACS): A CACS is by far the most accurate way to determine if your heart arteries are silently suffering. The heart gives no warnings until the arteries are badly blocked and the first symptom you have may be the day you die. Do not wait. In my community this 1 minute CT scan costs $80, uses no dye, and takes 1 minute. It is far more accurate for screening your heart than a stress test. My book “Dead Execs Don’t Get Bonuses“ goes into detail on how this test works. Your score should be zero and anything higher should prompt you to see a preventive cardiology expert. There is a chance you or a loved one will end up in an emergency room (ER) or urgent care clinic with chest pain symptoms needing evaluation. First, do not go to an urgent care clinic with chest pain, pressure, tightness, squeezing, or compression. Go to an ER. However, the ER has pressure on them to turn over the rooms. I have reviewed dozens of charts with young people sent home with cursory evaluations only to die or be maimed by massive heart attacks within days. Tragic. Do not go home without a thorough evaluation. Second, ask for “serial” cardiac enzymes that are repeated every 4-6 hours for 2-3 times. Third, ask for a repeat ECG to compare to the one you presented with. Fourth, ask for a definitive test before discharge. This may be a treadmill stress test with echocardiography (no radiation) or nuclear imaging (radiation). In some ERs, the CACS or more likely the more advanced coronary CT angiogram may be available. If you are not severely allergic to iodine dye, this is by far the most accurate way to be sure your arteries are clean. If they are not clean, a cardiologist will have to evaluate your status but you will know the score and be alive. There are so many potential drug interactions and some of them are deadly. Some of them center on the long QT syndrome found on your ECG mentioned above. There are online resources to check your list of medications for interactions, particularly if you are prescribed a new medication. Antibiotics are particularly frequent causes of drug interactions that can be avoided with proper research online. I have focused on heart issues as they are the focus of my quarter century of practice, but these lessons are true of other conditions (e.g. a bad headache not fully evaluated in the ER). Do not be afraid to challenge, ask why, read online, and refuse to go home before proper testing is performed. My hope is that I never am sent a medical chart to review with your name on it. The best way to not be a statistic of the third most frequent cause of death in the U.S is to take excellent care of your health, have proper preventive testing, and stay out of ERs and hospitals unless very ill.

https://food.news/2024-06-05-poor-harvests-drive-surge-orange-juice-prices.html,"Poor harvests drive orange juice prices to record highs, forcing makers to explore alternative fruits",0,"Advertisement Orange juice futures have surged to a multi-decade high of $4.92 per pound this week – driven by poor harvests in Brazil and Florida. Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of orange juice, has faced unusually high temperatures and below-average rainfall this year, while Florida’s orange groves have been battered by hurricanes and a cold snap in 2022. Additionally, both regions have been afflicted by “citrus greening,” a disease that renders the fruit bitter and ultimately kills the trees. With stockpiles dwindling, juice producers are increasingly experimenting with more climate-resilient fruits, like mandarins, as reported by Tortoise Media. Human knowledge is under attack!

The rising prices of orange juice, a breakfast staple, have thrust the industry into crisis, compelling some producers to seek alternative fruit options. The situation is exacerbated by a sharp decline in production in Florida and extreme weather conditions in Brazil, the primary orange-producing region. Historically, Brazil has played a crucial role in the global orange juice market. In the 1960s, after frosts devastated Florida’s orange groves, Brazil filled the gap with its supply of frozen concentrated orange juice. (Related: Oranges are waste-free: Every part has unique health benefits.) The situation worsened in 2005 when citrus greening disease reached Miami, leading to a 55 percent decline in Florida’s orange production over the next decade. This prompted a significant price hike in orange juice, driving bottlers to opt for the more affordable Brazilian alternative. Today, Brazilian companies supply more than half of all orange juice bottled by major brands like Tropicana, with shipments originating from the Port of Santos in São Paulo. In 2017, the U.S. orange juice export market was valued at $1.4 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) – solidifying Brazil’s financial influence over American orange juice production facilities. As of this week, frozen concentrated orange juice futures on the Intercontinental Exchange in New York have reached $4.77 per pound, nearly double the price from a year ago. According to Harry Campbell, a commodity market data analyst at Mintec, the soaring prices are pushing manufacturers to adjust their blends by incorporating more affordable fruit juices, such as apple, grape and pear to reduce reliance on orange juice. “This trend appears to be long-term. Consumers may eventually resist paying a premium for orange juice, but until then, prices will continue to rise due to the low supply,” Campbell told CNBC. The ongoing supply constraints and rising costs underscore the need for the industry to diversify and adapt to changing climatic and economic conditions, ensuring sustainability and affordability in the global food and drink market. Recent findings from the research center Fundecitrus indicate that Brazil is experiencing one of its worst orange harvests in over 30 years due to excessive heat last year. In a report published on May 10, the citrus growers’ organization projected Brazil’s orange production for the 2024-2025 season to be 232.4 million boxes, each weighing around 40.8 kilograms. This marks a 24 percent decrease from the previous cycle. Typically, Brazil produces about 300 million boxes of oranges per cycle. However, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have significantly impacted crop yields. According to Fundecitrus, a series of intense heatwaves between September and November last year disrupted the crucial flowering and early fruit formation stages, severely reducing production. Additionally, citrus greening, a disease with no known cure that results in bitter and stunted fruit, continues to pose a major challenge for orange farmers worldwide. “Orange juice prices are rising due to the three Ds: drought, disease and demand,” explained Dave Reiter, a trader with Reiter Capital Investments LLC, in an email to CNBC. While many associate orange juice production with Florida and California, Brazil is the largest producer of both oranges and orange juice. The majority of Brazil’s orange juice production takes place in São Paulo and Minas Gerais, regions that have been grappling with weather problems and disease for several years. Reiter noted that the benchmark orange juice futures contract is a thinly traded market, which can lead to significant volatility. He predicted that the next target price for orange juice could reach $5.16 per pound. As changes in climate and extreme weather continues to disrupt traditional agricultural practices, the orange juice industry faces mounting challenges. The combination of drought, disease and rising demand underscores the need for adaptation and innovation to ensure the sustainability and affordability of this popular beverage.

https://food.news/2024-05-17-ditch-harmful-vegetable-oils-for-these-substitutes.html,Ditch harmful VEGETABLE OILS for these healthy substitutes,0,"Advertisement Industrial seed and vegetable oils are harmful to your health, and these products are long entrenched in the market. However, there are substitutes you can use to replace these harmful oils in your cooking. But how exactly do industrial seed and vegetable oils undermine your health? According to a study published in the journal Open Heart, the linoleic acid in vegetable oil is the culprit as it easily oxidizes and turns into oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OXLAMS). These OXLAMS induce atherosclerosis and heart disease, so it follows that reducing vegetable oil consumption would also reduce the amount of OXLAMS being formed.

Every purchase at HealthRangerStore.com helps fund our efforts to build and share more tools for empowering humanity with knowledge and abundance. But there’s no need to fret, as registered nutritionist Kerry Torrens shares several alternatives to seed and vegetable oils that offer extra health benefits for you and your family. Pressed from the fruit of the avocado tree, this oil is often likened to olive oil. It is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), especially oleic acid, which increases the oil’s stability at high temperatures. A study published 2019 in the journal Molecules stated that almost 70 percent of avocado oil consists of heart-healthy oleic acid, a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid. The high smoke point of both refined and unrefined avocado oil makes it ideal for cooking. Its subtle flavor also allows other ingredients in your recipe to shine through. Olive oil is made from the juice of the olive fruit and is known for its many health benefits from protecting you against heart disease to reducing your risk of developing Type-2 diabetes. Oleic oil, the predominant MUFA found in olive oil, is thought to be 50 times less likely to oxidize than linoleic acid – the predominant polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) found in vegetable oils, like corn oil and sunflower oil. Virgin olive oil is a good cooking oil for temperatures between 356 F and 374 F. Aside from imparting a unique flavor to your dishes, virgin olive oil contains antioxidants such as vitamin E and more. However, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is reported to have the lowest oxidation rate of any cooking oil. EVOO is made from pure, cold-pressed olives and is an ideal choice when cooking at home – but be wary of overheating it as it has a low smoking point. Butter has been part of the human diet since the agricultural ages after the domestication of mammals. It is obtained from churning milk or cream, and was first prepared from sheep’s milk. Nowadays, organic butter is made using milk from grass-fed cows. Butter contains a variety of fat-soluble nutrients such as vitamins K2, A, D and E. It serves as the perfect carrier for these vitamins as it provides the fat necessary for their absorption. Butter also contains butyric acid that can inhibit the growth of tumors in the breast, according to a study published in the Journal of Dairy Science. Commonly used in Indian cooking, ghee is made by simmering butter until the moisture evaporates and removing the milk solids until a clear golden oil is left. The low moisture and high saturated fat content gives ghee a high smoke point and long shelf life. It is also devoid of lactose and casein, making ghee a suitable option for those with lactose intolerance or milk allergy. A study by researchers from Universiti Putra Malaysia examined ghee and vegetable oils when exposed at a temperature of 356 F. It found that ghee creates fewer damaging acrylamides compared to vegetable oils. Acrylamides are chemicals that form when starchy foods such as potatoes and bread are cooked at temperatures above 248 F. Lard is made by rendering – boiling, steaming or using dry heat – pork fat from the rest of the animal tissue. It does not oxidize at high temperatures and has a remarkably high smoke point of 375 F. Contrary to claims that pork lard is unhealthy due, it contains the second-highest amount of MUFAs at 48 percent – only olive oil has more at 77 percent. This helps lower blood cholesterol levels and maintain healthy cells. Lard is also a great source of choline, a nutrient your brain and nervous system need to regulate memory, mood, muscle control and other functions. Lard contains anywhere from 102 to 399 milligrams per cup, depending on how the pig was raised. Lard rendered from organic, pasture-raised pigs will likely contain significantly more choline than those raised in the conventional manner. Whereas lard is made from pork, tallow is made from suet (beef fat) that has been clarified and rendered. It boasts of a high smoke point of 400 F, making it an excellent choice for frying, sauteing and searing meats. Since it’s from beef, tallow adds more flavor to your dishes. (Related: The decades-long saturated fat SCAM to push toxic vegetable oils… here’s why you should be eating tallow instead of canola.) Both tallow and suet are rich in fat-soluble nutrients such as vitamins A, B1, D, E and K. They are also healthier and stable alternatives to industrially-processed seed and vegetable oils that cause inflammation."
https://food.news/2024-05-16-replace-ultra-processed-foods-with-healthy-alternatives.html,Replace ultra-processed foods with these HEALTHY alternatives,0,"Advertisement In a world where convenience often trumps nutritional value, making healthy food choices can sometimes feel like a daunting task. However, small changes in dietary habits can yield significant benefits for overall well-being. One effective strategy is to swap out ultra-processed foods (UPFs) – those laden with additives, preservatives, and refined ingredients – for healthy alternatives. The rise of UPFs in modern diets has been linked to various health concerns, including obesity, heart disease and metabolic disorders. Fortunately, making healthier food choices doesn’t have to be complicated or restrictive. By replacing ultra-processed options with nutrient-dense alternatives, you can enhance nutritional intake and promote better health outcomes. Human knowledge is under attack!

When choosing snacks, try substituting sugary options such as candy with healthier alternatives like dried fruit or dark chocolate. While indulging in occasional sweets is fine, frequent consumption of sugary foods can heighten the risk of health issues such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. Explore a variety of nutritious snack choices such as dried fruits, fresh fruits like bananas and strawberries dipped in antioxidant-packed dark chocolate or homemade energy balls to fulfill your sweet tooth cravings. For more snack inspiration, check out this list of 28 healthy snack ideas suitable for both you and your children. Instead of your customary soda, consider opting for coffee, infused sparkling water, kombucha or green tea. While the temporary energy surge from sodas and other sugary drinks may be appealing, the long-term consumption of soda is associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. On the other hand, coffee, kombucha and tea provide a caffeine boost without the added sugar. Additionally, they are rich in antioxidants, which may help reduce cholesterol levels and safeguard against heart disease and stroke. However, it’s important not to consume excessive amounts. Too much caffeine can potentially lead to stomach discomfort or jitteriness. If you’re pregnant, it’s advisable to consult your doctor before consuming caffeine. Additionally, be mindful of what you add to your tea or coffee, as excessive sugar and cream can negate their health benefits. Enhance the flavor with citrus slices or spices such as cinnamon or mint, but do so in moderation. Instead of relying on store-bought coffee creamers, which often contain unhealthy additives like high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), consider crafting your own creamer. HCFS has been associated with various adverse health outcomes, including diabetes, insulin resistance, liver issues, obesity and weight gain. (Related: Overconsumption of high fructose corn syrup-rich foods causes health problems. addiction.) For a dairy-free and healthier alternative, you will need Combine all the ingredients in a glass bottle or mason jar, then shake thoroughly. Store the mixture in the refrigerator for up to one week, or freeze it in ice cube trays for longer-term use. For added flavor, you can also incorporate a sprinkle of cinnamon or a pinch of pumpkin pie spice. Remember to shake well before each use. Potato or corn chips often contains excessive salt and potentially unhealthy saturated or trans fats, increasing the risk of heart disease. Consider these alternatives instead of indulging in these. (Related: Studies show ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS put millions of people in the U.K. at risk of cardiovascular disease.) Nuts offer a delightful salty indulgence now and then. Cashews, walnuts and almonds provide a dose of heart-healthy unsaturated fats. Moreover, they boast satisfying protein and fiber, along with essential vitamins and minerals. Keep in mind, though, that nuts are calorie-dense, so stick to moderate one-ounce servings. Popcorn isn’t just a favorite among movie buffs; it’s also a high-fiber whole grain that satiates hunger with fewer calories compared to chips. Additionally, popcorn contains antioxidants that may reduce the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. For a healthier option, prepare popcorn using an air popper or with a heart-friendly oil, omitting the butter and using salt sparingly. Avoid the temptation of theater popcorn, which often packs a hefty load of calories, fat, and sodium. Alternatively, consider indulging in homemade snacks such as baked potato chips, beet or kale chips and roasted chickpeas. These options are rich in fiber and magnesium, a vital mineral essential for regulating blood sugar levels and supporting nerve function. Instead of indulging in ice cream, consider Greek yogurt paired with fresh fruit. Ice cream tends to be loaded with fat, sugar, and calories. Just a half-cup serving of vanilla ice cream, devoid of any additional toppings, can pack 140 calories and 14 grams of sugar. In contrast, the same portion of nonfat Greek yogurt, boasting a creamier and thicker texture than regular yogurt, contains a mere 73 calories and significantly less sugar. Additionally, Greek yogurt provides ample amounts of calcium, magnesium, protein, and vitamin B12. Enhance the flavor and nutritional value by adding a variety of berries, sliced bananas or other fruits. This combination not only adds natural sweetness but also contributes to a lower risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, thanks to the synergistic benefits of fruit and yogurt. While baked goods from bakeries may tempt the taste buds, they often harbor excessive amounts of sugar and refined white flour, devoid of fiber. Furthermore, they may contain butter or hydrogenated oils, laden with heart-harming saturated or trans fats. Choose a square of dark chocolate over cookies or cake. Dark chocolate, with its higher cocoa solid content compared to milk chocolate, offers a delectable alternative. Enjoying a square or two a few times per week may lower the risk of chest pain, heart attack, or stroke. Instead of opting for fatty cuts of beef, consider the following alternatives: Mixed lentils and mushrooms offer a plant-based alternative reminiscent of ground beef when cooked. Mushrooms contribute a meaty flavor and texture, while lentils provide a hearty base. When combined and seasoned well, they create a meatless sloppy joe that rivals traditional burgers. This option is particularly suitable for vegans seeking alternatives to meat and fish in their diets. Seafood provides a delightful alternative to steaks and burgers typically loaded with saturated fat, which can elevate cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease. Fish varieties such as salmon or tuna boast high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, known to lower “bad fats” in the bloodstream and prevent plaque buildup in arteries. Grilled shellfish, including crab and lobster, offer another flavorful option rich in protein and essential minerals. Instead of reaching for that bowl of sugary cereal, a breakfast staple for many, consider opting for alternatives, like high-fiber, high-protein oatmeal (ideally minimally processed steel-cut oats available in shelf-stable packaging from supermarkets and online retailers), chia pudding or plain Greek yogurt parfait topped with fresh or freeze-dried berries, crushed almonds, and unsweetened coconut flakes. Sugary cereals, often targeted towards children, are frequently laden with artificial food dyes, such as red dye 40, and high fructose corn syrup, both of which have been linked to behavioral issues in children. Instead of your typical sandwich staple, consider opting for more nutritious whole-grain bread, tortillas or wraps. This straightforward substitution replaces your less nutritious white bread with wholesome whole grains. When selecting bread, look for the “100 percent whole grain” label to ensure maximum nutritional benefit. Consider exploring a nutritious bread option, such as Ezekiel bread, which is crafted from whole grains and legumes, devoid of refined flour or sugar. The sprouting process involved in its creation might enhance the accessibility of specific nutrients. Furthermore, you have a variety of delicious, grain-free alternatives to choose from, such as nutrient-rich portobello mushroom caps, sweet potato toast, and wraps made from Swiss chard or lettuce. Refined grains, such as white flour, are deficient in essential nutrients, like fiber, B vitamins, iron and magnesium. In contrast, whole grains are rich in fiber, which aids in reducing cholesterol levels and lowering the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes. Additionally, the fiber content promotes satiety – assisting in weight management efforts. Check out StopEatingPoison.com for more stories like this.

https://food.news/2024-05-13-report-certain-foods-high-risk-pesticide-contamination.html,Consumer Reports reveals certain food items carry high risk of PESTICIDE contamination,0,"Advertisement Consumer Reports (CR) has unveiled alarming findings indicating that one out of every five tested foods available in the United States carries a high risk of pesticide contamination. The report, released on April 18, highlighted the presence of banned pesticides in certain foods, with green peas being cited as an example. To assess the current state of affairs, CR conducted its most extensive review yet on pesticide levels in food. The analysis, based on seven years of data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), scrutinized a variety of produce – both conventional and organically grown, domestically or imported to the United States. The study encompassed 59 common fruits and vegetables, examining not only fresh varieties but also canned, dried or frozen alternatives. Human knowledge is under attack! Governments and powerful corporations are using censorship to wipe out humanity's knowledge base about nutrition, herbs, self-reliance, natural immunity, food production, preparedness and much more.

Support our efforts to build the infrastructure of human freedom by shopping at HealthRangerStore.com, featuring lab-tested, certified organic, non-GMO foods and nutritional solutions. Pesticide contamination posed significant risks in 20 percent of the foods surveyed, including popular choices like bell peppers, blueberries, green beans, potatoes and strawberries. Notably, green beans were found to contain residues of a pesticide banned for use on the vegetable in the U.S. for over a decade. Imported produce, particularly from Mexico, showed a higher likelihood of carrying hazardous levels of pesticide residues. Dr. James E. Rogers, CR’s director of food safety research, expressed concern over the recurring pattern observed. He described it as a case of progress followed by setbacks in pesticide regulation. According to Rogers, this concentrated risk facilitates targeted solutions, albeit requiring concerted efforts and time to prompt regulatory adjustments by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which is responsible for overseeing pesticide use in agriculture. Despite the concerning findings, the report also offered some reassurance. Nearly two-thirds of the foods tested, including the majority of organic options, exhibited minimal pesticide risks. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the greatest threats stemmed from a select few pesticides, primarily affecting specific foods cultivated on a small portion of U.S. farmland. Decades of research underscore a clear correlation between pesticide use and long-term adverse health effects in humans. Studies reveal a range of detrimental impacts across various bodily systems: Cancer risk Certain pesticides, including organochlorines, creosote and sulfamate, were identified as carcinogenic, while others, like DDT, chlordane and lindane were implicated in tumor growth. Arsenic, present in many pesticides, was also recognized as a human carcinogen. Research published in Cancer Causes and Control, Environmental Health Perspectives and Reviews on Environmental Health suggested an increased risk of liver cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancers associated with pesticide exposure. Respiratory issues Individuals regularly exposed to pesticides, particularly through occupational use, face elevated risks of respiratory ailments, such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and impaired lung function. Studies also suggest a potential link between pesticide exposure and lung cancer. Kidney damage Investigations into chronic kidney disease reveal a positive association with pesticide exposure in a majority of studies, although conclusive findings are hindered by confounding factors and limited lifetime exposure assessments. Neurological effects Pesticides exert toxic effects on the nervous system, leading to cognitive decline and potentially increasing the risk of Parkinson’s disease. Research from the University of Guelph suggested a significant risk increase for Parkinson’s disease following exposure to specific pesticides. Birth defects High pesticide exposure, as indicated by a study in Nature Communications, correlated with elevated rates of birth defects – emphasizing the severe consequences of such exposure during pregnancy. Endocrine disruption Pesticides act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, interfering with hormonal function and posing risks to sexual and reproductive health. Studies highlighted associations with childhood cancers, fetal death, infertility and low birth weight. (Related: Pesticide linked to reproductive issues found in popular oat-based breakfast cereals.) Autism risk Research published in BMJ suggested a heightened risk of autism spectrum disorders associated with prenatal pesticide exposure. Proximity to pesticide-treated fields during pregnancy is linked to increased autism risk and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The ramifications of pesticide use extend beyond human health, profoundly impacting the environment in more ways than one: Threat to pollinators Pesticides pose a significant threat to vital pollinators like honey bees, disrupting their ability to collect pollen and negatively affecting their population. Chemicals, such as neonicotinoids – recognized for their toxicity to insect brains – are particularly harmful. Additionally, fungicides can disrupt bee gut bacteria and impede nutrient absorption from pollen. Disruption of ecosystems Excessive pesticide application leads to displacement of aquatic life, habitat destruction and insect mortality. Certain chemicals can render vegetation toxic to wildlife – disrupting the food chain and essential ecosystems. Soil degradation Pesticides degrade soil quality – diminishing essential nutrients, like nitrogen and potassium. This degradation not only affects soil-dwelling organisms, such as earthworms, frogs, snails and snakes but also compromises crop sustainability and reduces the nutritional value of food grown in contaminated soil. Water contamination Pesticides persist in the environment – contaminating water sources through erosion, leaching, microbial assimilation, plant absorption and runoff. This contamination poses risks to aquatic life and human health. Risks to farm workers Despite evidence suggesting the toxicity of even minimal pesticide exposure to humans, farm workers face significant health risks due to their regular and direct contact with these chemicals. The lack of routine health monitoring by regulatory agencies leaves farm workers vulnerable to higher exposure levels. Moreover, residues carried home on clothing and footwear inadvertently expose families to harmful chemicals. Recent evidence underscores the detrimental health effects of even minimal chemical exposure, with approximately 90 percent of Americans harboring pesticides in their bodies. Environmental Working Group (EWG) tests reveal that around 70 percent of U.S. produce contains pesticide residues. To reduce exposure to pesticides, experts recommend the following strategies: Opt for organic Choose organically grown foods or consider cultivating your own produce. Organic options, indicated by the USDA Organic seal, are cultivated without synthetic pesticides. While organic produce may still contain some pesticides, the use of synthetic chemicals is significantly lower compared to conventional farming practices. (Related: Avoid harmful chemicals like glyphosate in food by ALWAYS choosing ORGANIC.) Mind the Dirty Dozen Refer to the Environmental Working Group’s annual list of the “Dirty Dozen” and “Clean 15” to prioritize organic purchases. Items on the Dirty Dozen, such as spinach and strawberries, are known to contain higher pesticide residues and may warrant organic sourcing. Thoroughly wash produce Employ effective washing techniques to remove surface pesticide residues. Solutions, such as a 10 percent salt-water solution, full-strength vinegar or a baking soda-water mixture can help reduce surface chemicals. While washing may not eliminate pesticides absorbed into the produce, it can mitigate surface contamination. Limit non-organic animal products Reduce consumption of non-organic meat and dairy products, which may harbor pesticide residues from animal exposure to contaminated environments and feed. Studies have detected various pesticides in dairy products, highlighting the potential for environmental contamination. Install home water filtration Address potential pesticide contamination in drinking water by installing a home water filtration system. Such systems can effectively remove unwanted substances, enhancing water safety. Explore natural pest control methods Consider natural alternatives to chemical pesticides for gardening purposes. Homemade pesticides, beneficial insects and companion planting techniques can help manage pests without harming the environment. Visit Pesticides.news for related stories.

https://food.news/2024-04-25-turmeric-and-black-pepper-a-powerful-combination.html,Dynamic duo: Why TURMERIC and BLACK PEPPER are a powerful combination,0,"Advertisement Turmeric and black pepper are noteworthy for their stand-alone health benefits. But when combined, this dynamic duo becomes a powerhouse of healing. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) has substantial amounts of the plant compound curcumin. This phytochemical is a strong antioxidant that also boasts of being able to fight inflammation, bacteria and fungi. But this bright yellow spice has one drawback – the body cannot absorb it well, with most amounts of curcumin being eliminated. Meanwhile, black pepper (Piper nigrum) is rich in piperine, a bioactive compound that gives this spice its signature pungency. Piperine is similar to the alkaloid capsaicin, which is present in chili powder and cayenne pepper. This phytochemical has been shown to help address nausea, headaches, poor digestion and inflammation.

Every purchase at HealthRangerStore.com helps fund our efforts to build and share more tools for empowering humanity with knowledge and abundance. But piperine’s most notable quality lies in its ability to enhance the body’s absorption of curcumin. Adding black pepper to turmeric can mitigate the poor absorption of curcumin into the bloodstream. According to research, supplementing C. longa with P. nigrum significantly improves the body’s curcumin uptake by a huge degree. A study published in the Planta Medica journal expounded on this. Researchers from India examined how curcumin alone and piperine-curcumin in tandem was absorbed in both animal and human models. According to the study, adding 20 milligrams of piperine to two grams of curcumin notably increased the latter’s absorption. In rats given both piperine and curcumin, the bioavailability of the latter increased by as much as 154 percent. Meanwhile, the bioavailability of curcumin in human participants increased by 2,000 percent when supplemented with piperine. There are two prevailing theories explaining this phenomenon, as outlined by two separate studies. The first theory was outlined in a study published in the Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine. According to the paper, piperine may facilitate the passage of curcumin through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream. Meanwhile, a February 1986 study in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics suggested that piperine might inhibit the liver’s breakdown of curcumin. This, in turn, elevates the amount of curcumin entering the bloodstream, translating to health benefits. Here are some examples of how you can combine turmeric and black pepper: It’s important to note that while turmeric and black pepper have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties, individual responses may vary. It’s always a good idea to consult with a natural health practitioner before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.

https://food.news/2024-04-22-mighty-blueberry-superfruit-with-anticancer-properties.html,"The mighty BLUEBERRY, a superfruit with anticancer properties",0,"Advertisement In a study published in Pathology Oncology Research, academic pathologist Dr. Yujiang Fang and a team of University of Missouri researchers found that blueberry fruit extracts can greatly improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy on cancer cells. Long known for their antioxidant properties, blueberries have exhibited “inherent abilities to prevent carcinogenesis, inhibit the proliferation of neoplastic cells, and reduce the risk of recurrence in patients in remission.” The study noted that when the researchers reduced the dosage of radiation, the killing effect of blueberry phytochemicals on cancer was even enhanced. “That is because a chemical in the fruit called resveratrol acts as a radiosensitizer,” explained Fang.

He added that as a radiosensitizer, resveratrol “suppresses initiation, promotion and progression of carcinogenesis while reducing the expression of vascular endothelial growth, as well as promoting nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity” – improves cardiac health and healing processes and respiratory response; enhances performance during exercise; and reduces high blood pressure during pregnancy, as well as erectile dysfunction. This also means that even with less radiation, doctors can reduce the side effects of chemotherapy on healthy cells. Using cervical cancer cells in the lab, the researchers found that radiation reduced the number of cancer cells by 20 percent, while over the same period, blueberry extract decreased the number of cancer cells by 25 percent. The synergistic effect of both radiation and blueberry extract decreased the number of cancer cells by a whopping 70 percent – and additionally reduced the growth of new cancer cells. (Related: Blueberries are more effective at killing cancer than radiotherapy.) An earlier study published in the Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE B found blueberries to have the strongest natural total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and the highest total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and total anthocyanidin content (TAC) values when compared with blackberries and strawberries. These superfruits are a formidable line of defense against cancer – loaded with bioactive compounds, some of which have demonstrated the capacity to halt cancer cell proliferation and increase cell death or apoptosis. Extracts from these superfoods contain important nutrients, such as fiber, vitamin C and manganese, and bioactive compounds that have been scientifically proven to offer a lot of health benefits, such as: Studies show that when you eat blueberries every day, you can enjoy the following health benefits: Numerous research have associated the flavonoids in blueberries with improved learning and general cognitive function and memory, including decision-making, numerical ability, reasoning skills and verbal comprehension. A study published in Molecular Nutrition & Food Research found that blueberries can support gut health by improving intestinal morphology (the main indicator of intestinal development, functionality and health); modulating the composition and function of gut microbes; reducing gut permeability; remediating gut inflammation; and suppressing oxidative stress. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants, particularly anthocyanins, as well as vitamins C and E, that are known to protect eyesight and slow the progression of macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. The vitamin C in blueberries, paired with anthocyanins, supports collagen production and skin elasticity and protects your skin from free radical damage, reducing signs of aging. According to physiotherapist and top trainer Jeff Cavaliere, vitamin C, potassium and flavonoids like the anthocyanins in blueberries can enhance blood flow and reduce muscle inflammation, especially after a particularly intense workout. Blueberries also contain complex carbohydrates, which can help your body quickly replenish its energy levels and mend any microdamage done by heavy exercise to your muscles. A study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that the bioactive compounds in blueberries can improve insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant and obese men and women. Blueberries are notably high in fiber, low in carbohydrates and lower in sugar than other types of fruit. Research also suggests that blueberries can help your body process glucose more efficiently by helping improve your insulin sensitivity. Doing so helps you keep your blood sugar levels under control. Blueberries are loaded with vitamins and minerals that aid in maintaining bone strength, such as calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, zinc and vitamin K. A study published in Antioxidants found that blueberries increase the proliferation of human bone marrow cells that are responsible for bone formation. A study published in Molecular Nutrition & Food Research also suggests that increased doses of blueberry polyphenols could induce changes in the intestinal phenolic metabolism and increase calcium absorption in your bones – the main storage site of calcium, which helps your cells, muscles and nerves function normally.

https://food.news/2024-04-19-food-storage-containers-wheat-berries-optimal-shelf-life.html,Food storage: Containers for storing wheat berries for optimal shelf life,0,"Advertisement Biologically speaking, the wheat berry, also known as the “kernel,” is the seed from which a wheat plant grows. They are a powerful survival food that, if stored properly, can last for years in your stockpile. Wheat seeds or wheat berries are true whole grains that will keep you healthy. They are a great source of complex carbohydrates, fiber, healthy fats, protein, phytochemicals, minerals and vitamins A, B, C, E and K. Wheat berries are thick, short grains that look similar to brown rice. Industrious preppers grind them into whole wheat flour for baking – not purchasing them in bulk in the form of flour.

Every purchase at HealthRangerStore.com helps fund our efforts to build and share more tools for empowering humanity with knowledge and abundance. When boiled, cooked wheat berries have a chewy, subtly nutty and earthy flavor. They’re sturdy enough to handle bold salad dressings and still delicate enough to taste delicious with some cinnamon, honey and milk. If you like sprouts in salads and sandwiches, just add a little water to wheat berries and you can grow your own wheat sprouts. Here’s a list of good containers for packaging and storing wheat berries to keep them in your stockpile for years. (Related: 4 Best food storage containers for your stockpile.) The can creates a time capsule that protects the wheat berries from oxygen, moisture, rodents and light. The size of these small cans is perfect for individuals or smaller families to ensure only a small amount of product is open at a time. If you properly store your wheat berries in #10 cans, you can expect them to survive on your shelf for up to 30 years and possibly more. Protect cans from moisture to prevent rust. Do not store in direct contact with concrete floors or walls. Except for sugar, all dry foods stored in #10 cans should be packed with an oxygen absorber to prevent insect infestation and preserve the quality of food. Mylar bags provide a good moisture and oxygen barrier to protect the wheat during storage. However, they are more fragile than #10 cans and should be handled carefully. If wheat berries are properly stored in mylar bags that are airtight and do not have pockets of air left inside them – a tricky process that may take several tries to perfect – then the food inside is effectively frozen in time and can last for a long time. Extend the shelf life of wheat berries and protect them from insects by placing a 300 cc oxygen absorber in a one-gallon Mylar bag. You can expect a 25-year shelf life for wheat berries stored in a Mylar bag in a cool, dry, dark location protected from rodents. Mylar bags do have a problem in that they do not stack well in storage spaces because they leave a lot of empty space when placed in containers. The best way to save space using a Mylar bag is to use the large five-gallon bags inside a rodent-resistant container, such as a food-grade plastic bucket. Use your Mylar bag to line a five-gallon food-grade bucket before filling it and adding your oxygen absorbers. Fill the bag up to about one inch below the rim of your bucket. Rest your level, or another length of wood, across the top of your bucket, as close to the center as possible. For 5-gallon bags you should use five to seven 300cc oxygen absorbers or one 2,000cc oxygen absorber. You should adjust this number up a little bit if you are storing less dense foods like pasta or lentils because the bags will contain more air even when full in comparison to very dense foods, such as rice or wheat berries. The plastic bucket gives shape to the Mylar bag and protects it from rodents. The Mylar bag provides a better moisture and oxygen barrier than the bucket does alone. Then secure the lid on the plastic bucket. Be sure to label both the Mylar bag and the plastic bucket with a permanent marker and include the date and description of the contents. If you want to place all your wheat berries in one large container, a food-grade plastic bucket with gasket seals is a good candidate for storing your grain. They are an inexpensive option to store large amounts of dry food products and are available in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Never use a plastic bucket that has stored non-food items, or is not made of food-grade plastic, for your food storage. Re-purposed plastic buckets may come with some lingering odors. While not harmful, it is possible for the food to absorb the odor. You can store individually packaged items, such as bags of baking powder, baking soda, pasta, powdered sugar, salt and a variety of other items in their original packaging inside the plastic buckets. The bucket provides an extra layer of protection from critters, protects packaging from absorbing moisture in the storage room and helps to maintain freshness. It does not prevent insects originally inside the packages from multiplying. However, it will contain the infestation and not allow it to spread to other stored foods.

Fortunately, there are natural cancer-fighting solutions that you can use against the Big C. Allspice (Pimenta dioica) is made from the unripe berries of the P. dioica tree that are dried and ground. It is called by many names including Jamaican pepper, kurundu, myrtle pepper, pimenta and new spice. The P. dioica tree is cultivated in many warm areas throughout the world, with its essential oil also commercially available.

According to research, allspice possesses antimicrobial and antioxidant properties thanks to its abundance of bioactive agents that contribute to health promotion. It can address inflammation, pain and fever thanks to these same plant compounds. Allspice is also known to possess cancer- and tumor-fighting properties due to three compounds in particular. The plant compounds eugenol, ericifolin and quercetin present in allspice are the ones responsible for its anticancer effects. Black walnut (Juglans nigra) contains the plant compounds quercetin 3-beta-D-glucoside and penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose. These two chemicals part of the 16 compounds present in J. nigra kernel were the center of a paper published October 2020 in Molecules. The study authors pointed out that the two compounds prevented two kinds of cancer cells from multiplying. However, they suggested that the antioxidant activity is likely driven not only by these two phenolic compounds, but also by a combination of its other compounds. These compounds exerted antioxidant activities that were significantly higher compared to the vitamin E analog Trolox that was used as a control for the study. Despite its reputation as a poisonous plant, bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis) possesses cancer-fighting properties. One study published in October 2020 in the International Journal of Dermatology focused on the cancer-fighting ability of sanguinarine, a plant compound found in the roots of S. canadensis. The October 2020 study found that sanguinarine, in a dose-dependent manner, is effective on certain kinds of skin cancer. The plant compound blocks proliferation of cancer cells and induced apoptosis (cell death) a number of different transformed and malignant cell types. Meanwhile, The Truth About Cancer disclosed that sanguinarine can trigger apoptosis via three mechanisms, citing a study published May 2016 in Free Radical Biology and Medicine. According to the study, sanguinarine activates caspase (an enzyme that helps to break down proteins and other molecules), prompts DNA fragmentation and down-regulates anti-apoptotic proteins in laboratory leukemia cells. Parsley (Petroselinum crispum) is often dismissed as a mere garnish in the kitchen. However, this mere garnish possesses powerful anti-cancer compounds such as apigenin, which prevents the formation of blood vessels that carry nutrients to cancerous tumors. It also contains 8-methoxypsoralen, a plant compound shown to inhibit the development of carcinogen-induced lung cancer in laboratory mice. A major Italian population study involving more than 2,500 women with breast cancer found that the risk of breast cancer was reduced by increasing their parsley intake. The reason for this lowered breast cancer risk was the plant compounds present in P. crispum. (Related: The unassuming parsley has many healing properties, including the ability to fight cancer.)

https://food.news/2024-04-01-healthiest-salts-contain-more-nutrients-less-sodium.html,The healthiest kinds of salt contain more nutrients and less sodium,0,"Advertisement Salt, or sodium chloride, is a mineral compound that is required to survive. It is an essential nutrient your body needs for various physiological processes, including aiding the balance and stability of electrolytes and fluids, carrying and absorbing nutrients into cells, maintaining cell plasma volume, regulating acid-base balance and supporting a healthy nervous system. Most that has been said about salt is usually just to eat less of it, but is that always the best advice? Not getting enough salt in your body may cause health issues, too, such as dehydration, elevated levels of bad cholesterol and triglycerides, increased risk of death from heart failure, insulin resistance and others.

Some kinds of salt are marketed as healthier than others – in terms of nutrient and sodium level contents – depending primarily on where they were sourced and if or how they were processed. Himalayan pink salt Also referred to as “sendha namak” or “saindhava lavana,” all-natural Himalayan pink salt is almost exclusively harvested from the salt range in the Punjab region of Pakistan, near the foothills of the Himalayas – present for millions of years in its naturally crystalline form without being spoiled or polluted. Believed to be the purest of all kinds of salts and widely recognized as nutritionally superior to other salts, Himalayan pink salt contains a unique combination of up to 84 minerals (including calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and sodium) and trace elements (including chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium and zinc) at varying safe levels. In addition, its overall sodium content is lower when compared to other kinds of salt used for human consumption. (Related: Not all salts are equal: 20 Ways to use Himalayan salt – the purest salt on Earth.) Sea salt As the name suggests, sea salt is what’s left after evaporating seawater or water from salt lakes and contains essential minerals, like potassium, and trace elements like naturally occurring iodine, iron and zinc, which are beneficial. However, because of rising pollution in the lakes and oceans, unrefined sea salt may contain high amounts of arsenic, lead, mercury and other heavy metals, as well as micro- and nano-plastics that have found their way into sea salt – posing a grave threat to human food safety and health. Health authorities and organizations, like the American Heart Association, have pegged the ideal limit of daily salt intake to one to two teaspoons of salt per day. However, this can increase your body’s need for sodium depending on your activity level. If you sweat a lot, you need to replenish lost sodium and chloride through your diet. Ultimately, moderation and mindful salt consumption are keys to maintaining a healthy sodium intake. Note that the mineral content for different types of salt available in the market is considered “insignificant” because you can often get the essential minerals your body needs by simply eating healthily and choosing nutritious, whole foods. Here are ways you can reduce sodium in your diet. Visit Health.news for more stories like this.

From its rich history to its modern-day applications in health and cuisine, the orange fruit continues to shine as a symbol of vitality and nourishment. Oranges are instantly recognizable by their bright orange hue, though some varieties, like the blood orange, may have a deep red or maroon interior. The fruit is typically spherical with a slightly flattened shape, and its skin is textured with tiny pores that release aromatic oils when pressed. The flesh is segmented, juicy and encased in a thin, white pith that is rich in bioflavonoids. The taste of an orange is a harmonious blend of sweetness and tanginess, making it a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes. Sweet orange is believed to have originated in Southeast Asia, specifically in the region encompassing southern China and northeastern India.

Commonly referred to as the European olive, this ancient superfood is celebrated not only for its rich flavor but also for its impressive nutritional profile and health benefits. From its vibrant hues to its storied history, the olive is a cornerstone of Mediterranean cuisine and a powerhouse of wellness. Olives are small, oval-shaped fruits that grow on olive trees and can live for hundreds of years. They come in a variety of colors, ranging from deep green to rich purple and black, depending on their ripeness. Green olives are harvested before they fully ripen, while black olives are left to mature on the tree. The texture of olives is firm yet tender, with a smooth, glossy skin. The taste of olives is complex and varies depending on their preparation. Fresh olives are naturally bitter due to a compound called oleuropein, which is why they are typically cured or brined before consumption. The taste of cured olives can range from tangy and salty to buttery and mild, making them a versatile ingredient in countless dishes. The olive tree is one of the oldest cultivated plants in the world, with its origins tracing back to the Mediterranean region over 6,000 years ago. Archaeological evidence suggests that olives were first domesticated in the Levant, an area that includes modern-day Israel, Palestine and Syria. The ancient Greeks and Romans later spread olive cultivation throughout the Mediterranean, where it became a symbol of prosperity and health. (Related: Calabash nutmeg: A hidden gem of African superfoods.) Today, olives are grown in regions with Mediterranean climates, including Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey and California. Spain is the largest producer of olives globally, contributing to the vast array of olive varieties available worldwide.

https://food.news/2025-03-01-organic-coffee-gardening-tips-for-spring-enthusiasts.html,Organic coffee gardening tips for spring enthusiasts,0,"Advertisement Spring is here and if you’re a coffee lover and a home gardener, you’re in for a treat. That morning cup of organic coffee doesn’t just support good health, it’s also a secret weapon for your garden. And the best part? You can reuse your coffee grounds to give your garden a nutrient-rich kickstart this season. (h/t to GardenDesign.com) Before you get coffee grounds, you first need to drink coffee. And there are several benefits to incorporating organic coffee into a balanced diet. Coffee is loaded with antioxidants — over 100 polyphenols, according to studies — that help protect your body from oxidative stress. This stress, caused by free radicals, can lead to chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes and even neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. Phenolic acids, the most abundant antioxidants in coffee, are particularly powerful in fighting free radicals. Flavonoids, another group of antioxidants, help support cellular health. But here’s the kicker: Caffeine, the star of your morning routine, also has antioxidant properties that can support good overall health. So while you’re sipping your organic brew, you’re not just waking up — you’re doing your body a favor. And once you’re done with that cup, don’t toss the grounds. They’re a treasure trove of nutrients for your garden. Used coffee grounds are a fantastic, eco-friendly way to boost your garden’s health. They’re rich in nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium and copper, all of which plants need to thrive. If you don’t drink coffee, you can still get used coffee grounds for free: Just ask your local coffee shop for their used grounds and help reduce waste. Here’s how you can put them to work in your spring garden: For compost Coffee grounds are great for composting. They’re considered “green” material, meaning they’re rich in nitrogen, which helps break down organic matter. Mix your used grounds with “brown” materials like dried leaves, wood chips or straw in a 3:1 ratio (brown to green). This combo creates a nutrient-rich compost that improves soil structure and feeds your plants over time. (Related: How to grow your own survival garden.) For mulching Spread a thin layer of composted coffee grounds around the base of your plants to suppress weeds, retain moisture and keep roots cool during warmer months. Always mix coffee grounds with other mulch materials like shredded leaves or straw to prevent them from forming a crust that could block water and nutrients. Liquid fertilizer boost Turn coffee grounds into a liquid fertilizer by steeping two cups of grounds in five gallons of water overnight. Use this nutrient-rich “coffee tea” to water your garden beds or container plants. It’s an easy way to give your plants a slow-release dose of nitrogen and other essential nutrients. Feeding garden soil (and worms) Earthworms love coffee grounds. These little garden helpers munch on the grounds, producing nutrient-rich castings that improve soil health. Plus, worms aerate the soil, making it easier for plant roots to access water and nutrients. Sprinkle a thin layer of grounds around your garden beds for healthy garden worms. For acid-loving plants While coffee grounds are neutral to slightly acidic (pH 6.2–6.8), they’re especially beneficial for acid-loving plants like azaleas, blueberries, hydrangeas and roses. You can sprinkle a small amount of fresh coffee grounds around the base of these plants to give them a nutrient boost. While coffee grounds are a gardener’s ally, they’re not a one-size-fits-all solution. Avoid using them on plants that prefer alkaline soil, like lavender or rosemary, or those that thrive in dry conditions, like cacti and succulents. And remember that moderation is key. Coffee grounds should make up no more than 20 percent of your compost or soil mix to avoid stunting plant growth. Acid-loving indoor houseplant varieties like African violets, monsteras and philodendrons can also benefit from a sprinkle of coffee grounds in their soil. You can use the liquid fertilizer method to give your indoor plants a gentle nutrient boost. Avoid using coffee grounds on plants like orchids and pothos, which prefer less acidity. This spring, don’t let your coffee grounds go to waste. Whether you’re composting, mulching or brewing up a liquid fertilizer, these little leftovers can make a big difference in your garden. The Health Ranger Store is here to help you stock up on delicious and high-quality organic coffee.

Health Ranger Select 100% Organic Hand-Roasted Whole Bean Coffee (Honey Processed Honduras) coffee blend comes from the country’s Cafe Organico Marcala Sociedad Anonima (COMSA) co-op, which uses innovative methods and practices to create coffee of exceptionally high quality. “Honey processing” is one such innovative method the COMSA co-op specializes in. While it may have the word “honey” in its name, this method doesn’t involve actual honey. Instead, it refers to the fermentation process the farmers employ. Unlike the typical method, which entails milling the pulp and washing the mucilage off coffee cherries, honey processing keeps the mucilage, or the “honey,” on the cherries as they dry. This results in a medium roast coffee blend with a clean and slightly sweet taste. With its distinctly fruity aroma and exquisite flavor with floral undertones, our organic Honey Processed Honduras coffee blend is truly an exceptional Marcala classic. You can also try our Health Ranger Select 100% Organic Hand-Roasted Whole Bean Coffee (Low Acid Blend) which is formulated for both cold brew and hot brew.

Often referred to as African nutmeg, Jamaican nutmeg, or “ehuru” in Nigeria, this aromatic seed has been a cornerstone of traditional medicine and culinary practices for centuries. Calabash nutmeg derives its name from the calabash tree, which produces large, gourd-like fruits containing seeds. The seeds themselves are small, oval-shaped and dark brown, with a wrinkled surface that resembles the more commonly known nutmeg (Myristica fragrans). However, calabash nutmeg has a distinct flavor profile — earthy, slightly sweet and with a hint of spiciness that sets it apart from its more widely used counterpart. Calabash nutmeg is warm and nutty, making it a versatile addition to both sweet and savory dishes. The history of calabash nutmeg is deeply intertwined with the cultural and medicinal practices of West and Central Africa. Indigenous communities have long valued the seed for its therapeutic properties, using it to treat ailments ranging from digestive issues to respiratory conditions. (Related: The jackfruit: A superfood source of vitamin C, fiber and other nutrients.) Historical records suggest that calabash nutmeg was introduced to the Caribbean during the transatlantic slave trade, where it became known as Jamaican nutmeg. Today, it is cultivated primarily in tropical regions of Africa, including Nigeria, Cameroon and Ghana, where it thrives in the humid, fertile soils of rainforests. Calabash nutmeg is more than just a flavorful spice — it is a nutrient powerhouse. Rich in phytonutrients, it contains compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids and tannins, which contribute to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These bioactive compounds help combat oxidative stress, a key driver of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Calabash nutmeg is also a source of essential oil containing myristicin and elemicin, which have been studied for their potential neuroprotective and antimicrobial effects. A nutritious superfood, here are some of the health benefits of calabash nutmeg: While more research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms, existing evidence points to calabash nutmeg as a promising natural remedy. The versatility of calabash nutmeg makes it a delightful ingredient in a variety of dishes. Its warm, nutty flavor pairs well with both sweet and savory recipes, adding depth and complexity to meals. Here are a few recipe ideas to inspire your culinary adventures: Calabash nutmeg is a culinary ingredient that is also a testament to the rich heritage and natural bounty of Africa. Its unique flavor, coupled with its potential health benefits, makes it a standout superfood in a world increasingly focused on holistic wellness.

https://food.news/2025-02-24-bush-tomato-nutrients-superfood-support-digestive-health.html,Bush tomato: A mighty superfood that supports digestive health,0,"Advertisement The bush tomato (Solanum centrale) is a small but mighty fruit that has been a staple in the diets of Indigenous Australians for thousands of years. Often referred to by its common names, such as desert raisin, kutjera or akudjura, this superfood is known for its unique flavor, rich nutritional profile and potential health benefits. With its vibrant color, distinctive shape and complex taste, the bush tomato is not only a culinary delight but also a powerhouse of phytonutrients that may help prevent or reverse various health conditions. Bush tomatoes are small, round fruits that typically measure about one to two centimeters in diameter. When ripe, they exhibit a deep golden-yellow to reddish-brown hue, often with a slightly wrinkled texture that resembles a raisin. This appearance has earned them the nickname “desert raisin.” The fruit’s flavor is complex, combining tangy, earthy and slightly sweet notes with a subtle smokiness. Some describe the taste as reminiscent of sun-dried tomatoes, but with a more intense and unique flavor profile that makes it a standout ingredient in both traditional and modern cuisine. The bush tomato has a rich history deeply intertwined with the culture and traditions of Indigenous Australian communities. For thousands of years, these communities have harvested and consumed the fruit, using it as food and medicine. The plant thrives in the arid and semi-arid regions of central Australia, where it has adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. European settlers first encountered the bush tomato during their explorations of the Australian outback in the 19th century. However, it wasn’t until recent decades that the fruit gained attention beyond its native land, as global interest in Indigenous foods and superfoods began to rise. Today, bush tomatoes are cultivated in small quantities, primarily in Australia, and are increasingly exported to international markets. (Related: Bilberries: The wild blueberry powerhouse of antioxidants and flavor.) Bush tomatoes are a rich source of essential nutrients, including vitamins C and E, potassium and dietary fiber. However, what truly sets them apart is their impressive array of phytonutrients, which contribute to their health-promoting properties. These phytonutrients include: The nutrient-dense profile of bush tomatoes makes them a valuable addition to a health-conscious diet. Research suggests that consuming bush tomatoes may offer the following benefits: Bush tomatoes are incredibly versatile and can be used in a variety of dishes, both traditional and contemporary.

https://food.news/2025-02-24-freeze-dried-traditional-snacks-which-is-better.html,Freeze-dried vs. traditional snacks: Which is better for your family?,0,"Advertisement Convenience often trumps nutrition, but the rise of healthy snacks — both traditional and freeze-dried — has been a welcome shift. These snacks are not only delicious but also pack a powerful nutritional punch, making them ideal for busy families, health-conscious individuals and even emergency preparedness enthusiasts. (h/t to Healthline.com) Traditional healthy snacks, such as fresh fruits, nuts, seeds and homemade granola bars, have long been staples of balanced diets. These snacks are celebrated for their simplicity, natural ingredients and accessibility. Fresh fruits like apples, bananas and berries are rich in vitamins, minerals and fiber, making them a go-to choice for quick energy and optimal digestive health. Nuts and seeds, on the other hand, provide healthy fats, protein and essential nutrients like magnesium and zinc, which support your overall well-being. One of the greatest advantages of traditional snacks is their versatility. They can be easily incorporated into meals or enjoyed on their own, and their preparation often requires minimal processing. For families, these snacks are a reliable way to ensure kids get the nutrients they need without relying on heavily processed alternatives. However, traditional snacks do have their limitations. Fresh fruits and vegetables have a short shelf life and require refrigeration, which can be inconvenient for on-the-go lifestyles or emergency situations. This is where freeze-dried snacks come in handy, offering a modern solution to these challenges. Freeze-drying, or lyophilization, is a cutting-edge dehydration technique that removes water from food while preserving its nutritional value, flavor and texture. This process involves freezing the food and then using a vacuum to turn the ice directly into vapor, bypassing the liquid stage. The result? Lightweight, shelf-stable snacks that retain most of their original nutrients. (Related: Prepping tips for beginners: Nutritious emergency foods to stock up on.) Freeze-dried fruits, in particular, have become a game-changer for families and health enthusiasts. Unlike traditional dried fruits, which often contain added sugars and preservatives, freeze-dried fruits are typically made with just one ingredient: The fruit itself. This makes them a naturally sweet, guilt-free snack option. Freeze-dried fruits are packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. For example, freeze-dried berries retain high levels of vitamin C and anthocyanins, powerful antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress and support good health. Apples and bananas provide potassium and fiber, which aid digestion and keep energy levels stable. Convenience and Longevity One of the standout features of freeze-dried snacks is their extended shelf life. When stored in a cool, dry place, these snacks can last for months or even years without refrigeration, making them perfect for busy families, road trips and emergency food supplies. Their lightweight nature also makes them easy to store and transport, whether you’re packing a lunchbox or preparing for a natural disaster. Versatility in daily life Freeze-dried fruits can be enjoyed straight out of the bag as a crunchy snack, added to cereals or yogurt for a nutrient boost, or rehydrated for use in recipes. This versatility makes them a practical choice for anyone looking to incorporate more fruits into their diet without worrying about spoilage. In addition to their daily benefits, freeze-dried snacks are a cornerstone of emergency preparedness. Natural disasters, power outages and other unforeseen events can disrupt access to fresh food, making it essential to have non-perishable options on hand. Freeze-dried foods, with their long shelf life and nutritional integrity, are an ideal solution. You can stock up on freeze-dried fruits, vegetables and even complete meals to ensure that you have access to healthy food during emergencies. These snacks provide essential nutrients and energy, helping to maintain physical and mental well-being in challenging situations. While traditional snacks offer the comfort of familiarity and minimal processing, freeze-dried snacks bring unmatched convenience and longevity. Choosing freeze-dried snacks ensures that your whole family has access to nutritious, delicious snacks at all times. If you are focused on emergency planning, freeze-dried snacks provide peace of mind because healthy food is always within reach. The Health Ranger Store is committed to helping you provide your family with healthy and convenient snacks.

https://food.news/2025-02-22-black-plum-nutrient-packed-superfood.html,Black plum: A nutrient-packed superfood with timeless appeal,0,"Advertisement The black plum (Vitex doniana) is a lesser-known yet remarkable fruit that has been cherished for centuries in traditional medicine and culinary practices. Often referred to by its common names, such as African black plum, wild plum or simply Vitex, this fruit is a powerhouse of nutrients and phytonutrients, making it a true superfood. With its deep purple-black hue, oblong shape and sweet-tart flavor, the black plum is as visually striking as it is beneficial for health. The black plum is easily recognizable by its dark, almost black skin, which encases a juicy, fibrous pulp. The fruit is typically oblong or oval-shaped, measuring about two to three centimeters in length. When ripe, the flesh ranges from a deep purple to a reddish-brown color, with a texture that is both succulent and slightly fibrous. The taste of the black plum is a delightful balance of sweet and tart, with a subtle earthy undertone that makes it a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes. The black plum has a rich history that dates back centuries, primarily in Africa, where it is indigenous. It is widely grown in West Africa, including countries like Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon, as well as parts of East Africa. The fruit thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in savannahs and forested areas. (Related: Bilberries: The wild blueberry powerhouse of antioxidants and flavor.) While its exact discovery date is not well-documented, black plum has been a staple in African traditional medicine and diets for generations. Its resilience and adaptability have made it a valuable resource for communities in arid and semi-arid regions, where it provides both food and medicinal benefits. Black plums are a treasure trove of essential nutrients and bioactive compounds. They are rich in vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin C and several B vitamins, as well as minerals like calcium, magnesium and potassium. However, what truly sets the black plum apart is its impressive array of phytonutrients, which include flavonoids, tannins, phenolic acids and anthocyanins. These compounds are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, making the fruit a potent ally in promoting overall health. Black plum’s nutrient-dense profile translates into a wide range of health benefits.

https://food.news/2025-02-22-why-you-should-upgrade-pink-himalayan-salt.html,Here’s why you should make the upgrade to Pink Himalayan Salt,0,"Advertisement Many health-conscious individuals consider pink Himalayan salt as a healthier, more natural alternative to regular table salt. Mined from the pristine foothills of the Himalayas in Pakistan, this pink-hued salt is celebrated not only for its unique flavor but also for its nutrient profile and potential health benefits. (h/t to MedicalNewsToday.com) Pink Himalayan salt is a type of rock salt that is chemically similar to table salt, containing up to 98 percent sodium chloride. The remaining two percent is where the magic happens — this portion consists of trace minerals like calcium, magnesium and potassium, which give the salt its distinctive pink color. These minerals not only enhance its visual appeal but also contribute to its slightly different taste compared to regular table salt. Unlike table salt, which is heavily refined and often contains anti-caking agents like sodium aluminosilicate or magnesium carbonate, pink Himalayan salt is minimally processed and free of artificial additives. This makes it a more natural option for those looking to reduce their intake of processed foods. Table salt is a staple in most kitchens, but its highly refined nature and added chemicals have raised concerns among health-conscious consumers. While both table salt and Pink Himalayan salt provide sodium, the latter offers additional trace minerals that can support good overall health. For example, the potassium in pink Himalayan salt helps balance sodium levels in the body, which is crucial for maintaining overall well-being. Magnesium also supports muscle and nerve function, while calcium is essential for strong bones and teeth. The minerals in pink Himalayan salt, though present in small amounts, can contribute to a more balanced nutrient intake when pink salt is used regularly. If you’re still on the fence, here are other reasons to try pink Himalayan salt: A natural, additive-free option As mentioned earlier, pink Himalayan salt is free of the artificial additives found in table salt. For those looking to minimize their exposure to synthetic chemicals, this makes it a cleaner, more natural choice. Supports hydration and fluid balance Sodium is essential for maintaining proper fluid balance, and pink Himalayan salt can help with this. Some people even add a pinch of it to their water or meals to promote optimal hydration, especially during hot weather or after intense workouts. (Related: Hydration tips for winter: Why electrolytes are your secret weapon.) A versatile household item Salt is not just a kitchen ingredient, it can be used for various purposes. For example, you can use pink Himalayan salt to make salt lamps, which an help clean the air in your home and enhance your mood. Pink Himalayan salt can also be used to make an oral rehydration solution or a saline solution to clean wounds and rinse your sinuses. While salt is essential for bodily functions like muscle contraction, nerve signaling and fluid balance, excessive intake of table salt can have serious health consequences. High sodium consumption is a leading risk factor for hypertension (high blood pressure), which can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney problems. Table salt’s refined nature and lack of balancing minerals like potassium can exacerbate these risks. Over time, a diet high in table salt may lead to fluid retention, strain on the cardiovascular system and even an increased risk of heart failure. Switching to pink Himalayan salt isn’t just about flavor — it’s about making a healthier choice for your body. Its natural composition, trace minerals and lack of additives make it a superior option for those looking to reduce their reliance on processed foods. However, moderation is key. Even with pink Himalayan salt, it’s important to monitor your sodium intake. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends consuming less than five grams of salt per day (about one teaspoon) to reduce the risk of heart disease and other health issues. Pink Himalayan salt offers a more natural, mineral-rich alternative to table salt, making it a worthwhile addition to your pantry. While it’s not a miracle cure, its trace minerals and lack of additives can contribute to a healthier diet. The Health Ranger Store is committed to helping you find natural alternatives to common products that often contain harmful chemicals. That’s why we’re proud to introduce clean, lab-verified, healthy food options like our Pink Himalayan Salt Fine Ground. A much healthier alternative to regular salt, pink Himalayan salt can contain up to 84 different beneficial trace minerals without the harmful additives often found in regular table salt.

https://food.news/2025-02-21-kumquat-tiny-citrus-powerhouse-with-health-benefits.html,Kumquat: The tiny citrus powerhouse with big health benefits,0,"Advertisement The kumquat (Citrus japonica), a diminutive yet vibrant citrus fruit, has been captivating taste buds and nourishing bodies for centuries. Often overlooked in favor of its larger citrus cousins like oranges and lemons, the kumquat is a nutritional gem that deserves a spotlight. Known by various names such as “golden orange,” “dwarf orange,” or “cumquat,” this fruit is as versatile as it is flavorful. With its unique combination of sweet and tart, the kumquat is not only a culinary delight but also a potent source of health-promoting compounds. Kumquats are easily recognizable by their small, oval shape, typically measuring about the size of a large olive. Their smooth, glossy skin ranges in color from bright orange to deep gold, depending on the variety and ripeness. Unlike most citrus fruits, the kumquat’s skin is sweet and edible, while the flesh inside is tart and slightly sour. This contrast creates a delightful flavor experience that is both refreshing and complex. The fruit’s seeds are small and edible, though some prefer to remove them for a smoother texture. (Related: Papaya: Discover the remarkable health benefits of this tropical superfood.) The kumquat has a rich history that traces back to ancient China, where it was first cultivated over a thousand years ago. The fruit’s name is derived from the Cantonese words gam gwat, meaning “golden orange.” It was introduced to Europe in the 19th century by Scottish botanist Robert Fortune, who brought it from China to England. From there, it spread to other parts of the world, including the United States, where it is now grown in states like Florida and California. Today, kumquats are also cultivated in Japan, Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean region, thriving in warm, subtropical climates. Kumquats are packed with phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals that contribute to their health benefits. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that supports immune function and skin health. Additionally, kumquats contain significant amounts of fiber, which aids digestion and promotes gut health. The fruit is also rich in flavonoids, such as lutein, zeaxanthin and beta-carotene, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These compounds help protect the body against oxidative stress and chronic diseases. The nutritional profile of kumquats makes them a valuable addition to a wellness-focused diet. Here are some of the conditions and symptoms that kumquats may help prevent or alleviate: Kumquats are incredibly versatile in the kitchen, adding a burst of flavor and nutrition to both sweet and savory dishes. Their unique sweet-tart profile makes them a popular ingredient in jams, marmalades and desserts. They can also be used to enhance salads, sauces and marinades.

https://food.news/2025-02-20-debunking-top-10-myths-emergency-food-storage.html,Debunking the TOP 6 MYTHS about emergency food storage,0,"Advertisement When it comes to preparing for emergencies, food storage is a cornerstone of any survival plan. Yet, many well-meaning preppers fall victim to common myths that can leave them with a pantry full of unappetizing or unusable items. From outdated assumptions about shelf life to misconceptions about what your family will actually eat, these myths can undermine even the most carefully laid plans. (h/t to TheEpochTimes.com) Below are some of the most persistent food storage myths, debunked. You can also read up on practical tips to ensure your emergency food supply is both effective and tailored to your family’s needs. It’s easy to assume that grocery stores and supply chains will bounce back quickly after a disaster. However, natural disasters, economic disruptions or even pandemics can cripple supply chains, leaving shelves empty for days or even weeks. For example, earthquakes can damage infrastructure, making it difficult for stores to restock. Having your own food storage ensures you’re not reliant on external resources that may not be available when you need them most. While government relief efforts are a critical part of disaster response, they are not instantaneous. As a prepper, you know that it can take days or even weeks for aid to reach affected areas, and not all emergencies qualify for government assistance. By maintaining your own food storage, you ensure your family has immediate access to meals, no matter the situation. Factors like heat, humidity and light are the enemies of long-term food storage. Many non-preppers make the mistake of stashing their emergency supplies in garages, attics or outbuildings, only to find their food spoiled when they need it. Optimal storage conditions — cool, dark and dry — are essential for preserving the quality and shelf life of your food. If space is an issue, consider decluttering to make room in your home for your emergency supplies. Canned food is a staple of many food storage plans, and for good reason — it’s convenient, shelf-stable and widely available. However, canned food isn’t foolproof. Over time, it can lose nutrients, flavor and texture. (Related: Quinoa, mushrooms and more: Superfoods for energy and vitality that you need in your survival stockpile.) For example, canned tuna may become mushy, and soups can change color and taste. Additionally, many canned foods contain high levels of sodium and preservatives, which may not align with your dietary preferences. While canned food is a great foundation, it’s important to diversify your storage with freeze-dried meals, grains and other shelf-stable and nutritious options. Food storage companies determine shelf life based on optimal storage conditions — cool, stable temperatures and protection from light and humidity. While properly stored food can last for decades, real-world conditions often fall short of these ideals. Over time, food may lose its nutritional value, flavor and texture, even if it remains technically safe to eat. To maximize shelf life, store your food in the coolest part of your home and use airtight containers to protect against pests and moisture. Food fatigue is a real phenomenon, even in emergencies. Just because someone is hungry doesn’t mean they’ll eat something they dislike. Stocking up on foods your family already enjoys or getting versatile ingredients that can be prepared in multiple ways such as grains like quinoa and lentils, is key to avoiding mealtime revolts. For example, instead of loading up on a single type of canned meal, consider storing basics like rice, beans and spices that can be combined into a variety of dishes. Once you get started on your food stockpile, use the “first in, first out” method to ensure your food stays fresh. Incorporate stored items into your regular meals to keep your supply current. Include a mix of canned goods, freeze-dried meals, grains and other shelf-stable items to provide variety and balance. The best food storage plan is one that’s customized to your family’s unique needs and preferences. By debunking these common myths and following practical tips, you can build a supply that’s not only effective but also enjoyable to eat. The Health Ranger Store is here to help you prepare for any emergency.

https://food.news/2025-02-20-eggplant-nutritional-powerhouse-with-ancient-roots.html,The majesty of the eggplant: A nutritional powerhouse with ancient roots,0,"Advertisement Among the vibrant array of vegetables found in farmer’s markets and grocery stores, the eggplant (Solanum melongena) stands out as a versatile and nutritious gem. Often referred to by various names such as aubergine, brinjal or melongene, this member of the nightshade family has a rich history and a diverse range of culinary uses. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the eggplant is a powerhouse of nutrients and antioxidants that can contribute significantly to your overall health and well-being. Eggplants are known for their distinctive colors and shapes. The most common variety, often found in Western cuisine, has a deep purple, almost black, color and glossy skin. However, eggplants can also be found in shades of white, green and even striped patterns, depending on the variety. Their shapes range from the elongated and slender Japanese eggplant to the plump and round Italian varieties. When cut, the flesh of the eggplant is white and spongy, which can vary in texture from firm to soft when cooked. In terms of taste, eggplants have a mild, slightly sweet and somewhat earthy flavor, which makes them an excellent base for absorbing the flavors of other ingredients. This adaptability has made eggplants a favorite in cuisines around the world, from the Mediterranean to Southeast Asia. The origins of the eggplant trace back to ancient times, with evidence suggesting that it was first cultivated in India and China over 4,000 years ago. The earliest written records of eggplant cultivation date back to the 5th century B.C. in China, where it was initially grown for its medicinal properties. From these regions, the eggplant spread to the Middle East and the Mediterranean, where it became a staple in various cuisines. The name “eggplant” is believed to have originated from the 18th century, when European varieties of the plant produced small, white, egg-shaped fruits. In other parts of the world, such as France and the United Kingdom, it is known as “aubergine,” a term derived from the Arabic “al-badhinjan.” In India, it is commonly called “brinjal,” and in some parts of the United States, it is referred to as “melongene.” (Related: Custard apple: A nutrient-packed superfruit with ancient roots.) Eggplants are not only low in calories but are also packed with essential nutrients and phytonutrients. They are a good source of dietary fiber, vitamins B1, B6 and K, and minerals like potassium and manganese. The deep purple skin of the eggplant is particularly rich in anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid with potent antioxidant properties. One of the most notable phytonutrients found in eggplants is nasunin, an anthocyanin that has been shown to protect the lipids in brain cell membranes, potentially aiding in cognitive function and reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Eggplants also contain chlorogenic acid, another potent antioxidant that has been linked to lower blood pressure and improved cardiovascular health. The nutritional profile of eggplants makes them a valuable addition to a healthy diet. Here are some of the potential benefits and therapeutic uses of eggplants: The culinary applications of eggplants are vast, and they can be found in various dishes across different cultures. In the Mediterranean, eggplants are a key ingredient in dishes like ratatouille, caponata and moussaka. In Indian cuisine, they are used in curries, such as baingan bharta, and in the Middle East, they are featured in dishes like baba ganoush. For those looking to incorporate more eggplants into their diet, there are countless recipes to explore, such as: The eggplant, with its ancient roots and diverse culinary applications, is more than just a beautiful vegetable.

Bilberries, with their round shape and slightly tart, sweet taste, are not only a culinary delight but also a nutrient powerhouse packed with phytonutrients that can support overall health. Bilberries are round, about five to nine millimeters in diameter, and grow on low shrubs. They are easily recognizable by their deep indigo hue, which comes from powerful antioxidant pigments called anthocyanins. When ripe, the skin of bilberries is smooth and slightly waxy, encasing a juicy, dark purple flesh that can stain fingers and tongues alike. The flavor of bilberries is a delightful balance of sweet and tart, with a more intense and complex taste compared to cultivated blueberries.

Known by various names such as “Sharon fruit” in Israel and “kaki” in Japanese, the persimmon is not only a delight to the palate but also a powerhouse of nutrients that can contribute significantly to overall health. The persimmon is a visually striking fruit, typically ranging from a deep orange to a rich burgundy color. It is roughly apple-shaped, with a glossy, smooth skin and a distinctive calyx at the top.

https://food.news/2025-02-18-why-consume-only-lab-verified-cocoa-products.html,Here’s why you should choose only lab-verified cocoa products,0,"Advertisement Chocolate is often celebrated as a decadent treat, a mood booster and even a superfood due to its high antioxidant content. But beneath its rich, indulgent surface lies a darker truth: Some cocoa products can harbor harmful contaminants that pose serious health risks. (h/t to Food-Safety.com) Recent research has raised alarms about the presence of toxic heavy metals like cadmium and lead in chocolate, prompting experts to urge consumers to choose only lab-verified cocoa products. A groundbreaking study by researchers at Tulane University analyzed 155 chocolate samples from major brands sold in the United States. These products were sourced from cocoa beans grown in regions like West Africa, South America and Asia. While most samples contained toxic heavy metals below recommended safe levels, some chocolates — particularly dark chocolates with high cocoa content — exceeded safety thresholds for cadmium and lead. Cadmium, a naturally occurring heavy metal, can accumulate in cocoa beans during cultivation, especially in soils contaminated by industrial activities or volcanic ash. On the other hand, lead often contaminates cocoa during post-harvest processing, particularly while the beans are being dried on the ground or transported in lead-contaminated equipment. Both metals are toxic even in small amounts, posing serious risks to the kidneys, bones and nervous system over time. The Tulane University study found that dark chocolates from Central and South America had the highest cadmium levels, with one sample from Colombia containing 843 micrograms per kilogram (ug/kg) — exceeding the European Commission’s safety limit of 800 ug/kg. Similarly, dark chocolates from Venezuela and Peru contained lead levels far above California’s interim safety limit of 150 ug/kg. While these levels may not pose immediate risks to adults, they are particularly concerning for children, whose smaller body size makes them more vulnerable to heavy metal toxicity. Long-term exposure to cadmium and lead can have devastating health consequences. Cadmium is a known carcinogen and can damage the kidneys, weaken bones and increase the risk of osteoporosis. Lead, even at low levels, can impair cognitive development in children, leading to learning disabilities and behavioral issues. In adults, chronic lead exposure has been linked to high blood pressure, kidney damage and reproductive problems. For the study, researchers used hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) calculations to assess the risks of long-term exposure to these metals. While most chocolates posed no significant risk to adults, 33 dark chocolate samples exceeded safety thresholds for children weighing 15 kilograms (33 pounds) or less. This is particularly alarming given that children are more likely to consume chocolate regularly and in larger quantities. (Related: Clean food watch: Does your protein powder contain heavy metals?) The good news is that not all cocoa products are created equal. By taking a few precautions, you can minimize your exposure to harmful food contaminants: Choose lab-verified products Look for chocolates and cocoa powders that have been tested for heavy metals and other contaminants. Reputable brands often provide this information on their packaging or websites. Lab verification ensures that the product meets safety standards and is free of toxins. Opt for low-risk origins The researchers found that chocolates made from West African and Asian cocoa beans generally have lower levels of cadmium and lead. Choose products made from cocoa sourced from these regions. Moderate your intake While dark chocolate is often touted for its health benefits, its higher cocoa content also means it’s more likely to contain contaminants. Limit your consumption to one ounce per day, especially if you’re eating dark chocolate with 70 percent or more cocoa content. Check for certifications Certifications like USDA Organic, Fair Trade or Rainforest Alliance indicate better farming and processing practices, which may reduce the risk of contamination. To ensure cocoa products are safe, rigorous testing is essential. Residue analysis, a process that detects pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins and other contaminants, is a critical step in cocoa quality control. Advanced techniques like atomic absorption spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) are used to measure contaminants at trace levels. Regular microbiological testing is also crucial to prevent contamination by mold, bacteria and viruses, which can thrive in poorly stored or processed cocoa. By adhering to strict hygiene practices and conducting routine testing, producers can minimize the risk of contamination and ensure their products are safe for consumers. While chocolate can be a delicious healthy treat, it’s not without risks. The presence of toxic heavy metals like cadmium and lead in some cocoa products underscores the importance of choosing lab-verified options. By being mindful of where your chocolate comes from and how it’s processed, you can enjoy your favorite treat without compromising your health. The Health Ranger Store is committed to helping you find high-quality cocoa products so you can protect your family from heavy metal contaminants like cadmium and lead. That’s why we’re proud to introduce clean, lab-verified, healthy foods such as Health Ranger Select Organic Cocoa Love.

Known by various names across the globe — such as pawpaw in some regions, tree melon or simply papaya — this fruit has carved a niche in both culinary and wellness circles. Its golden-orange flesh, sweet taste and buttery texture make it a versatile ingredient, while its impressive nutrient profile positions it as a superfood with the potential to prevent and even reverse certain health conditions. Papaya is easily recognizable by its oblong shape, which can range from pear-like to cylindrical, depending on the variety. When ripe, its skin transitions from green to a sunny yellow or orange hue, while its inner flesh glows with a vibrant orange or pinkish color. The fruit’s taste is a delightful blend of sweetness and mild muskiness, often compared to a cross between a cantaloupe and a mango. Embedded within the flesh are small, black, gelatinous seeds, which, though edible, are often discarded due to their peppery, slightly bitter flavor. Papaya is believed to have originated in the tropical regions of Central America, particularly southern Mexico and neighboring countries. Historical records suggest that the fruit was cultivated by the Maya and Aztec civilizations long before European explorers arrived in the Americas. Spanish and Portuguese colonizers introduced papaya to other parts of the world, including the Caribbean, Southeast Asia and Africa, where it thrived in warm, humid climates. Today, papaya is grown in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, with India, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia being among the largest producers. Papaya’s health benefits stem from its rich array of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients. It is an excellent source of vitamin C, providing more than 100 percent of the recommended daily intake in a single serving. The fruit also contains significant amounts of vitamin A, folate, potassium and magnesium. Among its phytonutrients are carotenoids like beta-carotene, lycopene and lutein, which are known for their antioxidant properties.

This small, unassuming berry earned its name from its extraordinary ability to alter taste perception, turning sour flavors into sweet sensations. Beyond its novelty, miracle fruit is gaining attention for its potential health benefits, making it a fascinating subject for wellness enthusiasts and researchers alike. Miracle fruit, also known as miracle berry, sweet berry or flavor berry, is a bright red, oblong berry native to West Africa.

Its vibrant red hue and smooth skin make it visually appealing, though its taste is relatively mild when eaten fresh. (Related: 5 Remarkable ways GARLIC can support your health, according to science.) The berry itself is not particularly sweet or flavorful, but its magic lies in its unique active compound, miraculin. Miraculin is a glycoprotein that binds to taste buds and temporarily alters their function. When consumed, the compound makes sour or acidic foods, such as lemons, vinegar or pickles, taste sweet. This effect can last anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on the individual. The fruit’s ability to transform taste has made it a popular novelty item, but its health benefits are equally compelling. Miracle fruit has a rich history rooted in West Africa, where it has been used for centuries by indigenous communities. The fruit was first documented by European explorers in the 18th century, with records suggesting that local tribes used it to sweeten sour foods and beverages. In the 1960s, miracle fruit gained international attention when researchers began studying its potential as a natural sweetener for individuals with diabetes or those seeking to reduce sugar intake. Today, miracle fruit is primarily cultivated in West Africa, particularly in countries like Ghana, Nigeria and Benin. It is also grown in tropical regions of Asia and the Americas, though on a smaller scale. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish. While miracle fruit is not a significant source of macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, or fats, it contains a combination of essential nutrients and phytonutrients that contribute to its health-promoting properties. These include: These compounds work synergistically to provide a range of health benefits, making miracle fruit more than just a culinary curiosity.

Its common names reflect its regional significance and characteristics. In South Africa, it is often referred to as “wild plum” or “sour plum,” while in other parts of the continent, it is simply called “African plum.” It thrives in subtropical climates and is often found growing wild in riverine forests. The tree itself is an evergreen, reaching heights of up to 15 meters, and produces clusters of small, oval-shaped fruits that ripen to a deep red or purple hue. The Kaffir plum is a visually striking fruit, with its glossy, smooth skin and vibrant color. When ripe, the fruit transitions from green to a rich red or purple, signaling its readiness for harvest. The flesh is juicy and fibrous, with a tart, tangy flavor that is both refreshing and slightly astringent.

https://food.news/2025-02-16-titanium-dioxide-food-additive-health-risks.html,The hidden danger in your food: Titanium dioxide and the health risks you need to know,0,"Advertisement Brightly colored candies, creamy frosting and white bread are commonly consumed food products, so chances are you’ve already consumed titanium dioxide (TiO2), a food additive often used to whiten and brighten processed foods. While it may make your food look more appealing, this chemical has been linked to serious health risks — so much so that the European Union banned it as a food additive in 2022. Yet, in the U.S., titanium dioxide remains a staple on grocery store shelves, hidden in everything from Skittles to Duncan Hines frosting. The question is: Why is a chemical deemed unsafe in Europe still allowed in American foods? And what are the potential dangers of consuming it? Titanium dioxide is a white, powdery substance used primarily as a pigment in paints, plastics and cosmetics. In food, it’s labeled as E171 and added to products like candies, chewing gum, baked goods and even some dairy items to enhance their color and texture. It has no nutritional value; its sole purpose is aesthetic. Despite its widespread use, titanium dioxide has come under scrutiny in recent years due to growing evidence of its potential harm to human health. Studies have linked it to DNA damage, inflammation and cancer. The primary concern with titanium dioxide lies in its nanoparticle form. Nanoparticles are incredibly tiny particles that can easily penetrate cells and tissues. When ingested, these particles can accumulate in the body, particularly in the gut, liver and spleen. Research has found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles can cause genotoxicity, meaning they can damage DNA and potentially lead to cancer. A study published in Food and Chemical Toxicology found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles induced DNA damage in human intestinal cells, raising concerns about their role in colorectal cancer. (Related: FDA proposes ban of popular food additive linked to negative side effects.) Additionally, titanium dioxide has been linked to intestinal inflammation and disruptions to the gut microbiome, the community of beneficial bacteria that plays a crucial role in digestion, immunity and overall health. A study published in Nanotoxicology also found that mice fed titanium dioxide experienced significant gut inflammation and changes to their gut bacteria, which could increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic conditions. The dangers of titanium dioxide aren’t limited to the gut. Emerging research suggests that nanoparticles can cross the blood-brain barrier, potentially harming the nervous system. A study published in the Archives of Toxicology found that titanium dioxide exposure in mice led to changes in gut bacteria and locomotor dysfunction, suggesting a link between the additive and neurological issues. Even more alarming, a 2025 study published in Alzheimer’s and Dementia found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles can bind to neurons, triggering oxidative stress and inflammation — two key factors in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. In 2022, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that titanium dioxide could no longer be considered safe for human consumption due to concerns about genotoxicity. This led to a ban across the European Union. In contrast, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains that titanium dioxide is safe for use in food. According to reports, the agency last reviewed the additive’s safety in 1973, long before the rise of nanotechnology and the growing body of research highlighting its risks. Public health advocates also argue that the FDA’s outdated safety standards are putting Americans at risk. While policy changes are needed to address the widespread use of titanium dioxide, there are steps you can take to reduce your exposure to this harmful chemical: Read labels carefully Titanium dioxide may be listed as “E171” or simply as “artificial color.” Avoid products that contain these ingredients. Choose whole foods Opt for minimally processed foods, which are less likely to contain artificial additives. Support advocacy efforts Organizations like the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) are pushing for stricter regulations on food additives. Supporting these efforts can help drive change. The case of titanium dioxide highlights a broader issue: The lack of oversight and transparency in the U.S. food system. While Europe has taken a precautionary approach – banning additives until they are proven safe – the U.S. often allows chemicals to remain in use until they are proven harmful. As a consumer, you have the power to demand better. By staying informed and making conscious choices, you can protect your health and push for a food system that prioritizes safety over profit.

https://food.news/2025-02-13-maximizing-recovery-after-workouts-with-protein-blends.html,Maximizing recovery after winter workouts with protein blends,0,"Advertisement Protein powders, whether whey-based or plant-based, are a convenient and effective way to refuel and recover after winter workouts, helping you stay strong and energized throughout the season. If you exercise during the winter months, you may find yourself bundling up for outdoor runs, hitting the gym to stay active or even shoveling snow as an impromptu workout. While the cold weather can make exercise feel more challenging, it also highlights the importance of proper recovery — especially when it involves post-workout nutrition. Enter protein powders, a reliable way to refuel, repair and rebuild after a tough winter workout. (h/t to WorkingAgainstGravity.com) After working out, your body needs three key things to fully recover: In winter, these needs become even more critical. Cold weather can strain your immune system, and indoor workouts in dry, heated environments can leave you dehydrated without you even realizing it. Protein powders, such as whey or plant-based options like pea protein, offer a quick and efficient way to deliver the nutrients your body craves. Whether you’re sipping a protein shake or blending it into a smoothie, these supplements can help maximize recovery, especially during the 30- to 60-minute post-workout window when your body is most receptive to nutrient absorption. Still in doubt? Here are some reasons to try protein powders this winter: Muscle repair and growth Winter workouts, such as lifting weights, running on icy trails or shoveling snow, can take a toll on your muscles. Protein powders provide a concentrated source of high-quality protein, which is essential for repairing muscle fibers. Whey protein, in particular, is rich in branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), which are known to support normal muscle recovery. For those who prefer plant-based options, pea protein is an excellent alternative, with its complete amino acid profile that rivals animal-based proteins. Convenience in cold weather When it’s freezing outside, the last thing you want to do is spend time cooking a complex post-workout meal. Protein powders are a lifesaver for busy individuals who need a quick recovery option. Just mix a scoop with water, milk or a plant-based alternative and you’ve got a nutrient-packed shake ready to go. Hydration help Staying hydrated in winter can be tricky, as the cold weather often masks thirst. Protein shakes made with water or milk not only deliver protein but also contribute to your daily fluid intake. For an added hydration boost, consider adding a pinch of electrolyte powder to your shake. With so many options on the market, selecting the right protein powder can feel overwhelming. Here’s a quick guide to help you decide: Organic options If you’re prioritizing clean eating, look for organic protein powders made with minimal ingredients and free of artificial additives. (Related: Clean food watch: Does your protein powder contain heavy metals?) Pea protein Pea protein is a plant-based option that’s easy to digest and packed with essential amino acids. Pea protein is ideal for vegans or those with dairy sensitivities. Whey protein A fast-digesting protein derived from milk, whey is ideal for post-workout recovery due to its high BCAA content. It’s also versatile and blends well into shakes and smoothies. Here are some tips on how to incorporate protein powders into a winter workout: Prep ahead Save time by portioning out single servings of protein powder in small containers or bags so they’re ready to grab and go. Blend with winter-friendly ingredients Add seasonal fruits like bananas, berries or a handful of spinach to your shake for extra nutrients and flavor. Stay consistent Make protein shakes a regular part of your post-workout routine to ensure you’re consistently supporting healthy muscle recovery.

This fruit, which grows on the iconic African baobab tree (Adansonia digitata), is not only a symbol of resilience and longevity but also a potent superfood that is gaining global recognition for its many health benefits. The baobab fruit is encased in a large, oblong pod that can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. The outer shell is hard and woody, often covered in a velvety, yellowish-brown fuzz. Inside, the fruit has a white, powdery pulp that is naturally dry and fibrous. The pulp is studded with large, hard seeds, which are typically about two to three centimeters in length. The taste of the baobab fruit is often described as tangy and citrusy, with a hint of vanilla and a slightly sweet aftertaste. This unique flavor profile makes it a versatile ingredient in various culinary applications.

The discovery and use of the baobab fruit can be traced back to ancient African civilizations. In many African cultures, the fruit is not only consumed but also used in traditional medicine to treat a variety of ailments, from digestive issues to skin conditions.

According to a comprehensive analysis published in the Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, the fruit is exceptionally high in vitamin C, containing up to 10 times more than oranges. This high vitamin C content is crucial for optimal immune function, skin health and iron absorption. Additionally, the baobab fruit is a rich source of dietary fiber, which aids in proper digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome. The fruit also contains significant amounts of other essential nutrients, including potassium, magnesium and calcium. These minerals are vital for maintaining proper nerve function, muscle health and bone density. Furthermore, the baobab fruit is a good source of antioxidants, including polyphenols and flavonoids, which help combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation in the body. (Related: Superfruits for good health: Boost your daily protein intake with delicious apple cinnamon muffins.)

But this bitterness is proof of its rich phytonutrient content, which makes it a powerhouse of health benefits. Bitter melon is packed with bioactive compounds that contribute to its medicinal properties. These include: Antioxidants Bitter melon is rich in vitamin C, beta-carotene and other antioxidants that combat oxidative stress and inflammation, protecting cells from damage.

Native to Southeast Asia, this spiky, pungent fruit has been a culinary and cultural staple for centuries. Beyond its polarizing reputation, durian is a nutrient powerhouse that is packed with phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals that offer a range of health benefits. Durian is instantly recognizable by its large, oblong shape and thick, spiky rind, which can range in color from green to brown. The fruit typically weighs between two to seven pounds, with some varieties growing even larger. Inside the tough exterior lies a creamy, custard-like flesh divided into segments, each encasing a large seed. The color of the flesh varies from pale yellow to deep orange, depending on the variety. The taste of durian is as complex as its aroma. Described as a blend of sweet, savory and creamy flavors, it has been likened to a unique combination of almonds, caramel and cheese. However, its strong, sulfurous odor — often compared to rotting onions or gym socks — has led to its ban in many public spaces, including hotels and public transportation in Southeast Asia. Despite its divisive reputation, durian enthusiasts enjoy its rich, indulgent flavor and consider it a delicacy. Durian is the edible fruit produced by several tree species within the genus Durio. Of the 30 recognized species in this genus, at least nine are known to bear edible fruit. Among these, Durio zibethinus, which is native to Borneo and Sumatra, is the sole species widely available in international markets. Durian has a long and storied history, with its origins tracing back to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Historical records suggest that durian has been cultivated for over 400 years, with early mentions in texts from the 15th century. Today, it is widely grown in tropical regions, particularly in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, which are among the largest producers and exporters of the fruit. The name “durian” is derived from the Malay word duri, meaning “thorn,” a nod to its spiky exterior. Over time, durian has become deeply embedded in the cultural fabric of Southeast Asia, featuring prominently in local cuisines, festivals and traditional medicine. Durian is not only a culinary delight but also a nutrient-dense superfood. It is rich in vitamins such as vitamin C, vitamin B6 and folate, as well as minerals like iron, magnesium and potassium. Additionally, durian contains a variety of phytonutrients, including: The unique combination of nutrients and phytonutrients in durian makes it a valuable addition to a health-conscious diet.

They are particularly high in potassium, magnesium and copper, which are known to support heart health, muscle function and energy production. Dates also contain significant amounts of B vitamins, such as B6 and niacin, which play a role in metabolism and nervous system health.

https://food.news/2025-02-02-hidden-dangers-of-using-weight-loss-medications.html,The hidden dangers of using weight loss medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro,0,"Advertisement With societal pressures and beauty standards that often dictate self-worth, more women are turning to weight loss medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro to shed pounds quickly and discreetly. A recent poll revealed that one in ten women is already using these so-called “fat jabs,” while nearly three-quarters are considering them. However, many are doing so in secret, fearing the stigma associated with losing weight without using traditional methods like diet and exercise. While these medications — known as GLP-1 receptor agonists — have been hailed as “miracle drugs” for their ability to curb appetite and promote significant weight loss, their growing popularity comes with a dark side. Beyond the allure of rapid results, these drugs carry serious health risks that are often overlooked in the pursuit of a slimmer figure. Weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro work by mimicking hormones that slow digestion and reduce hunger, helping users feel full for longer. While this can lead to impressive weight loss, it also comes with a host of side effects. A recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine highlighted both the benefits and risks of these medications, revealing that while they may reduce the risk of certain conditions like dementia and addiction, they also increase the likelihood of severe gastrointestinal, pancreatic and kidney issues. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In rare cases, weight loss drugs may also cause stomach paralysis, a condition where the stomach muscles stop working, leading to severe discomfort and digestive problems. More alarmingly, these drugs have been linked to pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and kidney damage, which can progress silently until it becomes life-threatening. For women who are taking these medications in secret, the risks are compounded. Without medical supervision, they may not recognize the early warning signs of these serious conditions. Additionally, the pressure to hide their use can lead to feelings of isolation and shame, further exacerbating mental health challenges. The poll also revealed that many women feel compelled to keep their use of weight loss medications a secret due to societal judgment. The idea that weight loss should be achieved solely through diet and exercise is deeply ingrained, creating a stigma around using medical interventions. This stigma can prevent women from seeking proper medical guidance, leaving them vulnerable to the risks associated with unsupervised drug use. (Related: Diane Kazer on Decentralize.TV: The dark side of WEIGHT LOSS and the rise of alternative therapies.) Moreover, reliance on these medications often overshadows the importance of addressing the root causes of weight gain, such as poor eating habits, mental health struggles or a sedentary lifestyle. While weight loss drugs can provide a temporary solution, they are not a substitute for sustainable lifestyle changes. For women seeking to lose weight without the risks of medication, here are several science-backed strategies that can help achieve sustainable results: Prioritize protein-rich foods like lean meats, fish, eggs and legumes to preserve muscle mass and keep you feeling full. Incorporate a variety of vegetables, such as leafy greens, tomatoes and bell peppers, to boost nutrient intake without excess calories. Include healthy fats like olive oil, avocados and nuts in moderation to support overall health. Combine cardio exercises like walking, jogging or cycling with strength training to build muscle and burn fat. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, as recommended by health guidelines. Foods high in dietary fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes, can help you feel fuller for longer and stabilize blood sugar levels. Consume at least 25-30 grams of fiber daily to support healthy digestion and weight loss. Stress, anxiety and depression can also contribute to overeating and weight gain. Seeking support from a therapist or counselor can help address these underlying issues. Remember that sustainable weight loss is a gradual process. Aim to lose one to two pounds per week through consistent, healthy habits rather than quick fixes like weight loss drugs. The rise in the secretive use of weight loss medications highlights the need for greater awareness of their risks and the importance of addressing weight loss holistically. Women should feel empowered to seek help without fear of judgment, whether through medical professionals, nutritionists or mental health counselors. While weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro may offer short-term solutions, they are not without significant risks. For long-term health and well-being, a balanced approach that includes proper nutrition, regular exercise and mental health support remains the safest and most effective way to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. In a society that often equates thinness with success, it’s crucial to remember that health is not just about the number on the scale — it’s about feeling strong, energized and confident in your own skin. And that’s something no medication can provide. Visit DangerousMedicine.com to learn the truth about Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and other dangerous drugs.

https://food.news/2025-01-18-natural-ways-reduce-harmful-fat-heart-tips.html,Natural ways to reduce harmful fat around the heart: Expert tips for better heart health,0,"Advertisement Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, but emerging research suggests that managing fat around the heart — a type of visceral fat — can play a critical role in reducing cardiovascular risks. Unlike subcutaneous fat, which lies just beneath the skin, visceral fat is deeper, surrounding vital organs like the heart and liver. This type of fat is particularly dangerous because it can trigger inflammation, disrupt heart function and increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular events. The good news? Experts say that natural, lifestyle-based approaches can help reduce this harmful fat and improve overall heart health. Visceral fat, including fat around the heart, is more than just a storage depot for excess calories. It’s metabolically active, releasing inflammatory substances called cytokines that can damage blood vessels and heart tissue. Over time, this inflammation can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis, which is a major contributor to heart disease. A study published in Cardiovascular Diagnosis & Therapy highlighted the dangers of visceral fat, noting that its location — especially around the heart — can predict future cardiovascular events. Dr. Sanjay Rajagopalan, a cardiovascular researcher at Case Western Reserve University, explains that this fat can even alter heart muscle function, increasing the risk of heart failure and irregular heart rhythms. Here are three approaches that can help naturally reduce fat around the heart: Dr. Sean O’Mara, a physician specializing in health optimization, emphasizes that reducing visceral fat — including fat around the heart — should be a primary focus for maintaining heart health. His program combines diet, fasting, exercise and environmental therapies to target fat at its source. Diet O’Mara recommends a carnivore-based diet that includes meat and fermented fruits, vegetables and dairy. Fermentation eliminates sugars and inflammatory compounds while preserving nutrients and gut-friendly microbes. He also recommends avoiding processed foods. Fasting Prolonged fasting is a cornerstone of his approach. Studies suggest that extended fasts can reset metabolism and burn fat effectively. Exercise Instead of long-distance running, O’Mara advocates for anaerobic activities like sprinting or brisk walking, which promote fat loss without triggering the body’s fat-storage mechanisms. Sauna and cold plunge Alternating between heat and cold exposure can stimulate the production of protective proteins that improve overall health and reduce fat. O’Mara reports that his patients often see an 80 percent reduction in heart fat within three to four months when following his program. Dr. Jack Wolfson, a board-certified cardiologist and functional medicine expert, takes a holistic approach to reducing visceral fat. His program focuses on diet, lifestyle and mental well-being. Diet Wolfson recommends the Paleo diet, which emphasizes whole, unprocessed foods like grass-fed meat, wild seafood, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Avoiding artificial ingredients and pesticides is key. Lifestyle Adequate sleep, regular sun exposure and exercise are non-negotiable. Wolfson also stresses the importance of reducing environmental toxins by using air and water purifiers. Mental health Happiness and stress management are crucial. Wolfson encourages natural strategies to combat anxiety and depression, as mental health issues are closely linked to cardiovascular risks. Supplements Instead of pharmaceuticals, Wolfson suggests evidence-based supplements like berberine and vitamin C to support heart health. Wolfson’s approach aims to lower insulin levels, a hormone that promotes fat storage, while reducing inflammation and improving cardiovascular function. Caroline Mansfield, a registered naturopath, advocates for a natural, anti-inflammatory lifestyle to reduce heart fat. Diet Mansfield believes an anti-inflammatory diet rich in leafy greens, healthy fats and lean proteins, and devoid processed and sugary foods is the key to a healthy heart. Exercise Regular moderate- to high-intensity exercise can boost metabolism and fat burning. Stress management Prioritizing sleep and relaxation helps lower cortisol, a hormone that drives fat accumulation. Detoxification Using natural products like zeolite can help remove toxins that contribute to fat storage and inflammation. Mansfield notes that these strategies not only reduce visceral fat but also improve overall metabolic and cardiovascular health. While the approaches above vary, they all emphasize the importance of diet, exercise and stress management. Here are some additional tips to keep your heart in top shape: Eat more fiber Soluble fiber, found in oats, beans and fruits, can lower “bad” LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. Include omega-3s Fatty fish like salmon and sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which protect against heart disease. (Related: A toast to heart health: How moderate wine consumption could support a healthy heart.) Limit salt and saturated fats Reducing salt intake and swapping saturated fats for healthier options like olive oil can lower blood pressure and cholesterol. Quit smoking Smoking is one of the most significant controllable risk factors for heart disease. Quitting can dramatically improve your heart health. Stay active Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week to improve cholesterol levels and overall cardiovascular health. Hydrate Drinking plenty of water supports liver function, which is essential for breaking down cholesterol. Experts agree that reducing fat around the heart isn’t just about looking better, it’s about preventing disease before it starts. By adopting heart-healthy habits, you can lower your risk of cardiovascular events, improve your quality of life and set the stage for long-term well-being. As Wolfson puts it, when losing weight with natural strategies, “fat everywhere — including around the heart — decreases.” He added that the secret lies in “keeping insulin low and inflammation in check.” The bottom line? Small, consistent changes can lead to big improvements in heart health. Whether it’s through diet, exercise or stress management, taking control of your lifestyle today can help you live a longer, healthier life tomorrow.

https://food.news/2025-01-12-moderate-wine-consumption-could-support-heart-health.html,A toast to heart health: How moderate wine consumption could support a healthy heart,0,"Advertisement For centuries, wine has been celebrated not just for its rich flavors and cultural significance, but also for its potential health benefits. Now, emerging research suggests that enjoying a glass of wine in moderation – particularly as part of a balanced diet – could play a meaningful role in supporting heart health. A groundbreaking study published in the European Heart Journal has shed new light on the protective effects of wine, revealing that moderate consumption could reduce the risk of heart disease by up to 50 percent. But before you uncork that bottle, it’s important to understand the nuances of these findings and how they fit into a broader picture of heart-healthy living. The study, led by Professor Ramon Estruch from the University of Barcelona, took a unique approach to measuring wine consumption. Instead of relying solely on self-reported data, researchers analyzed urine samples for tartaric acid, a biomarker that provides a more accurate measure of wine intake. Over four to five years, they tracked 1,232 older adults at high risk of cardiovascular disease, all of whom lived in a Mediterranean country. The results were striking: Participants who drank between 12 and 35 glasses of wine per month – roughly one glass per day – had a 50 percent lower risk of heart disease compared to those who drank one glass or less. Even those who consumed between three and 12 glasses per month saw a 38 percent reduction in risk. These benefits were comparable to or even exceeded, the effects of statins, a commonly prescribed medication for lowering cholesterol. However, the study also highlighted a crucial caveat – moderation is key. Drinking more than 35 glasses per month diminished the heart-protective effects. This underscores the importance of balance when it comes to alcohol consumption. So, what makes wine, particularly red wine, so beneficial for the heart? The answer lies in its rich concentration of antioxidants, particularly polyphenols like resveratrol. These compounds help neutralize free radicals – unstable molecules that can damage cells and contribute to chronic diseases, including heart disease. Resveratrol, in particular, has been shown to reduce inflammation, improve blood vessel function, and lower levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol or “bad” cholesterol. But wine isn’t the only source of these powerful antioxidants. Foods like peaches, sweet potatoes, tangerines and walnuts also contain polyphenols, making them excellent additions to a heart-healthy diet. For those who don’t drink alcohol, there’s no need to start solely for the sake of resveratrol. One of the most intriguing aspects of the study is its focus on the Mediterranean diet, a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds and olive oil, with moderate amounts of fish, poultry and dairy. This diet has long been associated with reduced risks of heart disease, and the study suggests that wine may amplify its benefits. Professor Paul Leeson, a cardiologist and professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Oxford, noted that the heart-protective effects of wine may only be significant when consumed as part of this dietary pattern. Leeson suggested that the health advantages of a glass of wine could only be seen “when being drunk alongside a plate of Mediterranean food.” This also highlights an important point: Like other superfoods, wine isn’t a magic elixir. Its benefits are most likely to be realized when enjoyed as part of a broader lifestyle that prioritizes nutrient-rich foods, regular physical activity and other heart-healthy habits. (Related: Blueberries: Nature’s MIRACLE MEDICINE for optimal heart health and brain function.) If you’re considering incorporating wine into your routine for its potential heart benefits, here are a few key guidelines to keep in mind: Moderation is essential The study defined moderate consumption as 12 to 35 glasses per month or roughly one glass of wine per day. For women, experts recommend limiting intake to half that of men due to differences in metabolism. Pair it with meals Drinking wine with food, particularly meals rich in fruits, vegetables and healthy fats, may enhance its benefits. Know your limits If you don’t currently drink alcohol, there’s no need to start. The potential benefits of wine can be achieved through other dietary and lifestyle choices. Choose quality over quantity Opt for high-quality wines, particularly red varieties, which tend to have higher concentrations of polyphenols. Consult your doctor If you have a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or other health conditions, it’s important to discuss alcohol consumption with your healthcare provider. The latest research adds to a growing body of evidence that moderate wine consumption, particularly as part of a Mediterranean diet, could be a valuable tool in supporting heart health. However, it’s important to remember that wine is just one piece of the puzzle. A balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management and avoiding smoking are all critical components of a heart-healthy lifestyle. The next time you drink a glass of wine, you can do so with the knowledge that, when enjoyed responsibly, it might just be doing your heart a favor.

https://food.news/2025-01-07-hidden-dangers-red-no-3-why-fda-should-ban-synthetic-food-dye.html,The hidden dangers of Red No. 3: Why the FDA should ban this synthetic food dye,0,"Advertisement The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is on the verge of making a landmark decision that could reshape the American food industry. Red No. 3, a synthetic food dye also known as erythrosine, is under scrutiny for its potential health risks, and the FDA is considering banning it from the U.S. food supply. This move comes after decades of mounting evidence linking the dye to cancer, hyperactivity in children and other serious health concerns. Despite being banned in cosmetics since 1990 due to its carcinogenic effects, Red No. 3 remains a common ingredient in thousands of food products, from candies to baked goods. Red No. 3 (erythrosine) is a petroleum-derived synthetic dye that is used to make foods bright cherry-red. It is commonly found in popular snacks like Betty Crocker products, Peeps, Pez and cake-decorating gels and maraschino cherries. But while Red No. 3, also called Red 3, adds visual appeal to food, it offers no nutritional value. Its primary purpose is to make food look more enticing, often masking the lack of natural ingredients or quality in processed foods. The controversy surrounding Red No. 3 is not new. In 1990, the FDA banned its use in cosmetics and topical medications after studies showed it caused cancer in laboratory animals. This decision was based on the Delaney Clause, a 1960 amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that prohibits the use of any color additive shown to cause cancer in humans or animals. However, the FDA allowed Red No. 3 to remain in food products, a decision that has puzzled public health advocates for decades. Recent research has only added to the concerns. A 2021 review by the California Environmental Protection Agency linked synthetic food dyes, including Red No. 3, to hyperactivity and neurobehavioral issues in children. The study found that some children are particularly sensitive to these dyes, experiencing symptoms that mimic attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Thomas Galligan, a principal scientist at the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), emphasized this point. Galligan explained that evidence “shows pretty conclusively” that when some children consume foods containing synthetic food dyes, they will experience “nervous system effects that look like ADHD.” The FDA’s potential ban on Red No. 3 follows California’s groundbreaking decision last year to ban four synthetic food dyes, including Red No. 3, by 2027. This move aligns California with stricter European Union regulations, where many synthetic dyes are either banned or require warning labels. European countries have long taken a precautionary approach to food safety, prioritizing consumer health over industry interests. (Related: STUDY: Food dye tartrazine temporarily makes skin and muscle TRANSPARENT.) Congressman Frank Pallone Jr., a vocal advocate for food safety, has been pushing the FDA to take action. In a letter to the agency, he wrote that there is “simply no reason for this chemical to be in our food except to entice and mislead consumers by changing the color of their food so it looks more appealing.” Pallone Jr. also expressed concerns that during the holiday season, which often has sweet treats in abundance, children could be eating many foods that may contain Red No. 3. Despite the growing evidence of harm, the food industry has historically resisted efforts to ban Red No. 3. In the 1980s, when the FDA first attempted to ban the dye, the maraschino cherry industry lobbied heavily to keep it on the market. Today, the National Confectioners Association argues that synthetic dyes like Red No. 3 are essential for maintaining the vibrant colors consumers expect in their favorite treats. Christopher Gindlesperger, a spokesperson for the association, has claimed that these “vibrant colors” are important to the industry. The FDA, for its part, maintains that Red No. 3 is safe when consumed in accordance with its regulations. However, critics argue that the agency’s standards are outdated and fail to account for the cumulative effects of long-term exposure to synthetic dyes. As Galligan pointed out, food dyes only make food look “pretty” so consumers will want to buy them. He added that dyes don’t have any other function except as “a marketing tool.” Red No. 3 is just one of many synthetic food dyes that have come under scrutiny. Other commonly used dyes, such as Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6, have also been linked to behavioral issues and hyperactivity in children. While these dyes are approved by both the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), their safety remains a topic of debate. Some studies suggest that certain dyes may contain cancer-causing contaminants, though regulatory agencies argue that these contaminants are present in levels too low to pose a significant risk. The inconsistency in global regulations further complicates the issue. For example, Green No. 3 is approved in the U.S. but banned in Europe, while Quinoline Yellow is allowed in the EU but prohibited in the U.S. This patchwork of regulations makes it difficult for consumers to assess the safety of the foods they eat. The potential ban on Red No. 3 represents a critical opportunity for the FDA to prioritize public health over corporate interests. By aligning U.S. regulations with stricter international standards, the agency could set a precedent for addressing other harmful additives in the food supply. As Susan Little of the Environmental Working Group explained, it doesn’t make sense that “the same products food manufacturers sell in California are sold in the EU but without these toxic chemicals.” American children “need to be protected, too,” advised Little. For consumers, the best course of action is to read labels carefully and avoid products containing synthetic dyes whenever possible. Natural alternatives, such as beet extract and beta carotene, can provide vibrant colors without the associated health risks. While these options may be more expensive, the long-term benefits to health are well worth the investment. The FDA’s impending decision on Red No. 3 is a pivotal moment in the fight for safer food. With overwhelming evidence linking the dye to cancer and behavioral issues in children, there is no justification for its continued use in food products. By banning Red No. 3, the FDA can take a significant step toward protecting public health and ensuring that the foods consumers eat are as safe as they are appealing.

https://food.news/2024-12-27-history-nutrients-health-benefits-sauteed-spinach-garlic.html,"The epic journey of sauteed spinach with garlic, a nutritious holiday side dish",0,"Advertisement During Christmas holidays, kitchens are constantly filled with the aromas of roasted meats, sweet pies and festive spices. But amidst the indulgent feasts, there’s always room for a side dish that’s both nutritious and delicious: sauteed spinach with garlic. This simple yet elegant dish is steeped in history, packed with nutrients and perfect for Christmas dinner. Spinach, the star of this dish, has a fascinating journey that spans continents and centuries. It is believed to have been initially cultivated by the Persians around 700 AD. The Persians developed an irrigation method that allowed the plant to thrive, overcoming its tendency to bolt in hot climates. From Persia, spinach made its way to China as a gift from the king of Nepal to the Chinese Emperor. By the 11th century, it had reached Spain, thanks to the Moors, and eventually found its way to Italy, where it became a beloved ingredient. One of the most intriguing chapters in spinach’s history involves Catherine de Medici, the Italian-born queen of France. Legend has it that she adored spinach so much that when she married King Henry II, she brought her love for the leafy green with her to France. Dishes featuring spinach became known as “a la Florentine,” a nod to her Florentine roots. Interestingly, during the 17th century, spinach was often cooked with sugar and used in sweet recipes, showcasing its versatility even then. (Related: The sweet saga of fruitcake: A nutritional powerhouse with a long shelf life.) In the United States, spinach faced a decline in popularity during the 1930s. However, its fortunes changed dramatically with the creation of the iconic comic strip character Popeye the Sailor Man. Created by E.C. Segar, Popeye’s love for spinach was said to be inspired by a miscalculation of its iron content in the 19th century. While spinach’s actual iron content is lower than initially thought, the cartoon’s impact was undeniable. Spinach sales soared, and the town of Crystal City, Texas, even erected a statue of Popeye in gratitude for the vegetable’s revival. Spinach is more than just a tasty green — it’s a nutritional powerhouse. One cup of raw spinach contains just seven calories and an abundance of essential vitamins and minerals. It provides 29.7 milligrams (mg) of calcium, 0.81 grams (g) of iron, 24 mg of magnesium and 167 mg of potassium. Spinach is also a great source of vitamins A, C and K, as well as folate and fiber. Iron is a standout nutrient in spinach. This nutrient is crucial for transporting oxygen in the blood and supporting healthy immune function. While spinach contains less iron than previously believed, pairing it with vitamin C-rich foods (like garlic) can enhance iron absorption. Calcium, though present in spinach, is less easily absorbed due to its oxalate content, but it still contributes to overall bone health. Spinach is also a treasure trove of active plant compounds, including lutein, kaempferol, nitrates, quercetin and zeaxanthin. These compounds play vital roles in supporting eye health, reducing inflammation and preventing chronic diseases like cancer. Studies suggest that diets rich in green vegetables, like spinach, may lower the risk of certain cancers and improve overall health. Garlic, the aromatic ingredient in sauteed spinach, is more than just a flavor enhancer; this humble bulb has been revered for its medicinal properties since ancient times. Civilizations from Egypt to China documented its use for maintaining health and healing. Today, scientists attribute many of garlic’s benefits to sulfur compounds formed when the cloves are chopped, crushed or chewed. One of the most well-known garlic compounds is allicin, which can support good health. Garlic is also a nutritional powerhouse, containing fiber, manganese, selenium, vitamin B6 and vitamin C. A single clove of garlic has just 4.5 calories but packs a punch in terms of health benefits. Garlic has been shown to boost the immune system, making it an ideal ingredient during cold and flu season. It also contains antioxidants that support overall health. Additionally, garlic contains compounds that may help lower blood pressure and improve heart health. Sauteed spinach with garlic is a dish that’s as simple as it is satisfying. The key to success lies in preparing the spinach properly. Wash the leaves thoroughly, even if they’re labeled as pre-washed, to remove any grit. Smaller leaves are generally more tender and less bitter, making them ideal for this dish. You can season your sauteed spinach with garlic with salt, pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice for a bright, zesty flavor. For a festive touch, consider adding a sprinkle of toasted pine nuts or a drizzle of balsamic glaze. Ingredients: Instructions: Serve sauteed spinach with garlic with complementary dishes like baked chicken breasts, roasted chicken thighs or a hearty meatloaf. Add some red pepper flakes to the sauteed leafy greens to give the side dish a spicy kick. Alternatively, you can add cream or cream cheese to make creamed spinach. As many families gather around the Christmas table, meals often lean toward indulgence. Rich desserts, savory roasts and creamy casseroles dominate the spread. But a side dish of savory sauteed spinach with garlic offers a refreshing contrast, balancing the richness of the meal with its vibrant green color and healthful properties. The dish’s nutritional profile makes it an excellent choice for those looking to maintain a balanced diet during the holidays. Spinach’s high fiber content promotes digestive regularity, while its magnesium content supports muscle and nerve function. Garlic’s immune-boosting properties can help keep guests feeling their best, even during the busiest time of year.

https://food.news/2024-12-26-history-nutritional-profile-health-benefits-pecan-pie.html,"Festive flavors: The sweet history, nutritional profile and health benefits of pecan pie",0,"Advertisement Pecan pie, with its golden crust and sweet, nutty filling, is more than just a holiday dessert — it’s an iconic dish for a reason. This beloved treat, synonymous with Thanksgiving and Christmas in the U.S., has a rich history that ties it to the American South, Indigenous traditions and the evolution of American cuisine. But beyond its sentimental value, pecan pie is also a surprisingly nutritious dessert, packed with health benefits that make it a festive favorite. To understand what makes pecan pie special, you should first look at its star ingredient: the pecan. Native to North America, pecans have been a staple of Indigenous diets for centuries. The Algonquin people, for example, valued pecans not only for their rich flavor but also for their nutritional benefits. The name “pecan” itself comes from the Algonquin word “pacane,” meaning “a nut that requires a stone to crack.” Pecans were a vital food source, providing sustenance during the colder months and symbolizing abundance and resourcefulness. When European settlers arrived, they adopted pecans into their own culinary traditions. Settlers in the southeastern U.S., especially the French and the Spanish, then started cultivating pecans, which thrived in the region’s warm climate. Pecans soon became a staple in Southern kitchens, symbolizing the area’s rich natural resources and the culinary traditions that grew around them. The first documented pecan pie recipe appeared in the late 19th century, but it wasn’t until the early 20th century that the dessert America knows and loves today took shape. The introduction of corn syrup, particularly Karo syrup, revolutionized pecan pie. Karo syrup’s thick, sweet consistency created the signature gooey filling that defines modern pecan pie. By the 1930s, Karo syrup’s recipe for pecan pie was printed on its bottle labels, making the dessert accessible to home cooks across the country. This marketing strategy helped pecan pie become a nationwide sensation, solidifying its place as a holiday staple. In Texas, where pecan production is a major industry, the nut holds a special place in the state’s identity. In 1919, Texas declared the pecan tree its official state tree, and in 2013, pecan pie was named the official state pie. This recognition highlights the nut’s importance to Texas’s economy and heritage, as well as its role in Southern culture. Pecan pie’s association with family gatherings and holiday celebrations makes it a beloved dessert for many. Whether it’s served at Thanksgiving, Christmas or a Sunday supper, pecan pie embodies the warmth and comfort of home. Its rich, nutty flavor and sweet filling bring people together, making it a dessert that transcends regional boundaries and connects people across the country. While the classic pecan pie recipe features a buttery crust filled with pecans, sugar, eggs and corn syrup, there are many variations that reflect regional tastes and modern dietary preferences. Here are a few popular versions: Bourbon pecan pie Adding a splash of bourbon whiskey to the filling gives this version a bold, Southern flair, often enjoyed in Kentucky and other parts of the South. Gluten-free and vegan pecan pie Modern dietary trends have led to the creation of gluten-free and vegan versions, using almond flour or rice flour crusts and plant-based substitutes for eggs and dairy. Honey pecan pie Replacing corn syrup with honey creates a slightly less sweet pie that highlights the natural flavors of the pecans. Maple pecan pie In New England, where maple syrup is a common ingredient, this variation uses maple syrup instead of corn syrup for a distinct earthy sweetness. These variations showcase the versatility of pecan pie, allowing bakers to adapt the classic recipe to suit their tastes and dietary needs. Pecan pie isn’t just delicious — it’s also surprisingly nutritious. Pecans, the key ingredient, are packed with essential nutrients that offer numerous health benefits. Here’s a closer look at what makes pecans so good for you: Copper You need copper for proper nerve function, immune health and the production of red blood cells. Fiber Pecans are a good source of dietary fiber, which aids in healthy digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut. Healthy fats Pecans are rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are linked to improved heart health and reduced inflammation Thiamine (vitamin B1) Thiamine helps convert carbohydrates into energy, keeping your body fueled throughout the day. Zinc Zinc supports immune function, cell growth, brain health and wound healing. Despite its indulgent reputation, pecan pie can be part of a balanced diet. Here are some of the health benefits associated with pecans: Antioxidants Pecans are packed with antioxidants, which help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. These antioxidants can also support good health. Brain function Pecans are rich in nutrients that support brain health, including healthy fats and antioxidants. Studies have linked regular nut consumption to improved cognition and a reduced risk of cognitive decline. Heart health Pecans are a great source of monounsaturated fatty acids, which have been shown to improve cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease. Studies have found that incorporating pecans into your diet can lower LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and improve the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol). (Related: The sweet saga of fruitcake: A nutritional powerhouse with a long shelf life.) Corn syrup is another key ingredient in pecan pie, but the syrup is actually considered more unhealthy than sugar. If you want to serve a healthier pie for the holidays, try this recipe. It features a healthy pie crust and filling. Instead of corn syrup, you can use other natural sweeteners, like raw honey or pure maple syrup. Raw honey has a mild flavor but an intense sweetness. Use it as an alternative to corn syrup without changing the taste of your pecan pie. You can also use pure maple syrup, but it will give the pie a strong maple flavor, which some guests might not like. Ingredients: Instructions: Pecan pie’s combination of rich history, cultural significance and nutritional benefits makes it a perfect dessert for Christmas. Its association with family gatherings and festive traditions adds an extra layer of meaning to this beloved treat.

https://food.news/2024-12-26-turkey-protein-packed-nutritional-powerhouse-christmas-feast.html,Not just for Thanksgiving: Turkey is a protein-packed nutritional powerhouse of Christmas feasts,0,"Advertisement Christmas is a time of tradition, family and delicious food. At the heart of many holiday celebrations is the centerpiece of the Christmas dinner: roast turkey. This iconic dish has a rich history, a nutritious profile and a host of health benefits that make it a perfect choice for the festive season. The transformation of Christmas into a family-centered holiday with a focus on food can be traced back to Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol,” published in 1843. Dickens’ portrayal of a quaint, family-oriented Christmas, punctuated by acts of charity and a hearty meal, reshaped the holiday for many Americans and Britons. Before Dickens, Christmas celebrations were often rowdy public affairs, and in America, they were even shunned by religious groups like the Puritans. Dickens’ story, however, offered a roadmap for a more intimate and wholesome celebration, one that revolved around the home and a special meal. In “A Christmas Carol,” the Cratchit family’s Christmas dinner became a symbol of the holiday’s transformation. The meal, featuring turkey, cranberries and mincemeat, was later echoed in American cookbooks, solidifying turkey as a staple of Christmas dining. By the mid-19th century, turkey had become a symbol of the festive meal, celebrated for its size, flavor and, as the world now knows, its nutritional benefits. Turkeys are native to the Americas, where they were first domesticated by indigenous peoples. The birds made their way to Europe in the early 16th century, with the first recorded arrival in Spain in 1519. By 1526, a sailor named William Strickland brought the first turkey to England, and it quickly became a delicacy among the wealthy. King Henry VIII is believed to be the first British monarch to enjoy turkey as part of his Christmas feast. The bird’s name also has an interesting history. One theory suggests that early settlers in the Americas thought turkeys were a type of guinea fowl, which were imported into Europe by Turkish traders. These birds were often referred to as “Turkish birds,” which eventually led to the name “turkey” for the new bird. Another theory posits that turkeys were imported into Europe via Turkish traders, further solidifying the connection to the name. By the 18th century, turkey farming had become widespread in England, particularly in Norfolk. Initially, turkeys were a luxury item, but by the 1840s, they had become fashionable for Christmas. Aside from Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol,” Queen Victoria also had a role in popularizing the bird. She first served turkey at Christmas in 1851. By the end of the 19th century, turkey had become a staple of the Christmas meal, particularly for the growing middle class. Turkey is a lean source of protein, low in fat – especially if the skin is removed – and rich in essential vitamins and minerals. A three-ounce serving of roasted turkey breast without the skin contains only about 1.8 grams of fat and 125 calories, making it a healthier option compared to many other holiday dishes. (Related: 3 Health benefits of cranberries, a Thanksgiving staple (recipes included).) Turkey is particularly rich in B-complex vitamins, including niacin (B3), pyridoxine (B6) and cobalamin (B12), which are essential for energy production and brain function. Turkey also provides important minerals like iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc. One standout nutrient in turkey is selenium, a powerful antioxidant that supports the immune system and helps protect cells from oxidative damage. Turkey offers several health benefits, making it an excellent choice for a festive meal. Its high protein content helps keep you feeling full and satisfied, which is especially important during the holiday season when portion sizes can get out of hand. Protein also plays a key role in muscle repair and maintenance, making turkey a great post-holiday recovery food. One of the most famous claims about turkey is that it makes you sleepy due to its tryptophan content. Tryptophan is an amino acid that helps the body synthesize protein and produce serotonin, a neurotransmitter that promotes relaxation. However, the idea that turkey is uniquely responsible for post-feast drowsiness is just a myth. While turkey does contain tryptophan, its levels are similar to those in other meats like roast beef and canned tuna. The real culprit for sleepiness is often the large amounts of carbohydrates consumed during the meal, which can cause a spike in blood sugar followed by a crash. Another benefit of turkey is its low-fat content, especially when the skin is removed. This makes it a healthier alternative to many other holiday dishes, which can be high in saturated fats and calories. By choosing turkey and avoiding the skin, you can enjoy a festive meal without overloading on unhealthy fats. While turkey is a nutritious choice, how you prepare it matters. For example, frying turkey in oil can significantly increase its fat and calorie content, as most of the oil is absorbed by the skin. To keep your holiday meal healthy, opt for roasted turkey and avoid the skin. Seasonings and marinades can add sodium, so be mindful of your intake if you’re watching your salt consumption. For those who enjoy processed turkey products like turkey sausage or bacon, it’s important to check the labels. These items often contain high amounts of sodium, which can contribute to high blood pressure and cardiovascular issues. Choosing lean cuts of turkey and avoiding processed forms is a great way to enjoy this food while keeping your diet healthy. While turkey is most commonly associated with Thanksgiving and Christmas, its popularity has grown to the point where it’s enjoyed year-round. Whether it’s a hearty turkey sandwich, a nutritious turkey soup or a simple turkey salad, this versatile bird can be part of a healthy diet throughout the year.

https://food.news/2024-12-23-history-nutritional-profile-health-benefits-gingerbread-cookies.html,"From ancient spices to modern delights: The history, nutritional profile and health benefits of gingerbread cookies",0,"Advertisement Gingerbread cookies have been a beloved treat for centuries, delighting taste buds and warming hearts during the holiday season. But beyond their festive appeal, these spiced cookies boast a rich history and some surprisingly health-boosting ingredients. From ancient ceremonial roots to modern-day gingerbread houses, gingerbread has evolved into a treat that’s as nutritious as it is delicious. The story of gingerbread began thousands of years ago, with early forms of the treat appearing in ancient Greece and Egypt. These early versions were used for ceremonial purposes, often shaped into intricate designs to honor gods and celebrate special occasions. Fast forward to the 11th century, and gingerbread made its way to Europe, thanks to Crusaders who brought ginger back from the Middle East. Initially reserved for the aristocracy, ginger and other spices eventually became more affordable, allowing gingerbread to spread to the masses. In Europe, gingerbread took on new forms and meanings. Early recipes included ground almonds, rosewater, stale breadcrumbs, sugar and ginger. The dough was pressed into wooden molds, creating intricate designs that often depicted the likeness of royalty or religious symbols. These gingerbread cookies were sometimes decorated with edible gold paint or flat white icing, making them both a treat and a work of art. By the 16th century, the English had refined the recipe, replacing breadcrumbs with flour and adding eggs and sweeteners to create a lighter, more cake-like gingerbread. Queen Elizabeth I is credited with popularizing the gingerbread man, presenting visiting dignitaries with cookies baked in their own likeness. Gingerbread became a symbol of love and friendship, often exchanged at fairs and festivals. Today, gingerbread comes in many forms, from thin, crisp cookies to cake-like versions and even gingerbread houses. The classic gingerbread cookie is a blend of ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and other spices, sweetened with molasses, brown sugar, or honey. These flavors combine to create a warm, aromatic treat that’s perfect for the holiday season. Gingerbread houses, a beloved Christmas tradition, originated in Germany after the Brothers Grimm published their fairy tales, including “Hansel and Gretel.” The tradition soon spread to the Americas, where gingerbread houses have become a staple of holiday celebrations. While they may be made of cookies, these festive creations can offer some unexpected health benefits. Despite being a sweet treat, gingerbread cookies contain several ingredients that offer real health benefits. Let’s take a closer look at the key components: Cinnamon, a key ingredient in gingerbread, is derived from the bark of cinnamon trees. This spice contains compounds like cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid and cinnamate, which have a range of health benefits. Studies have shown that cinnamon can act as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and help reduce cholesterol and blood pressure. Some research suggests that cinnamon may also have benefits for neurological disorders like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. While the amount of cinnamon in gingerbread is relatively small, it’s a reminder that this spice can be a healthy addition to a balanced diet. Ginger is the star ingredient in gingerbread, and for good reason. This powerful spice has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to aid digestion and alleviate nausea. (Related: Here’s a healthy and delicious tiger nut gingerbread cookie recipe you’ll love.) Studies have shown that ginger can help reduce nausea and vomiting and improve digestive function. Some research suggests that ginger may also help fight off cold and flu symptoms, ease arthritis pain and reduce menstrual discomfort. While the amount of ginger in gingerbread cookies may not be enough to provide these benefits on its own, it’s a reminder that small amounts of this spice can have a big impact on your overall well-being. Molasses, which is a dark, thick syrup made during the refining of sugarcane or sugar beet, add a rich sweetness to gingerbread. While it’s primarily sugar, molasses also contains important nutrients like iron, calcium, potassium, magnesium and vitamin B6. These vitamins and minerals are essential for bone health, hair growth and preventing anemia. Additionally, molasses is rich in antioxidants, which help protect the body’s cells from damage caused by free radicals. However, it’s important to remember that molasses is still a sugar, so it should be enjoyed in moderation. While it may contain some beneficial nutrients, the best way to get these vitamins and minerals is through whole foods like fruits, vegetables and nuts. Nutmeg, used in small amounts in gingerbread, has been linked to reduced inflammation and heart health benefits. While gingerbread cookies are a treat, there are ways to make them a bit healthier without sacrificing flavor. One approach is to swap out some of the less nutritious ingredients for healthier alternatives. For example: Whole wheat pastry flour, in particular, is a great option for gingerbread cookies. It’s finely ground, lighter in taste and produces tender, flavorful cookies. These substitutions can make your gingerbread cookies a bit healthier while still keeping them delicious and festive. Gingerbread cookies are more than just a Christmas treat – they’re a celebration of tradition, flavor and the surprising ways food can nourish both body and soul. So this holiday season, enjoy a gingerbread cookie and embrace the warmth and wellness it brings. Watch this clip for a tasty recipe for Tigernut Gingerbread Cookies.

https://food.news/2024-12-23-history-health-benefits-ham-with-pineapple-cloves.html,Savory symphony: The history and health benefits of ham with pineapple and cloves,0,"Advertisement When you think of festive holiday meals, ham with pineapple glaze and cloves may be one of the first foods that you think about. This classic pairing is more than just a delicious dish—it’s a culinary tradition with a rich history, a nutritional profile that packs a punch and health benefits that make it a standout choice for celebrations. Let’s dive into the fascinating story of how this dish came to be, what makes it so nutritious and why it’s worth adding to your holiday table. The story of ham and pineapple begins with exploration and innovation. In 1493, Christopher Columbus stumbled upon pineapples during his second voyage to the New World. While he was initially disappointed to find the fruit instead of gold, others, like Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo, were captivated by its beauty. Pineapples quickly became a symbol of luxury, reserved for royalty and the wealthy due to their scarcity and the high cost of shipping them to Europe. Fast forward a few centuries, and pineapples began to lose their exclusivity thanks to the invention of canning in the early 19th century. This technology made tropical fruits like pineapples accessible to the masses, transforming them from a rare delicacy into an everyday ingredient. By the early 20th century, pineapple was a staple in American kitchens, and companies like Dole and Del Monte were promoting its use in recipes, including one for baked ham with pineapple. The pairing of ham and pineapple isn’t just a coincidence. Allan Benton, owner of Benton’s Country Hams, explains that pineapple’s natural sweetness helps balance the saltiness of ham. This harmonious combination has made ham with pineapple a beloved dish around the world, from luaus in Hawaii to holiday tables in the United States. Ham, the star of this dish, is a versatile and nutrient-dense food. Made from pork legs, ham is typically preserved through salting or smoking, though the exact process varies. Despite being a processed meat, ham offers several health benefits when consumed in moderation. A 2-ounce serving of ham provides: Ham is particularly rich in selenium, an essential nutrient that supports immune function, DNA repair and thyroid health. It’s also a good source of protein, providing all nine essential amino acids, which are crucial for building muscle, supporting metabolism and maintaining overall health. Additionally, ham contains carnosine, an amino acid compound with antioxidant properties that may help reduce inflammation and improve exercise performance. Ham also offers the following health benefits: While ham is high in sodium, it also contains potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure and supports cardiovascular health. The high protein content in ham can help maintain muscle mass, which is especially important as you age. Selenium and zinc in ham play a role in strengthening the immune system, helping your body fight off infections. Pineapple, the tropical fruit that complements ham so perfectly, is more than just a sweet addition to your dish. It’s a nutritional powerhouse that offers a range of health benefits. One cup of pineapple chunks provides: Pineapple is best known for its high levels of vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that supports immune function, skin health and tissue repair. It’s also rich in manganese, an essential mineral involved in bone formation, metabolism and immune response. The fiber in pineapple promotes digestive health, while its B vitamins help your body convert food into energy. Vitamin C in pineapple strengthens your immune system, helping you stay healthy during cold and flu season. The dietary fiber in pineapple aids in digestion and can prevent constipation. Bromelain, an enzyme found in pineapple, has anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce pain and swelling. Cloves, the aromatic spice that adds depth to ham with pineapple glaze, have a long history of use in traditional medicine. (Related: Herbs and spices that support good metabolic health.) These tiny buds are packed with nutrients and offer several health benefits. One teaspoon of ground cloves provides: Cloves are an excellent source of manganese, which helps boost optimal bone health and metabolism. They also contain vitamin K, a nutrient essential for blood clotting and bone health. Clove oil is often used in dental care for its ability to numb pain and kill bacteria. Cloves can stimulate digestive enzymes, aiding in the breakdown of food and improving digestion. Impress your guests with this amazing recipe for pineapple glazed ham with cloves. Ingredients: Instructions: The combination of ham, pineapple and cloves creates a dish that is as nutritious as it is delicious. The ham provides protein and essential minerals, pineapple offers vitamins and antioxidants and cloves add a touch of spice with their own health benefits. Together, they make a meal that’s not only festive but also good for you. Whether you’re celebrating a holiday, hosting a party, or simply enjoying a special meal, ham with pineapple glaze and cloves is a timeless choice.

https://food.news/2024-12-21-fruitcake-history-nutritional-powerhouse-long-shelf-life.html,The sweet saga of fruitcake: A nutritional powerhouse with a long shelf life,0,"Advertisement Nothing says Christmas like a decadent fruitcake — or, at the very least, a silly fruitcake joke. For decades, this dense, fruit-and-nut-laden dessert has been the butt of holiday humor, with jokes about its longevity and questionable taste circulating as freely as the cake itself. But beneath the punchlines lies a rich history, a fascinating nutritional profile and a surprising array of health benefits that make fruitcake worth a second look this holiday season. Fruitcake’s origins date back to ancient times, making it one of the oldest desserts in human history. The Romans are credited with creating the first version, a simple yet practical energy bar made from barley, honey, wine and dried fruit. This early fruitcake was designed to fuel soldiers on the battlefield, proving that even in its infancy, fruitcake was a symbol of endurance and sustenance. By the early Middle Ages, fruitcake had evolved into a more refined treat, with European bakers incorporating sweet spices like cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. These aromatic ingredients were not only a sign of culinary sophistication but also a way to preserve and enhance the flavors of the dried fruits and nuts that were becoming increasingly popular in baked goods. Over time, fruitcake consumption spread across Europe, with the cake taking on regional variations that reflected local ingredients and traditions. In America, fruitcake found its footing with the arrival of European colonists. The influx of cheap sugar from the Caribbean made it possible to preserve fruit year-round, and candying fruit — a process that involves boiling it in sugar syrup and coating it in granulated sugar — became a popular method for extending the shelf life of summer harvests. This allowed colonists to enjoy the fruits of their labor well into the winter months, making fruitcakes a staple of holiday celebrations. One of the most enduring myths about fruitcake is its seemingly infinite shelf life. Stories abound of fruitcakes that have survived for decades, even centuries, thanks to their high sugar content, low moisture and the occasional soak in high-proof spirits like brandy or bourbon. These factors create an environment inhospitable to bacteria and mold, allowing the cake to remain edible for years — or even decades — if stored properly. Fruitcake’s legendary longevity made it a natural choice for mail-order businesses in the early 20th century. With the advent of Rural Free Delivery in 1896 and the Parcel Post service in 1913, fruitcake companies like Claxton’s of Georgia and Collin Street of Texas became household names. Their fruitcakes, packed in sturdy tins and shipped across the country, became a beloved holiday tradition for many American families. Despite its reputation as a dense, sugary indulgence, fruitcake offers a surprising array of nutritional benefits. (Related: Christmas pudding: A delectable, healthy treat worth serving this holiday season.) At its core, fruitcake is a blend of dried fruits, nuts and whole grains, all of which are rich in essential nutrients. Here’s a closer look at what makes this holiday treat a potential health ally: Dried fruits and nuts are rich in antioxidants, which help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. This can reduce oxidative stress and lower the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer. Dried fruits like apricots, cranberries and raisins are packed with natural sugars, fiber, potassium and iron. While the body processes these sugars similarly to refined sugars, the dried fruit also delivers a host of additional nutrients. Dietary fiber, in particular, helps promote satiety, making fruitcake a less likely culprit for overeating during the holiday season. Nuts like almonds, pecans and walnuts are a cornerstone of many fruitcakes. These ingredients are rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are known to support optimal cardiovascular health. Nuts also provide a dose of protein, which can help keep you feeling full and satisfied. When made with whole wheat flour, fruitcake offers plenty of dietary fiber, which supports digestive health and helps regulate blood sugar levels. This makes fruitcake a healthier choice than many other holiday desserts, which are often loaded with refined carbohydrates. While fruitcake does offer some health benefits, it is still an overindulgent dessert. Fruitcake’s high sugar content, even if it is natural, can contribute to blood sugar spikes if consumed in excess. Pairing a slice of fruitcake with a glass of water or a cup of tea can help slow digestion and reduce the risk of a sugar crash. This Healthy Christmas fruitcake recipe involves some soaking of the fruit used, but this step only takes 15 minutes. When you’re done, just mix all the ingredients, place it in the oven and glaze or ice it if you want to. Ingredients: Glaze (optional): Instructions: Despite its detractors, fruitcake remains a robust part of American holiday traditions. According to the Serious Eats website, over two million fruitcakes are sold each year, proving that this dessert’s staying power is as strong as ever. While it may never win over everyone, fruitcake’s rich history, unique texture and health benefits make it a worthy addition to your Christmas table. With its blend of delicious dried fruits, nuts and whole grains, fruitcake is a holiday treat that’s as nourishing as it is indulgent.

https://food.news/2024-12-19-unique-holiday-dishes-history-christmas-ham-traditions.html,Unique holiday dishes: The surprising history behind the Christmas ham tradition,0,"Advertisement When you think of Christmas dinner, what comes to mind? For many, it’s the centerpiece of the meal: a beautifully glazed, golden-brown baked ham. This festive dish has been a staple of holiday feasts for centuries, bridging ancient traditions with modern celebrations. But beyond its rich history and cultural significance, Christmas ham also offers a range of nutritional benefits that make it a healthier choice than you might expect. The tradition of eating ham during the winter months dates back long before Christmas was even celebrated. In fact, the origins of this festive dish can be traced to the ancient Germanic and Norse pagan traditions of Yule, a midwinter festival honoring the Winter Solstice. During these celebrations, wild boars were sacrificed as offerings to Freyr, the Norse god of fertility and abundant harvests. The meat from these boars was then prepared and shared among celebrants, becoming a central part of the feast. As Christianity spread across Northern Europe, the religious significance of the wild boar sacrifice faded, but the tradition of enjoying pork during the winter solstice remained. By the time Pope Julius I designated Dec. 25 as the official date to celebrate Jesus Christ’s birth in 350 A.D., the custom of eating ham had already become deeply ingrained in wintertime traditions. Over time, the wild boar was replaced with domesticated pigs, and the dish evolved into the honey-glazed or baked ham that is known and loved today. Interestingly, the connection between ham and Christmas isn’t just about tradition — it’s also tied to religious identity. In some parts of Europe, particularly Spain, Christians historically ate pork to distinguish themselves from the region’s large Muslim population, who abstain from consuming pork. (Related: Christmas pudding: A delectable, healthy treat worth serving this holiday season.) Of course, not every culture celebrates Christmas with ham. In the United Kingdom, turkey reigns supreme as the star of the Christmas dinner table, while in Italy, fish and pasta take center stage. In Sweden, the traditional “julebord” features an array of cured meats, cheeses and fish. Despite its varying popularity, ham has remained a beloved holiday dish in many Western countries, with Americans alone purchasing over 318 million pounds of ham during the Christmas season. So, what makes ham such a popular choice for holiday meals? Beyond its rich flavor and festive appearance, ham offers a surprising array of nutrients that contribute to its nutritional value. A 3.5-ounce serving of cooked ham contains approximately: While the high sodium content is a drawback, ham is also packed with essential vitamins and minerals, including: These nutrients make ham a valuable addition to your holiday meal, especially when paired with other nutrient-dense dishes like vegetables, whole grains and fruits. Despite being classified as processed red meat, ham offers several health benefits when consumed in moderation. High-quality protein Ham is an excellent source of lean protein, which is essential for building and repairing tissues, maintaining muscle mass and supporting overall health. Protein also helps keep you feeling full, which can be especially helpful during the indulgent holiday season. Essential vitamins and minerals The vitamins and minerals in ham play a crucial role in maintaining optimal health. For example, selenium protects your cells from damage caused by free radicals, while thiamin supports your body’s ability to convert food into energy. Niacin and phosphorus contribute to healthy skin, digestion and bone strength. Energy boost The combination of protein and B vitamins in ham helps your body produce energy more efficiently, making it a great choice for fueling up during busy holiday gatherings. Traditional Christmas ham is glazed and offers a delicious combination of sweet and salty. However, the amount of butter, brown sugar and honey that goes into the glaze isn’t always good for your gut. If you’re watching your sugar intake, the recipe below is a great alternative because it is free from dairy, sugar and gluten. This glaze is a delicious alternative to the usual honey maple glaze. Ingredients: Instructions: Christmas ham is more than just a holiday tradition – it’s a dish with a rich history and a surprising nutritional profile. While it’s important to enjoy it in moderation, the nutrients it provides can make it a valuable part of your festive feast. Whether you’re celebrating with family, friends or loved ones, Christmas ham is a delicious reminder of the joy and nourishment that food brings to your life.

https://food.news/2024-12-18-nutritional-historical-look-at-eggnog.html,A toast to tradition: A nutritional and historical look at EGGNOG,0,"Advertisement As the holiday season approaches, the aroma of cinnamon, nutmeg and pine fills the air, and with it comes the tradition of sipping on a creamy, indulgent drink: eggnog. Whether you’re gathering around the fireplace or attending a festive party, eggnog is a beloved holiday treat that has been enjoyed for centuries. But what exactly is eggnog? Where did it come from and is it a healthy choice for the holidays? Keep reading to learn more about the nutritional profile, health benefits and rich history of this seasonal favorite. Eggnog’s roots trace back to medieval Europe, where a drink called “posset” was popular. Posset was a mixture of hot, sweetened milk curdled with ale or wine, often spiced with ingredients like figs and eggs. By the 17th century, sherry had replaced ale or wine, making posset a luxurious drink reserved for special occasions. This rich beverage eventually made its way to Colonial America, where rum from the Caribbean became the liquor of choice. (Related: Here’s a healthy and delicious tiger nut gingerbread cookie recipe you’ll love.) The exact moment when posset became known as eggnog is unknown, but the popularity of this drink soared. In fact, eggnog’s appeal was so strong that it sparked a riot at West Point in 1826. When cadets were told they would be served alcohol-free eggnog, they smuggled in whiskey, leading to the infamous Eggnog Riot. Today, eggnog remains a symbol of celebration and togetherness, with variations like Mexico’s “rompope” and Peru’s pisco-infused version adding to its global charm. Eggnog is undeniably rich and creamy, but its nutrient content varies depending on the recipe and ingredients used. A four-ounce serving of traditional, non-alcoholic eggnog contains about 200 calories and 10 grams of fat. While this may seem indulgent, it is worth noting that eggnog is packed with nutrients like protein, calcium and vitamins A and D, thanks to its milk and egg base. However, adding alcohol, such as brandy or whiskey, increases its calorie count. For example, a single ounce of brandy adds 65 calories, and many recipes call for double that amount. This can push the calorie count of a single serving to 265 – 330 calories. Meanwhile, vegan versions of eggnog made with almond or coconut milk are lower in calories and fat, making them a lighter alternative for those watching their intake. Despite its indulgent reputation, eggnog offers several health benefits. The combination of milk and eggs provides a good source of protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth. The calcium in milk supports bone health, while vitamins A and D promote good health and support healthy skin. The warm spices often added to eggnog, such as cinnamon and nutmeg, also offer health perks. Cinnamon, for instance, has been shown to boost overall well-being, while nutmeg contains antioxidants that can also support good health. These spices not only enhance the flavor of eggnog but also add a touch of wellness to your holiday celebration. If you’re concerned about the sugar and calorie content of traditional eggnog, there are several ways to enjoy a healthier version. One option is to reduce the amount of sugar in your recipe. Instead of using granulated sugar, try a natural sweetener like honey or maple syrup, which can add a subtle flavor boost without causing blood sugar spikes. Another approach is to use plant-based milk, such as almond or coconut milk, as the base. These alternatives are lower in calories and fat, making them a great choice for those looking to lighten up their eggnog. You can also skip the alcohol if you’re watching your calorie intake or prefer a non-alcoholic option. Making a booze-free eggnog reduces your caloric intake by almost 100 calories. If serving a non-alcoholic eggnog is not an option, try cutting your alcohol serving in half. If you want to avoid the health risks of using raw eggs, consider using pasteurized eggs or a vegan recipe. Pasteurized eggs are heat-treated to eliminate bacteria like Salmonella, ensuring a safer option for everyone. You can also heat your eggnog to at least 160 F (71 C), which is sufficient to kill most pathogens. Alternatively, you can buy store-bought eggnog, which is pasteurized and ready to drink without heating. Vegan versions, made with ingredients like cashews and spices, offer a creamy texture and festive flavor without the need for eggs or dairy. Eggnog’s versatility has led to countless variations across the globe. In Mexico, “rompope” combines almond paste and milk with spices like vanilla and cinnamon. Puerto Rican “coquito” swaps heavy cream for coconut milk. These adaptations showcase the creativity and cultural diversity of eggnog, making it a truly international holiday treat. The recipe below uses plant-based milk instead of whole milk, light coconut milk instead of heavy cream, and maple syrup or honey instead of refined sugar. This healthy version is easy to make and is just as creamy and delicious as classic eggnog. Ingredients: Instructions: Notes: It is normal for the eggnog to thicken more as it cools. However, if the eggnog is too thick after refrigeration, whisk in a bit of additional plant-based or coconut milk to reach your desired consistency before serving. It is also normal for eggnog to separate a bit over time. Stir it before serving to blend the ingredients back together and ensure an even texture. Eggnog is more than just a holiday drink — it is a symbol of joy, tradition and togetherness. While it may be indulgent, it also offers nutritional benefits and can be enjoyed in healthier forms. Whether you’re sipping on a classic recipe or experimenting with vegan alternatives, eggnog is a delightful way to celebrate the season.

https://food.news/2024-12-17-christmas-pudding-delectable-healthy-treat-holiday-season.html,"Christmas pudding: A delectable, healthy treat worth serving this holiday season",0,"Advertisement Christmas is a time of tradition, indulgence and celebration, and for many British households, the festive season wouldn’t be complete without the iconic Christmas pudding. Served with brandy sauce, brandy butter or custard, this dense, fruit-packed dessert has been a staple of Christmas dinners for centuries. But beyond its rich, indulgent taste and cultural significance, the Christmas pudding is also a surprisingly nutritious treat packed with health benefits. Let’s dive into the fascinating history, nutrient profile and health perks of this beloved holiday dessert, as well as how you can make it healthier if you’re watching your sugar intake. The origins of the Christmas pudding date back to the 14th century, when it began as a humble dish known as “frumenty.” This early version was more like a savory porridge, made with hulled wheat, boiled in milk and seasoned with spices like cinnamon and saffron. It was often associated with meatless days, such as Lent and Advent, and was a simple dish meant to sustain the body during periods of abstinence. Over time, the recipe evolved, incorporating other ingredients like beef, currants, mutton, prunes, raisins, spices and wine. By the 17th century, the dish had transformed into something closer to the sweet pudding that is consumed today, with the addition of eggs, breadcrumbs, dried fruit and spirits like brandy or beer. (Related: Pumpkin spice latte: Savor the perfect beverage for late autumn.) It was the Victorians who perfected the recipe, turning it into the Christmas pudding that is celebrated today. The pudding traditionally contains 13 ingredients, symbolizing Jesus and the 12 disciples. These ingredients typically include brandy, brown sugar, breadcrumbs, citron, currants, eggs, flour, lemon peel, milk, mixed spices, orange peel, raisins and suet. The flaming brandy is said to represent the passion of Christ, adding a dramatic flair to the presentation. While the Christmas pudding may seem like an indulgent treat, its ingredients are surprisingly nutritious. Here’s a breakdown of the health benefits packed into this festive dessert: Fiber-rich fruits Dried fruits like currants, prunes, raisins and sultanas are rich in dietary fiber, enzymes, polyphenols (antioxidants), vitamins and minerals. These fruits are also high in potassium and iron, making them a great addition to your diet. While dried fruits do contain natural sugars, they have a lower glycemic index, meaning they won’t spike your blood sugar as quickly as other sweet treats. Digestion-friendly prunes Prunes are known for their ability to support healthy digestion, relieve constipation and protect cells from free radical damage, thanks to their high antioxidant content. Heart-healthy raisins A flavorful ingredient, raisins are not only delicious but also packed with fiber and iron. These nutrients can support good health. Nutritious nuts Almonds, hazelnuts, pecans and walnuts are often added to the pudding mix. These nuts are rich in healthy fats, vitamin E, polyphenols and melatonin, which can all boost your overall well-being and even improve sleep quality. Antioxidant-rich spices The mixed spices in a typical Christmas pudding — such as allspice, cinnamon, cloves and ginger — are not just for flavor. These spices are rich in antioxidants and can support optimal digestive health. They can also help reduce bloating, cramps and nausea, making them a great addition to a heavy holiday meal. Underrated carrots Often overlooked, carrots are a secret ingredient in many Christmas pudding recipes. Rich in beta-carotene (which the body converts to vitamin A), carrots are good for supporting optimal eye health and boosting your overall well-being. This recipe retains the rich, festive flavors of a traditional Christmas pudding while being lighter, sugar-free and gluten-free. It’s a great option if you want to enjoy the holidays without overindulging in decadent desserts. Ingredients: Instructions: The best way to reheat this tasty, healthy Christmas pudding is to steam it again. Steam it for one and a half hours before serving. The pudding will keep well for three or four days, but if you want to store it for longer, freeze it. Wrap the pudding well before freezing.

https://food.news/2024-08-14-study-ergothioneine-mushrooms-help-extend-lifespan.html,Study suggests ergothioneine in mushrooms can help extend your lifespan,0,"Advertisement Mushrooms are a great addition to many savory dishes. Research suggests the benefits offered by mushrooms go beyond the kitchen. Several studies have found that a compound in mushrooms can help extend the human lifespan. One recent study looked into the potential benefits of fungi-derived bioactive compounds on lifespan and health span. The study also highlighted the importance of finding interventions to minimize age-related diseases. Another study published in the Nutrition Journal investigated the health benefits of mushrooms. Researchers found that mushroom consumption is linked to a longer lifespan. They credited this benefit to mushrooms’ high content of ergothioneine, an antioxidant amino acid found in fungi and bacteria. While conducting the study, researchers reviewed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‘s Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The 20-year prospective cohort study involved 15,000 participants. Results revealed that the people who included mushrooms in their diet had a 16 percent lower chance of early death. The researchers also discovered that consuming one serving of mushrooms per day instead of processed meat reduced the chances of dying prematurely from any cause by at least 35 percent. The research team explained that this benefit may be due to ergothioneine’s antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. They also suggested that ergothioneine’s anti-aging properties could stem from its ability to protect against telomere shortening. Telomeres are usually described as protective “caps” for chromosomes. These long strings of delicate, elaborately folded DNA act like the protective plastic tips on shoelaces that help prevent fraying and damage. Longer telomeres are associated with better cellular health and are also usually linked with longevity. But telomeres naturally shorten over time, which makes them less able to preserve the structure of chromosomes. Shorter telomeres are linked with aging and chronic degenerative disease. In a study with participants over 60, those with shorter telomeres were three times more likely to die of heart disease than those with longer telomeres. They were also at least eight times more likely to die from infections. In another preliminary study published in the Journal of Dietary Supplements in 2022, a research team discovered that treating cells with ergothioneine for eight weeks alleviated telomere shortening from oxidative stress. They suggested that this can help potentially avoid mutations in DNA that could cause cancer. The researchers concluded that the results support “a potential role for ergothioneine in oxidative stress-related conditions and healthy aging.” Ergothioneine also supports longevity by helping to replenish and recycle glutathione, the body’s master antioxidant. Data also suggests that ergothioneine offers a valuable “trifecta” of anti-aging gifts: supporting longer telomeres, protecting DNA and recycling glutathione. In a separate study, scientists found that people over 60 were found to display lower levels of ergothioneine. They added that those over 60 with mild age-related cognitive impairment showed even sharper declines in this important amino acid. This is bad because ergothioneine, which helps protect brain cells from oxidative stress, is believed to help aging adults maintain healthy cognition and memory. Test tube and animal studies have indicated that ergothioneine may also help support memory by creating new neurons or brain cells. In a trial published in the Japanese Journal of Pharmacology, the research team gave both healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment a mushroom extract containing 5 mg of ergothioneine a day for 12 weeks. They found that the supplementation resulted in significant improvements in verbal memory, working memory and sustained attention for both the healthy and the mildly impaired volunteers. (Related: 6 Mushrooms you can eat to prevent cognitive impairment and reduce your dementia risk.) Aside from its anti-aging properties, ergothioneine also helps support a healthy immune system, promotes optimal cardiovascular function and supports healthy skin. Ergothioneine is even used in skincare serums and creams to reduce the appearance of fine lines and soothe redness and irritation. It is also used in products that help fight against damage and photoaging caused by ultraviolet radiation. Visit NaturalMedicine.news for more research about mushrooms and other superfoods.

https://food.news/2024-07-15-5-science-backed-health-benefits-of-garlic.html,5 Science-backed health benefits of garlic,0,"Advertisement Many savory dishes feature garlic, a flavorful superfood. According to scientific data, garlic offers many amazing health benefits, such as supporting optimal heart health and protecting against cancer. Known scientifically as Allium sativum, garlic is a culinary staple and an impressive powerhouse of bioactive compounds with beneficial effects on human health. Garlic is a great source of potassium, which helps with muscle contraction and heart function. Garlic also contains selenium that your body uses for reproduction and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) production. Human knowledge is under attack!

Additionally, garlic contains manganese, a mineral that is used by the body for building strong bones and maintaining a healthy immune system. Here are five science-backed benefits of incorporating garlic into a balanced diet: According to a study published in the journal Proceedings From the National Academy of Sciences, consuming garlic boosts the production of hydrogen sulfide. This bioactive compound acts as a powerful antioxidant and assists with cellular signaling to increase circulation and relax blood vessels. This could explain why garlic has long been known as a natural treatment that can also prevent heart disease, which includes atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, heart attack and stroke. A study published in the Journal of Dietary Supplements revealed that consuming crushed raw garlic significantly improved fasting blood sugar, waist circumference, cholesterol levels (both by lowering triglyceride levels and raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels) and blood pressure in those with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a deadly collection of comorbidities, including high cholesterol, high blood sugar, high blood pressure and excessive abdominal fat. According to a meta-analysis published in the journal Gastroenterology, consuming vegetables from the Allium family, which includes garlic, onions, leeks and chives, significantly reduces someone’s risk of developing stomach cancer. Several studies have also suggested that garlic consumption can reduce the risk of cancer in the brain, esophagus, lungs and prostate. (Related: Harness the legendary power of garlic, the everyday superfood, with this simple recipe.) A meta-analysis published in the journal Food & Nutrition Research evaluated nine randomized controlled trials looking at garlic consumption in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The results revealed that there were statistically significant improvements in blood sugar and other key diabetic biomarkers when the subjects took garlic supplements, which contained a compound called allicin, with daily amounts ranging from 0.05 to 1.5 grams. A cross-sectional study published in the journal BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders revealed that women who regularly consume garlic and other Allium vegetables had a significantly reduced risk of hip osteoarthritis. The authors suggested that this could be due to diallyl disulfide, a compound in garlic believed to repress enzymes that break down skeletal bone matrixes. Additionally, diallyl disulfide is well-known due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, contributing to garlic’s ability to support optimal cardiovascular health and protect against various diseases. Other reported benefits of garlic include a reduced risk of preterm delivery, alcohol-induced liver damage and the common cold. Now that you know about the health benefits of garlic, how much garlic do you need to eat to reap these benefits? The exact amount isn’t confirmed yet. According to a study published in the journal Proceedings From the National Academy of Sciences, a concentration of garlic extract equivalent to about two medium-sized garlic cloves per day should be enough. That may sound like a lot, but garlic is a versatile ingredient. You can easily add it to almost any meal, such as homemade salad dressings, hummus, chicken, fish, meat, poultry, stir-fry, omelets and more. Here are more ways to add garlic to your regular diet: Eat it raw This isn’t the most palatable way to consume garlic, but research, such as an August 2013 study published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology, suggests that garlic loses its powerful anti-inflammatory properties once it has been heated. Know the right way to prepare garlic If you are going to cook garlic, chop, slice, or smash the cloves for at least 10 minutes before putting it on the heat. Preparing garlic this way initiates an enzymatic process that maximizes its health-boosting benefits. Try an aged garlic extract If you can’t stomach the taste of fresh garlic or have trouble with it due to indigestion, try a high-quality aged garlic extract instead. Make garlic bread at home Follow the steps below to make garlic bread: Store garlic cloves in the pantry or a cupboard in your kitchen. Room-temperature places that remain cool and dark are the perfect places to store garlic. If you’re worried about having smelly “garlic breath,” chew on raw mint. You can also try eating lettuce, fennel seeds, or apples after a garlicky lunch or dinner. If you have a heart condition and are taking heart medications, keep in mind that garlic and garlic extracts may interact with certain drugs, such as blood thinners.

https://food.news/2024-06-10-fda-proposes-ban-popular-food-additive-bvo.html,FDA proposes ban of popular food additive linked to negative side effects,0,"Advertisement The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has finally proposed a ban on a popular food additive used in various consumer foods and beverages that has been linked to many negative side effects. Brominated vegetable oil (BVO) is a food additive that is used to help emulsify citrus-flavored soft drinks and prevent the flavoring ingredients from separating during distribution. BVO contains bromine atoms which are bonded to the triglycerides that are derived from vegetable oil. The concern with BVO is due to the presence of bromine, an element also found in brominated flame retardants. Some research has suggested that excessive consumption of BVO can lead to bromine accumulation in the body, potentially causing adverse effects.

Because of these health concerns, BVO has been subjected to scrutiny and regulatory action in various parts of the world: The Food and Drug Administration explained that it wants to “revoke the regulation authorizing the use of BVO in food.” Officials have concluded that the use of the oil in food is no longer considered safe, especially since several studies have suggested that it could possibly cause adverse effects in people. According to the FDA’s announcement, BVO is a vegetable oil that is modified with bromine. In 1970, the FDA ruled that BVO was no longer “Generally Recognized as Safe” and started monitoring its use under the agency’s food additive regulations. Throughout the years, many beverage makers reformulated their products to replace BVO with an alternative ingredient. Now, only a few beverages in the U.S. contain BVO. Recent toxicology studies conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health have also given the FDA conclusive scientific evidence to support the agency’s proposal to remove its food additive authorization for BVO. There has been controversy regarding the use of the oil for many years, and some other countries have already banned BVO from being used in food. Reports have also suggested that the ingredient bromine can irritate the skin and the mucous membranes. Additionally, long-term exposure can cause neurologic symptoms such as headaches, memory loss and impaired balance or coordination. BVO is often included on the nutrition facts list on diet soda drinks. It is also used in the following products: The food additive is typically derived from corn or soybean oil. In 2013, PepsiCo announced that it would remove BVO from Gatorade products. And in 2014, Coca-Cola announced the removal of BVO from all its products.

https://food.news/2024-05-09-maker-prime-drinks-sued-pfas-excessive-caffeine.html,Maker of Prime drinks sued over PFAS and claims of excessive caffeine in its beverages,0,"Advertisement The maker of the Prime beverage line has been sued over claims of its beverages containing both so-called “forever chemicals” and excessive caffeine. The class-action lawsuit against Prime Hydration LLC was filed on April 8 in the Southern District of New York. Poughkeepsie, New York resident Lara Vera filed the suit in federal court on behalf of herself and other shoppers who purchased Prime products across the country. The plaintiffs accused Prime Hydration of “misleading and deceptive practices” concerning the company’s 12-ounce (oz) energy drinks. Despite being advertised as having only 200 milligrams (mg) of caffeine, the drinks actually contain between 215 mg and 225 mg.

According to Vera, she bought Prime’s Blue Raspberry products several times in August 2022 for about $3 to $4 each. However, she added that she would have avoided them if she had known the actual caffeine content. The Poughkeepsie resident is seeking $5 million from Prime Hydration, USA Today reported. (Related: Michelle Obama’s juice brand fails health standards set by her husband’s administration.) The suit pointed out that Prime’s 200 mg of caffeine is equivalent to “half a dozen Coke cans or nearly two 12-oz Red Bulls.” One 12-oz can of Red Bull energy drink contains 114 mg of caffeine, and one cup of coffee contains around 100 mg of caffeine. It also reiterated that “there is no proven safe dose of caffeine for children.” Common side effects for kids consuming caffeine may include headaches, rapid or irregular heartbeats, seizures, shaking and an upset stomach. Aside from physical side effects, the complaint also said that caffeine may have adverse emotional effects on the mental health of children. Moreover, the lawsuit also referenced a call by U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate Prime energy drinks due to their dangerously high caffeine levels. In a letter, the senator for the Empire State said vague marketing targeting young people encouraged parents to buy a “cauldron of caffeine” for their children. Prime Hydration was founded in 2022 by YouTubers Logan Paul and KSI (born Olajide Olayinka Williams “JJ” Olatunji). Paul has since joined professional wrestling, becoming the World Wrestling Entertainment franchise’s United States Champion. Meanwhile, Olatunji has transitioned into a professional boxing career after he and Paul duked it out in the ring back in 2018. While their products are growing more popular and lucrative, the company is still dealing with class action suits because of the ingredients in their energy and sports drinks. Prior to Vera’s lawsuit, Prime Hydration was sued in 2023 over a variant allegedly containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), or “forever chemicals.” The class-action lawsuit filed Aug. 2, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleged that Prime Grape flavor drink contained PFAS as per independent third-party testing. This complaint was filed by the Milberg law firm, which specializes in class action lawsuits, on behalf of lead plaintiff Elizabeth Castillo and other similarly affected consumers. According to the law firm, Prime Hydration “generated more than $250 million in retail sales in its first year, including $45 million in a single month.” Castillo’s suit is seeking a $5 million judgment – a small amount compared to the company’s profits. A news release by Milberg said PFAS are dubbed “forever chemicals” as they “bioaccumulate,” or accrue, in the body over time. The chemicals have been found to have adverse effects on both the human body and the environment, they added. Head over to CleanFoodWatch.com for more similar stories.

https://food.news/2024-05-09-eating-one-avocado-day-improve-diet-quality.html,Study: Eating an avocado a day can help improve overall diet quality,0,"Advertisement As a superfood full of “healthy” fat, avocados are popular among health enthusiasts or those trying to support their overall well-being. According to a study published in Current Developments in Nutrition, consuming one avocado per day may also help “improve overall diet quality.” The study was led by a team of researchers from Pennsylvania State University’s Department of Nutritional Sciences. The team included Kristina Petersen, associate professor of Nutritional Sciences, and Penny Kris-Etherton, retired professor of Nutritional Sciences. Human knowledge is under attack!

For the study, the research team investigated how food-based intervention, specifically one avocado per day, can affect overall diet quality. The findings are important because poor diet quality is a risk factor for many diseases, including heart disease. Additionally, many American adults have poor diet quality and do not meet key dietary recommendations provided by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. According to Petersen, avocados are a nutrient-dense food and they contain a lot of fiber and other important nutrients. While conducting the study, the researchers tried to find out if the regular intake of avocadoes would result in “an increase in diet quality. Petersen said previous observational research suggests that avocado consumers have higher diet quality compared to non-consumers. As a result, the research team developed the study to find out if “there is a causational link between avocado consumption and overall diet quality.” Petersen explained that because only two percent of American adults are regular avocado consumers, the researchers tried to confirm if including avocados in someone’s daily diet could significantly increase their diet quality. Before the study, researchers conducted phone interviews with participants. Interviews were also conducted throughout the study to find out what their dietary intake was like in the previous 24 hours. The researchers also evaluated their diets using the Healthy Eating Index to measure how well they adhered to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The researchers worked with 1,008 participants divided into two groups. One group continued with their usual diet and limited their avocado intake during the 26-week study. The second group incorporate one avocado a day into their diet. Petersen said the participants who consumed one avocado per day “significantly increased their adherence to dietary guidelines.” This suggests that some strategies, like eating one avocado per day, “can help people follow dietary guidelines and improve the quality of their diets.” (Related: Latest EWG consumer’s guide reveals 2024’s DIRTY DOZEN and CLEAN FIFTEEN.) In the study, the researchers classified avocados as a vegetable and they observed an increase in vegetable consumption attributed to the avocado intake. Some participants also used avocados to replace some unhealthier options. Petersen warned that having poor diet quality significantly increases one’s risk for conditions like heart disease, kidney disease, Type 2 diabetes and other preventable diseases. She advised that improving people’s adherence to dietary guidelines is an effective way of helping reduce their risk of developing chronic conditions and “prolong healthy life expectancy.” Petersen has conducted similar studies about the impact of food-based interventions, including the link between pistachios and diet quality. However, she added that more research is needed to find out what other food-based strategies can be used to improve people’s adherence to dietary guidelines. Avocados can easily be incorporated into diets through making green smoothies or adding them to scrambled eggs. Avocados can also be used as a substitute for dips like mayo and sour cream. Here are some tips on how to incorporate an avocado into nutritious meals: Seasoned Keep things simple by sprinkling avocados with a bit of salt and pepper. Other flavorful seasonings to try include balsamic vinegar, cayenne pepper, lemon juice or paprika. Cut an avocado into chunks and add your preferred seasonings and spices before serving. On toast Start the day with avocado on toast, a healthier substitute for regular spreads like butter and margarine. Avocado can also be pureed as a spread on toast and sandwiches for a more nutritious meal. In salads Studies also suggest that the extra calories from fat and fiber in avocados may help keep people fuller for longer. This can then help reduce calorie intake at subsequent meals. Because salads can be light in calories, adding avocados can make them a more filling meal. In soups Avocados can be used as the main ingredient in avocado soup. Chunks of the superfruit can also be added into other soups. Go to Fruits.news for more stories about avocados and other nutritious fruits that should be part of a balanced diet.

https://food.news/2024-05-01-ewg-consumers-guide-2024-dirty-dozen-clean-fifteen.html,Latest EWG consumer’s guide reveals 2024’s DIRTY DOZEN and CLEAN FIFTEEN,0,"Advertisement The latest edition of the Environmental Working Group (EWG) annual consumer’s guide has found that almost three-fourths of the non-organic fruits and vegetables they sampled contained traces of toxic pesticides. The EWG’s 2024 “Dirty Dozen,” which include strawberries and spinach, tested at levels closer to 95 percent. In the EWG researchers’ report titled “2024 Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides In Produce,” they revealed that four out of five of the most frequently detected pesticides found on the 12 most-contaminated produce items were fungicides that could have serious side effects on consumer health. We are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

Every purchase at HealthRangerStore.com helps fund our efforts to build and share more tools for empowering humanity with knowledge and abundance. Alexa Friedman, an EWG senior scientist, warned that these fungicides “can disrupt the hormone function in our body.” She added that the chemicals were also associated with things such as “worse health outcomes” and negative effects on the male reproductive system. Researchers reported that the four fungicides detected on the Dirty Dozen produce included fludioxonil, pyraclostrobin, boscalid and pyrimethanil. Two of the fungicides – fludioxonil and pyrimethanil – had the highest concentrations of any pesticide detected. The EWG’s annual Dirty Dozen and Clean Fifteen lists are based on a review of Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration data. For the 2024 lists, EWG looked at data from 47,510 samples of 46 fruits and vegetables. 2024’s Dirty Dozen list is similar to previous years, with strawberries, spinach and hearty greens taking the top three spots. Below is the full list: Friedman explained that it’s possible fungicides were seen in high concentrations compared to other types of pesticides because they are often sprayed on produce later in the process. Farmers usually spray fungicides after harvest to protect crops from mildew or mold as they are transported to the grocery store. Aside from fungicides, testing also revealed the presence of the neonicotinoids acetamiprid and imidacloprid which, as neuro-active insecticides, can harm bees and other pollinators. Neonicotinoids have also been linked to issues affecting the development of children’s nervous systems. Testing also confirmed the presence of pyrethroid insecticides like cypermethrin and bifenthrin. While there are fewer studies on these pesticides, existing research has warned that they may also harm children’s brains. More than one in 10 pear samples tested positive for diphenylamine, a compound that is currently banned in the European Union over cancer concerns. While most of the pesticides detected in the Dirty Dozen are legal, scientists also found acephate, an organophosphate insecticide that is essentially prohibited for use on green beans. One sample tested positive for levels at an alarming 500 times the Environmental Protection Agency‘s (EPA) legal limit. (Related: Herbicide in every bite: GLYPHOSATE detected in 100% of U.S. fast-food brands tested.) The EWG also reported that at least 65 percent of the conventional items on the Clean Fifteen list were pesticide-free. Below is the full list: The consumer’s guide is primarily aimed at helping shoppers make informed choices as they choose between conventional and organic items, which are often more expensive or harder to find. Friedman said EWG always recommends that shoppers “consume as many fruits and veggies as possible, whether they’re organic or conventional.” However, for people worried about consuming pesticides, EWG recommends checking the consumer’s guide to prioritize which fruits and vegetables to buy organic to help reduce pesticide exposure. EWG recommends prioritizing organic versions of Dirty Dozen items to limit possible exposure to contaminants. Overall, EWG encourages policymakers and regulators to be more proactive in understanding the risks posed by pesticides and protect consumers from them. Friedman said that conducting research that focuses on the side effects of these pesticides, specifically the pesticides that were found in high detection in 2024, can help researchers learn more about how these could affect the health of susceptible populations, such as children. She also explained that even though many of the pesticides detected in tests were at or below legal limits set by the EPA, “legal doesn’t always mean that they’re safe for everyone.” To illustrate, EWG researchers discovered in a 2020 study that for nearly 90 percent of common pesticides, the EPA had failed to apply an extra margin of safety for children when setting limits.

Fortunately, some prepping skills can help you on your journey, such as learning how to preserve food. By using the proper food preservation techniques, you can keep your harvest fresh and edible, even without a refrigerator or freezer. (h/t to PreppersWill.com) Note that even though refrigeration slows down spoilage, it doesn’t halt it completely. Meanwhile, food preservation methods can actively inhibit bacterial growth and other decay processes, ensuring that food doesn’t go to waste. Human knowledge is under attack!

Dehydration is a traditional food preservation method that uses the power of the sun to remove moisture from food and significantly extend its shelf life. This technique can also be used if you prefer convenient modern electric dehydrators. While electric dehydrators offer a controlled environment, the basic principles remain the same when harnessing the power of the sun. If you want to save money, you can create a simple solar dehydrator using readily available materials. (Related: Why freeze-drying is the best food preservation method.) For example, you can use wood frames with screens stretched taut to create a platform for the food to lie on. Place this dehydrator in direct sunlight for several hours so the sun’s heat can naturally dehydrate the food. To dehydrate food successfully regardless of the method, you must make sure that the food is thoroughly dried. Properly dehydrated food will have a crisp texture. This means that no moisture could cause spoilage. Dehydrating is great for fruits and vegetables such as: Canning is another classic food preservation method that has stood the test of time. While advancements in food science have resulted in the refinement of canning techniques, the core principle is the same: Using the method, you create a shelf-stable food product by destroying microorganisms that cause spoilage and sealing the food in airtight containers. There are two main types of canning: Water bath canning and pressure canning. Water bath canning is best for high-acid foods like fruits (applesauce, peaches and pears), some vegetables with added pickling liquid (pickles, relish) and certain condiments (BBQ sauce, jams and tomato sauce). Using this canning technique, the filled jars are submerged in simmering water until they reach a temperature high enough to destroy harmful bacteria. Meanwhile, pressure canning is best for low-acid foods like broths, dry beans, meats, vegetables and cooked dishes (baked beans, chili, soups and stews). For pressure canning, you need a pressure canner that traps steam and raises the temperature above boiling, ensuring the safe preservation of low-acid foods. While usually done on a stovetop, both water bath canning and pressure canning can be adapted for off-grid use. Keep in mind that you need a reliable heat source like a fire pit or BBQ and a way to accurately monitor the temperature throughout the canning process to ensure food safety. As the name implies, you will need salt for salting various foods. Like dehydration, this technique actively extends the shelf life of food by drawing out moisture and inhibiting microbial growth. The salting process involves the generous application of salt directly onto the food. You can do this by creating a thick salt rub or packing the food into a bed of coarse salt. After the initial salting, the food must be placed in a cool area for an extended period, usually one month, to allow the dehydration process to take effect. Once cured, the food is ready for cooking. Alternatively, you can use a brine solution. You will need enough water to cover the food completely, and then slowly add salt while stirring until a layer of undissolved salt forms on the bottom. The food is then submerged in the brine and stored in a cool location for a week or more, depending on the size and type of food. Salting is a versatile technique that is best for meats, fruits, vegetables and eggs. However, this method has several downsides, such as requiring a lot of salt and time. Additionally, the preserved food will have a higher sodium content, which might not be ideal for someone who has to monitor their sodium intake for health reasons. Smoking is a food preservation method that uses smoke to naturally extend the shelf life of various foods. This technique is best for meats, fish, fruits and vegetables. There are two main types of smoking: Cold smoking and hot smoking. With cold smoking, you need to keep the temperature below 100 F as the smoke slowly dries out the food within one to five days. This method typically requires additional preparation, such as curing meat with salt ahead of time or cooking it fully to prevent bacteria growth during the slow drying process. If possible, use a smokehouse for cold smoking to keep the meat away from direct flames. Hot smoking cooks the food at around 220 F. This method is quicker, but hot-smoked meats still require refrigeration after smoking. For long-term storage, dehydrate the hot-smoked meat after the initial smoking process. Smoking is versatile. You can choose this method if you prefer a certain smoker design and you can either purchase or make your smoker. Here are some alternatives to refrigeration that you can try after SHTF. The icebox or ice room is a food preservation method that uses ice harvested during the winter months to keep food cool during the warmer seasons. Iceboxes are well-insulated containers, often made of wood, that have a compartment for storing ice. The ice slowly melts, which provides a cool environment for the stored food. Meanwhile, ice rooms are larger, often walk-in structures, that are built with thick walls and insulation to retain the cool air generated by all the stored ice. Note that these methods require planning and a dedicated ice harvesting routine if you are looking for a reliable approach to off-grid cooling. The root cellar is a traditional and highly effective off-grid cooling solution. These underground chambers utilize the natural insulating properties of the earth to maintain a cool, stable temperature year-round, which is ideal for storing different food items. There are many guides online on how to construct different kinds of root cellars. Some need a hole dug in the ground, while others can be built using a closet in your home. Root cellars offer a slightly cooler environment to store fruits and vegetables. If you have the space and resources, you also have the option to build a root cellar or basement in your home. Use these structures for long-term food storage. A zeer pot is a traditional food preservation method that uses clay pots and evaporation for cooling. To make a zeer pot at home, you will need two terracotta pots. Make sure one is slightly smaller than the other. Place the smaller pot inside the larger one. Fill the gap between the two pots with sand. This sand will act as a heat sink, absorbing and retaining cool temperatures. Keep the sand damp. As the water evaporates from the sand, it draws heat away from the inner pot, which creates a cooler environment. Cover the larger pot with a terracotta lid, metal lid, or a damp cloth to minimize evaporation from within the pot itself. The zeer pot should be kept in a shady area for optimal cooling effect. This method is best for fruits and vegetables. Note that the damp environment can attract insects, so you need a secure lid. If you want to live off the grid and become self-sufficient, learn how to harvest and preserve food properly so you have access to a variety of food year-round.

https://food.news/2024-04-23-honey-amazing-superfood-with-many-health-benefits.html,Honey: An amazing superfood with many health benefits,0,"Advertisement Honey is an amazing superfood that is full of nutrients and antioxidants. It also has antibacterial properties, making it a great addition to your prepper medicine cabinet or survival food stockpile. Here’s why you should start stocking up on honey before SHTF. (h/t to FoodStorageMoms.com) Honey is a sweet liquid that honeybees produce from plant nectar. A common ingredient in many foods, honey is available in several different forms, such as raw honey or Manuka honey. Honey also has several health benefits and is a common ingredient in many home remedies and alternative medicine treatments. Human knowledge is under attack!

One tablespoon (20 grams) of honey contains the following nutrients: Because honey is essentially pure sugar, it contains no fat and only trace amounts of protein and fiber. While honey contains small amounts of some nutrients, most people don’t usually consume enough for it to be a significant dietary source of vitamins and minerals. However, honey is a great addition to a healthy diet because it is a great source of health-promoting plant compounds called polyphenols. Minimally-processed honey is a great source of different important bioactive plant compounds and antioxidants, such as flavonoids and phenolic acids. Darker honey varieties offer more antioxidants than lighter varieties. Antioxidants can help neutralize reactive oxygen species in the body, which can build up in your cells and cause damage. Data suggests that this damage may be linked to health issues such as heart disease, premature aging and Type 2 diabetes. One study suggests that honey may also help protect against heart disease because it helps improve blood fat levels, lower blood pressure, regulate your heartbeat and prevent the death of healthy cells. These factors can help boost heart function and health. In an observational study, researchers worked with more than 4,500 volunteers over 40. The results showed that moderate honey intake was linked to a lower risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) among women. Raw honey usually contains propolis, a resin that bees produce from sap-producing trees and similar plants. Data suggests that propolis may improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you are worried about blood sugar management, honey may offer some benefits over regular sugar. While honey raises your blood sugar level like other types of sugar do, the antioxidants in honey may help protect against metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes. Scientists have revealed that honey may increase adiponectin levels, a hormone that reduces inflammation and improves blood sugar regulation. Data also suggests that daily honey intake may improve fasting blood sugar levels in individuals diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Coughing is a common health issue for children with upper respiratory infections. These infections can affect both sleep and quality of life for children and parents. According to a review of several studies on honey and cough in children, honey seems to be more effective than diphenhydramine for cough symptoms. Honey may also help reduce cough duration. Another review revealed that honey may also help improve sleep quality among children with coughs, along with their parents. As a bonus, unlike some cough medicines, honey doesn’t have any negative effects. (Related: Herbs and honey: 7 Natural home remedies for a cough.) In the past, honey has been used topically to help treat wounds and promote burn healing. The practice is still common today. According to a review of 26 studies on honey and wound care, honey was most effective at healing partial-thickness burns and wounds that have become infected after surgery. Data also found that Manuka honey may have positive applications in burn treatments. Keep in mind that if you have a severe burn, home remedies are not a viable substitute for emergency care. Seek medical attention instead. Researchers think that honey’s healing powers are due to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. You need to shop smart when buying honey. Just because a container says it contains honey, it may not be honey. In other cases, it may only contain a tiny percentage of honey. Try to look for organic or raw honey because some producers dilute honey with plain syrup. While honey adulteration is illegal in most countries, it is still a widespread issue. Some containers may also have some harmful ingredients that you don’t want to feed your family. Remember that honey is a type of sugar and that consuming it will cause your blood sugar levels to rise. Additionally, eating large quantities of honey, especially consistently over a long period, can contribute to weight gain and increase your risk of diseases like heart disease or Type 2 diabetes. Honey is easy to incorporate into a balanced diet. You can get a small boost of antioxidants from honey by using it as a natural sugar alternative. You can use honey as a glaze for roasted vegetables or grilled meats for a caramelized finish. Try adding honey to baked goods like cakes, cookies and muffins for added moisture and sweetness. You can also add honey to marinades or sauces to give savory dishes a hint of sweetness. Try combining a bit of honey with mustard or mayo for a simple and tasty sandwich spread or veggie dipping sauce.

https://food.news/2024-04-15-betalains-beets-reduce-fatigue-boost-athletic-performance.html,Study: Betalains in beets can help reduce fatigue and boost athletic performance,0,"Advertisement Studies have shown that beets offer many benefits, such as promoting heart health. Data has also revealed that the nutritious root vegetable contains natural plant pigments and phytochemicals that have science-backed abilities to sustain and boost the health and function of several body systems. Additionally, a recent study found that unique compounds in beets can help fight oxidative stress and inflammation. Researchers also reported that these compounds may help reduce fatigue, boost energy levels and even improve athletic performance. Human knowledge is under attack!

Support our efforts to build the infrastructure of human freedom by shopping at HealthRangerStore.com, featuring lab-tested, certified organic, non-GMO foods and nutritional solutions. The study was published in the journal Current Nutrition Reports. For this study, the research team analyzed betalains for their therapeutic potential. Betalains, the natural plant pigments responsible for the bright red color of beets, have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. These compounds also boost the levels of beneficial nitric oxide in the body, in turn helping to relax arteries and improve blood flow and circulation. The researchers said this increases the availability of oxygen, which leads to enhanced performance during exercise. The review authors credited betalains with alleviating exercise-induced fatigue and improving sports performance. The new review builds on previous studies, such as a small randomized controlled trial published in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise that showed how beet juice can improve oxygen use and enhance performance in a group of amateur cyclists exercising at simulated high altitudes. (Related: Un-beet-able: Study shows beetroot can boost athletic performance.) The authors of the recent review also mentioned other studies showing how betalains could help ease exercise-induced muscle damage. Both professional and amateur athletes know that intense physical activity can damage skeletal muscles, which causes symptoms like stiffness, pain and loss of muscle strength that can last from two to 14 days. People who have overexerted themselves at the gym may understand the aching and weakness that can follow after intense physical activity. Fortunately, beets and beet juice might offer some relief. A 2024 study published in the journal Nutrients found that beetroot extracts can significantly decrease blood levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and malondialdehyde. For the study, researchers observed 32 elite athletes who had just run a marathon. The results of the 2024 study also revealed that beet extracts boost the activity of glutathione, a potent antioxidant and detoxicant produced in the body. The research team suggested that beetroot supplementation “positively influences” recovery from muscle damage. The 2024 study also supports the findings of an earlier article published in the journal Sports Medicine, where researchers credited betalains with reducing post-exercise muscle damage, inflammation and fatigue. They also added that the compounds helped speed recovery after workouts. Experts also think that the same properties of beets that enhance athletic stamina, like boosting increasing nitric oxide and promoting blood flow, can support optimal heart health. Aside from betalains, research has suggested that healthy levels of potassium in beets can help lower blood pressure. In addition, one cup of cooked beets contains four grams of fiber, which can help support lower levels of homocysteine. This can offer benefits because excessive amounts of homocysteine have been linked to heart disease. Sarah Thomsen Ferreira, a registered dietitian, has advised that beets can help improve arterial health and reduce LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. Beets are savory and earthy with a satisfying consistency. A low-calorie superfood, beets may help create a sense of fullness that can reduce overeating and fight against obesity. As a bonus, beets can help stabilize blood sugar. These root crops are also a good source of folate, a B vitamin that can help prevent strokes.

https://food.news/2024-04-05-essential-guide-storing-organic-foods-for-survival.html,An essential guide to storing organic foods for survival,0,"Advertisement Many non-preppers who want to start storing food for their survival stockpile often wonder how to begin. If you’re one of them, keep things simple and start small, so you don’t get overwhelmed. Prepare for the next big one now and stock up on essential survival food supplies, like organic canned food or food buckets with beans and grains. (h/t to TheSurvivalMom.com) Start with a manageable goal, like preparing one week’s worth of food. Next, try planning for the most likely scenarios in your neighborhood, like a power outage or a blizzard. Human knowledge is under attack! Governments and powerful corporations are using censorship to wipe out humanity's knowledge base about nutrition, herbs, self-reliance, natural immunity, food production, preparedness and much more.

Support our efforts to build the infrastructure of human freedom by shopping at HealthRangerStore.com, featuring lab-tested, certified organic, non-GMO foods and nutritional solutions. To keep the list manageable, only include items that your family likes to eat so nothing goes to waste. You should also avoid buying things that require refrigeration once opened, like mayonnaise. One week’s worth of food, or about twenty-one full meals, that your family will eat and doesn’t require refrigeration is the ideal starting point for a newbie prepper who wants to try food storage. Because power outages are one of the most common survival scenarios, start thinking of ways you can prepare and store food without power. Consider getting a solar oven or a small gas stove so you can still cook even without electricity. Alternatively, you can build a fire outdoors so you can cook. (Related: Unlocking the mastery of bucket food storage: Essential for complete preparedness.) Use either a pen and notebook or a computer program like Excel to lay out your meal plan. Create columns to track each day and rows for each meal. You can also include snacks and drinks. Before SHTF, learn how to meal plan using a system that works for you. Breakfasts that are easy to prepare include peanut butter, chicken sandwiches, or soup with bread for lunch. Some dinner suggestions include chili, chicken fried rice, pasta with chicken and vegetables, rice and beans, spaghetti, tortellini soup and taco soup. Quick snacks include nuts, dried fruit and common pantry items like cheese crackers. For drinks, stock up on one gallon of water per person then add beverages like dry milk, drink powder, coffee, or tea. After you decide on the dishes for your meal plans, check each one and make a grocery list of what you would need for that week’s worth of food. Don’t forget to include seasonings for the meals and ingredients for bread. Keep in mind your individual family members’ food and drink preferences while you plan your meals so you only buy items that everyone won’t mind eating a lot of after SHTF. List the food item you need to stock up on and the minimum amount you have as a goal. You can either buy the amount of a food item you need all at once or spread it across several smaller purchases so you don’t have to shell out a lot of money in one go. Try not to pay for items at full price. To save more money, check which stores offer promos and sales on items that you need for your stockpile. It can take you a week or at least one month to buy all items, depending on how many items you buy and if you buy them when there is a sale. Note that most sales usually happen around major holidays.

https://food.news/2024-04-05-largest-producer-eggs-halts-production-avian-flu.html,Largest producer of fresh eggs in the U.S. halts production because of claimed avian flu outbreaks in Texas and Michigan,0,"Advertisement Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., the largest producer of fresh eggs in the U.S., reported on Tuesday, April 2, that it had temporarily paused production at a Texas plant after bird flu was found in chickens. Bird flu was also detected at the company’s poultry facility in Michigan. In a statement, Cal-Maine Foods, which is based in Mississippi, said an estimated 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets, or about 3.6 percent of its total flock, was destroyed after avian influenza (also known as bird flu) was found at the facility in Parmer County, Texas.

The plant in Texas, Ridgeland, is on the Texas-New Mexico border in the Texas Panhandle about 85 miles southwest of Amarillo and about 370 miles northwest of Dallas. According to the company’s statement, Cal-Maine Foods is cooperating with federal, state and local government officials and focused industry groups to “mitigate the risk of future outbreaks and effectively manage the response.” The company also said it is working to “secure production from other facilities to minimize disruption to its customers.” Additionally, Cal-Maine Foods has claimed that there is no known bird flu risk associated with eggs that are currently on the market. The company also didn’t recall any eggs. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, eggs that are properly handled and cooked are safe to eat. The announcement by Cal-Maine comes one day after state health officials announced that one person was diagnosed with bird flu after being in contact with allegedly infected cows. Officials have also said that the risk to the public remains low. Michigan’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has reported that Michigan State University’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has also detected bird flu in a commercial poultry facility in Ionia County. The county is located 100 miles northwest of Detroit. The department added that it received confirmation of the disease on April 1, Monday, from the lab. It is the fourth time since 2022 that bird flu was detected at a commercial facility in Michigan. Jennifer Holton, the department’s spokesperson, explained that state law prohibits the department from disclosing the type of poultry at the facility in Ionia. She added that the facility was placed under quarantine and that the department does not foresee any disruptions to supply chains across the state. The human case recorded in Texas marks the first known instance worldwide of a human getting infected with this version of bird flu from a mammal, said federal health officials. According to reports, dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were infected with avian flu last week. Soon after, federal agriculture officials confirmed infections in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received cows from Texas. The company said Cal-Maine sells most of its eggs in the Southwestern, Southeastern, Midwestern and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. (Related: Hong Kong recently banned U.S. poultry amid bird flu outbreak in 5 states.) Bird flu primarily spreads through close or unprotected contact with infected birds. Most cases in humans have occurred after someone has had unprotected exposure to sick or dead infected animals. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), bird flu viruses infect birds’ respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which causes them to shed the virus via their saliva, mucous and feces. Humans and other mammals can get infected when they get enough virus in their eyes, nose or mouth, or inhale it into their lungs. Those who have had close contact or unprotected contact with infected animals for long periods are at greater risk of infection. Avian flu can cause mild upper respiratory issues or severe illness, including pneumonia and multiple organ failure that results in death. In the U.S., the disease usually spreads because of wild birds. However, outbreaks in commercial poultry or backyard flocks that have resulted in deaths have been reported in 48 states since February 2022. It’s rare for humans to be infected with avian flu. The only other human case in the country occurred in 2022, when someone incarcerated in a Colorado prison was exposed to poultry infected with bird flu. On April 2, the CDC explained that the current public health risk is low and that there is no person-to-person spread of bird flu so far. The organization said it is a vital measurement that would prompt concern for the spread of bird flu. Officials also advised that there is still an increased risk for poultry, livestock and farmers and workers in these sectors, along with veterinarians, veterinary staff and first responders who respond to cases.

Food and water supplies will ensure that you have enough to eat and drink and give you the energy you need to accomplish various tasks that might need doing after a disaster, like repairing damage to your home. Water Get at least one gallon of water per person per day for at least three days. You will need clean water for drinking and personal sanitation. If you have extra space in your garage or stockroom, try to prepare extra water, allocating four gallons per person per day. This should be enough for your hydration, cooking, sanitation and limited laundry needs. Non-perishable/shelf-stable food If possible, prepare a three-day supply of non-perishable food, or close to it, such as: These non-perishable items will provide sustenance without requiring refrigeration. Manual can opener Electric can openers are convenient, but when preparing an emergency prepping kit it’s better to include a manual can opener so you can still eat canned food even during a power outage. (Related: Prepping tips: How to prepare a food storage starter kit.) Water purification tablets or filters Since clean water is key to your survival, you can benefit from having water purification tablets or filters in your kit. If the water supply becomes contaminated, you can use items like purification tablets or a portable water filter to make water safe for consumption. These items are essential for maintaining proper hygiene and for treating minor medical emergencies after SHTF. Prescription medications If someone in the family has asthma, diabetes, hypertension or other health conditions that require prescription medications, look into getting extra supplies of those. If possible, try to get enough medication that will last them at least several days. First aid kit Find a sturdy container and turn it into your first aid kit. Include the following first aid supplies: Don’t forget other supplies for babies or older people. Basic personal hygiene items Prepare toiletries like soap, shampoo, toothbrushes and toothpaste so you can maintain proper hygiene even after SHTF. You might also need items like dust masks, a solution for your contact lenses and hand sanitizer for disease control during emergencies. Miscellaneous personal hygiene products Women in the family will need various feminine hygiene products like pads or tampons. If you have a baby at home, stock up on diapers and baby wipes. Even if you don’t have an infant at home, moist towelettes or baby wipes can be used to maintain cleanliness when water is scarce. You should also get extra toilet paper and paper towels. Garbage bags You will need garbage bags for proper waste disposal and sanitation purposes. These items are important for keeping everyone at home safe. Portable radio Use a battery-operated or hand-crank radio to stay informed about all emergency updates and news broadcasts. If you have a NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) weather radio, you can check the weather conditions at all times. Flashlights Prepare several flashlights and extra batteries for battery-powered devices. Use the flashlights to provide illumination during power outages. You can also get solar flashlights that you can charge in window sills when the sun is up. Whistle Tiny but important, a whistle can be used as a signaling device when SHTF or to attract attention if you need rescue. Multi-tool or Swiss army knife A multi-tool has many uses, and you may need one for cutting, opening, or repair work. Other useful tools for your tool kit include: These items will help you stay warm and shelter you if you have to bug out after a disaster. Warm clothing When preparing kits for the family, include a spare change of clothes with items like hats, gloves, socks and additional layers so you can stay warm in inclement weather. If possible, the kits should have a complete change of clothing for each family member. If your area has severe rain storms, you should also have rain gear in addition to a change of clothes. A pair of sturdy shoes or boots Shoes protect your feet, especially if you have to walk in an area with debris or if you need to walk long distances as you bug out. Plastic sheeting and duct tape If you need to evacuate, you can use these items for temporary shelter or to seal windows and doors in case of damage. Tent or tarpaulin sheet It’s ideal to have a portable shelter option for outdoor emergencies or evacuation scenarios. Thermal blankets Use thermal blankets to stay warm, especially in cold weather conditions. If you live in very cold climates, you may need a sleeping bag for all family members. Communication and navigation Maps and other tools in this section can help you navigate if you need to bug out. Compass and local maps These navigational tools will help you find your way if you can’t use your GPS or electronic devices. Signal flares Use signal flares if you need to signal for help or alert rescue teams to your current location. Portable battery or hand-crank charger With a portable battery, you can keep your electronic devices charged for communication and information access. Emergency/survival whistle An emergency or survival whistle can be used as an additional signaling device to attract attention after SHTF. These supplies are crucial if you have food in your kits that require cooking. Matches or lighters Store matches or lighters in a waterproof container so you can use them even in wet conditions. Portable stove or camp stove With a portable stove, you can cook and boil water when traditional methods are unavailable. Cooking utensils Your kits should include pots, pans, utensils and other cooking tools for meal preparation. To conserve water, include paper cups and plates along with plastic utensils for multiple meals. Fire extinguisher Make sure you have a fire extinguisher to put out small fires and prevent them from spreading. Pet supplies If you have pets, they’ll also need food, water and supplies. Their kits should include pet food, a leash, a collar with an ID tag, a pet carrier and additional items specific to your pet like treats and toys.

Sodium aluminum phosphate is an additive often used in food products as an emulsifying agent, leavening acid and stabilizer. It is a white, odorless solid that is slightly soluble in water. Sodium aluminum phosphate is used to make a variety of commercially baked goods like biscuits, cakes and muffins. It is also used for baking powders and self-rising flours and in processed cheeses to improve their texture and melting properties. Sodium aluminum phosphate is also used in school lunches and fast food items, like hamburger buns and pizza dough, said Wolf. Wolf warned that people are often exposed to sodium aluminum phosphate, especially if they consume food products like processed baked goods like burgers and frozen pizza. She also called for sodium aluminum phosphate to be “taken out of our food supply.” Chemicals company Innophos sells sodium aluminum phosphate under the brand name Actif-8. The product’s brand safety data sheet has classified sodium aluminum phosphate as a “hazardous substance or preparation” that can cause serious eye damage and skin and respiratory irritation. The safety data sheet also warned that users must avoid breathing dust, fumes, gas, mist, vapors, or sodium aluminum phosphate spray and to wash “thoroughly after handling.” The Innophos safety data sheet also advised users to wear protective gloves and eye or face protection when handling sodium aluminum phosphate. If inhaled, Innophos warned that sodium aluminum phosphate “may cause upper respiratory tract irritation.” Additionally, ingesting large quantities of the toxic additive may cause negative side effects such as abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. However, despite these warnings, Wolf explained that sodium aluminum phosphate is still often used to make various food products without safety precautions for consumers. “People who handle this product have to suit up and ventilate and avoid eye and skin and lung irritation, yet it is also used to make food that children are eating, warned Wolf. She also discussed a summary of peer-reviewed scientific literature on aluminum reproductive toxicity by Robert A. Yokel, published in the journal Critical Reviews in Toxicology. According to the review, aluminum exposure may cause “adverse reproductive outcomes in male and female mammals.” Yokel’s analysis also suggested that “male reproductive endpoints were significantly affected after exposure to lower levels of [aluminum] than females.” Increased aluminum intake resulted in higher concentrations of the metal in the fetus, placenta and testes in both male and female mice and rats. The proposed mechanism for aluminum’s reproductive toxicity was linked to “oxidative stress as the initiating event, followed by increased DNA damage, impaired spermatogenesis and reduced testosterone levels and sperm count.” Christopher Exley, a researcher on aluminum toxicity and the author of “Imagine You Are An Aluminum Atom: Discussions With Mr. Aluminum,” praised Wolf’s efforts to bring the toxic effects of sodium aluminum phosphate to a wider audience. Exley cautioned that humanity is now “in the [aluminum]” age and that it is becoming harder to avoid sodium aluminum phosphate exposure. He also warned that the additive “has a significant impact upon human health — including the male reproductive system.” Exley, who is a leading expert on aluminum toxicity, has studied the effects of aluminum exposure on human health with his team at Keele University in the United Kingdom. Exley and his research team have also looked into the additive’s potential link to autism. In a 2014 study published in the journal Reproductive Toxicology, Exley and his fellow researchers provided “unequivocal evidence of high concentrations of aluminum in human semen.” The research team also warned about “concerning implications for spermatogenesis and sperm count.” In 2017, Exley published research that showed how two months of aluminum exposure at human dietary levels negatively affected spermatogenesis and sperm quality in rats. According to Wolf, the studied effects of ingesting aluminum correspond to observed declines in masculinity, muscle mass and libido among younger men. She also warned that some environmental factors, like aluminum exposure, could help explain increased rates of depression, disinterest in sex and weight gain among men. Wolf also warned that sodium aluminum phosphate may cause brain inflammation, dementia and Parkinson’s disease. She also said that other potential sources of aluminum exposure include antacids, cookware, vaccines and geoengineering projects that “spray aluminum particles into the atmosphere.” Wolf was “horrified” to find proof of a “chemical war on men” that is targeting traditional masculinity, along with “the ability to strengthen a physical relationship” and in turn a family, or to fight in a “hot war.” Wolf also criticized the Food and Drug Administration’s oversight of food additives like sodium aluminum phosphate, particularly the agency’s “extraordinarily corrupt and negligent” handling of Pfizer’s Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine trials. According to Wolf, the FDA has not recalled lead-contaminated cinnamon applesauce products, instead claiming that manufacturers and distributors must make sure that their products are not contaminated with harmful chemicals. She advised consumers to have a more proactive approach to avoid aluminum-containing food additives. Wolf said that shoppers should always check ingredient labels and remove products with aluminum from their pantries. Go to Ingredients.news for similar stories about other dangerous food additives.

https://food.news/2024-03-26-6-benefits-preserving-food-through-freeze-drying.html,"Beets, berries and more: 6 Benefits of preserving food through freeze-drying",0,"Advertisement When you’re getting ready before SHTF, stocking up on healthy and long-lasting freeze-dried foods like berries and vegetables is an important part of your preparedness plan. Detailed below are some of the benefits of freeze-dried food, such as a long shelf life and nutrient retention. (h/t to WeLovePrepping.com) Freeze-drying is a food preservation method that reduces the surrounding pressure to allow the frozen water in the food to sublimate directly from solid to gas. This method removes up to 98 percent of the food’s moisture content. The lack of water in the processed food makes it impossible for spoilage reactions to occur. It also greatly reduces weight and volume. Human knowledge is under attack!

https://food.news/2024-03-19-apple-cider-vinegar-daily-supports-weight-loss.html,"A serving of apple cider vinegar a day can support healthy weight loss goals, new study reveals",0,"Advertisement According to an experimental study, apple cider vinegar may help with weight loss, reduce blood glucose levels and reduce blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides). However, the research team advised that you still need to do more than just consume apple cider vinegar every day. Details of the study were published in the journal BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health. Apple cider vinegar is made from fermented apples and is naturally high in acetic acid.

This superfood is also popular among health enthusiasts because it offers several health benefits, from antibacterial properties to antioxidant effects and the potential to help control blood sugar. Apple cider vinegar’s origins as a health tonic can be traced to Hippocrates, who used it to treat wounds, fever and skin sores. (Related: Natural healing: A warming apple cider vinegar recipe that helps boost your immune health.) For the experimental study, a research team in Lebanon conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving overweight and obese young volunteers aged 12 to 25 years old. The scientists randomly placed 30 participants in one of four groups. The participants were instructed to consume either five, 10 or 15 milliliters (mL) of apple cider vinegar diluted in 250 mL of water every morning before they ate anything for 12 weeks. The control group consumed an inactive drink – a placebo – made from lactic acid added to water to look and taste the same. This sort of study usually provides high-quality evidence because it can demonstrate cause and effect that the intervention, which is apple cider vinegar, results in a specific outcome. The study was also double-blinded, which means neither the volunteers nor the research team involved with collecting the data knew who was in which group. After three months, data revealed that the regular consumption of apple cider vinegar was linked with a significant decrease in body weight and body mass index (BMI). On average, the volunteers who drank apple cider vinegar during that period lost six to eight kilograms (13 to 18 pounds) in weight and reduced their BMI by 2.7 to three points, depending on the dose. The volunteers also showed significant decreases in the waist and hip circumference. Additionally, the scientists observed significant decreases in levels of blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol in the apple cider groups, which echoes previous studies. The placebo group, who consumed water with lactic acid, had smaller decreases in both their weight and BMI. There were also no significant decreases in their blood glucose and blood lipids. Before you take apple cider vinegar, keep in mind that it is acidic and there are concerns that it may erode tooth enamel. This can be an issue with other acidic beverages, including fizzy drinks and sodas, lemon water and orange juice. To reduce the risk of acid erosion, some dentists recommend the following after drinking acidic drinks: This study offers some evidence of a potential connection between apple cider vinegar and weight loss. But before health professionals can recommend this as a healthy and natural weight loss strategy, experts recommend conducting bigger and better conducted studies across a wider age range. Such research must be conducted with a controlled background diet and exercise across all volunteers to provide more robust evidence that apple cider vinegar could be a useful aid for healthy weight loss. But if you don’t mind the acidic taste of apple cider vinegar then you could try consuming a bit to help with weight loss, alongside a balanced diet. This study does not suggest that you can eat whatever you want and drink apple cider vinegar as a way to control your weight.

https://food.news/2024-03-14-research-pineapples-digestive-health-pain-sports-injuries.html,Research shows pineapples can support digestive health and ease pain from sports injuries,0,"Advertisement Pineapples are sweet and delicious tropical fruits. A popular ingredient for fruit and green smoothies, studies have also shown that pineapple offers several health benefits, such as supporting digestive health and relieving sports injuries. Despite their name, pineapples don’t grow on pine or apple trees. In the 17th century, pineapples were named the way they were because, at the time, the term “apple” was applied to unknown fruits. And pineapples looked like pinecones. We are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware. Explore our decentralized, peer-to-peer, uncensorable Brighteon.io free speech platform here. Learn about our free, downloadable generative AI tools at Brighteon.AI. Every purchase at HealthRangerStore.com helps fund our efforts to build and share more tools for empowering humanity with knowledge and abundance. Pineapples originated in South America. By the 15th century, the tropical fruit reached Europe and India because sailors found that eating pineapples helped support their overall well-being during their long voyages. There are now over 100 different pineapple varieties sold worldwide, mainly from Costa Rica, Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. Experts think that pineapple’s therapeutic value is mainly due to bromelain. The proteolytic enzyme bromelain is found in different supplements and herbal preparations. The most important substance in pineapple is bromelain. Bromelain is still being studied for its potential use in other medical applications. As a proteolytic enzyme, bromelain helps break down the protein molecules in food for optimal absorption and digestion. This characteristic is also linked to other beneficial actions. The copper levels in pineapples may help maintain neural pathways in the brain, which then helps support cognitive function. According to a 2017 study in Iran, pineapple juice positively affected the cognitive ability of memory-impaired mice subjects to recognize objects. The scientists concluded that pineapple has the potential to treat certain cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, pineapples may help support mental health by reducing anxiety and improving mood due to tryptophan and magnesium. Both are known to help boost the body’s production of serotonin, the substance that elevates mood. Pineapples contain fiber and potassium, which can both support heart health by reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Potassium is vital in regulating blood pressure, while fiber helps lower cholesterol levels. (Related: Grapefruit found to help reduce high blood pressure.) Pineapple antioxidants are flavonoids and phenolic compounds that reduce inflammation and damage from free radicals. The results of a laboratory study on rats revealed that these antioxidants may have heart-protective effects by reducing cardiac oxidative stress and inflammation. Bromelain was first identified in 1891 and has been used as a dietary supplement for gastric upset and inflammation for over 50 years. Eight proteolytic substances have also been isolated from bromelain. Bromelain therapy is used with pancreatic insufficiency patients who are unable to produce enough digestive enzymes. Aside from bromelain helping digest the proteins in food, pineapple fiber also contributes to gut mobility and healthy bowel elimination. Bromelain is used for sports injuries and swelling because of its anti-inflammatory effect, especially on the muscles, joints and soft tissue. One clinical study revealed that, when administered to boxers, bromelain “completely cleared all bruises on the face and hematomas of the orbits, lips, ears, chest, and arms in four days.” The magnesium in pineapple also helps relieve muscle cramps and fatigue. The first critical step in burn or wound care is to treat the affected area before systemic complications such as inflammation and infection set in. Bromelain gel is typically used to remove as much of the damaged skin as possible so cells can regrow with minimal scarring. Some studies have suggested that bromelain may reduce bruising, inflammation, swelling and pain after surgery. Bromelain has also been found effective in controlling pain after periodontal surgery. Some topical skin cosmetics products contain bromelain because it has exfoliation properties that can help remove damaged tissue. Cancer is a chronic disease linked to uncontrolled cell growth. Cancer progression is linked to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Studies have found that pineapples have cancer-fighting compounds, such as beta-carotene, bromelain, quercetin and vitamin C, that are known to support the immune system and neutralize harmful free radicals, which helps minimize oxidative stress and reduces inflammation. Research has also found that bromelain can reduce tumor growth, induce cell death, and reduce inflammation. According to a laboratory study, bromelain was able to suppress the growth of breast cancer cells. Another study also revealed that the compound inhibited the growth of colon cancer cells. Research is still being conducted to help experts learn more about pineapple’s anti-cancer properties. Some cancer centers also include pineapple in their patients’ daily diets. Fresh pineapples are imported from warm climates and the fruits are in season during the spring, fall and winter. Frozen and fresh pineapple are naturally sweet and free of added sugars. You can enjoy frozen pineapple any time of year. However, some brands of canned pineapple can be high in sugar, especially if the fruit is sold canned or jarred in syrup. Read the ingredients list to see if sugar is added to the brand before buying. If there aren’t other options, drain the liquid and rinse the fruit to reduce excess sugar. To reduce the sugar content of the pineapples that you consume, choose pineapple canned or jarred in water or its own juice. You should also choose similar products for fruit cups marketed for children. If you’re worried about how to cut pineapples, you can also buy it pre-sliced fresh or frozen. Follow the steps below to cut a whole pineapple: You can add fresh pineapples to salads. Chopped pineapple can also be added to cottage cheese, ricotta, or yogurt. Use frozen pineapples to make refreshing fruit or green smoothies. Bake or grill pineapple rings or add some of the chopped fruit into your favorite soups and stews.

The tips below can help you get started: When prepping food for SHTF scenarios, you must assess your family’s unique needs. Start by calculating the calories required per person based on age, health status and activity levels. Next, determine the quantity and type of food items needed to meet those needs over a specific period, accounting for potential spoilage. Usually, you can do with a three to six-month supply. (Related: Stock up on nascent iodine to protect your thyroid from radioactive iodine in case of a nuclear emergency.) You can find a variety of suitable prepper foods found at regular grocery stores. Make the most of your prepping budget by purchasing nutritious, non-perishable items with long shelf lives like beans, canned meat and fish, honey, rice, salt and cooking oil. Try to avoid foods requiring refrigeration or frequent rotation. When making a list of things to buy, choose items your family likes and doesn’t mind eating a lot of to avoid waste when it’s time to hunker down. Consider the nutritional variety and calories and ensure that you maintain optimal health by stocking up on vitamins, supplements or sprout powders. Starting a food stockpile can be expensive, but you can save some money by incorporating cost-effective options without sacrificing nutrition. You can buy staple ingredients like beans, pasta and rice in bulk. Another option is to check sales and promos for canned or pouched chicken, salmon and tuna. Learn how to forage so you can harvest berries, various greens and mushrooms for free. For a long-term option, start a home garden and grow organic fruits and vegetables. When prepping food for long-term emergency situations, you should focus on shelf-stable items that can last a long time without refrigeration. Here are some suggestions for your stockpile: Canned foods like meats, soups, vegetables and fruits can last for years past their printed expiration date if stored properly. Prioritize high-acid foods like tomatoes that can last 18 months or even longer. Low-acid foods like meats and vegetables can last for at least three to five years when canned. Beans are another great item for your stockpile because they are full of protein and fiber. Stock up on dried black beans, chickpeas, lentils and pinto beans. Dried beans will last indefinitely when stored in airtight containers. You need fats like lard olive oil, shortening and vegetable oil for cooking and to help round out calories. Buy small bottles and rotate your stock to prevent spoilage. Grains like oats and rice are cheap, long-lasting carb sources to stockpile. Choose white rice over brown because the former has a longer shelf life. Store rice and grains in airtight containers. Sprouts, which come from sprouting seeds like broccoli seeds, are also great for your stockpile because they are full of vitamins and minerals. When dealing with a long-term SHTF scenario, having a reliable source of nutrients like sprouts ensures that you stay healthy. To save time and money, you can stock up on sprout powders, a more convenient form of sprouts. Broccoli sprouts are the newly sprouted seeds of the Brassica oleracea var. italica plant, a cruciferous vegetable related to wild cabbage. Despite their unassuming size, broccoli sprouts pack an impressive nutritional punch, which is why they are considered one of the world’s most nutritious vegetables. Made from organic broccoli sprouts, Health Ranger Select Organic Broccoli Sprout Powder is vegan, non-GMO, non-China and is certified Kosher and organic. Our premium formula for Health Ranger Select Organic Broccoli Sprout Powder contains no gluten, artificial sweeteners, colors, preservatives or other additives and is lab-tested for glyphosate, heavy metals and microbiology.

https://food.news/2024-03-13-florida-bill-banning-lab-grown-meat-desantis-signature.html,Florida bill BANNING lab-grown meat awaits Gov. DeSantis’ signature,0,"Advertisement The Florida House on Wednesday, March 6, gave final approval to a wide-ranging bill that would ban cultured, or lab-grown, meat and local regulation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. The Republican-controlled House voted 86-27 to approve SB 1084, with the bill finally ready to go to Governor Ron DeSantis. SB 1084 would make several modifications related to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS). Democrats fixated on parts of SB 1084 that would ban the sale and manufacture of cultivated meat, which DeSantis has condemned as “fake meat,” and prevent local governments from regulating EV vehicle charging stations.

Lindsay Cross (D-St. Petersburg) claimed that both bans were meant to “stop innovation, put barriers on the free market and to lock [Florida] into existing frameworks.” Meanwhile, Rep. Christine Hunschofsky (D-Parkland) insisted that the “food fight” section of SB 1084 “sends a bad message” to researchers and investors about lab-grown meat. Hunschofsky added that the move could discourage manufacturers from working in Florida because “they don’t know what day of the week that the Legislature will be OK with them being in the state of Florida.” House bill sponsor Danny Alvarez (R-Hillsborough County) said that there are still questions about the safety of lab-grown meat. He explained that selling cultivated meat needs to wait, adding that research over time could help confirm that “it is viable for consumption.” He noted that the bill is being passed because they “know that Florida agriculture can hold us down and provide plenty of safe, quality beef and agricultural products.” Alvarez also said lab-grown meat is being banned in Florida to help protect consumers. The measure, which passed the Senate early in March, would allow research into cultivated meat. Production involves a process of taking cultured cells from animals and growing them in controlled settings to produce food. A potential research ban was removed from earlier versions of the bill due to worries that such a ban could affect the space industry, which is also considering the development of lab-grown meats for long-term space journeys. Rep. Dean Black (R-Jacksonville) clarified that while it’s fine to develop “Moon meat” for astronauts, cattlemen like himself won’t support it. (Related: FDA approves lab-grown meat produced by Chinese firm linked to biowarfare program.) “They can make it on the Moon and export it to Mars, and it’s fine to have Martian meat as well,” Black said, adding that he supported SB 1084 because you shouldn’t be able to buy lab-grown meat in Florida, or anywhere in the United States. Under SB 1084, selling or manufacturing lab-grown meat will be considered a second-degree misdemeanor. Additionally, the bill would put oversight of EV charging stations under the FDACS, which regulates pumps at gas stations. Florida has at least 3,230 public charging stations in 44 of the 67 counties. According to a staff analysis of the bill, electric cars made up at least three percent of cars sold in Florida from July 2020 to July 2021. A 2021 state law already prohibits local governments from mandating such things as EV charging stations on gas retailers. That law was enforced after a move by Petaluma, California, to ban new gas stations with the intention of fast-tracking the shift to electric cars.

https://food.news/2024-03-12-bucket-food-storage-essential-for-complete-preparedness.html,Unlocking the mastery of bucket food storage: Essential for complete preparedness,0,"Advertisement As a prepper, you can sleep better at night knowing that you have access to essential food supplies in case of disasters like blizzards or tropical storms. Make sure your stockpile contains staples such as canned food, assorted spices and grains like beans and rice. If possible, stock up on food buckets to ensure your supplies last longer. (h/t to FCS.UGA.edu) When SHTF, you need to eat balanced meals regularly to maintain your strength and stay healthy. However, before you spend money on food supplies, you should first plan menus to include as much variety as possible. Don’t waste money on food that your family doesn’t like, but make sure you stock up on nutritious ingredients to ensure overall health when bugging in after SHTF. When deciding what foods to stock, choose wisely. Think of the different ways you can cook with versatile items, and make a list of several ways to prepare it. One approach to long-term food storage is to store bulk staples, such as beans and rice, together with different canned and dried foods. To save money, buy things like salt, beans, corn and wheat. When stored properly and in sturdy containers, these items are fairly inexpensive and have nearly unlimited shelf life. Bulk staples offer a limited menu, which is why you need to supplement them with air-dried or freeze-dried foods, packaged mixes and other supermarket goods. Canned meats are ideal, along with other items like rice and various beans. You can also add ready-to-eat cereals, dried fruits, pasta mixes and rice mixes since they will add variety to your menus. If you’re only starting your survival stockpile, start slow. Build your everyday stock of canned goods until you have extra supplies for a two-week to one-month supply. Rotate your supplies periodically to maintain a supply of common foods that will not require special preparation, water, or cooking. If you want to, buy commercially packaged, freeze-dried, or air-dried foods. Other options include stored meat or canned meats. Make sure all dry ingredients or supplies are properly stored in sturdy containers and off the floor in clean, dry, dark places away from moisture. Foods will maintain their quality longer if you avoid any extreme changes in temperature and exposure to light. (Related: Emergency food prep: Stock up on manuka honey, a must-have survival food and barter item.) If you want to stock up on bulk wheat, choose dark hard winter or dark hard spring wheat. Choose wheat with a #2 grade or with a protein content of 12 to 15 percent and moisture content that is less than 10 percent. If wheat is not already stored in nitrogen-packed cans, store it in sturdy five-gallon food-grade plastic buckets or containers with tight-fitting lids. Here at the Brighteon Store, we understand the importance of having a non-gluten option, which is why we are thrilled to introduce our ultra-clean and nutritious Health Ranger Select Organic Gluten-Free Mega Bucket. These mega buckets are carefully curated by the Health Ranger, Mike Adams, himself.

https://food.news/2024-03-11-berry-foraging-spotting-gathering-nature-sweet-treasures.html,Dive into the world of berry foraging: Unravel the secrets to spotting and gathering Mother Nature’s sweet treasures,0,"Advertisement Berries are a nutritious source of vitamins and minerals. If you don’t have a home garden, you can harvest wild berries once you learn how to forage safely. (h/t to BackdoorSurvival.com) Wild berries are elusive and they only appear for a short period during the summer and fall. If you want to forage wild berries, remember that their period of perfect ripeness moves quickly to a state of over-ripeness, meaning you only have a few weeks of harvesting. We are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware. Learn about our free, downloadable AI tools on nutrition, health and preparedness at this article link. Every purchase at HealthRangerStore.com helps fund our efforts to build and share more tools for empowering humanity with knowledge and abundance. While fresh wild berries taste better than store-bought berries, they spoil faster so you have to use them quickly. (Related: 12 Wild summer edibles to harvest for your food stockpile.) Blueberry/highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) Highland blueberries grow on a thin-branched shrub with glossy leaves. The plant also bears bell-shaped, usually white to light pink flowers that bloom in groups of five to ten. The plants prefer acidic soil. Blueberry leaves are sometimes red, especially during autumn. The leaves are small and oval to lance-shaped. Blueberries have a unique five-pointed star shape on the underside of each blueberry. Berries that fall off the plant are already ripe. Unripe blueberries may appear green or red. Once they turn blue, wait several days before they’re at full ripeness. Raspberry (Rubus strigosus, etc.) Raspberries grow in sharp-prickled bushes and they taste tart and sweet. Ripe raspberries are deep red and very sweet. Less than perfectly ripe berries are sour but edible. When foraging for raspberries, look for spindly raspberry bushes along disturbed lots and roadsides, especially in dry soil. Raspberry leaves are opposite and they grow in groups of three on the tips of the stems. Wild Strawberry (Fragaria virginiana) Wild strawberry is a creeper. The plant is often hidden, spreading close to the ground as fruits dangle from its low-lying vines. Make sure you don’t miss wild strawberry patches by keeping an eye out for the vines and berries in the ground. Wild strawberries look similar to commercial berries, but the former are smaller. Wild strawberries bear white, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are toothed and appear in threes. Wild berries look similar to false strawberries, which are also edible, but tasteless and dry. False strawberries bear yellow flowers and the seeds rub off easily. These berries usually point up instead of dangling at the vine tips. If you don’t have time to forage for berries, another option is to stock up on freeze-dried organic blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and bananas. Organic blueberries are a close relative of cranberries, huckleberries, gooseberries and bilberries, and they are one of the most nutritious and antioxidant-rich fruits in the world. Loaded with a variety of essential nutrients, Health Ranger Select Freeze-Dried Organic Whole Blueberries are an excellent healthy snack you can enjoy all year round. They have been carefully freeze-dried to preserve the taste, texture and nutrients of fresh produce without the use of any chemical preservatives.

Water Water, which is essential for hydration, is a crucial supply for your beverage prepping pantry. After all, many prepper “beverages” and survival foods must be reconstituted with water before you can consume them. For basic hydration, sanitation and cooking needs, you need at least one gallon of water per person per day. Store enough water so your family has enough if you’re worried about a long-term survival scenario. Coffee Stock up on coffee if you need a cup of joe every morning. Even if you don’t drink coffee, you can use it for bartering in a post-SHTF world. If storage space is an issue and you don’t want to clutter your stockroom with cans of whole bean coffee and a coffee grinder, buy ground coffee and instant coffee. (Related: SHTF bartering must-haves: 13 Things that will be in demand after an EMP attack.) Tea Depending on the type you choose, tea can also be used as a source of caffeine and energy like coffee. If you prefer energizing teas, choose black tea or green tea. For a calming cup of tea, buy an herbal tea like chamomile, which has soothing properties and can help promote relaxation during stressful survival events. Powdered milk Milk is a great source of calcium, protein and B-vitamins. This beverage is also versatile and can be used for drinking or baking. However, it is also one of the first things to spoil when the power goes out. Unless you have a dairy cow on your homestead, you’re better off having an ample supply of powdered milk. Powdered milk can last years, and you can use it to make dairy products like butter, yogurt, sour cream and cream cheese. Powdered milk is also great for creamy sauces, dips and gravies. Full of essential nutrients, organic milk is one of the world’s most nutritious beverages. This is especially true when milk comes from healthy cows raised under strict organic standards because they provide milk without toxic hormones or genetically modified organisms (GMOs) often found in conventional milk products. But because fresh milk spoils quickly, it can be very difficult to store long-term in case of a food emergency. Fortunately, organic milk can be dried to significantly extend its longer shelf life. Versatile, shelf-stable and cost-effective, Groovy Bee Organic Non-Fat Milk Powder is a highly nutritious beverage that belongs in your survival pantry. This high-quality lab-verified milk powder can easily increase your daily intake of calcium, potassium, protein and other nutrients in any situation. Just add water to make a convenient healthy beverage or incorporate it into your other recipes for a nutritional upgrade.

Think of stocking items to barter as one way to shock-proof your SHTF plans. If you need essential supplies and you have other things to barter with, trade for items that you don’t have in your stockpile. If possible, try to stock up on items that you can easily make or produce so that you won’t run out of them. If this isn’t an option, you can also get items with the highest trade value, such as necessities that people can’t live without. This includes essential bartering items such as: However, all of these valued items, especially clean water and food, are also things that you may want to keep for your family. These items will quickly fly off the shelves after a large-scale disaster. If you want to build a barter kit and stockpile certain items to trade, they need to last a long time. Small items like manuka honey are also great since you can store more of them. They are also easier to transport. Follow these tips to ensure a safe transaction when bartering post-SHTF: It’s often safer to barter with people you trust. Try to barter locally and barter items that are relevant to where you live. Find out what your neighbors need and what they can offer. Don’t announce that you have a survival stockpile in your garage. This is crucial if you have plans to barter with other people outside your community. Bartering after a disaster means you should always be alert. Head to your location with a partner or a small group of people you trust so you have a backup plan in case things go south. Don’t trade the same thing every time unless you’re dealing with someone you know and trust. This helps prevent you from becoming known for one specific item, which can end up in people targeting you for your supplies. Aside from common items like food and toiletries, make sure to stock up on manuka honey, one of the world’s most potent varieties of honey. This shelf-stable survival food has many applications for daily use and emergencies, such as supporting the natural healing of minor cuts and burns, maintaining your natural energy levels, and even helping preserve food. With its high levels of methylglyoxal (MGO), manuka honey has powerful immune-supporting properties and other health benefits. This means manuka honey is an ideal barter item when SHTF.

There are two ways to add to your emergency food stockpile. First, you can stock up on the non-perishable foods that you eat daily. This includes products that you can easily buy at the grocery store, like canned food or peanut butter. Second, you can buy “survival” food that you don’t have to use until an emergency but could last much longer than supermarket food. (Related: Prepping tips: How to prepare a food storage starter kit.) Whether you’re a newbie or an experienced prepper, it’s a good idea to add food from both categories so you have a wide variety of supplies to choose from once you’re facing a long-term disaster, like civil war. If you’re not sure where to start, make a list of foods that meet the following basic criteria: When SHTF, your body will need nutrients to ensure that you stay healthy. This means avoiding junk food and empty calories and focusing on nutritious ingredients like canned vegetables or miso. When you’re dealing with an emergency, you might lose access to utilities or other items that make it easier to cook. This means food like organic miso soup powder is ideal since you can make soup for your family with boiling water and miso powder. You can also stock up on other foods that can be eaten as-is, only need reheating or rehydrating, or are easy to pair with other ingredients. If possible, try to stock up on freeze-dried food with a shelf life of several years. But if this isn’t an option, you can be smart about picking long-lasting products, like organic miso powder. Avoid anything that doesn’t last at least one year in your prepping stockpile. When buying supplies for your stockpile, it’s best to purchase items in durable packaging, like a can or box, instead of flimsier packaging like what you’d find with potato chips. If you’re worried about the power going out, avoid food that needs to be cold or frozen. Some foods will be more calorie dense than others. Consider this when buying supplies, especially if limited space is going to be an issue building up a pantry. An emergency isn’t the time to be a picky eater, you can save money by avoiding foods that your family doesn’t like to eat a lot of. Make sure to get alternatives for any family members with a dietary problem, like gluten or lactose intolerance. Before disaster strikes, stock up on long-term storable food items like Health Ranger Select Freeze-Dried Organic Red and Yellow Miso Powders. Made using only the highest-quality ingredients, these organic red and yellow miso powders offer the same nutritional benefits as regular miso but with a much longer shelf life.

According to Cancer Research U.K., some patients use complementary therapies to feel better, ease the side effects of several cancer treatments and improve their quality of life. Some common examples of beneficial therapies include acupuncture, aromatherapy, herbal medicine, massage therapy, visualization and yoga. Cancer Research U.K. also said: “A good complementary therapist won’t claim that the therapy will cure your cancer,” adding that they will “always encourage you to discuss any therapies with your cancer doctor or GP.” Many health professionals also support patients with cancer using complementary therapies. However, some may be reluctant for their patients to use them. They claim that this is because many therapies have not been tested in the same way as more conventional treatments. But Dixon has been vocal about his support for natural treatments like aromatherapy and reflexology on the National Health Service (NHS). Naysayers insist that while alternative therapies are often used instead of medical treatment, there is no scientific evidence they can cure cancer. Others also claim that these natural therapies may cause harmful side effects or interfere with other treatments. Some examples of alternative therapies for cancer include laetrile (a plant substance), “shark cartilage supplements” and Gerson therapy, which involves following an organic vegetarian diet and having up to five coffee enemas a day. King Charles has previously expressed his support for Gerson therapy, which involves drinking up to 13 glasses of fruit juice a day. In 2004, he told the Royal College of Gynecology that the therapy should be investigated for its “beneficial nature” instead of being dismissed. The German doctor Max Gerson developed Gerson therapy in the 1920s and 30s. He said that it helped cure his migraine headaches. He then went on to use it to treat other diseases such as tuberculosis and cancer. Gerson therapy is also known as the Gerson diet, Gerson regimen or the Gerson method. Gerson therapy involves changes to your diet and nutrient intake. It aims to rid the body of toxins and strengthen your immune system. Gerson therapy can help bring the body back to its normal metabolic state, allowing your body to heal itself. The Gerson regime has three main parts: Gerson therapists believe that people with cancer have too much salt (sodium) in their bodies compared to the amount of potassium. People following Gerson therapy only eat organic, vegetarian food. The therapy also encourages followers to consume up to 13 glasses of fresh juices a day. Consuming fresh juices can help restore the right balance and cleanse the liver. Having up to five coffee enemas a day is also required in Gerson therapy. Practitioners believe that coffee enemas further help to excrete toxins from the liver and colon. Additionally, taking certain supplements and enzymes can help the body eliminate cancer cells.

https://food.news/2024-02-05-prepping-protect-home-stockpile-against-pests-rodents.html,Prepping 101: How to protect your home and stockpile supplies against pests and rodents,0,"Advertisement As a prepper, knowing how to protect your home from pests and rodents ensures that your survival stockpile lasts for a long time. Keeping your home clean is also important for maintaining proper hygiene when SHTF. (h/t to TheSurvivalMom.com) Pests are some of the biggest enemies of food storage. Keeping pests away from your food stockpile is crucial, especially if you don’t want to waste any of your hard-earned supplies. Bugs Bugs may hide in the long grass around your home. You can cut down their numbers by keeping the grass cut short. Some types of bugs can die before maturing due to exposure to sunlight. Short grass allows the sunshine to kill them before they spread to your pantry. Buy or borrow a push lawn mower and use it regularly to keep bugs at bay. If you live on a property with tall grasses and plants, use a machete to cut them down quickly. Mosquitos Mosquitoes are dangerous because they can multiply after laying their eggs in standing water. Always remove or minimize any standing water on your property. Check around your yard and empty containers like buckets, trash cans or anything that could collect standing water. Check all the screens in your windows and doors. Repair or replace screens that have holes. Rats and mice Rats and mice can carry 35 different diseases and they can be hard to keep out of a home. Rodents only need a hole the size of a dime to squeeze through. Neither mice nor rats have a collarbone. This means if their head can fit through a hole, so can the rest of their body. Rodents have sharp teeth and will gnaw through just about anything, even plastic food containers. If you have rodents at home and you want to avoid using rat poison with harmful chemicals, try using traditional mouse traps. If you don’t want to kill them, get a no-kill catch-and-release trap. Alternatively, you can adopt a pet cat or foster one so it can catch mice or rats for you. Seal or cover any openings around your home and remove bushes and trees near your house so rodents can’t use them to access the roof and enter. Termites Termites eat constantly and in the spring, they will swarm and start looking for food in your home. Termites like dark and damp rooms. If possible, treat termites by hiring a professional. If you’re worried about termites after SHTF, protect and maintain the integrity of your shelter. Divert water away from your home and trim and cut back trees nearby to keep termites away. Make sure none of the roots or branches are touching your home. (Related: Food storage tips: Keep pests away from your food supplies with diatomaceous earth.) You can keep most pests away from your home and stockpile by sealing all openings properly. Inspect your foundation and look for any cracks. You should also check for gaps around windows, frames and doors. If possible, hire a professional to seal and double-check your home. Stockpile some expanding insulation and rolls of thick metal screening. Use the insulation to seal small holes and reinforce the metal screening. Insulation can also help prevent rodents with sharp teeth from entering through the hole. Check the following areas for any openings: You can eliminate rodents and other pests by cutting off their access to food. Store food in sturdy, thick plastic or metal containers with tight-fitting lids. Always clean outdoor grills, cooking spaces and spills. When you’re done cooking, wash the dishes and put leftover food away. If you have pets, don’t leave their pet food or water bowls out overnight. If you have a bird feeder, use a squirrel guard on it. Any other food for animals should be at least 100 feet away from your home. The farther away, the better. If you have livestock, keep all animal feed in heavy plastic or metal containers. Elevate all trash cans, hay and woodpiles at least one foot above the ground. Keep woodpiles as far away from your home as possible. Aim for at least 100 feet. Clearing the property of old vehicles and equipment means that rodents won’t have access to spaces that they can live in. If you can prevent rodents from having nesting sites outside your home, you can decrease your chance of mice and rats trying to get inside your house. If you’re having trouble with rats sniffing around your food stockpile, use snap traps. Peanut butter is perfect for bait because it is sticky and won’t fall off if the trap is knocked over. Rodents will have to get very close, if not onto the trap, to eat the peanut butter. You only need a 1/4 teaspoon of peanut butter on the trap to attract vermin. Read all the instructions before setting up your trap. Place snap traps along the wall with the short end of the trap touching the wall. It should look like the letter “T.” Because rodents often run along the edges of walls, this placement will either get their attention with the peanut butter or snap them when they pass by. However, rats and other rodents are cautious. It may take a week before they decide to approach your traps. Just be patient. If you decide to use snap traps, place them in sheds or outbuildings you have on the property. Try to avoid live traps and glue traps. When rodents get caught in them, they often become afraid and will urinate. Animal urine may contain germs. To minimize the risk of being exposed to disease, it is best to kill rodents before they urinate. When dealing with a long-term survival scenario, you must know how to deal with annoying pests and rodents. Keep your home clean and store food properly to keep pests away from your property.

https://food.news/2024-02-02-prepping-tips-17-wild-foods-forage-winter.html,Foraging tips: 17 Wild foods to forage for your winter stockpile,0,"Advertisement Food prices have gone up by at least 15 percent from October 2021 to October 2023. As a self-sufficient prepper, this means finding different ways to save on your grocery bills without sacrificing taste and nutrient value. If you don’t want to spend money, winter foraging is one way to add more supplies to your prepper pantry for free. (h/t to SimpleFamilyPreparedness.com) There are many benefits of learning how to forage, such as getting free food in the form of wild edibles. Foraging can also be fun for the whole family. It’s also a good way to exercise, and foraging is one way to reconnect with nature. And while foraging in winter seems harder compared to foraging in late summer, there are still plenty of wild edibles to harvest once you know where to look. When SHTF, knowing how to forage year-round can also help you find food after the stores run out of supplies. Winter is the hardest time to find wild food, but it’s not impossible. When you’re foraging, only harvest plants and mushrooms that you are sure are safe to eat. Don’t go foraging without taking some classes or reviewing reference materials to avoid poisoning yourself and your family if you make a mistake. Avoid these dangerous mistakes by using detailed guides or signing up for foraging or survival classes. You can also forage with a more experienced prepper so they can teach you as you harvest. Whether you’re winter foraging or hunting for wild edibles in spring or summer, you should always forage in a way that’s good for the environment. This means only taking what you need and leaving enough food for wildlife and future harvests. Try following the rule of thirds. This means only taking a third, leaving one-third for the wildlife and leaving one-third to grow back or reproduce. If you’re not sure where to start, harvest fruits, nuts and leaves. Nuts and fruits can generally be harvested in abundance without causing any harm. Meanwhile, roots, shoots and tubers require the proper understanding of plants and their life cycles to ensure a sustainable harvest. Oak trees drop lots of acorns, and they’re one of the most overlooked wild edibles to forage in winter. You can find them on the forest floor or lurking beneath the snow cover around the base of the oak tree. Once you get rid of the tannins, acorns can be turned into flour. Beechnuts are tiny but full of flavor. You can eat them raw or roasted. Beechnuts can be collected in the fall to use throughout winter. They’re full of fat and protein, making them a great snack when it’s cold. Chickweed is a hardy winter plant that grows almost anywhere. It should be ready to harvest when the snow melts. Chicory root has a strong, earthy flavor and can be used as a coffee substitute when roasted and ground. Crabapples get sweeter and full of pectin as winter goes on and they are great in desserts, jellies and syrups. Many crabapple varieties stay on the tree into winter, and the fruit gets sweeter with time. Crabapples can survive cold temperatures better than regular apples and you can usually find them clinging onto their branches well into the winter season. Wild cranberries can be foraged from late fall to early winter, especially in boggy areas. You can also find some under the snow in winter. The berries are tart and add a vibrant flavor to dishes, from sauces to baked goods. Daisy greens are a nutritious and edible wintergreen. They’re a bit bitter, like other leafy greens, and are great for winter salads. Dandelions have edible leaves, roots and flowers. In winter, dandelion leaves are milder. The leaves are great in salads or cooked like spinach. Goosefoot or wild quinoa produces seeds that are a great alternative to expensive quinoa often sold in stores. Goosefoot seeds are high in protein and can be used in various dishes, from stews to wraps. Hop hornbeam trees produce nutty seeds. Pick these seeds and use them like you would grains or nuts in different dishes. The seeds are great in bread or as cereal. Lightly toasting them brings out their flavor even more, so add them to give salads or homemade granola a natural crunch. (Related: Tips for responsibly and safely foraging and hunting for food.) Jerusalem artichokes or sunchokes are tubers that you can dig throughout winter. They are nutty and sweet, and a versatile ingredient. Roast Jerusalem artichokes to make a caramelized treat. You can also boil and mash them, or slice them raw into salads for some crunch. Jerusalem artichokes are delicious and a natural source of iron and potassium. Nettles are a winter favorite, especially in milder climates. Nettles are full of vitamins and minerals. You can use them like other tender greens once you cook them to remove the sting. Use nettles for soups, stews or as steamed greens. In winter, oyster mushrooms will grow on the sides of trees and are easy to spot because of their unique shape. Oyster mushrooms are tender, slightly sweet and full of protein and vitamins. Serve oyster mushrooms sauteed, add them to various dishes like stir-fries, or use them to make creamy pasta sauces. Pine nuts have a buttery flavor, especially when toasted. Add pine nuts to pasta, pesto or salads. Pine nuts are also a good source of energy and healthy fats and they are a great addition to your winter diet. However, you should make sure you’re picking from trees that are safe to eat from. Pine nuts are an early winter forage item because squirrels love them and will gather as many as they can find before winter sets in. Purple dead nettle is easy to spot. Just look for its purple tops, even in winter. Purple dead nettle is a little bitter but it mixes well with other greens. Dry it out for homemade smoothies. You can also use purple dead nettle to make a healing salve that can help with inflammation and allergies. Purple dead nettle can also be used to dye wool a beautiful spring green. You can find watercress growing near streams and rivers. Watercress adds a fresh, peppery flavor to any dish. You can often find it all year round and is high in nutrients. Watercress is remarkably spicy, making it a great green for winter meals like soups and stews. Like other common plants, wild violets are beautiful and a versatile ingredient. Wild violet leaves and flowers are edible and will add a lovely dash of color and a sweet, floral flavor to winter salads or desserts. If you love to bake, use wild violet flowers for decorating cakes and other desserts. Use the heart-shaped leaves to add a mild, sweet taste to salad greens.

https://food.news/2024-01-29-farmer-protests-erupt-across-europe-green-policies.html,Farmer protests erupt across Europe over GREEN POLICIES that demand the obliteration of food production,0,"Advertisement Agricultural workers in several European countries say that green policies and taxes are eating into their profits, with farmers calling for more government subsidies. Farmer protests have sprung up in France, Germany and Romania ahead of the 2024 European Parliament election in June. The farmers’ demands vary in general, but they are all suffering from environmental reforms and need more government subsidies to offset their losses. Over the past few days, mass protests in Southern France have forced the government to address farmers’ issues. On Jan. 22, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal met with Arnaud Rousseau, the president of the National Federation of Agricultural Operators’ Unions (FNSEA). Earlier, farmers warned that they would continue to block some motorways until Attal listened to their demands. The FNSEA has since announced that it will decide later in January whether it will call for nationwide action. According to the farmers, the government’s eco-transition policies make national producers uncompetitive. This makes farms unprofitable and forces France to buy food products from countries where environmental standards are weaker. The farmers are seeking better remuneration for their produce, less red tape and protection against cheap imports. Protesters are using their tractors to close down long stretches of road and slow traffic. Protest groups have also dumped agricultural waste at the gates of government offices. The protests in France are a sign of discontent in agricultural heartlands across the European Union. In Berlin, eco-activists stood alongside protesting farmers. According to the farmers, they are fully supportive of environmentally friendly, genetically unmodified farming. However, they explained that they can only support organic farming methods if they have subsidies or, at least, fair prices set for their products. Farmers in Germany have complained that the government has hesitated to enforce such measures even after they have forwarded their demands to Agriculture Minister Cem Ozdemir. The farmers have been protesting on the streets of Germany since December 2023, when the federal government agreed on a budget canceling several decades-old farming subsidies and benefits. These could have saved German farmers more than 480 million euros ($521 million). Later, Berlin decided to ease the effect of the plans by making the benefit cuts gradual. The January protests in Germany highlight the deep frustration of the public with Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government, which came to power just over two years ago with a progressive, modernizing agenda but has been considered by many as “dysfunctional and incapable.” Scholz’s government is struggling to resolve many issues and reconcile lofty aims, such as transforming Europe’s biggest economy to meet climate targets and investing in neglected infrastructure while also meeting Germany’s strict self-imposed rules on racking up debt. Scholz has said that he recognizes the various concerns that go beyond cuts to tax breaks on farmers’ diesel fuel. Joachim Rukwied, the head of the German Farmers’ Association (DBV), has explained that farmers are disappointed because they are being ignored “and they can’t understand why they should be further burdened in European competition.” Rukwied added that the DBV will try to win over lawmakers in talks within the coming days, but he warned that there will still be smaller-scale “actions” by farmers to emphasize their point. (Related: German farmers: Ukraine’s accession to the EU would destroy family farming and flood markets with cheap crops.) Other groups have sympathized with or joined in some German farmers’ demonstrations. The groups have included road transport and hospitality associations. In Romania, farmers and truckers have been blocking main roads with their tractors and trucks for several weeks. The farmers are demanding lower taxes and fairer subsidies. However, talks with the government have failed, and they’re continuing to protest. Farmers are also upset over the growing cost of insurance for heavy machinery. In a statement that was sent to media outlets by a local protest leader, protesters warned that they would continue protesting until they “see the first law approved that enforces solutions for as many of the problems” that they have pointed out. These protests are not centrally coordinated, which has hindered negotiations with the coalition government, which then faces local, parliamentary, presidential and European elections later this year. On Jan. 15, Agriculture Minister Florin Barbu and 10 farmer associations announced that they had reached an agreement on several demands, setting clear deadlines for meeting them. But despite the ongoing talks, the protests have continued. Haulers were still in negotiations with transport and finance ministries. The protesters have demanded a moratorium on loan repayments, faster subsidy payments and separate lines at border crossings and the Black Sea port of Constanta for EU lorries and trucks from outside the bloc, including Ukraine.

https://food.news/2024-01-23-russia-shipment-wheat-food-insecurity-mali-africa.html,"Russia sends another shipment of FREE WHEAT to help address food insecurity in Mali, Africa",0,"Advertisement Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova announced on Jan. 17 that Mali has received 25,000 tons of humanitarian grain from Moscow. Zakharova added that Russia would continue to help several African nations address socioeconomic hardships. The shipment of grain was delivered through the port of Conakry in neighboring Guinea on Jan. 6 and handed over to the authorities of the landlocked West African country three days later, said Zakharova. Zakharova added that the recent grain shipment was the fourth delivery of “much-needed Russian goods to the population on a free basis.” Overall, 50,000 metric tons of wheat and more than 22,000 metric tons of fertilizers had been transported to Mali through the Russian Ministry of Emergencies, with the first three shipments being received on June 7, June 18 and Dec. 6, 2023, according to Zakharova. The deliveries are in fulfillment of Moscow’s pledge to provide food assistance to African nations facing food insecurity. The pledge is part of an agreement announced last summer by President Vladimir Putin at the Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg. In 2023, Russian Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev said up to 200,000 tons of free wheat would be supplied to six African countries: Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic (CAR), Eritrea, Mali, Somalia and Zimbabwe. (Related: Globalists weaponize food and energy supply to pave the way for global “Holodomor.”) Earlier in January, Igor Mozgo, Russia’s ambassador to Eritrea, unloaded 25,000 tons of food aid at the East African nation’s port of Massawa. Somalia received the same amount of wheat from Moscow last November. Burkina Faso, where Moscow recently reopened an embassy, is also scheduled to receive a share of the humanitarian grains. Alexey Saltykov, Moscow’s ambassador to the former French colony, told officials in Ouagadougou last December that supplies would arrive in “the coming days” According to reports, a shipment bound for CAR has arrived in neighboring Cameroon and been milled into wheat flour before transfer to the former French colony. Additionally, Zimbabwe is slated to receive a 25,000-ton grain cargo that arrived in Mozambique’s port of Beira later in January. In December 2023, the United Nations (UN) reported that a record 49.5 million people are expected to go hungry in West and Central Africa alone because of a combination of conflict, so-called climate change and high food prices. The figure is four percent higher than in 2023. According to a new regional food security analysis released by the UN World Food Program (WFP) and other humanitarian agencies, in coastal countries, the number of people facing acute hunger is predicted to reach 6.2 million in 2024, up 16 percent from 2023. Margot Vandervelden, the WFP’s acting regional director for Western Africa, explained that acute hunger remains at record levels in the region. However, funding needed to address the issue “is not keeping pace.” Vandervelden added that insufficient funding means those who are moderately hungry will be forced to skip meals and eat less nutritious food. This unfortunately puts them at risk of “falling back into crisis or emergency phases, perpetuating the cycle of hunger and malnutrition.” The analysis also revealed that more than two out of three households in West and Central Africa cannot afford healthy diets. According to the analysis, the cost of a daily nutritious diet in the central Sahel countries Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger is 110 percent higher than the daily minimum wage in the region. According to UN figures, Sahel countries are dealing with an Islamist insurgency that has displaced at least four million people from their homes and farms. The Democratic Republic of Congo also has several ongoing conflicts that have displaced nearly seven million people. The Sahel crisis has forced people to seek refuge in neighboring coastal countries such as the Ivory Coast, Ghana and Togo, which is struggling with its worst economic crisis in a generation. Ollo Sib, a senior research adviser for the WFP, said almost 80 percent of people who are currently in a difficult food situation are in areas affected by conflict. Sib also advised that without intervention, the situation could worsen in certain areas as more than 2.6 million people were at risk of falling into famine.

https://food.news/2024-01-23-israel-palestine-war-brings-famine-at-incredible-speed.html,"UN official: Israel-Palestine war brings FAMINE at incredible speed, leaving hundreds of thousands starving in Gaza",0,"Advertisement According to Martin Griffiths, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, the Israel-Palestine war in Gaza has brought famine with “such incredible speed.” Griffiths said that a “great majority” of 400,000 Gazans characterized by UN agencies as at risk of starving are already living in famine conditions. He also lamented that the famine was an “extraordinary and wholly unwelcome aspect of the Gazan war.” Griffiths lamented that the ongoing war has brought famine with incredible speed “to the front of the lines.” Those caught in the crossfire are suffering because while some want to help, aid has been trickling very slowly into Gaza from two border crossings in the south. Agencies have also warned that it is only a fraction of what the people need. Early in January, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that Israel had denied critical supplies from entering northern Gaza. However, Israel countered by accusing the UN Palestine Refugee Agency (UNRWA) of not doing enough and “stalling” the progress. Griffiths said that it is still difficult to provide humanitarian aid to the 300,000 Gazans who remain in the northern part of the Strip, where much of the fighting is ongoing. He explained that it’s not just a matter of the number of trucks that can get in. Griffiths also brought up many roadblocks stopping aid, such as unreliable “deconfliction of access routes” and civilians having to move from one place of insecurity to another. He warned that if people cannot rely on deconfliction of access routes and if hospitals keep getting attacked, humanitarian aid deliveries will continue to be a challenge. (Related: Israel weaponizes food supply as almost 600,000 people go hungry in Gaza.) The Gaza Health Ministry reported that more than 24,000 people have been killed in Gaza and more than 60,000 others injured since Oct. 7. On the other hand, the UN has reported that almost 90 percent of Gaza’s pre-war population has been displaced due to Israel’s persistent bombing, which has caused widespread devastation and forcing Gazan civilians to live with the threat of imminent death either by airstrike, starvation or disease. Griffiths said that the dire humanitarian situation in the enclave could create “generational hatred.” He added that the UN worries for the security of both Israel and Gaza. On Jan. 14, UN agencies issued a joint appeal for greater aid access to Gaza, saying that “a fundamental step change in the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza is urgently needed.” The heads of the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Program (WFP) and the World Health Organization have said that getting enough supplies into and across Gaza depends on several factors, such as the opening of new entry routes, more trucks being allowed through border checks every day, fewer restrictions on the movement of humanitarian workers and guarantees of safety for all those accessing and distributing aid. Cindy McCain, WFP head, lamented that people in Gaza are at risk of dying of hunger when they are only miles from trucks transporting food. She added that every hour lost puts many innocent lives at risk. McCain added that famine can be prevented, but only if those giving and distributing aid can quickly deliver sufficient supplies and have safe access to people in need. Back in December, the WFP warned that the “catastrophic hunger crisis” in Gaza, which already threatens to overwhelm the population, will only get worse as the war continues. Salwa Tibi, a 53-year-old aid worker and mother of four in Gaza, recently told reporters that her children are “screaming all day from hunger.” As heavy rains, winds and cooler temperatures descend on Gaza from November to February, aid workers and civilians trying to survive constant bombings said that they are suffering from harsh living conditions, insufficient access to warm clothing and outbreaks of disease in overpopulated makeshift shelters. Food, fuel and water remain scarce, and the price of what little supplies remain are increasing. Shadi Bleha, a 20-year-old student who was displaced from northern Gaza to Rafah near the border with Egypt, said that adults ration their meals so that children do not go hungry. Bleha, who eats one meal a day, has seen many people starving. The Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Phase Classification (IPC) has reported that the entire population of Gaza, which includes at least 2.2 million people, is facing high levels of acute food insecurity or worse. At least one in four households is facing catastrophic conditions. The IPC added that it is the highest share of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity the initiative has ever classified for any given area or country. Catherine Russell, UNICEF executive director, said that children at high risk of dying from malnutrition and disease require immediate medical treatment, clean water and sanitation services. Unfortunately, the conditions on the ground do not allow aid workers to safely reach children and families in need. According to UNICEF, Gaza’s 350,000 children under the age of five are especially vulnerable. The agency warned that in the coming weeks, child wasting, which is the most life-threatening form of malnutrition in children, could affect at least 10,000 children. Russell said that some of the material aid workers “desperately need to repair and increase water supply” are still restricted from entering Gaza. She added that the situation must soon be resolved because the lives of children and their families are hanging in the balance. However, the agencies echoed Griffiths’ warning that humanitarian aid alone cannot fight the worsening hunger among Gaza’s population. Phillipe Lazzarini, Commissioner General for the UNRWA, warned that commercial supplies are essential to allow the markets and private sector to re-open and provide an alternative to food accessibility to those in Gaza.

https://food.news/2024-01-12-mjn-voluntarily-recalls-batches-nutramigen-powder-contamination.html,Mead Johnson Nutrition voluntarily recalls batches of Nutramigen Powder due to contamination,0,"Advertisement Mead Johnson Nutrition (MJN), a company acquired by Reckitt Benckiser Group, is voluntarily recalling select batches of Nutramigen Powder from the U.S. market. A product recall was issued because of the possibility of contamination with Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria in products sampled outside the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced. Nutramigen Powder, a specialty infant formula for the dietary management of Cows Milk Allergy (CMA) that is sold in 12.6- and 19.8-ounce cans, underwent extensive testing by MJN and tested negative for the bacteria, reported the FDA. The agency said the Nutramigen containers were manufactured in June 2023 and distributed primarily in June, July and August. The FDA said based on the limited availability of the remaining stock of this special infant formula, it is believed that much, if not all, of the products recalled in the U.S. have already been consumed. The agency said there are no reports of illnesses or adverse events to date. Reckitt Benckiser said all the recalled products have the “Use By Date” of January 1, 2025. The company asked customers to dispose of the products if they belonged to the recalled batches. Reckitt Benckiser claimed that no other U.S.-distributed Nutramigen batches or other Reckitt products were affected by the recall. (Related: FDA warns 3 baby formula makers over violations of food safety standards.) Cronobacter bacteria can cause severe, life-threatening infections or meningitis. Cronobacter infection can also cause bowel damage and may spread through the blood to other parts of the body. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned that it can also cause “often fatal meningitis” in young infants. Cronobacter bacteria will usually infect those that are very young, particularly infants born prematurely. Even though this infection is treatable with antibiotics, death occurs in at least 40 percent of those who develop meningitis because of underlying risk factors and complications. According to the FDA, this bacteria is naturally found in the environment and can exist on almost any surface. The bacteria can also survive in dry foods, like herbal teas, powdered infant formula, powdered milk and starches. Despite these serious complications, it is estimated that only 18 cases of invasive C. sakazakii occur each year in the U.S., most of which happen because of the contamination of infant feeding products and equipment. While this bacteria can cause serious harm, Dr. Anna Morad, Director of the Newborn Nursery and Associate Professor of Academic General Pediatrics at the Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt in Tennessee, said people must keep in mind “that this is not a common infection.” The infection does not cause illness for older children and healthy adults, but it can cause illness in young infants who are under three months of age or those with a weakened immune system, said Morad. Because young infants are usually affected by this bacteria, detection can sometimes be difficult. Parents should note that many symptoms may start with excessive crying, fever, poor feeding and low energy. In more severe cases, some infants may develop seizures because this bacteria can infect the brain and the fluid within the spinal cord. Cronobacter is the same bacteria that caused the shutdown of Abbott Nutrition’s infant formula plant in 2022. Because C. sakazakii can survive on many surfaces, it can enter factories or homes simply from one’s hands by not washing. The bacteria can also spread through the soles of shoes. It is believed that in factories C. sakazakii can contaminate formula powder if the powder touches a contaminated surface or questionable ingredients were used to make the formula. If you have an infant at home, prevent the spread of the bacteria with the proper sterilization of bottles, utensils, or other breast pump accessories. Thorough hand washing and using clean water to mix the formula can help protect against infection. Prevention is key to minimizing the risk of Cronobacter infection. The CDC recommends using a ready-to-feed formula for infants under two months old, babies born prematurely, or infants with a weakened immune system. Taking extra steps at home will help prevent Cronobacter infection. For example, you can boil water to at least 158 F, let it cool and then use that to mix with powdered formula. In the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency said that due to the widespread presence of C. sakazakii in the environment, caregivers of infants must follow proper and thorough hygiene, preparation and storage practices, and learn steps to protect infants from Cronobacter infection. Morad warned parents that Cronobacter bacteria can also be found on breast pump parts and bottles so it is important to thoroughly clean these things. To reduce transmission, Morad recommended proper hand washing with soap and water before preparing bottles, milk, or meals. While there are many cleaning products on the market, you can also use alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol as an alternative. Even though Cronobacter bacteria can cause serious illness in infants, Morad advised parents to be careful with their formula preparation, “but not overly worried as this infection is a rare occurrence.” Practice thorough hand washing and cleaning techniques to protect children and young infants from Cronobacter bacteria, especially if they have a weakened immune system.

https://food.news/2024-01-02-california-first-fully-autonomous-ai-powered-restaurant.html,California welcomes world’s first fully autonomous AI-powered restaurant,0,"Advertisement The world’s first fully autonomous restaurant controlled and operated by robots that prepare and serve the food has been officially launched in Pasadena, California. The restaurant is CaliExpress by Flippy, derived from a partnership with Cali Group, a holding company that uses technology to transform the restaurant and retail industries. The collaboration also includes Miso Robotics, the creator of Flippy, the world’s first AI-powered robotic fry station, and PopID, a technology company that simplifies ordering and transactions with biometrics. CaliExpress by Flippy will use the most advanced systems in food technology, with both grill and fry stations fully automated and powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. Restaurant guests can watch their food being cooked robotically after checking in with their PopID accounts on self-ordering kiosks to get personalized order recommendations. The PopID accounts can also be used to pay for orders It’s a contactless facial recognition payment system that allows customers to pay for their items using just their faces. The new CaliExpress by Flippy restaurant is located in Pasadena, California on the northwest corner of Green Street and Madison Avenue at 561 E. Green St. (Related: SMASHING the AI threat matrix – How human resistance defeats Skynet.) According to a press release, CaliExpress by Flippy will use these various technologies “to deliver freshly made burgers based on a wagyu blend at price points competitive with other premium burgers using standard meat.” The restaurant uses a unique grill robot that grinds high-quality beef in real-time after the order is placed, resulting in a burger patty that melts in the mouth. Flippy, the robotic fry station, will then serve crispy, hot fries made from top-grade potatoes that are cooked for exact times. The menu is very simple and customers can order burgers, cheeseburgers and fries. The CaliExpress by Flippy kitchen will still be run by a much smaller crew. The press release added that the smaller crew will receive above-average wages. John Miller, CEO of PopID and board member of Miso Robotics, said that CaliExpress by Flippy “is the world’s first operating restaurant where both ordering and every single cooking process are fully automated.” The combination of these different technologies to create the most autonomous restaurant in the world is the product of “years of research, development, and investment in a family of revolutionary companies.” The CaliExpress by Flippy location will also be a pseudo-museum experience presented by Miso Robotics. The museum will feature dancing robot arms from retired Flippy units, experimental 3D-printed artifacts from past development, photographic displays and more exhibits. The CaliExpress by Flippy museum is designed to inspire the next generation of kitchen AI and automation entrepreneurs. Other restaurants are also experimenting with AI technology, with some using AI to design new menu options and flavors. Some local restaurants are testing generative AI technology, and several establishments think their tests are exceeding expectations. Greg Tierney, the owner of Motor City Pizza, a Detroit-style pizzeria in Lewisville, Texas, said AI has enhanced his menu. According to Tierney, one of his regular customers had an idea for a new pizza. The customer got the recipe from AI by using standard pizza ingredients, and then suggesting ideas like “Mexican street-corn pizza” to the AI. Chat GPT then produced an initial recipe. Tierney explained that the customer made several adjustments, such as making the recipe more savory and adding protein. The AI then produced the recipe for “Winston’s Elote.” The Winston’s Elote pizza is a blend of ingredients like chicken, jalapenos, onions, red peppers and roasted corn on a Detroit-style crust. The AI-developed pizza is then topped with queso fresco and cilantro, and drizzled with a tangy cream and hot sauce. Tierney noted that Winston’s Elote is now a permanent item on their menu and that customers love it. Visit Robots.news for more articles about robots and AI taking over the food industry.

https://food.news/2024-01-02-herb-honey-7-home-remedies-for-cough.html,Herbs and honey: 7 Natural home remedies for a cough,0,"Advertisement Parents often give cough medicine to sick children, but they’re not that effective. This is bad news for the more than 30 million people who consult a doctor every year because of a cough. If you or someone in the family has a cough, try natural remedies like honey or herbal teas instead. But if cough medicines don’t work, why do people spend billions of dollars annually on over-the-counter (OTC) products to get rid of a cough? According to Dr. Norman Edelman, a senior scientific advisor at the American Lung Association, people with a cough are often desperate to get some relief. According to Edelman, there isn’t “good evidence that cough suppressants and expectorants help with the cough.” Worse, many cough syrups on the market contain harmful ingredients, such as artificial colors or flavors and sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup. Did you know that coughing is therapeutic? Coughing is the body’s way of trying to eliminate mucus or foreign materials from your lungs and upper airway passages. You also cough as a reaction to something that is irritating your airway. A cough is a symptom, not a disease. When you find out the underlying cause, you can better deal with a cough. A productive cough produces mucus or phlegm. It’s best not to suppress this type of cough because you want to clear the mucus or phlegm. Productive coughs are often associated with viral illnesses like the common cold, lung or upper airway infections (e.g., bronchitis, pneumonia or sinusitis), postnasal drip, chronic lung diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), gastroesophageal reflux disease and smoking. Meanwhile, nonproductive coughs can occur with the common cold, allergies, asthma, bronchospasm, the use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (such as captopril, enalapril or lisinopril) and exposure to environmental irritants. While people of all ages can get a cough, parents often worry when children start coughing. If you have young kids at home, keep these tips in mind before giving them cough medicine: Don’t give cough or cold medication to a child younger than two years old. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding cough or cold medicine in children younger than six years old. Most of the time, giving your child cough medicine won’t make the cough go away faster than if you did nothing at all. Edelman explained that the medicine has little to do with a cough disappearing, which it will usually do on its own. Cough medicine may cause different side effects. For example, the OTC drug dextromethorphan can cause confusion, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea and vomiting. Guaifenesin may cause side effects like nausea and vomiting. If you give cough medicine to a child older than two, never give more than one drug with the same active ingredient, such as a decongestant or pain reliever. This may cause an overdose. Never give children antibiotics for a cough because they won’t work. If you give a child antibiotics, it can lower his or her resistance to future infections. The same guidelines apply to adults, with age adjustments. There hasn’t been a new effective development in cough treatments for more than half a century. Research has been conducted to provide proof that common OTC drugs sold to treat coughs, such as dextromethorphan and guaifenesin, are effective. However, these studies haven’t proven that cough medicines do work. Instead, the results have revealed that there is no proof that they do. Instead of risking your health with conventional cough medicine, try these natural remedies that aren’t linked to dangerous side effects. Fenugreek is a culinary and medicinal herb that can be used as a tea and as a gargle to soothe your throat and cough. Fenugreek is bitter so try adding a bit of honey to your cup of tea. Let the tea cool before gargling. One study published in the Journal of Herbal Pharmacotherapy has revealed that a mixture of eight herbs (anise, black seed, caraway, cardamom, chamomile, fennel, licorice and saffron) provided significant improvements in cough intensity and frequency among people with allergic asthma. Drinking tea alone or with lemon and honey can help soothe a productive and nonproductive cough. Aside from the herbal teas already mentioned, other teas that can help relieve a cough include: Young children are more likely to enjoy the taste of orange, lemon or peppermint tea. Honey is ideal for children two years and older and adults. In one study, researchers worked with 105 young volunteers ages two to 18. The researchers compared honey with no treatment and honey-flavored dextromethorphan to study its effect on coughing during the night and sleep quality. Parents of the volunteers rated honey as providing the best symptomatic relief. To treat a cough, add organic honey or fresh lemon juice to herbal tea. Instead of honey, give agave syrup to children younger than one year. If you don’t like peppermint tea, you can still benefit from the menthol in peppermint vapors. Add four to five drops of peppermint oil to eight ounces of hot water in a shallow bowl. Drape a towel over your head and inhale deeply. Breathe in the soothing vapors for several minutes. (Related: Cures from nature’s medicine cabinet: Effective home remedies for pain, coughs and other common complaints.) Marshmallow (Althaea officinalis) is an ancient remedy for cough and sore throat. The herb contains a substance called mucilage that helps soothe the throat. Dried marshmallow leaves may be used in fluid extracts, infusions, teas and tinctures. Marshmallow roots are available dried, peeled or unpeeled in capsules, creams, cough syrups, extracts (dry and fluid), ointments and tinctures. Marshmallow is not recommended for young children. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria in your gut. While they don’t reduce coughing directly, they have a significant impact on the bacterial population in your gut. Probiotics can support your immune system and this can be beneficial if you have a cold and cough. Slippery elm (Ulmus fulva) has been used in the past as a traditional as an oral herbal remedy for cough, diarrhea, sore throat and stomach problems. Like marshmallow, slippery elm contains mucilage that helps soothe the throat. To treat a cough, look for slippery elm tea or lozenges that are both made from the herb’s inner bark. If you’re sick, avoid conventional cough medicines. Instead, try natural remedies like herbal tea or a fenugreek gargle.

https://food.news/2023-12-20-apple-cider-vinegar-recipe-boost-immune-health.html,Natural healing: A warming apple cider vinegar recipe that helps boost your immune health,0,"Advertisement Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is a popular superfood ingredient for beverages, salad dressings and pickled foods. It is also often used as a natural ingredient for non-toxic cleaning solutions. This winter, you can also use apple cider vinegar to make a natural remedy that offers several health benefits, such as promoting digestive health and boosting your immune system. Detailed below is a recipe from herbal medicine educator Erica Kuo, who shares that taking the apple cider vinegar mixture can help you boost your immune health this winter. Apple cider vinegar is made by fermenting apple juice. ACV is a popular ingredient for natural health remedies. According to Kuo, apple cider vinegar contains yeast that can help suppress appetite. Combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise, incorporating apple cider vinegar into your routine can help you achieve your weight management goals. (Related: Prepper essentials: The many survival uses of vinegar.) During winter, use superfoods like honey, apple cider vinegar and warming spices and herbs to create an immune-boosting tonic. In the West, this herbal tonic is often called oxymel. The ancient Greek word “oxymeli” translates to “acid and honey.” Oxymel is an herbal extraction of vinegar and raw honey. Below is Kuo’s personal recipe for a spicy apple cider vinegar mixture. Ingredients: Preparation: How to use: Combining raw apple cider vinegar, which offers unique health benefits, with other superfoods like honey, is a great way to enjoy the benefits of both. You can also make ACV oxymel to extract and ingest supportive herbs, especially pungent ones that aren’t always pleasant to take on their own. Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) promotes gastric acid secretion and appetite. When a cold or fever sets in, horseradish can help induce sweating and improve respiratory and urinary infections. Chili pepper supports heart function, especially irregular or weak heartbeat, poor blood circulation and cold limbs. Chili peppers also help invigorate the body and can promote gastrointestinal digestion and increase gastric secretion. Ginger warms the stomach and intestines, promotes blood circulation, improves cold hands and feet in winter, enhances immune health and strengthens the body’s anti-inflammatory function. It can also help induce sweating, reduce fever, and relieve nausea caused by certain food smells. Additionally, ginger can promote healthy bowel function. Onions and garlic are rich in beneficial flavonoids and polyphenols, of which allicin is the most important component. Both have antiviral, antioxidant, immune health-boosting and anti-inflammatory effects. American or Korean ginseng can help activate blood circulation and enhance the body’s resilience during stressful situations. Aside from the ingredients used in the recipe above, some herbalists may recommend adding other medicinal herbs such as rosemary, thyme or turmeric. Rosemary can help stimulate healthy blood circulation and support optimal brain function. Because it promotes intracranial blood circulation, recent studies suggest that rosemary, like sage, can help prevent Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, memory loss, loss of smell and vision loss. Rosemary also helps boost digestive health and relieves flatulence, dizziness, headaches and fever. Thyme can boost your immune system and has antibacterial and antimicrobial effects. Turmeric is a natural “cleansing” ingredient that can purify the blood, aid metabolism and promote liver health. The spice can also help relieve fever, cramps and menstrual pain. Kuo warns that if you have low blood pressure, you should reduce your consumption of garlic and onions. If you have hypertension (high blood pressure), add cinnamon to spicy apple cider vinegar to boost its flavor and sweetness. Cinnamon and garlic can prevent blood coagulation, so skip the cinnamon and garlic if you are taking anticoagulants. If you don’t have horseradish, replace it with turmeric.

https://food.news/2023-12-06-research-nutrient-beef-milk-kill-cancer-cells.html,Research suggests nutrient from meat and dairy can help KILL cancer cells,0,"Advertisement According to a study published in Nature Journal, a nutrient found in both dairy and meat products may help protect against cancer by killing cancer cells. Researchers from the University of Chicago also reported that the nutrient showed promise for use in cancer treatments. While conducting the study, the research team looked for compounds that could activate a group of immune cells called CD8+ T, which are known to kill cancerous or virally infected cells. The researchers discovered that a nutrient called trans-vaccenic acid (TVA) was able to boost the ability of CD8+ T cells to infiltrate tumors and potentially kill cancer cells. TVA is a long-chain fatty acid found in meat and dairy products from grazing animals like cows and sheep. Additionally, the study showed that cancer patients with higher TVA levels circulating in their blood responded better to immunotherapy. This indicated that TVA shows promise as “a nutritional supplement to complement clinical treatments for cancer.” In the human body, only 20 percent of the TVA is broken down into other byproducts and the remaining 80 percent circulates in the blood. The research team used TVA while experimenting on mice. For the study, the mice were fed a diet rich in TVA. Data revealed that the TVA “significantly reduced the tumor growth potential of melanoma and colon cancer cells compared to mice fed a control diet.” The researchers also found that the TVA diet helped boost the ability of CD8+ T cells in mice to infiltrate tumors. TVA inactivates a receptor on the surface of CD8+ T cells, then activates a cellular signaling process involved in cellular growth, differentiation and survival. Mice with the receptors of CD8+ T cells removed lacked improved tumor-fighting ability. The researchers also studied leukemia cells and found that TVA could help enhance “the ability of an immunotherapy drug to kill leukemia cells.” Jing Chen, one of the senior authors of the study, said it was “amazing and intriguing” to observe how a single nutrient like TVA “has a very targeted mechanism on a targeted immune cell type, with a very profound physiological response at the whole organism level.” Even though the study suggests TVA has potential as a dietary supplement in cancer treatments, Chen advised against focusing too much on the food source. He explained that because research suggests that a diet with too much red meat or dairy can have adverse effects on overall health, the study should not be taken as an excuse to follow an unhealthy diet and consume a lot of fast food like cheeseburgers or pizza. Chen added that the focus should be on using TVA nutrient supplements and learning more about the optimized amount to be used in treating cancer. He also suggested that there could be other nutrients that would potentially be able to perform the same function as TVA. (Related: STUDY: Carotenoid in brown seaweed has potent anticancer properties.) “There is early data showing that other fatty acids from plants signal through a similar receptor, so we believe there is a high possibility that nutrients from plants can do the same thing,” said Chen. The research team also spoke of their plans to build a more comprehensive library of nutrients circulating in the human body to learn how they affect immunity and other biological processes. An earlier study also revealed a potential positive impact of TVA on cancer. Researchers reviewed the impact of TVA on human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a cancer that occurs in the nasopharynx located behind the nose and above the throat. The results showed that TVA “significantly inhibited cell proliferation” of the NPC cancer cells. The study authors suggested that using TVA could offer an advantage in treating the illness. In an earlier study from 2014, scientists reported that TVA exerted a “direct anti-carcinogenic effect” on human breast cancer cells. The recent TVA study follows other significant scientific breakthroughs in the last few years concerning cancer research. In October 2023, researchers from the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center in Sacramento, California, reported that they discovered a biological “switch” that could make cancer cells destroy themselves. Through a UC Davis news release the research team reported that CD95 receptors (Fas) are called death receptors. “These protein receptors reside on cell membranes. When activated, they release a signal that causes the cells to self-destruct,” the researchers explained. On the other hand, researchers from Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) discovered that a flavonoid in licorice root could inhibit the progression of pancreatic cancer. The HKBU researchers also said the chemical may boost the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs used to treat the illness. The American Cancer Society (ACS) warns that cancer is the second most common cause of death in the U.S. and that it is exceeded only by heart disease. According to the ACS, more than 1.9 million cancer cases will be diagnosed in the country in 2023. The organization expects an estimated 609,820 deaths this year, which comes to around 1,670 deaths per day. To reduce your cancer risk, avoid harmful habits like smoking.

https://food.news/2023-11-29-nutmeg-versatile-protects-against-free-radical-damage.html,"Spice up sweet and savory dishes with nutmeg, a versatile spice that can help protect against free radical damage",0,"Advertisement While nutmeg isn’t as popular as cinnamon, this spice is also used to add flavor to cakes, cookies or a warm cup of eggnog. Nutmeg is a versatile ingredient that can be used for both sweet and savory goods. It offers health benefits and contains antioxidants that can protect against free radical damage. Nutmeg comes from Myristica fragrans, a tropical evergreen tree indigenous to the Banda Islands in the Moluccas (Spice Islands) of Indonesia. It’s unclear exactly when nutmeg was first discovered, but experts say that as early as the 6th century A.D., nutmeg has been traded in the Greek colony of Byzantium, which was later known as Constantinople — now modern-day Istanbul. It’s believed that the spice traveled as far as Rome, where it was sold as a flavoring and was known for its health benefits and effectiveness as an aphrodisiac. (Related: Keep well this winter with these warming spices packed with health benefits.) Nutmeg is a great spice to have in your kitchen because it can be used in a wide variety of recipes. Nutmeg has a warming, slightly nutty flavor that’s also perfect for beverages like mulled wine and chai tea. Nutmeg can be used on its own or paired with other spices like cardamom and cinnamon. Nutmeg goes well with cakes, cookies, gingerbread and muffins. You can use it to make desserts like nutmeg cheesecake, cinnamon sugar pull-apart bread, cinnamon nutmeg scones or spice Bundt cake. Nutmeg can also be added to savory dishes like curry. Nutmeg is usually sold in its ground form. But if you prefer whole nutmeg, try visiting larger supermarkets that may sell them. Whole nutmeg should not smell, so if you can smell any mustiness do not buy it. Here are some of the benefits of using nutmeg: Nutmeg seeds are tiny, but they are full of plant compounds that act as antioxidants in your body. Several studies have looked into the organic antioxidants from dietary plants as they can protect cells from oxidative stress caused by harmful free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage cells and their components. Research has found that nutmeg is a powerful antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiseptic and antibacterial agent that can support skin health and function. When mixed into a cream, nutmeg helps reduce inflammation and irritation of the skin while promoting hydration. Nutmeg is also considered an aphrodisiac. The Hindus believed that a pinch of nutmeg could improve sexual desire and performance. While there is no specific human evidence of this, it is widely known that a bit of nutmeg can improve male libido. Research suggests that nutmeg oil has antiseptic properties that can inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. When consumed in small doses, nutmeg is considered safe. However, large doses could trigger adverse effects. Nutmeg contains two compounds called myristicin and safrole which, when ingested in large quantities, can cause you to hallucinate and lose muscle coordination. While there are no specific guidelines on how much nutmeg you should consume per day, it is recommended that you do not exceed one to two milligrams a day. Studies show that toxic reactions occur when nutmeg is taken at five grams and above. Purchase clean, organic nutmeg and use it to make hot chocolate or delicious desserts for the family.

https://food.news/2023-11-28-healthy-reasons-to-eat-sweet-potatoes.html,Healthy reasons to eat sweet potatoes,0,"Advertisement Sweet potatoes are nutrient-rich, with a sweet yet earthy flavor profile. This superfood is a great source of nutrients like dietary fiber and vitamins A and C. One large sweet potato (180 grams (g)) provides 162 calories, 3.6 g of protein, 37 g of carbohydrates and 0.2 g of fat. It also contains the following nutrients: Sweet potatoes are filling and provide plenty of health benefits. Here are some of the benefits of adding sweet potatoes to your diet: The anthocyanins in sweet potatoes have anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce heart disease risk. Studies show that purple sweet potato extract can suppress the activities of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, the fiber in sweet potatoes has been shown to lower blood cholesterol levels. Their high potassium content can also help keep blood pressure normal. Several studies have found that consuming flavonoids from foods like purple sweet potatoes can reduce the risk of heart disease. The alkaloids, anthraquinones, cardiac glycosides, flavonoids and tannins in sweet potatoes can also minimize serum creatinine and lactate-dehydrogenase activity, which is beneficial for your heart. Sweet potatoes are a great source of beta-carotene, which is essential for eye health. One cup of sweet potatoes provides 11.3 mg of beta-carotene. Beta-carotene can protect against age-related macular degeneration (AMD), especially when combined with vitamin C, copper and zinc. The anthocyanins in sweet and pigmented potatoes have also been shown to support eye health. Sweet potatoes with orange flesh contain more carotenoids, like the antioxidant lutein, than other types of potato. Lutein is concentrated in the macula of your eye’s retina and is associated with healthy vision. Research suggests that lutein-rich foods like sweet potatoes can help treat diet-related diseases and eye conditions. According to the American Diabetes Association, sweet potatoes are low-glycemic index (low GI) foods that are ideal for diabetes management. Replacing regular potatoes with sweet potatoes not only does wonders for your blood sugar control, but it also helps boost your intake of potassium, vitamins A and C and dietary fiber. Sweet potatoes also contain phenolic compounds and flavonoids that can protect against diabetes. Flavonoids promote glucose absorption in peripheral tissue and enhance insulin secretion, both of which can help you maintain healthy blood sugar levels and manage diabetes. (Related: Support brain health with lutein, a brain-boosting carotenoid.) There are two main varieties of sweet potatoes: dry flesh and moist flesh. Dry flesh sweet potatoes have tan-colored skin, light-colored flesh and a higher starch content. Moist-flesh sweet potatoes have darker skin and a richer orange interior. They taste sweeter and are more commonly available in the supermarket. Note that while the term “yams” is commonly used interchangeably with sweet potatoes, true yams come from an entirely different plant. When buying sweet potatoes, look for fresh sweet potatoes that are heavy for their size, hard, smooth and free of bruises. Avoid sweet potatoes with shriveled skin, dark spots or indentations because these are common signs of decay. You’ll find sweet potatoes in most grocery stores at any time of the year. Don’t refrigerate sweet potatoes. Instead, keep them in a cool, dry and dark place. The ideal storage temperature for fresh sweet potatoes is around 55 F and they will keep for at least a month or longer. Make sure you use sweet potatoes that are stored at warmer temperatures within a week to prevent spoilage. Before prepping sweet potatoes, scrub their skin with a vegetable brush under running water and dry them with a paper towel. Cut or cooked sweet potatoes should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator and used within five days. Sweet potatoes are versatile and can be baked, boiled, roasted, grilled, fried, whipped or pureed. They can serve as a side dish or be used to make salads, breads, pies or chilis. If you prefer a spicy dish, add chili powder. For a slightly sweet option, add cinnamon and nutmeg. When mashing or whipping sweet potatoes, skip the heavy cream and add rosemary and Parmesan for a savory flair with less fat and calories. Sweet potatoes can also be used to make lasagna, casserole, sweet potato hash or sweet potato gnocchi. Sweet potatoes are great for breakfast, lunch or dinner because they’re nutritious and inexpensive ingredients. Watch the video below to learn how to make a sweet potato pie.

https://food.news/2023-11-27-cranberry-juice-prevent-urinary-tract-infections.html,Prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and support overall health with cranberry juice,0,"Advertisement Native to northern parts of the U.S., cranberry is a popular superfood loaded with beneficial polyphenols that have antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. You can buy cranberries as fresh or dried berries, or in juice or supplement form. Many studies have investigated the effects of cranberries on urinary tract infections (UTIs). Research suggests that cranberries can help prevent recurring UTIs. UTIs are common in females older than 18. At least 60 percent of females have had at least one UTI, while up to 30 percent have had subsequent ones. Children, the elderly and patients with catheters are especially susceptible to UTIs. Cranberries contain proanthocyanidins (PACS) that are credited with cranberry’s beneficial effects against UTIs. PACS prevent bacteria that commonly cause UTIs, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli.), from attaching to cells in the urinary tract and causing infection. Recent guidelines suggest that cranberry products may help reduce the risk of recurrent UTIs in women, children and those who have undergone interventions such as bladder radiotherapy. Consuming cranberries is also linked to a 30 percent decreased risk of recurrent UTIs in these groups. Cranberry juice was also found to be more effective than other dosage forms, like capsules or tablets, in preventing UTIs. The PACS in cranberries may also help suppress stomach or intestinal infections caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). A study of 522 adults with H. pylori bacteria revealed that participants who drank cranberry juice with a high amount of PACS twice a day for eight weeks had a 20 percent lower infection risk than those who took cranberry powder or a placebo. (Related: 4 Health benefits of pomegranate, an ancient superfood.) A review of 22 studies concluded that cranberries may lower fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c — a test that measures average blood sugar levels over the past three months — in those with Type 2 diabetes. Researchers suggest that the polyphenols in cranberries are responsible for this effect. Research also suggests that cranberries may reduce some risk factors for heart disease, such as blood pressure and body mass index (BMI). Additionally, they can help increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or “good” cholesterol, in individuals younger than 50. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), a 100-gram (g) serving (one-half cup) of cranberry juice provides the following nutrients: Cranberry juice has a similar sugar content to other juices, which should be considered if you are monitoring your sugar intake. You can easily add cranberries to your regular diet. While fresh cranberries are not usually consumed raw due to their acidity and tartness, they are often added to recipes. Cranberry is often sweetened and consumed as a juice or used to make sauces. Cranberry extracts and powders may be added to dishes. Use cranberries to make a refreshing fruit smoothie or fresh cranberry salsa. If you prefer something savory, make roasted Brussels sprouts with cranberries, bacon and maple.

https://food.news/2023-11-24-us-schools-dealing-with-milk-shortages.html,Schools all over the U.S. are now experiencing MILK SHORTAGES,0,"Advertisement The typical school lunch for many young students in the United States often includes a ubiquitous carton of milk. But some school cafeterias may soon run out the half-pint cartons of milk they usually serve, with several districts across the U.S. already trying to find alternatives. Strangely enough, the problem is not a shortage of milk but of the cardboard cartons used to package and serve it, reported dairy industry suppliers and state officials. According to a statement from Pactiv Evergreen of Lake Forest, Illinois, which calls itself “the leading manufacturer of fresh food and beverage packaging in North America,” the company is still dealing with “significantly higher than projected demand” for its milk cartons. Matt Herrick, spokesperson for the International Dairy Foods Association, explained that the shortage is affecting the company’s ability to fully supply some school milk orders. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has acknowledged that the supply chain problem now affects several states. School officials in California, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington state said they are preparing for the shortage. The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service previously required milk to be served with school meals. But in a memo issued in late October, districts were given leeway to serve different types or sizes of milk during the supply shortage. As a last resort, districts could even skip offering milk. It remains to be seen how long the carton shortage could last. In Everett, Washington, school officials told parents to expect a disruption in cafeteria milk supply that could last for several months. (Related: Shortage of feedstock caused by severe drought leading to MILK shortage in France.) Herrick said U.S. milk processors are cooperating with other package suppliers to address the carton shortage. He said that he expected the problem to improve within weeks and to be resolved by early next year. As the shortage continues, school districts are now sending messages to their families and communities about how they are either currently managing or preparing to navigate serving milk without the half-pint cartons. According to several districts, they expect the milk carton shortage to last until January 2024. In West Virginia’s Preston County Schools, school nutrition officials are considering options aside from their usual milk supplier. Beth Doerr, the district’s child nutrition director, released a statement to advise the public that in some cases, “juice and water will need to be substituted.” For Walla Walla Public Schools in Washington, Pamela Milleson, the district’s nutrition services director, has prepared a multi-tiered contingency plan with other district departments in case the milk carton shortage reaches the district. The 5,600-student district also released an FAQ page on its website and plans to inform parents should the shortage impact local school milk offerings. Milleson said Walla Walla schools usually serve 22,000 cartons of milk per week. A July 2023 USDA report revealed that 97 percent of school food authorities surveyed between November 2022 and January 2023 experienced one or more supply chain-related issues, including increased costs and staff or product shortages. Milleson said one of the important lessons that came out of the pandemic is that it taught schools “how to be flexible, stay calm and develop effective contingency plans” during emergency scenarios. However, the ongoing supply chain woes are negatively affecting staff and families. Meanwhile, dairy suppliers are pointing at packaging manufacturer Pactiv Evergreen as the source of the milk carton supply issue. Milleson thinks the increase in states and districts serving universal school meals could also be a factor affecting the carton supply shortage.

https://food.news/2023-11-22-sweet-potatoes-support-digestive-health-prevent-cancer.html,Sweet potatoes can support digestive health and protect against cancer,0,"Advertisement Sweet potatoes are a staple for Thanksgiving dinners, but the vegetable deserves the spotlight year-round. Sweet potatoes contain dietary fiber, vitamins and other essential nutrients. They also offer several health benefits, such as improving digestion. While some people use the terms “sweet potato” and “yam” interchangeably, the two are not related. Yams have a drier texture and are more starchy compared to sweet potatoes. Here are some of the health benefits of sweet potatoes: The dietary fiber in sweet potatoes can help prevent constipation and promote regularity, which are important for a healthy digestive tract. Studies have also found that high dietary fiber intake can help reduce the risk of colorectal cancers. Sweet potatoes are a great source of beta-carotene, a plant pigment that acts as a potent antioxidant. It is also a provitamin. Your body converts beta-carotene into the active form of vitamin A. Antioxidants may help reduce the risk of different types of cancer, including lung and prostate cancer. Antioxidants like beta-carotene can help prevent cellular damage from free radicals. If levels of free radicals in your body get too high, cellular damage can occur. This can increase the risk of some conditions. Obtaining antioxidants from dietary sources like sweet potatoes may help prevent diseases like cancer. After the age of 18, the Dietary Guidelines recommend an intake of 700 milligrams (mg) of vitamin A per day for women and 900 mg per day for men. The vitamin is crucial for protecting eye health. According to the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), a baked sweet potato with the skin on contains around 1,403 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin A, or 561 percent of the daily requirement. Vitamin A also acts as an antioxidant. Combined with other antioxidants, it can help protect you from different health conditions. One 124-gram (g) serving of sweet potato provides 12.8 mg of vitamin C. Current guidelines recommend a daily intake of 75 mg of vitamin C for adult women and 90 mg for adult men. If you consume little or no vitamin C, you can develop scurvy. Many of the symptoms of scurvy are due to tissue problems linked to impaired collagen production. Vitamin C also supports the immune system and enhances iron absorption. A low vitamin C intake may increase your risk of iron deficiency anemia. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), it’s best to avoid eating foods that contain high amounts of added salt. Instead, you should eat more potassium-rich foods to maintain a healthy cardiovascular system. A 124 g serving of mashed sweet potato provides 259 mg of potassium or around five percent of the daily requirements for an adult. Current guidelines recommend that adults consume 4,700 mg of potassium daily. In one 2008 study, scientists reported that an extract of white-skinned sweet potato improved insulin sensitivity in people with Type 2 diabetes. The dietary fiber in sweet potatoes is also good for you. According to research, people who consume more fiber appear to have a lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. A 124 g serving of mashed sweet potato, or around half a cup, will provide 2.5 g of fiber. The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest that adults aged 19 years and above consume 22.4 to 33.6 g of fiber each day, depending on their age and sex. (Related: Support healthy blood sugar levels with this delicious sweet potato and pumpkin soup.) When buying and cooking sweet potatoes, always check if the potato is firm with smooth, taut skin. Store sweet potatoes in a cool, dry place for no longer than three to five weeks. Sweet potatoes are naturally sweet and creamy. Roasting sweet potatoes will bring out their natural flavor so you can eat them without toppings. Other ways to incorporate sweet potatoes into a balanced diet include adding roasted sweet potatoes and pecans to a salad and topping it with balsamic vinegar.

https://food.news/2023-11-22-pumpkin-support-eye-health-superfood-beta-carotene.html,"Support eye health with pumpkin, a superfood source of beta carotene",0,"Advertisement Pumpkin is a variety of squash that may come to mind during popular holidays like Halloween or Thanksgiving. This nutrient-rich vegetable is low in calories, but full of vitamins and minerals. Pumpkin seeds, leaves and juice are also full of nutrients. Pumpkin offers amazing benefits, including being one of the best-known sources of beta-carotene, the powerful antioxidant that gives orange vegetables and fruits their vibrant color. Your body converts ingested beta-carotene into vitamin A. Studies show that pumpkins can do the following: Pumpkins are full of beneficial antioxidants. The vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene in pumpkins can support eye health and prevent degenerative damage in older adults. In 2019, the National Eye Institute conducted a clinical trial called the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS). The results of the study suggested that high doses of vitamin C, vitamin E and beta-carotene are associated with a significantly reduced risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Pumpkins contain dietary fiber, potassium and vitamin C that all support heart health. Results of a 2017 study involving 2,722 volunteers revealed that consuming enough potassium could be as important as decreasing sodium in the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension), which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Reducing sodium intake involves preparing meals that contain little or no salt. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements, consuming more potassium may also reduce the risk of other types of CVD. (Related: Grapefruit found to help reduce high blood pressure.) If you have diabetes, incorporating pumpkins into your diet may help control your condition and blood sugar levels. The results of a 2019 study suggest that a combination of two plant extracts, one of which was pumpkin polysaccharides, helped bring down the blood sugar levels in mice. While the study did not involve humans, the findings suggest that pumpkin compounds may have some potential to protect against Type 2 diabetes. The results of a 2016 study suggest that there is a connection between a diet rich in beta-carotene and tumor suppression in prostate cancer. The results of a 2014 cross-sectional study also showed that beta-carotene slowed the development of colon cancer in a Japanese population. According to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Food Data Central database, one cup (245 grams (g)) of cooked, boiled, or drained pumpkin prepared without salt contains: Pumpkin also contains the following essential vitamins and minerals: Pumpkins are also full of dietary fiber. The recommended intake of fiber is between 25 g and 38 g per day for adults. Fiber helps slow the rate of sugar absorption into the blood, promotes regular bowel movements and smooths digestion. Getting enough fiber in your diet can also help reduce the risk of colon cancer. There are many ways to add more pumpkins to your diet. Preparing fresh pumpkin at home will offer the most health benefits, but canned pumpkin is also a great choice because the vegetable retains many of its health benefits in the canning process. Try to avoid canned pumpkin pie mix for regular consumption because this product contains added sugars and syrups. When buying canned pumpkin, look for products that only have one ingredient, pumpkin. If you’re buying sweet or pie pumpkin varieties, choose a pumpkin that has a few inches of stem remaining. Get a pumpkin that is hard and heavy for its size. You can store uncut pumpkins in a cool, dark place for up to two months.

https://food.news/2023-11-21-3-health-benefits-of-cranberries-recipes-included.html,"3 Health benefits of cranberries, a Thanksgiving staple (recipes included)",0,"Advertisement Most people associate cranberries with Thanksgiving, but there are lots of good reasons to eat cranberries year-round. Perfect as a snack or a main dish, cranberries are a nutrient powerhouse. With just 50 calories and four grams of sugar per cup, cranberries are low in calories and sugar, especially when compared to other fruits. Cranberries have also been linked to a number of impressive health benefits as they can help do the following: Cranberries are packed with antioxidants. In fact, when it comes to fruits, they rank just below blueberries, the so-called king of antioxidants, in antioxidant potency. Those antioxidants help reduce chronic inflammation, which contributes to the development of several chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Previous studies have shown that people who consume cranberries often have lower levels of C-reactive protein than those who don’t eat cranberries. C-reactive protein is a blood marker of inflammation, which has been shown to trigger premature aging and cognitive decline. Cranberries contain bioactive compounds called phytochemicals. Many phytochemicals act as antioxidants. Aside from reducing inflammation, antioxidants also protect healthy cells from free radicals. These reactive molecules are naturally generated by our bodies. But at very high levels, they can damage healthy cells, fats, proteins and even DNA. Therefore, it’s important to eat foods rich in phytochemicals, such as cranberries. One of the best-known benefits of cranberries is their use in promoting urinary tract health. For decades, many people used cranberries as a remedy for bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs), which caused frequent and painful urination. Scientists first thought that cranberries worked by acidifying the urine, thus killing the bacteria causing the UTI. (Related: Prevent urinary tract infections naturally with this antioxidant-rich superfood.) It wasn’t until the 1990s that scientists would determine that something in cranberries prevented bacteria from sticking to the lining of the bladder. That “something” was identified as proanthocyanidins. Finally, in 2016, a landmark study found that drinking cranberry juice every day reduced symptomatic UTIs by nearly 40 percent in women with recurrent UTIs. The study’s findings suggest a reduction in the need for antibiotics when treating UTIs and highlight the role of cranberries as a natural treatment for UTIs. It’s best to buy fresh, raw cranberries when they are in season, which usually runs from mid-September to mid-November in North America. They can be refrigerated or frozen for later use, but it’s best to eat them fresh. The skins contain many of the beneficial properties of cranberries, so your best bet is to add them whole to oats or cereals or blend them into juices and smoothies. You can also incorporate cranberries into both sweet and savory recipes. Make your own delicious cranberry sauce with only five ingredients. It’s the easiest Thanksgiving side dish. Ingredients for 2 1/2 cups of sauce: Preparation: These cranberry crumble bars freeze well.

https://food.news/2023-11-20-allspice-natural-source-of-beneficial-plant-compounds.html,"The nice spice: Try allspice, a natural source of beneficial plant compounds",0,"Advertisement It may sound like allspice is a premade blend of spices, but it’s actually a single spice. Allspice has a unique flavor profile that is often described as a blend of up to four different spices, hence the name. The spice is also used in folk medicine due to its potential health benefits. Allspice, also called Jamaican pepper, newspice or pimienta, is the dried, unripe berries of Pimenta dioica, a plant that belongs to the Myrtaceae family. It’s native to Jamaica, the tropical forests of South and Central America, and Southern Mexico, but it’s also commercially grown in Cuba, Honduras and Trinidad. Allspice is made by picking the berries from the plant’s small flowers and drying them in the sun until they’re browned. Allspice is available ground or whole. It is often used as a seasoning for meats, desserts and liqueurs. (Related: Tips to help bring out the flavor of your homemade spice blends.) When used as a spice in small amounts, allspice is considered safe to use. However, older research suggests that people with hand dermatitis may develop allergic reactions when cooking with it. Drug interactions are not well documented. Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests a potentially negative effect when large amounts of allspice are consumed while taking blood clotting medication. Because of the lack of human studies on allspice’s health benefits, an appropriate dosage has yet to be determined. Due to its many uses in folk medicine, the compounds in allspice have been studied widely. Those behind allspice’s benefits include: Ericifolin Ericifolin is a phenolic compound that may have antibacterial and cancer-fighting properties. Eugenol Eugenol is derived from phenylpropene. It has potential antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and cancer-fighting properties. Gallic acid Gallic acid is yet another powerful antioxidant and it may have cancer-fighting and antiviral effects. Gallic acid has also been studied for potential protective effects on brain health, especially the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s. Quercetin Quercetin is a type of flavonoid, a powerful antioxidant that may help protect against harmful molecules called free radicals. Its antioxidant capacity may have cancer-fighting properties, and it’s also known for its potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. Allspice provides many health benefits. Here are some of them, all backed by science: Antimicrobial and antifungal effects The eugenol and ericifolin in allspice may provide antimicrobial and antifungal effects. Studies on essential oils extracted from allspice berries suggest that it has antifungal properties against Candida albicans, a yeast that is resistant to certain antifungal drugs. Additionally, the essential oil shows antibacterial properties against E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, salmonella and S. aureus. Its effects are mainly attributed to its eugenol content, which may damage bacterial membranes. Menopause treatment Menopause is the termination of the menstrual cycle in women aged 45 to 52. The condition causes hormonal changes, particularly a decline in estrogen and progesterone levels. This may cause the following symptoms: While hormone therapy has traditionally been the primary treatment for menopause symptoms, complementary therapies are becoming more popular, such as herbal remedies. Research suggests that allspice extract binds to estrogen receptors. This means it may trick your body into believing that its estrogen levels are up, thus helping manage symptoms. Can protect against cancer Many of allspice’s beneficial plant compounds have potential cancer-fighting properties. According to test-tube and animal studies, ericifolin, eugenol, gallic acid and quercetin may decrease tumor growth, prevent the spread of tumors and promote apoptosis or the programmed death of cancerous cells. Allspice’s anticancer effects have been studied on breast, colon, duodenal, gastric and prostate cancers. Its effect varies depending on the type of cancer. Research conducted on breast cancer cell lines suggests that allspice extract leads to autophagy, or the body’s way of clearing unnecessary or damaged cells, such as cancerous cells, by degrading them. Prostate cancer cells can also be eliminated through apoptosis, while gastric cancer cell lines were affected by allspice extracts’ ability to inhibit the growth of Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that’s considered carcinogenic. You may buy allspice berries, whole or ground, in the supermarket’s spice aisle. Allspice essential oil can also be bought at stores and online. Store allspice in a cool, dry place, like your kitchen pantry. Allspice’s unique flavor profile makes it a versatile ingredient that can be used to give a warm, peppery flavor to different dishes. Use allspice to season seafood or fish or a dessert like allspice crumb muffins. Use whole berries the same way you would use whole cloves. Ground allspice is mostly used in baking or as a seasoning for meats, poultry, stews and vegetables. Here are some sweet and savory dishes that you can make using allspice: Since allspice can be used in almost any dish, make sure you have it in your pantry as you prepare for the holidays.

Cranberries are native to North America. Now, cranberries are grown across the northern United States, Canada and Chile. Can help with UTIs Cranberries are often used as traditional treatments for UTIs. The high level of antioxidant proanthocyanidins (PACs) in cranberries may help prevent certain bacteria from binding to the urinary tract walls. This suggests that PACs in cranberries may help prevent a urinary tract infection (UTI). In a 2016 review, researchers found that medical professionals most commonly recommend cranberries for women with recurrent UTIs. Another 2014 study of 516 participants revealed that taking a capsule of cranberry extract twice per day reduced the incidence of UTIs. (Related: Prevent urinary tract infections naturally with this antioxidant-rich superfood.) May help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease According to a 2019 systematic review, supplementing cranberries in your diet may help you manage several risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). These include systolic blood pressure, which is the blood pressure during a contraction of the heart muscle. The review also suggested that cranberry supplementation helped reduce body mass index (BMI) and improve levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or “good” cholesterol. In another study from 2019, scientists examined 78 volunteers who were overweight or were obese. Their findings showed that consuming a single dose of a low-calorie cranberry beverage with a high content of plant compounds daily improved someone’s regulation of blood sugar, chemical signs of inflammation and increased levels of HDL lipoprotein. May help slow cancer progression A 2016 review of 34 preclinical studies showed that cranberries or compounds in cranberries had several beneficial effects on cancer cells in test tubes. These benefits included reducing inflammation, slowing the growth of cancer cells and triggering the death of cancer cells. The 2016 review also found that cranberries can affect several other mechanisms that promote cancer growth and spread. Can help promote oral health The PACs in cranberries may also benefit oral health. A 2019 study revealed that PACs in fruits like cranberries may help teeth against a strand of bacteria that causes tooth decay. Cranberries may also help protect against gum disease. Farmers harvest fresh cranberries in September and October, so fall is the best time to purchase them. If you want to get cranberries the rest of the year, they are also available dried, frozen, or canned. Another option is to refrigerate fresh cranberries or freeze them for later use. Here are some suggestions on how to incorporate cranberries into a balanced diet: Keep in mind that some store-bought cranberry products may contain added sugars because cranberries are quite tart and may be difficult to consume without some added sweetener. Always check the ingredients label and choose the product with the least added sugar. Store-bought cranberry juice may contain other fruit juices and added sweeteners. When looking for cranberry juice that offers the most benefits, check labels that lists cranberry as the primary ingredient. Cranberries are usually safe to consume, but if you are taking the blood-thinning drug warfarin (Jantoven), discuss your intake of cranberries with your doctor. Data suggests that it may interact with warfarin or other blood thinners and cause increased anticlotting effects. Cranberry products may also cause a higher excretion of oxalate in urine. This could promote the formation of kidney stones if you are susceptible to calcium oxalate-type stones. If you have a history of kidney stones, talk to your healthcare provider before increasing their intake of cranberries.

It’s often associated with fall and Thanksgiving in the U.S. and is a common ingredient for various sweet and savory dishes around the world. Cinnamon is a fragrant spice that is made by cutting the stems of cinnamon trees (Cinnamomum verum). The inner bark is removed and saved while the outer parts, which are too woody, are discarded. The inner bark forms strips that curl into rolls when dried, forming the cinnamon sticks that you may already be familiar with. Cinnamon sticks can be used whole for cooking and seasoning or ground into powder. Cinnamon is native to Asia, particularly in Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon), the coast of India and Myanmar (Burma). Now, cinnamon is also cultivated in South America and the West Indies. Cinnamon has been consumed by humans for thousands of years, dating back as early as 2,000 B.C. The spice was also used in Egypt for embalming and religious practices. Cinnamon was used as a preservative for meats during the winter thousands of years ago. In medieval times, doctors used cinnamon to treat conditions like arthritis, coughs and sore throats. Research suggests that cinnamon offers some health benefits, depending on the variety and quality used. Cinnamon has beneficial antioxidants Cinnamon contains cinnamaldehyde, a polyphenol compound that has been found to have antioxidant properties. Antioxidants are substances that can help protect cells from harmful free radicals. Free radicals can be found in the environment and food and they may contribute to health issues like heart disease and cancer. Cinnamon may help with Type 2 diabetes Some studies suggest that cinnamon can help reduce insulin resistance and blood sugar levels. (Related: Study: Cinnamon compound boosts metabolic health and helps fight obesity.) Here are some suggestions on how different cultures use cinnamon: Below are more healthy recipes you can try if you have cinnamon at home: There are two main types of commercial cinnamon: Ceylon Cinnamon and cassia cinnamon. Ceylon cinnamon Ceylon cinnamon is mostly produced in Sri Lanka. Some people call it “true cinnamon.” Ceylon cinnamon is more expensive than cassia cinnamon and has more health benefits. It has a milder, sweeter flavor, and it’s best for baking and hot drinks such as hot chocolate. If you buy supplements, they will likely be Ceylon, especially if it is a good quality supplement. Cassia cinnamon Cassia cinnamon comes from Southern China and is mostly produced in Indonesia. It has the stronger smell and flavor of the two varieties. This cheaper variety is what you can typically find in the spice aisle at the grocery store. Cassia cinnamon is often used in various products containing cinnamon. Other types of cinnamon include: The best way to store cinnamon is in a cool, dry place away from heat and sunlight, such as your pantry. Cinnamon is generally safe to use, but here are some things to consider if you haven’t tried cinnamon before. Because there is limited research on cinnamon supplementation, children, pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding should avoid using cinnamon as a treatment. Cinnamon may affect your blood sugar levels, so if you have diabetes talk to your doctor before taking supplements. If you regularly take any medications, check with your doctor before you start using cinnamon supplements. They could affect the way antibiotics, blood thinners, diabetes drugs, heart medicines and others work.

It is a nutritious, versatile vegetable that’s full of a variety of nutrients, including dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals and beneficial antioxidants. Many of the health benefits of pumpkin are focused on its fiber content and micronutrients, including beta-carotene and vitamin A. Pumpkin is a type of winter squash that belongs to the same plant family as cucumbers and melons. It’s technically a fruit since it contains seeds. However, in terms of nutrition, pumpkin is more like a vegetable. Pumpkins are usually round and orange, although their size, shape and color can vary depending on the variety. They have a thick outer rind that’s smooth and ribbed and a stem that connects the pumpkin to its leafy plant. Pumpkins are hollow, except for ivory-colored seeds covered in stringy flesh. They are native to North America and have a big role in two holidays. They are carved into jack-o’-lanterns for Halloween and cooked into pies for Thanksgiving dessert in the U.S. and Canada. Pumpkins are also grown on every continent except Antarctica. Pumpkin seeds, leaves and flesh are all edible. There are several varieties of pumpkins, such as: Most of the pumpkins sold in America are canned. (Related: The sweet spice: Health benefits of nutmeg and tips for proper storage.) Pumpkin is a nutritious food and it contains different vitamins and minerals and relatively few calories. One cup (245 grams) of canned pumpkin provides: A cup of canned pumpkin also contains smaller amounts of several other nutrients. The vitamin A contained in pumpkin is in the form of vitamin A precursors beta-carotene and alpha-carotene. Your body can turn these beneficial antioxidants into vitamin A after you consume them. Pumpkin seeds, also called pepitas, are also commonly eaten as a snack. A one-ounce (15 grams) serving of pumpkin seeds in their shell contains: Pumpkin seeds are low in carbs but high in fat, so they’re an ideal snack if you are on a low-carb or plant-based diet. Most of a pumpkin’s health benefits come from its vitamin and mineral content, along with its low sugar and high fiber content. Supports optimal eye health Pumpkins are full of beta-carotene, which helps keep your vision sharp by helping the retina absorb light. The combination of other vitamins and minerals in pumpkin may help prevent age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Study findings suggest that individuals with AMD could slow its progression by taking supplements containing zinc, vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene or a combination of these nutrients. Supports optimal immune health The beta-carotene in pumpkin is partially converted into vitamin A, which can help protect your body from fight infections. Scientists have found that vitamin A is important for strengthening the intestinal lining, making it more resistant to infections. Additionally, vitamin C has a key role in immune health by strengthening the immune cells that respond when a pathogen is identified. Supports optimal heart health Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables is key to maintaining optimal heart health. Pumpkin contains specific nutrients that are good for heart health. One nutrient, potassium, may help reduce high blood pressure levels. Pumpkin also contains fiber that may help lower blood cholesterol levels by binding with the cholesterol in the foods you eat and preventing its absorption. Pumpkin is popular in sweet treats like custards, muffins, pancakes and pies, but it can also be used to make savory dishes. Use pumpkin to make soup or roast it with other vegetables.

https://food.news/2023-11-16-health-benefits-nutmeg-tips-proper-storage.html,The sweet spice: Health benefits of nutmeg and tips for proper storage,0,"Advertisement Nutmeg is a popular spice used on eggnog, desserts and various baked goods. But did you know that nutmeg also offers some health benefits and contains beneficial antioxidants? Nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) is a spice that is commonly used in baked goods, holiday treats, ethnic cuisine and different beverages. Nutmeg is produced by grinding nutmeg seeds from a flowering plant of the Myristicaceae family, sometimes called the nutmeg family. The plant is native to Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands. Nutmeg spice has a sweet taste and is often used with other sweet spices such as cinnamon, clove and allspice. Some studies have found that nutmeg has antioxidant, antibacterial, antidiabetic, pain-relieving, liver-protecting and cancer-preventative properties. Aside from its use as a flavoring spice in Asian, European, Middle Eastern and African cuisines and traditional American baked goods, nutmeg also has a history of medicinal use. Data suggests that nutmeg has a long history of being used to relieve chronic pain. Findings from rat studies have also suggested that nutmeg oil may have potential as a chronic pain reliever. According to data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), one serving (one teaspoon or 2.2 grams) of ground nutmeg provides 12 calories. The calories come from carbohydrates (1.08 g), protein (0.13 g) and fat (0.8 g). Nutmeg contains a small amount of vitamins A and C, choline and folate, but not in amounts that will impact your daily recommended intake of those vitamins. It also contains minerals like calcium (3.7 mg), magnesium (3.7 mg), potassium (7.0 mg), phosphorus (4.3 mg) and small amounts of sodium and manganese. (Related: Support brain health and improve cognitive function with these herbs and spices.) You can buy nutmeg in whole or ground form. Ground nutmeg is commonly found in almost every grocery store. If you want to buy whole nutmeg seeds to grind at home, you may need to visit a specialty market or purchase it online. Keep in mind that ground nutmeg will lose its flavor quickly. This is why some cooks choose to buy it whole. Whole nutmeg seeds stay fresh indefinitely, so you can grind what you need at home and save the rest for later. You can use nutmeg to flavor sweet baked goods such as apple pie, cookies and other desserts. Nutmeg is used to make a bechamel sauce. The spice can also be used to make baked or stewed fruit and custards. Nutmeg is also used when making curries, eggnog, punches, sauces (especially onion-based and milk sauces), pasta and vegetables, like spinach. Lastly, nutmeg can also be used to flavor meats, like lamb or starchy vegetables. While nutmeg is often used in cooking and baking, the spice or its essential oil can be used to gain a nutmeg high. Remember that using nutmeg-like this can have serious side effects. According to some sources, nutmeg affects the nervous system and the imagination. Some experts have warned that nutmeg essential oil can have a hypnotic or hallucinogenic effect. There are also published reports of nutmeg being used as a psychotropic drug with harmful consequences. According to the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, nutmeg is safe when consumed in amounts typically found in food. However, the overconsumption of nutmeg may be risky and can cause adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting and hallucination. There are reports of nutmeg poisoning dating back to the early 1900s, with symptoms including burning pain in the stomach, giddiness, or precordial anxiety. Scientists suggest that the toxic effects of nutmeg are due to the presence of myristicin oil, a natural organic compound found in the spice. In one published report, scientists discovered that nutmeg poisoning is rare but probably underreported and should be considered in recreational substance users with acute psychotic symptoms and central nervous system symptoms. Use nutmeg in moderation to make delicious desserts and savory sauces. Visit Superfoods.news to read more articles about nutmeg and other spices with amazing health benefits.

https://food.news/2023-10-30-grapefruit-can-help-reduce-high-blood-pressure.html,Grapefruit found to help reduce high blood pressure,0,"Advertisement Multiple studies have found that grapefruit can help lower high blood pressure. Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) was named for the grape-like clusters that form in the tree it grows in. The fruit belongs to the Rutaceae family and comes in white, pink and red varieties. Each type offers different flavor profiles, ranging from intensely tart to deliciously sweet. Grapefruit is full of vitamins A and C, and it is a great source of dietary fiber. The fruit also has an extremely low glycemic index of 25. The glycemic index measures how much food raises blood glucose levels, which means grapefruit is ideal for people with diabetes. (Related: Health tips: 7 Ways to control your blood pressure.) Additionally, grapefruit contains vitamin B6, calcium, folate, magnesium and thiamine. It also contains potassium, a nutrient with an essential role in controlling heart rate and blood pressure, as well as maintaining normal fluid levels inside cells, which is then balanced by sodium, which keeps normal fluid levels outside the cells. One grapefruit provides at least 10 percent of our daily potassium requirements. High blood pressure (hypertension) is a serious health condition and a risk factor for heart disease and stroke. A 2023 report from the American Heart Association has found that almost 50 percent of Americans over 20 have high blood pressure, which represents 122 million people. Experts warn that the likelihood of having high blood pressure increases as you age, reflected in the fact that at least three-quarters of Americans over 65 have the condition. Data suggests that grapefruit is effective for lowering blood pressure because of its high potassium content, which counteracts the adverse effects of sodium, one of the common causes of high blood pressure. Several studies support the use of grapefruit for lowering blood pressure. In a randomized controlled trial published in the journal Metabolism, researchers observed 74 overweight adult volunteers and divided them into two groups. The first was given half a grapefruit before each meal three times a day, while the control group didn’t eat any grapefruit. The results showed that grapefruit helped lower blood pressure. Those in the grapefruit group also lost weight, decreased their waist circumference and had a decrease in LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein). In another study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, scientists reported that grapefruit juice enhanced the systolic blood pressure-lowering effects of beetroot juice. Researchers conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis set out to study evidence for or against the effect of grapefruit consumption on body weight, blood pressure and lipid profiles. The analysis indicated a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure for those given grapefruit compared to the control group. Grapefruit is naturally high in potassium, and studies show that greater potassium consumption can lower blood pressure. According to a systematic review of 22 randomized controlled trials, increased potassium intake reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults with hypertension. Findings also indicated a decreased risk of stroke with increased potassium intake. A 1991 clinical trial published in the journal The Lancet revealed that grapefruit significantly increased the absorption of some medications, suggesting that regular doses could be turned into potentially deadly overdoses. The trial studied the effects of felodipine and nifedipine, two medications used to treat high blood pressure. Six men with borderline hypertension were given five milligrams (mg) of felodipine with either water, grapefruit, or orange juice. When taken with grapefruit juice, the bioavailability of felodipine averaged 284 percent, but ranged between 164 to 469 percent, compared to when taken with water. When the same test was repeated with 10 mg of nifedipine, its bioavailability with grapefruit juice was 134 percent, with a range of 108 to 169 percent, compared to that with water. David Bailey, a Canadian pharmacologist who received his doctorate in pharmacology from the University of Toronto, initially made the discovery. Bailey made the discovery by accident while researching the effect of alcohol on the blood pressure medication felodipine in the late 1980s. He wanted to disguise the taste of the alcohol and tried doing so using grapefruit juice. Bailey discovered that the subjects taking the medications with grapefruit juice had higher levels of the drug in their bloodstream. Upon continued study, he found that the grapefruit juice inhibited CYP3A4, an enzyme that helps break down the medication in the gut. This then makes the body absorb more of the drug. Bailey’s discovery resulted in the Lancet article mentioned above, and the phenomenon was known as “the grapefruit effect.” Bailey’s subsequent research showed grapefruit’s interactions with approximately 100 oral medications, where its effects either increased levels of the drug in the body to potentially dangerous levels, or the opposite: Reducing their effectiveness. His pioneering work resulted in many medications having warning labels, alerting patients not to take them with grapefruit juice. Here are some examples of medications that can interact with grapefruit juice: While reactions vary depending on the person, you should always check the labels and inserts of medications you are taking to confirm if grapefruit juice could interact with them. Grapefruit is also full of dietary fiber, antioxidants and potassium. If you have hypertension, try incorporating grapefruit into a balanced diet to lower your blood pressure naturally.

https://food.news/2023-10-24-antioxidants-in-grapes-can-boost-eye-health.html,Study shows antioxidants in grapes can boost eye health,0,"Advertisement A study has found that grapes are rich in antioxidants that can boost eye health. The vibrant pigmentation of this fruit reflects the rich concentration of polyphenols and antioxidants in their skin, making them a valuable addition to your diet. Polyphenols are plant compounds that offer many health benefits, from relaxing blood vessels to fighting free radical damage. Singaporean scientists analyzed the powerful antioxidant effects of grapes to assess their impact on oxidative stress markers, especially concerning eye health. Oxidative stress is one of the most significant contributing factors to all modern diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Researchers focused on oxidative damage as a causal factor in reducing eye health. The buildup of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and a reduction in macular pigment optical density (MPOD) are indicators of a decline in eye health due to oxidative stress. Due to the effects of grapes on fighting free radicals, the researchers hypothesized that an increase in grape compounds in the diet would increase MPOD and decrease AGE. For the study, researchers worked with 44 Singaporean adult volunteers. They all had their MPOD and AGE calculated during intake. Throughout the 16-week trial, the group was given either grape powder or a placebo. At the end of the study, both MPOD and AGE were once again evaluated in both groups. The researchers found that the group that was given regular doses of grape powder had “significantly more dense macular pigment and significantly less advanced glycation end products.” (Related: Grapes: Versatile fruit with health benefits.) Note that the study did not look at the concept of eating grapes and how it affects your vision directly. Instead, the research team tried to understand the effects of grape consumption on factors that coexist in those with declining eye health. With that in mind, the study suggests that an increase in grapes within the diet of adults is correlated to a reduction in oxidative stress in the eyes. The study suggests that grapes can help protect against oxidative stress within optical structures. This means that the more you follow an antioxidant-rich diet and eat organic fruits and vegetables, the more likely you are to reduce the threat of oxidative stress. The study is not overly complicated. While the researchers gave some of the volunteers grape powder, you can simply add organic grapes to your regular diet to reap similar protective benefits. Keep in mind that grape powder is extracted from whole grapes and the same benefits are possibly not present if you simply drink grape juice or wine. This is likely because the polyphenols are densely aggregated within grape skin. Another thing worth noting is that polyphenols and other plant substances beneficial for human health are almost always densest in the skin of said fruits and vegetables. A diet full of a variety of whole foods is almost universally beneficial for human health. Specifically, vibrantly colored plants and fruit are highly nutritious, so eat grapes as part of a balanced diet. Here are other nutritious foods that you can eat to boost eye health: Like grapes, broccoli can also help protect eye health. Broccoli is full of vitamin C, an antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress in the eyes and helps prevent cataracts. A cup of raw broccoli contains 81.2 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C, which offers at least 90 percent of the daily value for men and more than 100 percent for women. Broccoli is also a natural source of vitamin A. According to a July review, broccoli’s antioxidant load may help prevent age-related macular degeneration. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics lists kale as one of the best foods for eye health, along with other dark leafy greens like collard greens, spinach and turnip greens. Kale is full of the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, and experts suggest that it could help reduce sun-related damage to eye tissue and reduce the risk of age-related eye issues. While salmon is often associated with brain health, the omega-3 fatty acids known as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in salmon are also essential for eye health. While the eye benefits of DHA and EPA found in salmon start kicking in before birth, they offer benefits throughout your whole life. Wild sockeye salmon is one of the richest food sources of DHA. It’s also a food source of vitamin A and zinc, other nutrients that are beneficial for your eye health. Carrots often hold the title of the best food for eye health because they are full of beta-carotene, the pigment that gives orange vegetables their vibrant hue. While carrots are full of beta-carotene, sweet potatoes actually contain more of this beneficial pigment. One serving of boiled carrots provides 8.3 mg of beta-carotene, while the same portion of baked sweet potato contains at least 11.5 mg. Beta-carotene is good for you because the body converts it to vitamin A, which is essential for good vision. Additionally, the beta-carotene in sweet potatoes helps your eyes adjust in low light. Nuts are excellent foods for healthy eyes and vision because they are chock-full of nutrients like vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids and zinc. Nuts also contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant form of omega 3s. ALA can then be converted to DHA and EPA by the body, so walnuts are a great source of omegas for vegans and vegetarians or those who can’t eat fatty fish like salmon. The ALA in walnuts may be especially beneficial if you have diabetes-related eye issues. According to studies, ALA may help improve dry eye disease and retinopathy in those with diabetes. High blood sugar can negatively affect blood vessels in the eyes, so eating fiber-rich foods that help stabilize blood glucose levels can further improve eye health in people with diabetes Walnuts also contain vitamin E, an antioxidant usually found in healthy fats. The vitamin E and other polyphenols in walnuts help reduce inflammation and protect against free radical damage. Additionally, walnuts provide zinc, a mineral that’s highly concentrated in the retina. Visit FoodIsMedicine.com for more articles about grapes and other amazing superfruits.

https://food.news/2023-10-24-california-skittles-ban-prompts-ban-cancer-causing-additives.html,California “Skittles ban” prompts call to ban other CANCER-CAUSING food additives already BANNED in Europe,0,"Advertisement California has become the first state to take a major legal step in banning cancer-causing additive ingredients often used in food products. Now, health experts are encouraging the rest of the U.S. to also ban other potentially dangerous additives in different food products. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the “Skittles ban” on Oct. 7. Despite the name, the Skittles ban doesn’t ban the candy called Skittles. Instead, it bans the use of four very common food additives that have been linked to health problems like kidney, thyroid and gastrointestinal cancer, and mood disorders. These four ingredients are brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben and red dye No. 3. Some products that use these ingredients include: However, there are other ingredients that, despite their known health risks and prohibition in European countries, are still present in foods Americans eat every day. Dr. Carolyn Williams, a registered dietitian, emphasized that it’s “about time legislation was enacted to protect Americans from harmful food additives.” Williams added that it’s embarrassing that California had to [enact a ban] before the federal government because there are numerous studies about harmful ingredients and their “potential health risks.” None of the ingredients on the banned list are necessary in products but they are often cheaper, easier and faster to use in recipes. The ingredients also help manufacturers achieve more uniform products, but a natural ingredient could be used as a safer alternative. Williams hopes other states will soon follow California’s lead. She added that she also wants to see better regulation at the federal level. Williams knows that significant change will take some time because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) often takes several years to make changes. She added that there is “a lot of bureaucracy,” with the FDA often requiring “overwhelming evidence” that a certain ingredient has a specific negative impact on health. According to Williams, since various additives can have a range of effects on different people and their true adverse effects on health cannot be tested over time in humans, it is often difficult to conclusively determine what the side effects of each ingredient are. (Related: Learn how to decipher packaged food labels and avoid harmful ingredients.) Williams explained that it is not safe to give a group of human volunteers large amounts of potassium bromate to find out what happens. It is impossible to “give them a huge dose for a year and then see how many develop cancer.” For the desired changes to take effect, researchers must conduct “animal studies and longevity population studies,” which involves studying people eating certain foods for 50 years and looking at cancer rates. However, these methods do not demonstrate cause and effect. For example, animal studies usually show that if ingredients are “linked to potential cancer risk in animals,” it’s assumed that it can be potentially carcinogenic in humans. The California Skittles ban includes potassium bromate, a suspected carcinogen. Potassium bromate is already banned in Europe, China and India, but it is still being used in more than 100 products sold in the United States. It is a chemical compound typically used to strengthen dough. Potassium bromate comes in the form of white crystals or powders and is often used to make baked goods and breads. As a suspected carcinogen, potassium bromate has been shown to cause kidney, thyroid and gastrointestinal cancers in animals. Data shows that when potassium bromate breaks down in the body, it oxidizes and turns into free radicals. Studies have proven that free radicals are linked to cancer, mutation and DNA changes. Regulators in the European Union rely on the “precautionary principle,” which looks at the scientific possibility of harm, even if a risk analysis has not proven it, and enforcing measures so the ingredient is avoided. Meanwhile, the FDA relies on “overwhelming evidence.” The agency approaches risk associated with food additives differently compared to other countries. Williams said the U.S. and the EU are “working from two opposite spectrums.” While the EU and other countries are wary of potentially harmful ingredients, the U.S. is more willing to use these ingredients. The EU’s precautionary principle is more conservative than the FDA’s regulation, which is demonstrated by the fact that most of the controversial food additives common in America have already been banned in Europe. Research also shows that the levels of potentially harmful ingredients often present in food are a lot higher than the FDA threshold. Meaning, consumers “may be getting a much larger dosage.” In 2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned that there were “emerging child health concerns related to the use of colorings, flavorings and chemicals deliberately added to food during processing.” A 2022 National Institutes of Health (NIH) study also revealed that chemical food additives can cause many health problems like congenital eye and brain abnormalities.

https://food.news/2023-09-22-tips-bad-eating-habits-understanding-sugar-addiction.html,How to deal with bad eating habits: Understanding sugar addiction,0,"Advertisement Ending dinner with a piece of chocolate is a nice treat, but you may need to rethink your eating habits if you often finish off a whole chocolate by yourself. Sugar cravings can affect your overall health and may cause different complications like obesity and diabetes. Experts are still only beginning to understand the nature of sugar addiction, but studies have revealed that sugar raises dopamine levels. In a 2005 article published in the Journal of Neuroscience, scientists reported that binging daily on sugar “repeatedly releases dopamine in the accumbens shell [a section of the brain affected by dopamine].” The findings also showed that intermittent binging on sucrose or table sugar had effects similar to addictive drugs and it repeatedly increases dopamine in the brain. In another earlier study, researchers discovered that the repeated and excessive intake of sugar created a state “in which an opioid antagonist caused behavioral and neurochemical signs of opioid withdrawal.” The indices of anxiety and DA/ACh (dopamine/acetylcholine) imbalance were “qualitatively similar to withdrawal from morphine or nicotine,” suggesting that the rat subjects had become sugar-dependent. A clue to the remarkable release from sugar addiction could be explained by a 2020 study where scientists observed what happened to rats when fed a chronic high-fat diet (HFC). The diet contained 42 percent of calories as fat, mostly lard. Researchers found that the rats with chronic HFD intake were less motivated to obtain sweet palatable foods. This reduced motivation did not seem to be linked to pleasure upon tasting sweet food because the researchers did not observe any alteration in reactivity to sweet taste. Data suggested that chronic HFD causes a significant motivational impairment for sweet palatable foods and that these changes may be linked to “a decreased dopaminergic and cannabinoid neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens.” But what does it mean that the rats showed “significant motivational impairment for sweet palatable foods?” If you make changes to your eating habits, such as trying to ease your sugar addiction, you can eventually learn how to control your bad food choices. Instead of finishing a whole package of store-bought cookies, eat other foods that can regulate dopamine levels. The amino acid tyrosine, which can be found in foods like beef, chicken and cheese, is the precursor to dopamine. Try a healthy diet that contains foods rich in vitamin D, B vitamins, magnesium and omega-3 fatty acids, all of which contribute to healthy dopamine levels. Bone broth contains glycine, another dopamine precursor, so make some chicken broth on a cold night. You can also change your diet by focusing on lacto-fermented foods like sauerkraut that will help provide healthy gut flora, which then produces feel-good chemicals and a fat called arachidonic acid (AA), which is unique to animal fats. AA is the raw material out of which your body makes feel-good endocannabinoids. (Related: 6 Reasons why you’re always craving sugar, plus expert tips that can help curb sugar cravings.) To beat a sugar addiction, you can try to follow a balanced diet that gives you steady levels of dopamine throughout the day, but make sure it’s not too low that you feel listless and depressed and not too high that it makes you agitated and anxious. This is important because sugar triggers a whipsaw effect by sending dopamine levels high followed by a significant drop, like a bad dopamine roller-coaster where the highs are short-lived and the lows require another sugar fix. Charles Eisenstein, author of the book “The Yoga of Eating,” said many people are often worried about following a healthy diet because they don’t think they have the willpower to do so. While willpower can help you maintain a healthy and satisfying diet, it does not really stop sugar addiction. Eisenstein said people often use willpower to improve themselves, like making changes to their diet or bad habits. However, any effort at self-willpower is destined to fail. If you tell yourself, “I will make myself do it,” you are fighting yourself. This makes you divided, as if on some level you do not want to do it. Eventually, when your willpower is at its weakest, “your true desires will express themselves as actions,” warned Eisenstein. Instead, he advised that it’s better to focus on aligning “joyful, nurturing eating with the authentic needs of body and soul.” A healthy diet isn’t meant to make you feel like you’re being punished. Focus on nurturing eating, where you allow yourself to enjoy foods that you love but in moderation and nutritious meals until your body and brain become sufficiently nourished that you no longer crave sugar. Instead of pitting your mind against your body by following the soulless, low-fat dietary guidelines, use your mind to teach yourself eating practices that nourish the body. If you’re hungry, eat a meal that is delicious, healthy and filling. If you get a craving when you’re hungry, eating a healthy meal with protein-rich foods will help curb hunger. If your cravings are bad, try distracting yourself by going for a brisk walk. This offers two benefits: One, you distance yourself from the sugary treats you are craving. Two, the exercise will help release endorphins or “feel good” chemicals in your brain, which can also help “turn off” the cravings. If you can’t go outside, do push-ups, burpees or body-weight squats until you’re breaking a sweat. With time, your food addictions, to sugar, chocolate, coffee or alcohol, will end because your body is getting the nutrients it needs from healthier foods and beverages.

https://food.news/2023-08-18-biden-administration-launches-billion-initiative-carbon-capture.html,"Biden administration launches $1.2 billion initiative to “CAPTURE” CARBON DIOXIDE from the sky, depriving food crops of the molecule needed for photosynthesis",0,"Advertisement The administration of President Joe Biden has announced a $1.2 billion taxpayer-funded initiative to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere in an attempt to achieve a so-called “net-zero global economy” by 2050. In a statement, Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the $1.2 billion fund will be used to develop two commercial-scale “direct air capture” facilities in Texas and Louisiana. The projects are the first of this scale in the U.S. and represent the initial selections from the president’s bipartisan infrastructure law-funded Regional Direct Air Capture (DAC) Hubs program, which is focused on jumpstarting a nationwide network of large-scale carbon removal sites to deal with legacy CO2 dioxide pollution and complement rapid emissions reductions. The government claims these emissions are already in the atmosphere and are to blame for climate change and extreme weather. The emissions are also blamed for jeopardizing public health and ecosystems worldwide. The Hubs are supposed to “ensure meaningful community and labor engagement and contribute to the president’s Justice Initiative.” These projects are expected to eliminate over two million metric tons of CO2 emissions from the atmosphere annually and create 4,800 jobs in Texas and Louisiana. This will be the world’s largest investment in engineered carbon removal in history, with each Hub eventually removing more than 250 times more CO2 than the largest DAC facility currently in operation. This is despite experts highlighting the crucial role of CO2 in supporting life on Earth. Without CO2, photosynthesis will not be possible. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water and CO2 to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar. Still, both the government and mainstream media insist on the narrative that CO2 and greenhouse gases are bad for the environment. Granholm also noted that removing the CO2 already in the atmosphere is crucial to achieving a net-zero global economy. According to the Biden administration’s plan, development of the Hubs will jumpstart a new industry critical to addressing the climate crisis on a global scale and fast-track attempts to meet the government’s goal of a net-zero economy by 2050. DAC is a process that separates CO2 from the air to allegedly help reduce legacy CO2 in the atmosphere. The separated CO2 will be stored deep underground permanently or converted into useful carbon-containing products like concrete to prevent its release back into the atmosphere. The government insists that the widespread deployment of DAC and other innovative technologies that capture emissions are necessary to “fighting” the climate crisis and reinforcing America’s global competitiveness in the zero-carbon economy of the future. According to DOE estimates, achieving Biden’s ambitious plan for net-zero emissions will require at least 400 million to 1.8 billion metric tons of CO2 to be removed from the atmosphere and captured from emissions sources annually by 2050. It’s worth noting that the Biden administration’s alleged goal of a “zero-net global economy” by 2050 follows the Great Reset blueprint first put forward by the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF). (Related: Battle against carbon dioxide a ploy to TAKE AWAY FREEDOMS under the guise of “fighting climate change.”) Aside from the “carbon capture” projects, the WEF’s Great Reset plan also includes reducing coal and petrol production, eliminating private vehicle ownership, using wind and solar energy, and replacing meat consumption with insects.

https://food.news/2023-08-16-rfkjr-slams-corrupt-system-that-produces-poison-food.html,RFK Jr. slams the corrupt system that produces and sells POISON FOOD,0,"Advertisement Early in August, Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hosted an insightful roundtable discussion on farming and food with regenerative farmers who are working hard to develop an alternative farm model for the United States. The participants included Ben Dobson, Gail Fuller, Will Harris, Reginaldo Haslett-Marroquin, Kerry Hoffschneider, John Kempf, Judith McGeary, Wayne Swanson and Bob Quinn as more than 6,000 viewers watched live. The speakers discussed their visions on how to revitalize American farming with Kennedy. Kennedy started the conversation by recounting his experience litigating against Big Ag companies, and how it taught him how corporations and politicians plotted to consolidate the industry. According to Kennedy, passing legislation that protects factory farms, manipulating subsidy programs and forming crucial partnerships with industrial farmers helped greedy companies like Smithfield dominate the pork and chicken industries. In turn, these companies gradually turned the remaining family farmers into “indentured servants on their own land,” added Kennedy. Smithfield used marketing tactics on its websites and social media accounts to convince consumers that its pork products are environmentally friendly, which is greenwashing at its finest. In time, Smithfield’s low prices forced the entire industry to switch to the same model. Kennedy said his experience fighting against Big Ag inspired him to try “the other end of the spectrum” with individuals with a true desire to produce “real food and healthy food and wholesome communities” that everyone can be proud of. Kennedy then listened, took notes and asked questions while Elizabeth Kucinich, an organic food activist and filmmaker, moderated the panel. The farmers then talked about their challenges, successes and lessons from their work to help “rebuild the critical life system” of the American landscape and communities in it. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador recently banned genetically modified (GMO) corn in Mexican tortillas to help reduce GMO corn imports to Mexico from the U.S. and produce a demand for non-GMO corn. However, instead of supporting the switch to non-GMO agriculture, the Biden administration’s U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is taking Mexico to trade court, said Ben Dobson. Dobson, who is from Hudson Carbon, a non-profit on-farm soil laboratory in Hudson Valley, New York, said the agency’s self-serving move would be cutting the brakes on a market that could support U.S. farmers who want to end their dependence on GMO crops. (Related: FRANKENFOOD ALERT: Piggy Sooy GMO soybean contains 26.6% animal protein.) Bob Quinn, a Montana organic grain farmer, said enforcing different systems of compensation for farmers is important for setting up a different agricultural system. Unfortunately, the current system rewards high yields instead of the cultivation of the healthy environments that make farms prosper. Quinn explained that U.S. grain production has two goals: higher yield for farmers and higher-yield wheat needed by bakers. To address this, farmers transitioned to shorter, higher-yielding, gluten-heavy wheat treated with glyphosate. But the combination is hard for the human body to process, which often leads to allergies and other diseases. According to Quinn, the transition to organic heritage grains could help prevent those allergies. Reginaldo Haslett-Marroquin, a Guatemalan agronomist and the owner-founder of Regeneration Farms in Minnesota, said that the government institutions and corporations that control the food system are only interested in a model that has caused “a systemically and verifiable and quantifiable way of killing the planet in the name of food.” Haslett-Marroquin explained that on his farm, they discovered ways to use modern scientific advances in technology to help them “engage the natural design and the most efficient ways of working with the land.” Gail Fuller, a Kansas family farmer, spoke in detail about the policies that often hurt farmers and the land. To illustrate, crop insurance incentivizes bad management. And because tillage and pesticides are considered “best management practices,” farmers who use alternative practices are at a disadvantage. But he said that farmers aren’t always willing to switch to alternative practices because “industry writes the farm bill.” Fuller warned that one in four children in Kansas is food-insecure and the food that they have is often “low nutrient quality, highly toxic, food-like substances.” He also called for the end of the monopolies that control agriculture, the censorship of experts and researchers and ending subsidies for destructive farm practices and conservation programs that are a dead-end. Fuller added that policymakers should aim to improve food, health, water, farmer welfare and quality of life. Wayne Swanson, owner of Swanson Family Farm and consultant for small farms, explained why it’s crucial to grow localized farm economies and make small farms economically viable. He said that for the project to work, the public must be educated on how to value farming that isn’t always high-yielding or aesthetically beautiful. Instead, Swanson said that the focus must be on valuing relationships and environmental and community health. Dobson added that the farmers at the roundtable represented “food as food” and not as a commodity. He also explained that meaningful conversation about how to replace agro-industrial techniques, chemical inputs and genetically modified (GM) crops will help “rebuild the critical life system” of the U.S., adding that this is only possible if people talked about the communities, farms and the ecosystems involved, along with international relationships.

https://food.news/2023-08-09-usda-must-end-policy-on-gmo-vaccines.html,"Watchdog group: USDA must end “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy on GMO vaccines in organic livestock",0,"Advertisement OrganicEye, an agribusiness watchdog, has demanded that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) hold a public hearing on the use of mRNA and other genetically engineered vaccines in organic livestock production, or else the agency would face litigation. OrganicEye warned that the continued use of genetically modified (GM) products violates the legal definition of “organic.” The request comes after reports revealed that the USDA and some organic certifiers have done nothing while commercial livestock producers started using genetically engineered vaccines in animals producing organic-certified meat, eggs and dairy products. One significant difference between conventional and organic food is the organic label’s strict prohibition on GM farm inputs and ingredients, as detailed in the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990. Wisconsin-based OrganicEye warned that instead of enforcing this rule, the USDA has sanctioned a “don’t ask, don’t tell” protocol that was pushed by Big Ag which allows producers to administer genetically engineered vaccines to animals and still market them as “organic.” Mark Kastel, executive director of OrganicEye, said that the issue must be addressed immediately due to the imminent use of mRNA vaccines for livestock, which are currently being developed with massive funding from the government and industry. OrganicEye said that it is unacceptable for the USDA to delay dealing with this highly controversial issue. The agribusiness watchdog said the USDA’s National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) must conduct a meeting of all stakeholders – not only with industry interests who want these vaccines, but also with farmers. “These people have a right to be heard,” said Kastel. (Related: GMO MEAT? Bill Gates now spending tens of millions to genetically modify livestock.) By default, synthetic materials are banned in organics unless they have been explicitly permitted because they are considered “essential” to production and have been evaluated and determined to be safe for human health and the environment. Congress created the NOSB in the 1990s to recommend industry standards for regulating these materials. The NOSB is a powerful advisory board, and the USDA cannot allow synthetic substances in organic production unless the board specifically approves and recommends them. The NOSB was designed to represent stakeholders from all over the organics industry, including small farmers and consumers. However, the board has been misused and is now increasingly dominated by powerful agribusiness lobbyists, eventually becoming increasingly subordinate to agribusiness’ orders. Kastel said the first question that must be investigated is whether vaccines are “essential” for livestock. After all, they are usually not required in livestock production, unless there are state regulations about the interstate transportation of livestock. Despite this, many producers, especially those in industrial agriculture, continue to vaccinate their animals to “mitigate risks.” According to Kastel, a USDA hearing would allow the public to investigate if there is any reasonable justification from anybody other than those involved in conventional livestock production for the use of vaccines. Kastel also suggested that animals don’t need vaccines, particularly those cared for “in a healthy environment with plenty of outdoor access and pasture for ruminants like beef and dairy cows on family-scale farms.” Several vaccines previously approved for organic production have already been phased out and replaced with vaccines produced through genetic modification. At recent NOSB meetings, accredited organic certifiers revealed that they do not check if the vaccines used violate the prohibition against genetic engineering even though federal regulations mandate their review. In response, the NOSB recommended that the USDA approve a regulatory amendment allowing for the use of these GM vaccines in organic production in cases where the traditionally produced vaccine was not available. In a policy brief, OrganicEye criticized the move as “likely illegal” because in all cases, vaccines produced using methods of genetic engineering/modification are “forbidden by the national organic standards and are currently excluded from use.” The agency did not enact that recommendation and has stated that it won’t act in this regulatory area. Kastel said this means the USDA is saying they have no plans for new rulemaking and are only going to let things stand, insisting on a “don’t ask, don’t tell” approach to regulating GMO vaccines. In the OrganicEye policy brief, the watchdog proposed that the USDA devise a clear categorization for vaccines, review all vaccines for safety prior to approval, especially for the persistence of “foreign” DNA, RNA and antibodies in meat and develop a way to address concerns that may arise from that review, including removing such vaccines from the market if necessary.

https://food.news/2023-08-04-avocado-leaves-help-repair-injuries-major-organs.html,Study shows avocado leaves can help repair injuries in major organs,0,"Advertisement Multiple studies have shown that avocado leaves are full of beneficial nutrients. Research also suggests that avocado leaves are a promising natural therapeutic alternative for restoring damaged organs. In a recent study, researchers found that avocado leaf extracts helped repair heart, kidney and liver injuries. Details of the study were published in the International Journal of Phytomedicine and Phytotherapy. For the study, researchers turned air-dried avocado leaves into powder and mixed it with 80 percent ethanol for three days. They then freeze-dried the mixture containing the avocado leaf extract. The researchers observed 40 rats that were randomly divided into eight groups. Within two weeks, the rat groups received different treatments: The study revealed that the avocado leaf extract showed favorable competition with commercially available drugs used for treating heart, kidney and liver diseases. The researchers also reported that the avocado leaf extract presented fewer side effects compared to rifampicin, which caused significant oxidative stress on tissues in the heart and liver. The researchers believe that the effectiveness of avocado leaves could be due to disease-inhibiting phenolic compounds and flavonoids which have anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. The study suggests that avocado leaves are a potential alternative medicine for managing disorders affecting several major organs. (Related: Protect your skin from the inside out by eating nutritious superfoods.) In another study, researchers discovered that avocado leaves can help treat lead poisoning in the brain and support tissue regeneration in the cerebellum. Researchers observed animal subjects and found that after exposure to lead acetate, albino rats exhibited signs of aggression, inflammation and irritability. However, their healing process improved significantly after the rats were given the avocado leaf extract. The topical application of the extract to wounds helped speed up recovery, resulting in complete healing after six days. The avocado leaf extract also helped protect against lead acetate toxicity in the cerebellum. Using microscopic examination of tissue samples, the researchers found that lead acetate caused considerable changes to the structure of the cerebellum, but the avocado leaf extract helped damaged tissues regenerate. A recent study reported that avocado leaves may also have therapeutic potential against Type 2 diabetes. Researchers found that avocado leaves promoted the regeneration of pancreatic cells and suppressed enzyme activity during carbohydrate metabolism, which are anti-diabetic characteristics. Avocado leaves contain significantly more disease-inhibiting phenolic compounds than avocado fruit, making them a valuable option for managing diabetes naturally. Avocado has 145.7 milligrams gallic acid equivalents of phenolic compounds per gram (mg GAE/g), while avocado leaves contain 178.95 mg GAE/g. A separate study also found that avocado leaves can help reduce high blood pressure. Researchers reported that this could be due to the presence of the flavonoid quercetin, which is also a powerful natural antioxidant. If you have both diabetes and high blood pressure, you face as much as four times the risk of developing heart disease compared to someone without either health problem. Several studies in hypertensive rats have shown that quercetin has a diuretic effect and increases urine volume, which helps reduce blood pressure. Experts recommend drinking tea made from organic avocado leaves to enjoy their health benefits. To make avocado tea, boil the leaves and steep them in water. You can add natural sweeteners and spices of your choice before drinking. You can also purchase organic avocado tea from farmers’ markets.

https://food.news/2023-08-04-niacin-prevent-covid-reduce-heart-disease-risk.html,"Niacin found to help prevent COVID, reduce heart disease risk and support overall health and well-being",0,"Advertisement Studies have shown that niacin, a relatively unknown vitamin, offers many health benefits. In the second edition of the book “Niacin: The Real Story,” Dr. Andrew Saul wrote that orthomolecular physicians have discovered that the vitamin can help prevent heart disease and reverse arthritis. Niacin was also found to protect against Alzheimer’s disease and address mental illnesses. Dr. Saul is one of the principal authors of the book and the late Dr. Abram Hoffer, a psychiatrist who treated many patients with niacin, is credited as the lead author. In a 2020 study published in the journal Kidney360, researchers found that niacin (vitamin B3) could help reduce mortality in Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) patients suffering from acute kidney injury. Patients who received daily doses of 1,000 milligrams of niacinamide, a form of niacin, had a 25 percent lower death rate than patients who did not. To date, this COVID-related illness has no known cure. Doctors in India also reported that niacinamide supplements can reduce the recovery time of COVID-19 patients by as much as 30 percent compared to those receiving only standard care. This makes niacinamide an effective supportive treatment and preventive measure against COVID infection. Dr. Todd Penberthy, the author of the chapter on COVID-19 in the niacin book, has been researching niacin and its beneficial properties for 23 years. He believes that niacin can help reverse chronic kidney disease based on studies. The human body converts niacin to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NAD is a coenzyme found in every living cell and works with enzymes to facilitate chemical reactions that help produce energy. Viral diseases like COVID-19 trigger an immune response that depletes NAD in infected cells. Without NAD, cells will die in 30 seconds. Penberthy said people can boost their NAD levels by taking high doses of niacin. Because NAD is required for more than 400 gene functions, the vitamin’s effects can help change the course of today’s most prevalent diseases. If you have diabetes or heart disease, niacin could be an important supplement to take, said Penberthy. Niacin has been studied for more than 50 years and many clinical trials have shown its usefulness in preventing heart disease, the number one cause of death in people with diabetes. Niacin can also help boost your insulin sensitivity. (Related: 4 Reasons to take Vitamin B3 every day.) Because niacin has an incredible safety record, Penberthy isn’t worried about side effects. According to Penberthy, vitamin B3 is “unparalleled in its ability to safely reduce cardiovascular disease risk.” In 2006, Mary MacIsaac from Saskatchewan, Canada, died at the age of 112. MacIsaac was the second oldest Canadian resident at the time. According to reports, she skied cross-country and rode horses until she was 110. She was sprightly and even played the piano up until her death. MacIsaac had a clear mind until she died and attributed her longevity to niacin, which she took for her final 40 years. While many studies have proven that a balanced diet and vitamins promote health, the role of vitamin B3 in promoting longevity isn’t as well-known or accepted. Niacin can inhibit the formation of plaque in the arteries, protecting the heart and brain. Advocates of niacin believe that it has the best record for lowering cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein (a). Niacin can also help elevate blood levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the “good” cholesterol. Additionally, niacin has anti-aging properties that work at the cellular level. Because many deaths are the result of damage to neurons and blood vessels, the preventive effects of niacin qualify it as an anti-aging nutrient. An epidemic of pellagra, a health issue characterized by dementia, dermatitis, diarrhea and death, ravaged the U.S. in the 1930s and early 40s. Research revealed that vitamin B3 deficiency was the root cause of it. There were about three million cases of pellagra, with about 100,000 reported deaths. This disease was more frequent among impoverished Southerners, who died at a higher rate than residents of any other region. After the federal government mandated adding vitamin B3 to flour, the pellagra epidemic ended. In the early 1950s, Hoffer discovered that the psychosis linked to mental illnesses such as schizophrenia was similar to the psychosis diagnosed in pellagra patients. He then conducted a series of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies on non-chronic patients. The results of Hoffer’s studies showed that administering niacin doubled the recovery rate of patients compared to those who were given placebos. You can support your overall health and well-being by taking niacin supplements and eating foods rich in niacin like chicken breast, liver, salmon, tuna and turkey.

https://food.news/2023-08-03-radioactive-fish-discovered-near-fukushima-dump-wastewater.html,RADIOACTIVE fish discovered near Fukushima renews concerns over plans to dump nuclear wastewater into the ocean,0,"Advertisement Japanese plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) studied a black rockfish in May and found that it contained levels of radioactive cesium that were 180 times over Japan’s regulatory limit. The radioactive fish was caught near drainage outlets at the TEPCO plant, where three nuclear reactors melted down amidst a tsunami in March 2011. Rainwater from areas near the reactors flows into the area where the fish was caught. The alarming discovery reignited concerns over TEPCO’s plans to start releasing 1.3 million tons of treated wastewater from the former Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant by August. A report from July 23 showed that the problem is still unaddressed, prompting questions about how dangerous the company’s plans are for the public. Radioactive cesium has been detected in surface water and different kinds of food, such as breast milk and pasteurized milk. The amount of radioactive cesium in food and milk depends on several factors. The most important factor is whether or not there has been a recent fallout from a nuclear explosion, like a weapons test or an accident at a nuclear power plant. Depending on one’s level of exposure, cesium can cause diarrhea, bleeding, nausea, vomiting, coma and death. TEPCO wastewater has been mixed with rainwater and groundwater since the tsunami. The company admitted that fish near the drainage outlets are unsafe for consumption because the concentration of cesium in seabed sediment in the area has measured more than 100,000 becquerels per kilogram (Bq/kg). The maximum legal level is only 100 Bq/kg. A TEPCO official explained that the company has regularly removed fish from inside the port since 2012 because contaminated water flowed into the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station port immediately after the accident. In January 2022, a fish caught near Fukushima was found to have high levels of radiation. Authorities said that the fish had escaped from the drainage outlet. Following the report, shipments of black rockfish caught off the coast of Fukushima prefecture were immediately suspended. As of writing, they have not been resumed. More than 40 fish with cesium levels over the legal limit were caught in TEPCO’s port between May 2022 and May 2023. At least 90 percent of the fish were from the inner breakwater, where water flows from the area surrounding the melted TEPCO reactors. The Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) in Japan and the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have both approved TEPCO’s plan to release wastewater into the Pacific Ocean. The company claims the move is necessary to “secure space for decommissioning the plant.” (Related: Japan gets green light to release Fukushima radioactive water into Pacific Ocean.) However, the process would take decades to complete using an Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS). Earlier in July, the IAEA said the plan would have a “negligible radiological impact” on people and the environment. Paul Dorfman from Ireland’s Radiological Protection Advisory Committee warned that reports like the one about the contaminated rockfish are likely far from over. Companies believing and pretending certain things are not harmful because it is convenient is “literally killing the planet,” said Celine-Marie Pascale, an American University sociologist. She added that most of the time, corporate interests “triumph at global expense.” Meanwhile, officials in Hong Kong have declared that they will ban food imports from 10 prefectures in Japan if the release moves forward in August. Some Chinese wholesalers have already stopped accepting seafood imports from Japan. Aside from concerns about cesium, TEPCO has admitted that ALPS, which it plans to use, may not be enough to eliminate isotopes such as cobalt, plutonium, ruthenium and strontium. The system is also unable to remove tritium, the radioactive isotope of hydrogen. In June, Masanobu Sakamoto, president of JF Zengyoren, Japan Fisheries Cooperatives, said the group does not support the Japanese government’s stance that “an ocean release is the only solution.” Watch the video below for the IEAA’s report on the allegedly safe Fukushima water release.

https://food.news/2023-07-20-piggy-sooy-gmo-soybean-contains-animal-protein.html,FRANKENFOOD ALERT: Piggy Sooy GMO soybean contains 26.6% animal protein,0,"Advertisement Companies are growing bolder as they continue to sell various GMO products to unwitting consumers. One such company is Moolec, which produces Piggy Sooy – a soybean genetically engineered to contain pig protein. Moolec, the U.K.-based company that developed this Frankenfood, said that it spliced pig genes into conventional soya to create a soybean with 26.6 percent animal protein. The exact pig genes used in Piggy Sooy are a trade secret. Because of genetic engineering, the interior flesh of the soybean is a rosy flesh color. That’s not all. Moolec is also working on a pea plant that produces beef protein. The company claimed that these transgenic hybrids will have a similar taste, texture and nutritional value as meat, but without the high cost of cultured or lab-grown meat alternatives. According to Moolec, farmers apply conventional agricultural practices to grow the plants used to make Piggy Sooy. After the beans are harvested and processed using conventional techniques, their proteins will be used to make meat substitutes and other products. Moolec added that the commercial adoption of Piggy Sooy could help eliminate the raising and slaughtering of pigs, along with the associated ethical and environmental concerns. Amit Dhingra, Moolec’s chief science officer, said the company has worked on a “unique, successful and patentable platform for the expression of highly valuable proteins in the seeds of economically important crops such as soybeans.” Dhingra added that Moolec’s achievement can help pave the way for the entire scientific community as it explores more ways to “achieve high levels of protein expression in seeds via molecular farming.” The company noted that there is still no exact date on when Piggy Sooya may be available to consumers. (Related: FRANKENFOOD ALERT: Brazil approves planting of genetically modified wheat.) In June, scientists found that CRISPR/Cas gene editing causes significant changes in the plant genome. Researchers observed “chromothripsis-like” effects after the application of CRISPR/Cas gene editing in the genome of tomatoes. Chromothripsis is a phenomenon wherein several hundred genetic changes may occur simultaneously in a catastrophic event. The phenomenon can result in many sections of the genetic material getting swapped, recombined or lost. The researchers also warned that this catastrophic cascade of gene swaps, recombination and loss occurs in mammalian and human cells because of gene editing. This is the first time that scientists have found proof that chromothripsis also occurs in gene-edited plants, and unintended genetic alterations occur more frequently than first suspected as they also occur across large parts of the genome. Data also found that gene-edited (GE) plants are not safe. When both strands of DNA are cut, like in the case with CRISPR/Cas, the ends of the chromosomes can lose contact with each other. When the repair of the break in the chromosomes fails, the severed ends can be lost, restructured or incorporated elsewhere. Chromothripsis seems relatively rare in plants. CRISPR/Cas applications can also cause changes at genomic sites that are rather well-protected by natural repair mechanisms. Because the risks cannot generally be estimated, scientists must investigate them thoroughly in every case. The recent findings can help researchers learn more about the alleged “precision” of gene scissors. While new technology can be used to target and cut precise locations in the genome, the consequences of “cutting” the genome are, in some ways, still unpredictable and uncontrollable. This means plants obtained from new genetic engineering (New GE) cannot be regarded as safe per se, and they may need to be thoroughly investigated for risks. Without exact genomic analyses, chromothripsis can be overlooked. For example, it is likely that it also occurred in plants obtained from New GE that were already deregulated in the country, warned experts. To date, the U.S. has no specific regulations for gene-edited plants. Additionally, the same regulations that apply to conventional crops apply to GMOs. In May, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule on “Pesticides and Exemptions of Certain Plant-Incorporated Protectants (PIPs) Derived from Newer Technologies,” which now requires GMO developers to submit data that proves plants that were gene-edited to resist pests are harmless to other components of the ecosystem; don’t contain pesticide levels beyond those found in conventional crops; and won’t cause adverse side effects in consumers.

https://food.news/2023-07-13-report-humans-not-allowed-meat-dairy-2030.html,2019 REPORT: Humans will no longer be allowed to eat meat or dairy by 2030 in order to reduce “consumption-based emissions”,0,"Advertisement A restrictive 2019 report, which resurfaced recently, revealed that consumers will no longer be allowed to eat meat or dairy products freely by 2030. The report also claimed that people should be limited to only three items of new clothing per year and one airplane flight every three years. These “suggestions” will start in countries that “consume the most” to help reduce “the impact of urban consumption.” The report, titled “The Future of Urban Consumption in a 1.5°C World” was published in 2019 and sets out targets for cities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement ambitions. The report allegedly aims to quantify and suggest ways for city leaders to reduce consumption-based emissions. This translates to enforcing measures that include reducing the things people consume, like food, clothing and travel. (Related: NO ENERGY FOR YOU! SF Bay Area to phase out heating appliances powered by natural gas.) According to the report, the measures will be effective if they are first enforced among those who consume the most. The report also warned that “consumption-based emissions” need to be reduced by at least 50 percent by 2030. The report details six sectors where the world’s cities can take rapid action to address consumption-based emissions: The 2019 report was co-created and co-delivered by C40, Arup and the University of Leeds, with funding from Arup, Citi Foundation and the University of Leeds. The report claims to be an analysis and not a plan, but the tone of the report reads like a plan. C40 is a global network of mayors representing the world’s leading cities that are working together to address the “climate crisis.” The network includes almost 100 cities, along with 1,143 cities and local governments that have joined C40’s “Cities Race to Zero” campaign. The cities that sign up for the campaign commit to keeping global heating below the 1.5 C goal of the Paris Agreement. Without reading the reports and recommendations addressed to the “Cities Race to Zero” signatories, it’s hard to determine if the actions set out in the report are specifically included in the action plan. If they are, both the 100 C40 Cities and 1,000 additional cities are committing to the report’s reductions in consumer-based emissions. It stands to reason that Arup’s network is committed to doing the same. Arup is a global network of “experts” that claim to shape cities “in a thousand ways.” The network has over 17,000 members and offices in 46 of the 97 cities that make up C40’s global network. C40 and Arup have been collaborating since 2009. They have worked together on dystopian publications such as Deadline 2020, Green and Thriving Neighborhoods and a guide for creating net-zero neighborhoods. But there’s a chance that collaborations have pushed through with money changing hands. The first C40/Arup report, titled “Powering Climate Action: Cities as Global Changemakers,” was published in 2015. In the same year Arup, committed to investing $1 million over three years in a research partnership with C40. In 2019, the year the C40/Arup consumer-based emissions report “The Future of Urban Consumption in a 1.5°C World” was published, Arup tripled its advisory support to C40 to $3 million over three years. In 2023, Arup continued its investment in C40 with up to $300,000 a year to allegedly help C40 drive resilience and decarbonization in cities around the world. In March, C40 Cities re-highlighted the 2019 C40/Arup consumer-based emissions report in an article titled “A spotlight on consumption-based emissions.” C40 claimed that since the 2019 report was published, cities across the globe have started to map consumption-based emissions and studied ways to reduce them. Starting on page 66, the report summarizes what they hope to impose on consumers. These plans are being made and agreed upon outside the democratic process and under false pretenses. Some of the changes the report is pushing for include: The acknowledgment section at the beginning of the report shows that it was written by people from the following groups and universities: On paper, these measures seem beneficial, but in practice they are draconian. C40 and Arup’s activities must be halted immediately and their operations shut down permanently. Visit GreenTyranny.news to learn more tyrannical “green” measures.

https://food.news/2023-07-12-12-prepping-skills-to-teach-next-generation.html,A self-sufficient legacy: 12 Useful prepping skills to teach the next generation,0,"Advertisement The prepping lifestyle requires hard work and discipline. If you have children, you can help them prepare before SHTF by starting them young and teaching them useful skills like gardening and cooking. Instead of just letting them waste time on their smartphones and computers, teaching children useful skills can help them grow up into self-sufficient adults. As a prepper, think about your life and list the practical prepping and survival skills you’ve learned as you got older. (h/t to TheEpochTimes.com) These useful prepping skills can help your children become independent preppers before SHTF: If you have experience caring for livestock, you can share your knowledge with your children or grandchildren. Children are naturally drawn to animals, and learning how to care for other living creatures like chickens, ducks, goats or even honeybees can help teach them a sense of responsibility and compassion. Teaching kids how to care for different kinds of animals can also help them understand the importance of meeting the needs of another creature and sensitivity toward its needs. If children at home are old enough, you can also teach them simple recipes so they can start cooking and baking. This useful life skill isn’t just good for an emergency scenario, it can help them as they get older because cooking meals at home is one way to save money on food and dining out. Teach them some of your favorite recipes so they can cook these special dishes for their own families even after you are gone. Before SHTF, it can help to teach children and grandchildren basic cooking and baking skills like how to cook from scratch and bake a loaf of bread. Not sure how to start? Here are some tips on how to teach kids of different ages how to cook and bake: Children under three years old Kids this age can be tricky because they’re still very young, but you can start fostering an appreciation of food and cooking by letting them help with simple tasks, like washing produce. If your child wants to help, let them wash the fruits and vegetables. Have some clean towels ready, and let them try a salad spinner. Kids aged three to five Kids in this age bracket can start learning some simple knife skills. Make sure to keep things safe in the kitchen by giving them a dull knife. A three-year-old can practice their knife skills by cutting soft foods like cucumbers or strawberries with a butter knife or a plastic knife. Teach them how to hold a knife: By the handle only, and not touching the blade. Make sure they also know how to pass a knife from one person to another safely: Point the handle toward the person you’re passing it to, with the blade pointing away from them. Kids aged six to eight Kids in this age group can start with some actual cooking skills. First, teach them the basics of using a stove, but always with your supervision. Let them practice turning the stove off and on. Teach them how to cook scrambled eggs and other simple “recipes,” like sandwiches and salads. Have a pot holder or dry dish towel ready in case you need to touch hot pan handles. Kids aged eight to 10 Kids eight and older may be ready to handle a sharp knife, with supervision. Keep in mind that you are the best judge of your child’s readiness to handle sharp kitchen tools. You can teach kids how to bread food, like veggies or chicken tenders in flour. Use this time to teach them how to fry food. If they want to help with meal planning, let them. Gardening takes time, patience and knowledge gained through the years of working in your garden. Teaching kids how to care for a garden ensures that they also spend more time outdoors, under warm sunshine as they enjoy the fresh air. You can also help them plant, grow and harvest their favorite vegetables. You can avoid big messes by starting small. For example, you can teach younger children to plant and grow beans in cups placed near sunny windows. If the children are older, you can help them grow a tomato plant in a pot on the patio. Choose high-interest plants like cherry tomatoes, which are a tasty snack, or pumpkins, which you can carve by Halloween. Not everyone is skilled in handicrafts like crocheting, embroidery, knitting or sewing, and these skills are some of the most useful ones you can teach young children. As a bonus, these skills produce practical and beautiful results, and they also help improve hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. Other fun and useful crafts to try include herbal remedies, soap-making and woodworking. Basic home repairs like painting a room or fixing a clogged sink or toilet aren’t taught in school, but these skills will be very helpful for young children. Before you start, make a list of everything you know how to repair, typical home improvement projects and car maintenance. Choose something that will interest your child, such as painting a room or repairing a bicycle, and ask them to help you. (Related: Basic survival and prepping skills that your kids should learn ASAP.) Teaching kids about the beauty of nature can also help them appreciate nature exploration activities like bird watching, nature walks and tree identification. As you explore nature with your family, you can also try fun, educational activities like learning the difference between a squirrel and a chipmunk. These activities will help entertain your kids and teach them observation skills that are important for preppers. Enjoying the beauty of nature and disconnecting from technology can help foster creativity and curiosity in your children. Exciting outdoor activities like camping, fishing, hiking and cooking over a campfire are great for children who love exploring nature. Take some time off during weekends and teach your children how to forage for wild edibles while you are camping. With parental supervision, you can also teach them how to cook simple meals over a campfire, with adult supervision to keep them safe. Power tools are convenient, but if you want to help your children prepare before SHTF, it’s better to teach them how to use simple hand tools. Knowing how to handle tools like a hammer or a screwdriver is an important skill, especially if you want them to be more independent. Children may struggle with hand tools at first, but teach them patiently so they can learn how much pressure and leverage to use with different tools. With enough practice, you can even help them with simple projects like a birdhouse or a small wooden stool for their playhouse. Every child comes from a family with a rich heritage of multiple cultures, but not all of them learn about these traditions. Share important traditions and stories and help pass them along to young children just as they were passed down to you by your parents and grandparents. Sharing family roots, language, customs and holidays can help preserve them with the next generation. This might seem obvious, but not everyone knows about basic good manners and etiquette. Teach kids about the importance of having good table manners, and tell them to always say please and thank you. Good manners never go out of style. These skills are subtle, but they make a lasting impression in social settings, at school or the office. Passing on your musical skills can help children develop a passion for music. Teach them how to play an instrument you are familiar with, or help them learn an instrument that they are interested in. You can also share your favorite albums and genres with them, like jazz or classical music. Music lessons can be expensive for some families, but lessons taught by a close friend or family member can help teach kids musical skills and help reinforce relationships. When SHTF, you can entertain each other by telling stories. Older people know many stories from their childhood, and these stories are too valuable to lose. Share them with children of all ages, until one day they are old enough to tell them to their children. If possible, make a book of these stories shared among your family and illustrate them with your kids. As a prepper, it’s easy to dismiss the value of your skills and experience, but sharing them with the next generation can help enrich their lives and prepare them for future emergency scenarios.

https://food.news/2023-07-10-coffee-natural-remedies-that-help-with-hangover.html,Coffee and other natural remedies that can help you recover from a hangover,0,"Advertisement When you drink alcoholic beverages, your liver breaks down the alcohol into acetaldehyde, a toxic compound that can cause headaches, nausea and other unpleasant symptoms. After a night of drinking too much alcohol, your body will try to eliminate the acetaldehyde by making you take numerous trips to the restroom. Here are some of the symptoms of a hangover: Fortunately, there’s something readily available that can help you recover from a hangover: coffee. But there’s more to it that you need to know. Coffee is a popular hangover remedy because it contains caffeine, a stimulant that can help with some hangover symptoms. If you need a remedy for hangover fatigue, drink a cup of coffee so you can become more alert. Since caffeine is a natural diuretic, drinking coffee can make you urinate more. This can help your body eliminate toxic substances. Coffee can also help relieve headaches by constricting blood vessels in the brain. (Related: Study: Consuming walnuts found to reduce the negative effects of stress.) There are some downsides to drinking coffee when you’re already hungover. Caffeine is a stimulant, so if you’re already dehydrated after drinking, it might make your dehydration worse. Drinking coffee can make your hangover worse. It can also cause anxiety, jitters and heart palpitations in some people. It depends. If you’re only experiencing mild hangover symptoms and you’re not too dehydrated, you can drink one cup of coffee to boost your energy levels in the morning and relieve some of your symptoms. But if you’re already dehydrated, avoid coffee and try the other remedies listed below. Here are some hangover remedies that can help with your symptoms: Drink water Alcohol is a diuretic and can cause dehydration. Drinking water can help rehydrate your body and reduce the severity of a hangover. Drink herbal tea Soothing herbal teas like chamomile or peppermint can help soothe an upset stomach and promote relaxation. Replenish electrolytes Drinking sports drinks or fresh coconut water can help replenish electrolytes lost during alcohol consumption. Eat watermelon Since headache associated with a hangover is usually due to dehydration and decreased blood flow to the brain, eating watermelon may help relieve your symptoms. Watermelon is rich in L-citrulline, a nutrient that may increase blood flow. It is also a delicious and hydrating fruit with a high water content. Consume ginger Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can help relieve nausea and vomiting associated with a hangover. Try drinking ginger tea or adding fresh ginger to your food. Eat a healthy breakfast Eating a healthy breakfast can help regulate blood sugar levels and provide nutrients to your body. Alcohol blocks the production of a hormone that helps your body hold on to water, which can cause dehydration and the loss of electrolytes like potassium and sodium. Bananas are full of potassium and can help replenish your body’s stores. One medium banana contains nine percent of the daily value (DV) for potassium. Get some rest If drinking more water and tea doesn’t help, try to get some rest and sleep until you feel better. With some rest, your body can eventually recover from a hangover. If you don’t like getting hangovers, the best way to prevent them is to drink responsibly. Limit your alcohol intake and drink enough water throughout the night. If you find yourself with a hangover the next morning, a cup of coffee might give you some temporary relief. Remember that moderation is key when it comes to alcohol and caffeine.

https://food.news/2023-06-29-fda-arsenic-limit-apple-juice-too-high.html,Consumer Reports: FDA’s arsenic limit in apple juice is TOO HIGH and may pose a risk to children’s health,0,"Advertisement Apple juice seems like a healthy alternative to sugary drinks like soda. However, data suggests this beverage may actually pose a risk to children’s health. Consumer Reports, a consumer advocacy organization, recently criticized the Food and Drug Administration‘s (FDA) final guidance on the limit for inorganic arsenic in apple juice due to concerns about possible health risks to children. The FDA issued the final guidance on June 1, setting the action level for inorganic arsenic in apple juice at 10 parts per billion (ppb), a level that was first proposed back in 2013. The FDA’s testing revealed a decrease in inorganic arsenic levels, with many samples showing levels below 3 ppb and 5 ppb. But some apple juice samples still had levels of 10 ppb, leading to the establishment of the limit at that level. Consumer Reports challenged the FDA’s belief that 10 ppb can be considered a safe level achievable through good manufacturing practices. The organization warned that the importance of lower limits on inorganic arsenic can help protect public health, especially for foods consumed by children. Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, said “the action level should be lower than 10 ppb based on current science.” Ronholm also explained that because the majority of the industry had already met this level, the FDA’s action is “virtually irrelevant.” Despite his concerns, Ronholm thinks the FDA’s recent ruling is encouraging because it points to a renewed focus on solving the issue of food chemicals and heavy metals. He hopes that the agency will continue to focus on and monitor these issues, taking action as needed if there are “troubling levels of inorganic arsenic in apple juice.” Consumer Reports suggested that the FDA should instead recommend a lower level of 3 ppb. (Related: Michelle Obama’s juice brand fails health standards set by her husband’s administration.) The nonprofit organization conducted its own testing in 2018, and results revealed that there were elevated levels of cadmium, inorganic arsenic and lead in 21 out of the 45 tested fruit juices. But the majority of the tested juices had inorganic arsenic levels below the FDA’s limit, suggesting that with stricter measures manufacturers can still reduce the content in their products. Consumer Reports added that its own tests have confirmed that it is both feasible and necessary to establish lower limits on inorganic arsenic in apple juice to protect public health. The organization thinks that stricter regulations are necessary to effectively ensure the safety of consumers. Some foods contain arsenic because it is often present in the environment where food is produced and processed. Arsenic can occur naturally or result from human activities like the use of pesticides containing arsenic, or pollution from mining, fracking and coal-fired power plants. Studies have found that exposure to inorganic arsenic may be linked to several health issues in humans, such as cancer, diabetes, negative impacts on birth outcomes and cardiovascular and neuro-developmental problems. The FDA admits that it is currently not feasible to completely eliminate arsenic from the environment or food supply. But to address the problem, the agency sets action levels to inform the industry about contamination levels that exceed safety thresholds and could render certain foods unsafe for public consumption. These action levels serve as guidelines to protect public health from situations where it is impossible to completely eliminate arsenic in products. According to the FDA’s report, an extensive study spanning almost 10 years has shown that the average level of arsenic in apple juice was 4.6 ppb. Shockingly, some samples exhibited significantly higher levels, reaching up to 44 ppb. The presence of arsenic in apple juice is alarming because it is a product often marketed to and consumed by children, who consume a larger quantity of the liquid relative to their body weight compared to adults. The FDA also referenced data suggesting a potential link between exposure to arsenic and negative effects on the neurological development of infants and children. The FDA said it will continue to monitor the arsenic levels in apple juice samples. If any testing reveals levels above 10 ppb in certain products, the FDA may take enforcement action to resolve and address the issue. With further action from groups like Consumer Reports, it is possible to reduce the current limit on arsenic. After all, the majority of the juices tested have inorganic arsenic levels below the FDA’s 10 ppb limit. Watch the video below to know more about the health benefits of organic apple peel powder.

https://food.news/2023-06-16-protect-skin-by-eating-nutritious-superfoods.html,Protect your skin from the inside out by eating nutritious superfoods,0,"Advertisement Spending some time under the sun is good for you, but there may be people who avoid sunbathing or walking to the park on a sunny day due to fears of increasing their skin cancer risk. If you’re one of those worried about overexposure or skin cancer, you can eat superfoods that can help support healthy skin, such as berries and nuts. In addition to using natural and organic sunscreen, these dietary choices can help boost your natural defense against harmful sun exposure. Consuming the right foods will also help protect your skin against the sun’s ultraviolet rays, in a way protecting your body from the inside out. Studies have shed light on the protective role of antioxidants, including vitamins and various nutrients, in the battle against harmful free radicals, which are often linked to skin cancer. Because of these recent findings, many dermatologists are encouraging their patients to incorporate nutrient-rich foods into their diet to promote better skin health. The foods listed below are a natural source of essential antioxidants and offer a synergistic blend of nutrients that work together to maximize their effectiveness. Avocados are chock-full of healthy fats. These “good” fats have a role in many bodily functions, including the health of your skin. Getting enough of these healthy fats can help your skin be flexible and moisturized. In one study involving over 700 women, scientists reported that a high intake of total fat — specifically the types of healthy fats found in avocados — was linked to more supple, springy skin. Preliminary evidence also suggests that avocados contain compounds that may help protect skin from sun damage. UV damage to your skin can cause wrinkles and other signs of aging. Avocados are also rich in vitamin E, which is an important antioxidant that helps protect skin from oxidative damage. However, most Americans don’t get enough vitamin E in their diet. Research has revealed that vitamin E seems to be more effective when combined with vitamin C. Vitamin C is also essential for healthy skin. Your skin needs vitamin C to create collagen, the main structural protein that keeps skin strong and healthy. Vitamin C deficiency is rare in modern times, but common symptoms may include dry, rough and scaly skin that tends to bruise easily. Vitamin C also functions as an antioxidant that helps protect your skin from oxidative damage caused by the sun and the environment, which can cause signs of aging. A 100-gram serving (about 1/2 of an avocado) provides 14 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin E and 11 percent of the DV for vitamin C. Berries, which are full of ellagic acid, are a tasty and nutritious way to naturally boost sun protection. Ellagic acid, derived from ellagitannin, is a compound found in different red fruits. Out of these fruits, raspberries have been identified as particularly potent in the fight against skin cancer, making them a great addition to your sun protection diet. Carotenoids are the pigments that make fruits and vegetables yellow, red and orange, and they help protect your skin against damage from the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. Some fruits and vegetables with carotenoids include cantaloupe, carrots, kale, spinach and tomatoes. Curcumin is the plant pigment that makes turmeric yellow and it is known for its ability to destroy dangerous melanoma skin cancer cells. Curcumin also fights the formation and spread of cancer by acting as a potent antioxidant that prevents the formation of aflatoxin and nitrosamine processes that increase cancer risk. (Related: Boost your skin health with astaxanthin, a potent natural antioxidant.) Use turmeric while cooking to add a flavorful twist to carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, rice and other vegetables. Not all fats are bad for you and fatty fish, like herring, mackerel and salmon, are foods you should eat more of if you want healthy skin. Fish like salmon are full of omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for maintaining skin health. Omega-3s help keep the skin thick, supple and moisturized. You need omega-3s because an omega-3 fatty acid deficiency can cause dry skin. The omega-3 fats in fish help reduce inflammation, which can cause redness and acne. Omega-3s also help make skin less sensitive to the sun’s harmful UV rays. Research suggests that taking fish oil supplements may help fight inflammatory and autoimmune conditions affecting the skin, such as lupus and psoriasis. Fatty fish also contains vitamin E, one of the most important antioxidants for healthy skin. Getting enough vitamin E can help protect your skin against damage from free radicals and inflammation. Seafood like fatty fish is a source of high-quality protein, which you need to maintain the strength and integrity of your skin. Additionally, fatty fish contains zinc, a mineral that helps regulate inflammation, overall skin health and the production of new skin cells. Zinc deficiency can cause lesions, skin inflammation and delayed wound healing. Mushrooms are a great source of beta-glucans that also contain compounds that can help actively fight the development of melanoma. Beta-glucans from mushrooms can attract immune cells to the cancerous area, aiding in the destruction of malignant cells and potentially acting as a valuable defense against melanoma. Crunchy and savory nuts like pecans and walnuts contain ellagitannin, which detoxifies harmful liver enzymes and stops carcinogens from clinging to DNA. This acid also makes cancer cells destruct and gets rid of harmful free radicals that cause skin cancer. Eating selenium-rich foods like Brazil nuts, cod, halibut and mushrooms can boost your body’s antioxidant defense system, which gives you an additional layer of protection against the damaging effects of sun exposure. By adding these selenium-rich superfoods into your diet, you can fortify your body’s natural defense mechanisms, bolstering its ability to protect you from the harmful effects of the sun’s rays. Eating a combination of nutritious carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables and foods containing vitamin E can help counteract and mitigate the effects of the sun’s ultraviolet light on your skin. This powerful combination of superfoods works synergistically to provide enhanced protection and nourishment, helping to maintain the health and vitality of your skin even with sun exposure. Here are also some of the things you to avoid for healthy skin: Studies have found that chlorophyll in plants and plant-based foods can effectively reduce the risk of aflatoxin contamination. Aflatoxins are harmful substances that can damage DNA, consequently increasing your risk of developing skin cancer. Note that peanuts are particularly susceptible to aflatoxin contamination. Follow a nutritious diet full of chlorophyll-containing foods to help minimize your exposure to aflatoxins. Regular alcohol intake has been linked to an increased risk of malignant melanoma. Experts think this could be linked to the conversion of alcohol into acetaldehyde within the body. This process can result in DNA damage, increasing the likelihood of developing skin cancer. Nitrates, which are compounds present in soil, water and air, are commonly used as additives in cured meat products for their visual appeal. However, mounting scientific data suggests that there may be an alarming link between nitrates and cancer risk. Make healthy choices in your diet and lifestyle. Eat sun-protective foods, avoid drinking too much alcohol and reduce your intake of nitrates in cured meats to boost your skin health and reduce the risk of skin cancer.

https://food.news/2023-06-12-support-brain-health-lutein-brain-boosting-carotenoid.html,"Support brain health with lutein, a brain-boosting carotenoid",0,"Advertisement According to a study published in the journal Molecules, the carotenoid lutein can help boost brain health. Lutein, a natural plant pigment responsible for the yellow, orange and red colors of various fruits and vegetables, has been found to support healthy cognitive function and help prevent cognitive decline. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in every nine Americans older than 45 is affected by cognitive decline. This age-related condition is characterized by gradual impairments in a person’s ability to learn, reason, focus and remember. Cognitive decline can also manifest as an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease. The Molecules study highlights the potential of lutein to address that issue. For the review, the researchers analyzed different randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving volunteers who received either dietary or supplementary lutein. Next, the research team assessed the effect of lutein in three areas: The researchers discovered that lutein supplementation caused “modest improvements” in all three areas. They also cited several studies that found “significant improvements” in executive function. Although most improvements overall were slight, the researchers highlighted one significant finding: The groups given a placebo did not see improvements in their cognitive abilities. Instead, they experienced a substantial decline during the study. This points to the benefits of lutein for the brain – especially for older adults. The researchers highlighted several mechanisms that could explain the health-promoting effects of lutein. Specifically, they found that lutein has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which allow the carotenoid to reduce oxidative stress and activate anti-inflammatory pathways. Data also showed that lutein helped increase blood flow to the brain while enhancing neural response. (Related: Choline: An essential nutrient for brain and heart health.) The promising research findings suggest that lutein can help protect against cognitive decline. In another study published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, researchers discovered that taking a daily supplement of 10 mg of lutein, along with other carotenoids, was effective at improving memory within one year. Lutein naturally accumulates in your brain and retina. It is known to contribute to macular pigment optical density, which is crucial if you want to prevent eye diseases. Increased macular pigment optical density has also been linked to better cognitive function. Research suggests that lutein, especially when accompanied by zeaxanthin, another beneficial carotenoid, can help reduce the risk of cataracts and slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Lutein is also effective at helping filter harmful ultraviolet rays and blue light, which is why some researchers call it “sunscreen for the eyes.” Lutein is an essential nutrient, meaning your body is unable to produce this carotenoid. You can only obtain lutein from plant-based foods and supplements. While there is no recommended dietary intake of lutein, it’s generally considered to be safe, even when taken in high amounts. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies it as Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS). It’s estimated that many Americans consume only around one to two milligrams (mg) of lutein each day. But studies suggest that you may need a higher intake of lutein to reduce your risk of developing AMD. Taking 10 mg of lutein and two mg of zeaxanthin supplements has been reported to slow the progression of AMD. Researchers observed no negative side effects with this dosage, except for minor yellowing of the skin. The Council for Responsible Nutrition also confirms that a daily dose of up to 20 mg of lutein is safe for the body. Different vegetables provide healthy doses of lutein. The following leafy green vegetables contain the highest amount of dietary lutein: Lutein can also be found in other foods, such as: Lutein is absorbed best when consumed with fats because low-density lipoproteins are the main transport vehicles for lutein in your body. You can try pairing lutein-rich vegetables with healthy fats such as EPA and DHA, the omega-3 fatty acids found in wild-caught fish. Avocado, a superfood that contains beneficial monounsaturated fat and lutein, is also a great food for maintaining healthy lutein levels. Egg yolks are similarly full of good fats and lutein. While dietary consumption is the best way to get more lutein, you can also boost your lutein intake by taking dietary supplements. Lutein supplements are usually sourced from marigold flowers and mixed with oils, but they can also be made synthetically. For your safety and in order to maximize its benefits, consult with a natural health provider before taking lutein supplements. Other healthy habits can help preserve brain health, such as exercising regularly, getting enough sleep and eating a balanced diet. Researchers from Harvard Medical School say that the Mediterranean diet, which prioritizes nutritious fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts, olive oil and moderate amounts of fish, poultry and dairy products, is linked to lower rates of cognitive decline and dementia. Research also suggests that meaningful social engagement and mental stimulation through activities like reading, writing or puzzle-solving, can help boost cognitive health. Follow a balanced diet and eat nutritious foods rich in the carotenoid lutein to support your brain health and vision.

https://food.news/2023-06-05-michelle-obamas-juice-fails-her-health-standards.html,Michelle Obama’s juice brand fails health standards set by her husband’s administration,0,"Advertisement Michelle Obama, the wife of former U.S. President Barack Obama, is known for her health advocacy. However, products from her juice brand Plezi have failed health standards set by the Obama administration. The finding is based on discussions with 12 independent health professionals and organizations. After discussing with 12 independent health professionals and organizations, data showed that Plezi’s current flavors, which were released earlier this month, do not meet the requirements to be served at elementary and middle schools. “Under the Obama-era school-meal regulations currently under review, U.S. elementary and middle schools may only serve water, milk or 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice with no added sweeteners (the regulations do permit schools to dilute juices with water) – and none of Plezi’s four current flavors meet these criteria,” a Bloomberg article stated. Instead, all Plezi juices are sweetened with stevia and monk-fruit extracts, which the experts raised concerns over after dubbing them “non-nutritive sweeteners” and “potentially unhealthy.” Although Plezi juices fail regulations because they’re sweetened and highly processed – processed foods lose most of their nutrient content during processing – studies beg to differ about the healthfulness of stevia and monk fruit. According to a review by an international team of researchers, these natural sweeteners are not only safe for consumption but also possess antidiabetic, anti-obesity and other beneficial properties that make them excellent alternatives to artificial sweeteners and refined sugar. On the other hand, the use of artificial sweeteners like aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal) and acesulfame potassium (Sunnett, Sweet One) has been linked to a higher risk of heart problems, including heart attack, and stroke. However, earlier in May, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its own report advising against the use of sweeteners like stevia to control body weight. (Related: Build up your health with beet juice.) Nutrition experts were critical of Michelle Obama for promoting a brand that may “ultimately be a less healthy option.” Jerold Mande, a nutrition professor, explained that Michelle Obama “has been ill-served by advisers who convinced her to target 6- to 12-year-olds with a flashy, ultra-processed beverage that may not be any healthier than diet soda.” Most children prefer sweet beverages like soda and store-bought fruit juice. But guiding them towards more balanced options is important for their overall well-being. If you’re having a hard time finding nutritious and appealing beverages for your kids, here are some delicious alternatives to consider: Water If your child says they’re thirsty, always offer water first. Water is essential for many bodily processes, such as temperature regulation and organ function. In relation to body weight, children have greater water requirements than adults because the former have rapidly growing bodies and higher metabolic rates. Unlike other beverages, water doesn’t contain liquid calories, making it less likely to cause your child to feel full and refuse to eat food. This is important if your kid is a picky eater. Naturally flavored water If your child thinks plain water is boring, he or she may end up hating this essential beverage. Thankfully, you can encourage your kid to drink more water without adding extra sugar and calories by infusing water with fresh fruits and herbs. Try different flavor combinations until you find one that your kid likes. As a bonus, your child will get a boost of nutrition from the fresh fruit and herbs you add to the water. Here are some tasty and refreshing combinations to try: Coconut water While fresh coconut water contains calories and sugar, it’s still a healthier choice than other beverages like soda and sports drinks. Coconut water also provides nutrients like magnesium, potassium and vitamin C, all of which are essential nutrients for children. Additionally, coconut water contains electrolytes like calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium, which are lost through sweat after physical activity. This means coconut water is the ideal hydration alternative to sugary sports drinks for active children. If your child is sick with diarrhea or vomiting, you can give them coconut water to help them rehydrate. When buying coconut water, check the label since some brands contain added sugars and artificial flavors. If possible, give children unsweetened coconut water. Fruit and veggie smoothies If your child is very picky about what they eat and drink, serving them smoothies is a delicious way to sneak fruits, vegetables and other healthy foods into their diet. However, you need to avoid premade smoothies, which are usually full of sugar. Instead, give them homemade smoothies so you can control the ingredients. Smoothies are great for children who are picky eaters because you can easily blend vegetables like cauliflower, kale or spinach into a sweet-tasting smoothie that your child will enjoy. Try these kid-friendly smoothie combinations: Blend the ingredients with unsweetened non-dairy or dairy-based milk and try healthy add-ins like avocados, cocoa powder, ground flax seeds, hemp seeds or unsweetened coconut. Don’t buy smoothies at grocery stores or restaurants because these often contain added sugar. Make homemade versions whenever possible. Because smoothies are high in calories, it’s best to offer them as a snack or alongside a small meal. Unsweetened milk Many kids prefer sweetened milk drinks like chocolate or strawberry milk, but plain, unsweetened milk is the healthiest choice for growing children. Plain milk contains various nutrients that are critical for the growth and development of young children. Milk contains calcium, phosphorus, protein and magnesium, all of which are essential nutrients for bone health. Milk is also often fortified with vitamin D, another important vitamin for bone health. Some parents prefer giving their children fat-free milk, but milk with a higher fat content may be healthier for younger children since they need fat for proper brain development and growth. Unsweetened plant-based milks If your child is intolerant to dairy milk, you can give them unsweetened plant-based milk as an alternative. Plant-based milk includes almond, cashew, coconut, hemp, rice and soy milk. Like sweetened dairy milk, sweetened plant-based milks can contain loads of added sugar so it’s best to buy unsweetened versions. Unsweetened plant-based milks can be served on their own as a low-calorie drink or as a base for kid-friendly smoothies, oatmeal and soups. Avoid giving your children store-bought fruit juices that may contain added sugar and other harmful ingredients. Instead, give them healthy alternatives like water, coconut water or fruit and veggie smoothies. Watch the video below to know more about the health benefits of beet juice.

https://food.news/2023-05-18-make-bread-without-oven-like-pioneers-did.html,Prepper recipes: How to make bread without an oven like the pioneers did,0,"Advertisement Preppers can learn a lot from the pioneers who survived without modern technology and many of the useful tools that make life much easier, like power tools and modern survival gear. In the past, pioneers learned how to make bread without an oven. When SHTF, you can make no-oven bread using the recipes below. (h/t to PreparedSurvivalist.org) Frying pan bread is more commonly known as bannock bread. The recipe is simple, but you have to be careful so you don’t burn the bannock. Bannock, which comes from the Gaelic word bannach, was once a generic term for bread in Scotland and other areas in the British Isles, where wheat and ovens were rare. Bannock requires only a handful of ingredients, is affordable and endlessly versatile. Ingredients: Preparation: Bread on the stick, which is a rather simple recipe as the name implies, was popular with mountain men and people who had sourdoughs. If you don’t have a lot of time to cook or are low on supplies, this recipe is worth trying. All you need to do is wrap a long roll of dough around the end of a shaved stick and set the stick over the fire. (Related: Homemade recipes: No-knead artisan bread.) The stick with the dough is usually inserted into the ground at an angle to the fire and turned occasionally. You can also give the finished bread a pretzel-like texture by dipping a clean hand in water and spritzing the dough as it bakes. Ingredients: Preparation: “Hoe cake” is a pioneer cornbread that was baked on the curved metal side of a hoe. Pioneers made hoe bread by placing a clean hoe next to the fire and letting the hot iron cook one side of the hoe cake as the heat from the fire cooked the other side. If you have a cast-iron skillet, you can use it to finish cooking the hoe cake. It’s the same concept, but you need to flip the hoe cake from time to time to finish both sides. Ingredients: Preparation: This recipe is a modern one, but like the pioneer bread recipes above, you can make it even without an oven. Ingredients: Preparation: Learn simple pioneer recipes like bannock bread or bread on a stick so you can make bread for your family even without an oven.

But according to a study, bacteria can feel hangry too – which can make them release disease-causing toxins. The research was conducted by scientists from the University of North Carolina (UNC) and published in the journal Nature Microbiology. Adam Rosenthal, an assistant professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at UNC, and his colleagues from Harvard University, Princeton University and Danisco Animal Nutrition discovered that “genetically identical cells within a bacterial community have different functions.” While some of cells behave normally, other cells act abnormally and cause illness. The research team set out to learn more about the unusual behavior of certain bacteria within a community. For their study, they used a microfluidic droplet generator, a device made using newly-developed technology, and Clostridium perfringens, a rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the intestinal tract of humans, other vertebrates, insects and soil. They separated single bacterial cells into droplets to study each cell and found that well-fed C. perfringens cells didn’t produce toxins. Only the cells that lacked nutrition did. (Related: Bacteria “gangs” defend their turf by forming “social networks” that release toxins to neutralize enemies, according to new research.) Rosenthal hypothesized that giving the abnormally behaving cells more nutrients can help them “behave a little bit better.” To test their theory, the researchers exposed the harmful cells to a substance called acetate. After exposure to acetate, toxin levels declined across the bacterial community, along with the number of individually harmful cells. The researchers said that continued study is required to find out if this behavior is exclusive to C. perfringens or if specific environmental factors activate the production of toxins in other types of infections as well. Rosenthal and his team hopes that their findings can also be used to develop an alternative treatment for animals and humans. C. perfringens is a common pathogen found in factory farms, particularly in chicken farms. The study findings could be used to develop a means for farmers to keep animals healthy without using antibiotics that may harm consumers. As for humans, Rosenthal is currently working with colleagues at UNC to learn about antibiotic resistance, an increasingly prevalent public health issue that prevents modern treatments from working effectively. The demand for food products raised without harmful antibiotics is increasing. Back in 2012, sales of these food products had increased by 25 percent compared to the previous three years. Some say the overuse of antibiotics in food-producing animals could be linked to the increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or “superbugs.” When superbugs are passed to humans, they can cause serious illness. Antibiotics are used to prevent or treat bacterial infections in animals. Since the 1940s, antibiotics have been given to farm animals like chickens, cows and pigs to treat infections or prevent an illness from spreading. Additionally, low doses of antibiotics are added to animal feed to promote growth and make the animals produce more meat or milk. Since these low doses were said to reduce animal death rates and improve reproduction, the use of antibiotics became widespread in agriculture. But from 2015 to 2018, sales for antimicrobials for use in food-producing animals decreased by 38 percent. Strict legislation is currently enforced in the U.S. to ensure that no contaminated food products reach the food supply.

https://food.news/2023-05-03-how-to-forage-edible-nuts-survival-stockpile.html,Food supply tips: How to forage for edible nuts for your survival stockpile,0,"Advertisement Worried about where to find food when SHTF? Learn how to forage for nuts from various trees. When SHTF, you can forage for different kinds of nuts to add to your food stockpile. Despite their small size, nuts are great superfoods because they are nutritious and delicious. Nuts are rich in antioxidants, dietary fiber, protein and other beneficial vitamins. They also have a long shelf life when properly stored. (h/t to FoodStorageMoms.com) Below are some easy-to-find nuts you can forage for to secure your food supply. Raw acorns are bitter because they contain tannins. Fortunately, you can safely remove tannins by leaching acorns. This means putting the acorns in boiling water for about 15 minutes. After the acorns are boiled, replace the brown water with clean water and boil the nuts again for another 15 minutes. To leach acorns properly, repeat this process until the hot water is mostly clear. Don’t discard the brown tannin water; you can use it to help soothe sunburns, bug bites and rashes. Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook acorns: Beechnuts come from the beech tree. Beechnut trees begin to produce nuts when they are about 20 years old. They will generate nuts about every two years or so. Beechnuts taste similar to walnuts and are rich in protein. If you want to gather beechnuts, do it early to beat squirrels and raccoons, which love the nuts. You should also take note that beechnuts spoil quickly. Try dry roasting them not long after harvesting to make them last longer. You can roast the nuts in a slow oven or leave them out in the sun for a day. Keep an eye on the beechnuts so squirrels don’t eat them. Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook beechnuts: Black walnut trees produce delicious and nutritious nuts. If you spot black walnuts, harvest them immediately because squirrels and raccoons might beat you to it. Black walnuts can be difficult to open, so you may need a hammer to smash through the shell or outer husk. Wear an apron and gloves when deshelling black walnuts because the inside of their shells contains a brown oil that can easily stain your clothes. Alternatively, you can scrape the husks away with a knife. Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook black walnuts: You can harvest butternuts in temperate forests. They can be identified by their yellowish-brown husks that often have a rough texture. Butternut husks can easily be cracked open with a nutcracker or with two rocks. They are sweet, creamy and full of nutrients. Once you harvest butternuts, consume them as soon as possible or dry them immediately because they go rancid rather quickly. (Related: 5 Tips for safely foraging nutrient-dense food.) Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook butternuts: When foraging for hickory nuts, look for shellbark hickory, which has loose bark that separates in narrow strips. You can also look for shagbark hickory, which has long strips of bark that shed and fall to the base of the tree. Hickory nuts are easier to open than black walnuts, but it’s better to use a tool to get them open. They are loaded with oil and have a unique flavor that pairs wonderfully with sauces and desserts. Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook hickory nuts: Pecans are a type of hickory nut that are commonly found in the southeastern U.S. and parts of Mexico. They are often used as toppings for salads, desserts and other dishes due to their sweet taste and buttery texture. Pecans and walnuts have a similar nutritional profile, but pecan shells don’t stain like black walnuts do. Harvest pecans when they start to fall off the tree. Pick them up from the ground or try to shake them out of tree branches. Be observant when foraging for pecans. Make sure the nuts have recently fallen and have not cracked open. If possible, use gloves to protect your hands since pecan shells can have a sharp point at the end. Once you have enough deshelled pecans, store them in an airtight container. You can refrigerate them for up to six months. Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook pecans: Pine nuts come from pine trees, but not all pine trees produce edible pine nuts. These tree varieties can be found in western North America: The most common pinyon pine varieties for eating are the Colorado pinyon, Mexican pinyon and the single-leaf pinyon. During autumn, you can harvest pine nuts once you notice the cones open up, revealing large seeds. Unlike other nuts that are hard to crack open, pine nuts can be shelled by hand. But they do have one downside: Pine nuts are so small, making them difficult to shell. A hammer might not be as helpful, unless you use it with a gentle hand. To avoid tedious work, you can pop pine nuts into your mouth and gently crack them open. You can make pine nuts last for several months by storing them in a heavy-duty freezer bag and refrigerating them. Alternatively, you can store pine nuts in the freezer for three to six months. Here are some tips on how to prepare and cook pine nuts: Not sure when to harvest nuts? Most nuts grow well in the warm summer sunshine. Nuts should be ready for harvest by late summer or early fall. Generally, nuts are great sources of vitamins and minerals. The most common vitamins in nuts are vitamins E and B6, folate and niacin. Nuts also contain minerals like calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, potassium, selenium and zinc. These nutrients can help you maintain good overall health, especially in a survival situation.

https://food.news/2023-05-03-fruit-invasive-weed-boost-collagen-prevent-aging.html,"Fruit of known invasive weed found to boost collagen production, prevent skin aging",0,"Advertisement The sight of weeds in a garden may stress out a gardener, but in a recent study, researchers discovered that the fruit of cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium), an invasive weed, can boost collagen synthesis and even prevent early signs of skin aging. Cocklebur commonly grows in backyards in the United States. According to the study, the weed’s spiky fruit could not only help reduce damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) rays, but it could also help wounds heal faster. The researchers presented their findings at the annual meeting of the American Society For Biochemistry And Molecular Biology in Seattle. The research team reported that extracts of the fruit boosted the production of collagen, a protein that helps maintain skin elasticity and prevents wrinkles. (Related: Boost your skin health with astaxanthin, a potent natural antioxidant.) Cocklebur is native to parts of Europe, Asia and North America. It commonly grows in open, often moist places like river banks in agricultural land and other areas. Cocklebur is widely used in Traditional Chinese and Native American Medicine to treat various health issues, such as a stuffy nose, headaches and more severe conditions like arthritis and tuberculosis. It is also traditionally used to treat rabies, malaria and leprosy. However, cocklebur fruit seeds contain a chemical called carboxyatractyloside, which can poison and kill livestock when eaten. Humans who accidentally consume cocklebur may experience mild symptoms like an unpleasant taste and nausea. Severe symptoms can include abdominal pain, low blood sugar, vomiting, seizures and severe liver injury. According to the research team from Myongji University in South Korea, cocklebur fruit extracts can be used as a natural ingredient in topical skin creams and other cosmetics. Eunsu Song, a doctoral candidate at the university and one of the study authors, said cocklebur fruit has the potential to protect the skin and help boost collagen production. Cocklebur could also have “a synergistic effect if it is mixed with other effective compounds, such as hyaluronic acid or retinoic acid, against aging,” added Song. For the study, the researchers investigated the molecular properties of cocklebur fruit extracts. They also isolated particular compounds that could provide some antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, they conducted laboratory experiments in cells and on a 3D tissue model with properties similar to human skin to find out if these compounds affect collagen production, wound healing and damage from UVB radiation which is linked to sunburns, skin aging and skin cancers. Results showed that cocklebur fruit extracts promoted collagen synthesis, accelerated wound healing and exerted a protective effect against UVB radiation. Cocklebur fruits harvested in South Korea also showed slightly higher antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and wound-healing activities than cocklebur fruits from China. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds in cocklebur fruit make it an appealing cosmetic agent for anti-aging products. However, despite cocklebur fruit’s skin-protective properties, the researchers emphasized that it should be used with caution since it may also cause adverse effects at higher concentrations. As you age, your eating habits can significantly affect your appearance, fitness, quality of life and disease risk. Your body also needs many different nutrients to support the natural aging process. Some nutrients may help slow signs of aging and boost skin health. Eating more nutritious foods can also help you look and feel your best as you age. To age well, eat healthy sources of protein and essential fats as well as antioxidant-rich foods. These superfoods can promote skin health and boost collagen production. Fatty fish Fatty fish contains long-chain omega-3 fatty acids that can help fight heart disease, inflammation and many other health issues. Studies show that omega-3s are linked to a strong skin barrier and may help decrease inflammation that damages the skin. Fatty fish like salmon offer skin benefits thanks to astaxanthin, a powerful antioxidant responsible for the pink color of salmon. In one study, people with sun-damaged skin were given a combination of astaxanthin and collagen for 12 weeks. Researchers reported that the volunteers experienced significant improvements in skin elasticity and hydration. Salmon and other fatty fish are also full of protein, which your body needs to produce collagen and elastin. These two macromolecules are responsible for the strength, plumpness and elasticity of your skin. Eating foods rich in protein can also promote wound healing. Fatty fish is rich in selenium, a mineral and antioxidant with a crucial role in DNA synthesis and repair. Selenium may also help protect against skin damage caused by UV light. Having adequate levels of selenium may reduce the severity of skin diseases like psoriasis. Pomegranates Like most fruits, pomegranates are rich in various nutrients, such as dietary fiber, potassium and vitamin K, which help support heart health. Pomegranates are also full of beneficial antioxidants like flavonols, tannins, phenolic acids and lignans. According to human and animal studies, the antioxidants in pomegranates can support healthy skin aging by decreasing UV skin damage and brown spots caused by excessive sun exposure. The antioxidants in pomegranates can also protect your skin’s existing collagen and help you produce new ones. Vegetables Most vegetables are nutritious and low-calorie. Vegetables are full of antioxidants, which help reduce the risk of heart disease, cataracts and certain types of cancer. Many vegetables are also rich in carotenoids, such as beta carotene and lycopene. According to some studies, a diet high in carotenoids may protect your skin against UV rays, the main cause of premature skin aging. Carrots, pumpkins and sweet potatoes are some of the best sources of beta carotene. Many vegetables are also rich in vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant vitamin that plays an important role in collagen production. Collagen is a key building block of your skin, but its production starts to decline after you turn 25. Vegetables with the highest vitamin C content that promote collagen synthesis are bell peppers, broccoli, tomatoes and leafy greens. Make sure you eat a variety of vegetables in different colors since each color represents different antioxidants that can offer health benefits for your skin and overall well-being. Try to include at least two different vegetables in each meal and protect your skin using sunscreen. Visit Cosmetics.news for more tips on how to have healthy, younger-looking skin.

https://food.news/2023-04-25-40-percent-meat-products-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs.html,Study reveals 40% of meat products test positive for antibiotic-resistant SUPERBUGS,0,"Advertisement A study conducted by researchers in Spain revealed that almost half of the meat products in supermarkets could be hiding potentially deadly drug-resistant superbugs. The study found multidrug-resistant E. coli strains in 40 percent of beef, chicken, pork and turkey products for sale in shops across the country. The study also revealed that E. coli strains that can cause severe infections in people were “highly” prevalent in the tested meat products. Experts warned that antibiotic resistance is reaching “dangerously high” levels globally. Drug-resistant infections kill an estimated 700,000 people around the world annually. That figure could skyrocket to 10 million by 2050 if not addressed immediately, according to estimates. Multidrug-resistant bacteria can spread from animals to humans through the food industry. But data on the levels of antibiotic-resistant bugs detected in food is often unavailable. To address this, Spanish researchers developed a series of experiments to accurately measure levels of multidrug-resistant and extraintestinal pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae, a family of bacteria that includes E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other bacteria that can cause health issues like sepsis and urinary tract infections (UTIs). For the study, the researchers tested 100 meat products from random supermarkets across Oviedo, Spain, in 2020. The products included 25 samples each of chicken, turkey, beef and pork. The results showed that nearly three in four meat products (73 percent) contained levels of E. coli that were within food safety limits. (Related: Antibiotic-resistant SUPERBUGS found in imported SHRIMP sold at Canadian supermarkets.) Meanwhile, almost half (49 percent) of the samples contained multidrug-resistant bacteria or potentially pathogenic strains of E. coli. Out of this group, the researchers recovered and characterized 82 E. coli isolates. The research team also recovered a dozen K. pneumoniae isolates from 10 of the 100 meat products, including seven samples of poultry. Study findings revealed that 40 of the 100 meat products contained multidrug-resistant E. coli. The highest prevalence of positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli was found in turkey (68 percent) and chicken products (56 percent). The researchers explained that the higher presence of ESBL-producing E. coli strains in poultry compared to beef and pork could be due to differences in the slaughter and production of these meat products. The study also found that more than a quarter of the meat products (27 percent) contained potentially pathogenic extraintestinal E. coli (ExPEC). ExPEC has genes that allow them to cause disease even outside of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Dr. Azucena Mora Gutierrez of the University of Santiago de Compostela-Lugo said ExPEC causes the vast majority of UTIs. It is also a leading cause of sepsis and the second-leading cause of neonatal meningitis. One of the meat products was found to contain E. coli harboring the mcr-1 gene, which creates resistance to colistin, an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by bacteria resistant to all other antibiotic medications. Gutierrez advised that manufacturers must prioritize “farm-to-fork interventions” to protect consumers. She also suggested that enforcing surveillance lab methods for further study of high-risk bacteria common in farm animals and meat could help address the issue. According to Gutierrez, consumers should always cook meat thoroughly. Meat should also be stored properly in the refrigerator, and knives, chopping boards and other cooking utensils used to prepare raw meat must be properly disinfected to avoid cross-contamination. Enforcing these measures can help reduce risk to zero, concluded Gutierrez. Different types of bacteria can grow on animal products. This highlights the importance of safely handling and storing all types of meat. If you are confused about the different rules for handling different types of meat, follow the tips below to protect your family from harmful bacteria found in meat. Don’t buy meat that’s past the expiration or sell-by date. When buying groceries, buy meats last to reduce the time the meat is out of refrigeration. Here are some specific guidelines for selecting certain meats: Buy organic meat from trusted stores and cook food thoroughly to protect your family from harmful bacteria and food poisoning.

https://food.news/2023-04-20-fructose-consumption-linked-to-high-blood-pressure.html,Study reveals link between fructose consumption and high blood pressure,0,"Advertisement Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a serious health problem in the U.S. According to data, 47 percent or almost half of American adults are diagnosed with this condition. Hypertension is a condition characterized by systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mmHg. Traditionally, doctors warn their patients to limit their sodium intake, which can cause or exacerbate high blood pressure. But a recent study suggests there’s another culprit besides sodium that can raise your blood pressure: fructose. Aside from increasing blood pressure in adults, a high-fructose diet can also raise the likelihood of children developing hypertension as adults. Fructose is a naturally occurring monosaccharide present in fruits, but it can also be produced by your body when the polyol pathway is activated. Fructose is the main ingredient in high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), an artificial sweetener commonly added to packaged foods and beverages. Although fruit sugar is very similar in structure to glucose, fructose affects your body differently. When you consume fructose, your body processes the sugar for fuel storage. This happens so that the fuel can be used later to provide your body with water and energy. However, this has an adverse effect because fructose makes your body retain sodium, which increases blood pressure. A diet high in fructose upregulates the activity of sodium transporters, which can trigger an increase in blood pressure. Additionally, it inactivates vasodilators while activating vasoconstrictors and can increase appetite and cause thirst. When combined with other substances to form HFCS, fructose’s harmful effects at high concentrations are amplified. For the study, researchers analyzed data from participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. The study took a closer look at cardiovascular risk factors in Caucasian and African American young adults aged 17 to 35 at the time of enrollment. The research team gathered both dietary data and blood pressure at the time of enrollment. The dietary information quantified sodium and fructose intakes. Each participant’s blood pressure was taken at several points throughout the study: At seven years, 15 years and 30 years. Consumption of sodium and fructose had a significant impact on the prediction of higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures during year 30 of the follow-up. The researchers concluded that following a diet high in both sodium and fructose during adolescence could influence systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adulthood. Another study suggested that consuming fructose during pregnancy could contribute to the development of preeclampsia. Fructose is vital for fetal development and is naturally produced by the body. Fructose production is increased when a woman is pregnant. But if production does not return to normal or if the woman’s diet also includes fructose and its derivatives, it can lead to preeclampsia, which causes symptoms like hypertension and protein in urine (proteinuria). To protect your children and ensure that they remain healthy as they age, teach them how to have good eating habits. Pregnant women can also protect themselves by reading product labels and knowing the different names of fructose so they can avoid it. HFCS is associated with many health problems. It appears as fruit sugar, d-fructofuranose, d-fructose, d-arabino-hexulose or levulose in product labels. Make sure you avoid sugary food and beverages containing HFCS and eat a lot of organic whole foods instead. (Related: Vitamin C found to improve blood sugar and blood pressure control in people with Type 2 diabetes.) Many food products, such as junk foods and various beverages, contain this harmful sweetener. Keep your family healthy by avoiding these products: Some products labeled “healthy” may also contain HFCS. Review labels to avoid this sweetener and cut back on processed foods. Teaching young children the importance of good eating habits is key to ensuring their overall wellness as adults. Follow the tips below to prevent hypertension: Follow a balanced diet Whatever your age is, following a low-sodium diet can help improve your blood pressure. According to data, at least 90 percent of Americans consume too much sodium, which can be traced to overconsumption of processed and restaurant foods. Maintain healthy blood pressure by eating a nutritious diet full of various fruits and vegetables. Reducing your intake of foods rich in fats and sugars and avoiding processed foods can help boost your heart health. Exercise regularly Regular physical activity can help reduce your risk of developing hypertension. The more active you are, the better. But even moderate activity, such as 30 minutes of exercise three times a week, can offer health benefits. Engaging in physical activity regularly helps your heart use oxygen more efficiently. This means it doesn’t need to work as hard to pump blood, which can help lower your blood pressure. Lose weight/Maintain a healthy weight Eating well and staying active is key to successful weight management, another significant prevention method for high blood pressure. If you are overweight, losing a little weight can help reduce the strain on your heart and lower blood pressure. Don’t smoke/quit smoking Like drinking alcohol, smoking has many adverse effects. Aside from many health problems, smoking raises blood pressure and increases your risk of heart attack and stroke. If you need help quitting, consult your physician and ask about programs and resources that may be right for you. Monitor your blood pressure Hypertension is often symptomless. Take regular readings to monitor your blood pressure. This will allow you to quickly address any changes if your health takes a turn for the worse.

https://food.news/2023-04-19-reducing-daily-sugar-intake-benefits-overall-health.html,Reducing daily sugar intake to less than 6 teaspoons found to benefit overall health,0,"Advertisement According to the World Health Organization (WHO), added sugar should not make up more than 10 percent of your daily energy intake. A recent study also found that limiting your sugar intake to only six teaspoons a day and having only one sugary drink a week could significantly improve your overall well-being. The researchers who conducted the study highlighted the fact that consuming too much added sugar daily increases your risk of developing 45 different health conditions, including depression, diabetes and heart disease. More details were published in the journal The BMJ. For the study, an international team of researchers reviewed multiple studies to explore the link between sugar consumption and various health outcomes. The review included 73 studies from at least 8,600 articles that covered 83 different health outcomes in adults and children. Data from the studies revealed that consuming too much sugar can cause health problems like: The data also showed that a high-sugar diet may increase the risk of seven specific types of cancer, including breast, prostate and pancreatic tumors. (Related: Study links use of artificial sweeteners to increased cancer risk.) A sugary diet was also linked to other health problems like asthma, tooth decay and premature death. If you wish to stay healthy, it’s important to reduce your sugar intake because drinking high-sugar beverages like soda is linked to an increase in body weight. At the same time, adding sugar to your food and drinks can increase both liver and muscle fat. The data also suggested that for each additional serving of sugary drinks per week, there is a four percent increase in the risk of developing gout. The researchers warned that drinking 250 milliliters (mL) of sugary drinks per day is associated with a 17 percent higher risk of coronary heart disease and a four percent higher risk of death. Evidence also suggest that each 25-gram serving of fructose per day is linked to a 22 percent greater risk of pancreatic cancer. Associate Professor Liangren Liu of the West China Hospital of Sichuan University said the umbrella review suggests that high dietary sugar consumption, “especially intake of sugars that contain fructose, is harmfully associated with large numbers of health outcomes.” Liu added that data for the harmful links between dietary sugar consumption and changes in body weight, ectopic fat accumulation, coronary heart disease, obesity (in children) and depression seem to be more reliable than data for other outcomes. Based on their findings, Liu and colleagues recommend reducing the amount of sugar you add to food and beverages to only six teaspoons a day. They also recommend consuming only one or fewer sugary drinks every week. In addition, Liu said that while the link between dietary sugar consumption and cancer is limited, it warrants further research. Sugary treats like candy and soda can be comforting, but reducing your intake of sugary foods and beverages is key to improving your well-being. Follow the tips below if you have a sweet tooth but want to reduce your daily sugar intake: Limit your intake of sugary drinks Most added sugars in the average American diet come from sugary drinks like sodas, energy drinks, sweetened teas and sports drinks. Drinks that many people think are healthy, like fruit smoothies and fruit juices, may also contain a lot of added sugar. For example, one cup (271 grams) of cranberry juice cocktail contains more than seven teaspoons of sugar (31 grams), which is more than the recommended six teaspoons a day. Reducing your intake of sugary drinks can help with weight loss and improve your overall well-being. If you are looking for drinks that are naturally low on sugar, consider water, unsweetened sparkling water, herbal teas, plain black or green tea and coffee with little to no added sugar or creamer. Avoid sugary desserts Most desserts contain little to no nutrients and are full of sugar, which causes blood sugar spikes that can leave you feeling tired and hungry and make you crave even more sugar. According to data, grain- and dairy-based desserts, like cakes and ice cream, make up over 18 percent of the added sugar in the standard American diet. For healthier dessert alternatives, try a piece of fresh fruit or some Greek yogurt with cinnamon or berries. You can also try baked fruit with cream and dark chocolate that contains at least 70 percent cocoa or higher. Eat more whole foods Whole foods refer to foods that haven’t been processed or refined. They are free of any additives and other artificial substances like flavorings. Whole foods include whole fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and meat on the bone. Ultra-processed foods or packaged foods contain a lot of fat, salt, sugar and additives. These ingredients make these unhealthy foods taste good, making it hard to avoid them once you get a taste. Examples of ultra-processed foods are chips, sugary cereals and soft drinks. Almost 90 percent of the added sugar in the average American’s diet comes from ultra-processed foods, while only 8.7 percent comes from foods cooked at home using whole foods. Whenever possible, cook food at home instead of eating fast food or dining out to avoid added sugars. If you don’t have a lot of free time, you don’t have to cook elaborate meals. You can prepare delicious meals by simply preparing marinated meats and roasted vegetables. Avoid stocking up on foods and beverages with high sugar content Keeping high-sugar foods in the house makes you more likely to eat them. To effectively reduce your sugar intake, avoid buying soda and sugary desserts like cake and ice cream. If you want to improve your family’s eating habits, you should have a plan in place when the sugar cravings strike. Try stocking up on healthier alternatives, like herbal teas, fruits, healthy homemade desserts and low-sugar snacks and beverages.

https://food.news/2023-04-18-pork-producers-mrna-gene-therapy-on-animals.html,Pork producers have been using mRNA-based GENE THERAPY on animals since 2018,0,"Advertisement Dr. Joseph Mercola, an osteopathic physician, has been avoiding pork since 2018. Mercola takes a “whole-person” approach to wellness, helping his patients develop attitudes and lifestyles that can help them take control of their health. That’s why he is also urging them to avoid consuming pork. According to Mercola, pork producers have been using customizable mRNA-based gene therapy on animals. Harrisvaccines developed the first RNA-based livestock vaccine, a swine influenza (H3N2) RNA shot licensed in 2012. In 2015, the company developed an avian influenza mRNA shot. Harrisvaccines was acquired by Merck Animal Health in 2016. That same year, CureVac developed an mRNA-based rabies shot for pigs. Sequivity, a swine vaccine platform introduced in 2018, was developed by Merck in partnership with Moderna. Sequivity can produce customized “vaccines,” none of which undergo safety testing. This means Americans have been consuming pork treated with gene therapy for almost five years. More of the country’s meat supply is about to get the same treatment. After all, companies are working on mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccines for avian influenza, along with mRNA vaccines for cows. Lobbyists for the Cattlemen’s Association recently confirmed that they have plans to use mRNA “vaccines” in cattle, which might affect both dairy and beef. (Related: Why is eating large amounts of processed meat bad for your health? It comes down to the toxic additives and preservatives.) When Merck purchased Harrisvaccines in 2015, the company also entered into a partnership with Moderna to develop several undisclosed mRNA “vaccines.” This was slated to be a three-year collaboration, with a one-year optional extension that would allow Merck to perform research and development and commercialization of five potential products using Moderna’s mRNA technology. Even if you only consume organic meat, you still need to look for products from reliable producers. Since search engines only provide a short list of curated and heavily censored content, it’s almost impossible to confirm how many pork producers in America use Sequivity. Without that data, Mercola recommends avoiding pork altogether, including organic pork, especially since “organic standards do not have any rules on the use of vaccines, mRNA-based or otherwise.” Since the Sequivity platform has been around for at least five years already, it seems reasonable to assume that almost all large-scale swine producers have made this transition. One of the most frustrating aspects of this issue is that the industry didn’t tell consumers they were using novel gene therapy to develop harmful customized “vaccines” within weeks and without the required safety testing. Mercola noted that other health experts only became aware of this issue because attorney Tom Renz started warning others about it. According to Renz, consumers can be protected from gene-therapied pork and other meats with the Missouri House Bill 1169, which would require labeling of products that can alter your genes. The bill requires that “fully informed consent must be given for all vaccines, gene therapies and medical interventions, and would require companies to share information about the potential transmissibility of gene-altering interventions.” And it shouldn’t surprise consumers that there has been significant pushback by the industry against this bill. Why are companies so against the bill when it doesn’t ban anything and only requires transparency? What do they have to hide? It’s not a stretch to think that they consider Missouri House Bill 1169 a serious threat because many of them are selling foods that can have gene-altering effects. The bill would also prevent Big Pharma’s attempts to use the food supply as a tool to distribute vaccines to unknowing consumers. Renz warned that Big Pharma will do whatever it takes to prevent people from finding out that they have plans to “use food to alter their genetics.” Unfortunately, this means some farmers are also being set up as the fall guys. Additionally, major factory-farmers like Bill Gates have legal teams that can help protect the torts that may come if the food supply starts poisoning consumers while the small farmers could be at risk of being sued if it turns out that the food they are selling is unsafe, even if most of them don’t understand what is happening. If the corn growers, soybean, cattle and pork associations really care about farmers, they should be demanding that seed companies and vaccine manufacturers indemnify small farmers rather than opposing a bill that requires them to tell farmers exactly what is in their products. Missouri House Bill 1169 would help protect farmers from being sued because it would force the makers of GMO seeds and vaccines to be transparent about putting potential gene therapies into their products. If the bill is passed in Missouri, it would also help protect the American food supply from contamination with gene-altering vaccines. In the meantime, Mercola advises consumers to avoid all pork products, including organic products, that may have been tainted with mRNA vaccines.

https://food.news/2023-04-10-food-storage-tips-protect-stockpile-bugs-pests.html,Food storage tips: How to protect your food supply from bugs and pests,0,"Advertisement If you are stocking up on supplies and preparing for possible survival scenarios, you need to learn how to protect food staples like rice, flour and other items from various pests. When SHTF, you don’t want to bugs or rats to gain access to your food supply. Detailed below are tips that will help keep various pantry pests away. (h/t to ApartmentPrepper.com) Keep in mind that the foods below can attract pests like bugs and mice to your pantry or storeroom: Common pantry pests include small beetles, moths and weevils. These bugs are more annoying although they are often harmless. Pests like moths don’t bite, sting or do any damage to your home, but they can get into stored foods. In some cases, you might even see pests inside a completely sealed package or in a clean kitchen and pantry. (Related: Food storage tips: Keep pests away from your food supplies with diatomaceous earth.) Most of the time, pests get into food back at the processing plant, warehouse, delivery truck or grocery store. Pests can get into products that have been opened, but they can also get into unopened boxes by chewing their way in or crawling through packaging folds and seams. While you can’t see tiny bug eggs with the naked eye, if the food sits in your pantry for too long, the eggs will eventually hatch. The larva will then eat the food in the container. To prevent bugs from infesting your food, you can use simple food storage hacks like adding bay leaves or using certain storage techniques like freezing. Bay leaves Place dried bay leaves in containers with flour, rice, or any stored bulk foods. The fragrance of bay leaves can help deter pests and bugs such as: Freezing If you notice weevils in your food supply, you can kill them and their eggs by freezing them. Freezing is often done with flour. First, place the flour in a freezer bag. Squeeze the bag to let the air out, then freeze the flour for at least 48 hours. This will kill any eggs weevils in the flour. Make sure you don’t freeze flour in the original paper packaging since condensation may occur and ruin the flour. Before repackaging flour in Mylar bags, leave the flour on the counter until it reaches room temperature. Heating Some recommend using heat to kill insect eggs. When exposed to temperatures of just less than 100 F, insect growth will slow. At temperatures of 100 F to 120 F, an insect will die in a day. At temperatures above 120 F, an insect will die in minutes. However, for this method, you will need the help of companies that offer thermal remediation services. Oxygen absorbers Add oxygen absorbers to jars, other airtight containers and Mylar bags when storing pantry staples. You can also use oxygen absorbers when storing food using a vacuum food sealer. Insects require oxygen to survive and removing the oxygen from the container will eventually kill any insects or eggs in it. If you see a package of food that already has bugs in it, take it out of your pantry immediately. For some foods, you may be able to get rid of them and salvage your food supply. If you find bugs or pests in beans or rice, wash and soak for a few minutes. The insects will then float to the top. Rinse the beans or rice grains several times and repeat until you no longer see bugs. Note that you can’t wash cereal or flour if you find bugs in the container. Check other packages to see if the infestation has spread. After confirming that the other items are pest-free, remove the rest of the items. Carefully wipe everything down and make sure you thoroughly clean all the nooks and crannies. Change the packaging and make sure every opened item is in an airtight jar or a plastic Ziplock bag when you are done cleaning. To prevent further infestation, you may need to clean the rest of your kitchen. Don’t let your money and hard work go to waste. Before SHTF, follow the tips below to keep bugs and other pests out of your kitchen and survival stockpile: Clean up messes Many pests enter homes to search for food, but if you don’t feed them, they will go away. Always clean up crumbs and spills on counters, tables, floors and the pantry. Keep the sink free of dirty dishes. If you have pets, pick up their food bowls when they aren’t eating. Take the trash out regularly to keep pests out of your kitchen. Eliminate moisture Keeping your home as dry as possible can also help get rid of pests. Examine and replace leaking pipes or faucets. Make sure drains aren’t clogged and are working properly. Change the water in your pet’s bowl regularly. This can also help avoid attracting bugs. Seal all cracks and gaps Bugs are persistent. If they can find a way inside your home or storeroom, they will try to get into your food supply. Check the interior and exterior of your home for any cracks or holes. Examine areas near doors and windows. Check spots where utility lines or pipes enter your home. Seal all holes with caulk or steel wool and repair or replace damaged window and door screens. Regularly clean cabinets Your cabinets should also be cleaned regularly to deter pests. Set aside time to empty them and wipe down the shelves. Examine all items for signs of pests, including holes, dents or scratches on the packaging. While cleaning cabinets, remove any expired items. Use the right containers One of the best ways to avoid pantry pests is to store items properly. This means transferring all dried food items, including cereal, dried fruit, flour, nuts and rice into sealed containers. Use a sturdy container with a tight-fitting lid. Keep produce in the fridge to prevent fruit flies. If you keep fruit and vegetables out, such as on the kitchen counter, make sure they don’t spoil. Clean your kitchen and storeroom regularly and check for signs of infestations to prevent pests from getting into your survival food stockpile.

https://food.news/2023-04-03-food-safety-warning-contaminated-baronet-cheese-listeria.html,Food safety watchdogs issue warning over contaminated cheese; Brit dies amid listeria outbreak,0,"Advertisement Reports have confirmed that one British consumer died from listeria amid an outbreak linked to contaminated Baronet cheese. Food safety watchdogs recently issued a warning over the potential risk posed by certain Baronet semi-soft cheeses, which they said contained “exceptionally high levels” of the bacteria. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA) advised consumers not to eat the affected products, all of which are made by Wiltshire-based firm The Old Cheese Room. Baronet is a pasteurized semi-soft cheese with a pinkish-orange rind and pungent aroma. The cheese is sold in both small individual rounds and in one-kilogram wheels that can be cut down to order. The cheeses can also be served sliced from a deli counter. According to reports, one recall is for the one-kg Baronet, priced at £32 ($39.50) and with best-before dates of March 21, March 22, April 11, April 12, April 16 and April 18, 2023. The other two recalls are for the 270-gram Mini Baronet, costing £9 ($11.11) and the 200-g Baby Baronet. The Mini Baronet is also being recalled for three batches: March 22, April 10 and April 18, 2023. The Baby Baronet is being recalled for the following batches: March 22, April 4, April 10 and April 16, 2023. British shoppers who think they may have bought one of the affected Baronet items have been urged not to consume the product and to contact their retailer. Additionally, shoppers were warmed to thoroughly clean any surfaces they may have touched to prevent cross-contamination with other foods. In the announcement, the FSA and UKHSA warned that they had found three listeria cases “potentially linked to an outbreak” and that one individual had died. The agencies did not provide any further details of the recorded death. (Related: CDC: Listeria outbreak linked to deli meat and cheese kills 1, infects 16.) According to data, all infected patients had a closely genetically-related strain of listeria that was also found in samples of Baronet cheese. But that does mean that all the reported cases linked to the outbreak contracted listeriosis after consuming Baronet cheese. Listeriosis is a foodborne disease caused by Listeria monocytogenes. People develop an infection called listeriosis after eating food containing listeria. Listeriosis may cause the following symptoms: Listeriosis can go away on its own, but it can be serious among these groups: If you suspect that you are experiencing listeriosis symptoms, report your illness to the local authority. Tina Potter, head of incidents at the FSA, said those with “elderly relatives who may have purchased the recalled items, and who are at particular risk,” should be aware of the recall and observe the advice. Potter noted that certain foods carry a greater risk of listeria than others, such as pate, soft cheeses, smoked fish, chilled sliced meats and other chilled ready-to-eat products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that at least 1,600 individuals get listeriosis annually. The Old Cheese Room claimed that the product recall was only a “precautionary measure” despite the confirmed death. The company also told shoppers to contact them “for a full refund (with or without a receipt).” The cheesemaker also announced that it has stopped making Baronet cheese until they “have found the source of the issue.” You can get listeriosis from eating contaminated foods. The listeriosis incubation period, or the time when you first get infected and when you first experience symptoms, may vary. Usually, it takes one to two weeks, but it can be as short as several days or as long as three months. The following foods may contain listeria: These foods have the highest risk of L. monocytogenes contamination, but listeriosis can affect almost any improperly handled or prepared foods. L. monocytogenes is unique from other foodborne illnesses since it survives and even multiplies in low temperatures, including refrigerators and freezers. Food that has spoiled breaks down and develops an unpleasant odor, taste or change in texture. But when L. monocytogenes bacteria contaminate food, the smell, taste and texture remain the same. Follow the tips below to reduce your risk of getting listeriosis: Prepare food properly and avoid products that have been linked to listeria outbreaks to avoid listeriosis.

https://food.news/2023-04-03-fruit-from-invasive-weed-prevents-skin-aging.html,STUDY: Fruit from invasive weed found to prevent skin aging,0,"Advertisement Gardeners may balk at the sight of weeds in their garden, but researchers have discovered that an invasive weed common in American backyards can help prevent signs of skin aging. According to one study, cocklebur plant (Xanthium strumarium) fruits can help reduce damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) rays and hasten up wound healing in lab studies on human cells. Extracts from cocklebur fruit can also help boost the production of collagen, a protein found in many high-end skincare products that promise to “preserve skin elasticity and prevent wrinkles.” Cocklebur is a weed native to parts of Asia, Europe and North America. It can be found in moist places such as river banks in agricultural land and other areas. Cocklebur is commonly used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Native American Medicine to treat different health issues, from minor complaints like a stuffy nose and headaches to arthritis and tuberculosis. Native Americans used to brew cocklebur leaves to make tea for different conditions, such as kidney diseases, arthritis and tuberculosis. The weed was also used to treat health issues like leprosy, malaria and rabies. The seeds of cocklebur fruit contain carboxyatractyloside, a potent chemical. It can poison and even kill livestock when consumed. For humans, eating cocklebur can cause mild symptoms like an unpleasant taste and nausea. Eating prickly cocklebur can also cause serious symptoms, such as: Even though ingesting parts of the plant causes mild and severe side effects, cocklebur fruit and leaves are often used in traditional medicine. According to researchers from Myongji University in South Korea, extracts from cocklebur fruit can be used as an ingredient for topical skin creams and other cosmetics. Eunsu Song, one of the researchers and a doctoral candidate at Myongji University, explained that “cocklebur fruit has the potential to protect the skin and help enhance production of collagen.” Song added that the fruit may have a synergistic effect when combined with other effective compounds, such as hyaluronic acid or retinoic acid, against aging. (Related: Top 6 anti-aging superfoods you can add to your diet.) For the study, the researchers analyzed the molecular properties of cocklebur fruit extracts and isolated compounds that may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. They also conducted experiments using cells and a 3D tissue model with properties similar to human skin to learn more about how these compounds affect collagen production, wound healing and damage from UVB radiation, particularly the type that causes skin aging, sunburns and skin cancers. According to the study findings, cocklebur fruits grown in South Korea have slightly more potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and greater wound-healing activity compared to fruits grown in China. Cocklebur shows promise as a cosmetic agent by increasing collagen synthesis. The researchers added that cocklebur showed negative results with higher concentrations. While cocklebur fruit isn’t recommended for human consumption, there are superfoods that you can eat to promote skin health. Here are some great anti-aging superfoods to add to your diet: Avocado Avocados are a good source of inflammation-fighting fatty acids that can help keep your skin smooth and supple. Avocados also contain essential nutrients that may prevent skin aging, such as potassium, B vitamins and vitamins A, C, E and K. Avocados are rich in vitamin A that can help you shed dead skin cells, which leaves you with healthy, glowing skin. Carotenoids in avocados can also help block toxins and damage from the sun’s rays, at the same time offering protection against skin cancers. To eat more avocadoes, add them to a salad or your morning smoothie. Blueberries Sweet and tangy blueberries are full of vitamins A and C, along with anthocyanins, which are age-defying antioxidants. Anthocyanins give blueberries their beautiful blue color. These powerful antioxidants may help protect your skin from damage caused by sun exposure, stress and pollution by moderating the inflammatory response and preventing collagen loss. Blueberries are a low-sugar fruit that you can add to your breakfast smoothie or fruit bowl. Red bell pepper Red bell peppers are full of beneficial anti-aging antioxidants. They are rich in vitamin C, which is good for collagen production, and powerful antioxidants called carotenoids. Carotenoids have many anti-inflammatory properties and may help protect your skin from sun damage, pollution and environmental toxins. Slice bell peppers and dip them in hummus as a healthy snack. You can also add bell peppers to a raw salad, or you can add them to a veggie stir-fry. Papaya Papaya is full of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals that may help improve skin elasticity and minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Papaya contains: The antioxidants in papaya can help protect against free radical damage and may delay signs of aging. Papaya also contains papain, an enzyme that offers additional anti-aging benefits by working as one of nature’s best anti-inflammatory agents. Papain is also found in many exfoliating products. Drizzle fresh lime juice over a plate of papaya as part of a healthy breakfast. Watercress Watercress is full of the following vitamins and minerals: Watercress acts as an internal skin antiseptic. It helps boost blood circulation and the delivery of minerals to cells, which can boost oxygenation of the skin. Watercress is full of vitamins A and C, which can neutralize harmful free radicals and help prevent fine lines and wrinkles. Add watercress to your salad for glowing skin and better overall health.

https://food.news/2023-04-03-food-supply-best-beans-long-term-storage.html,Food supply 101: The best beans for long-term storage,0,"Advertisement Preppers know that beans are a must-have for your survival stockpile because they are affordable, versatile and filling ingredients. But did you know that certain kinds of beans have a longer shelf life compared to others? (h/t to PrimalSurvivor.net) White beans, such as butter beans and navy beans, are the best for long-term storage. White beans take only 45 minutes of simmering to cook, compared to 60 minutes or longer for other kinds of beans. The shorter cooking time of white beans is essential in emergencies where fuel conservation matters, especially if your water supply is also running low. While white beans rank number one in the list of the best beans for long-term storage in your stockpile, all beans are good for long-term storage. In fact, when stored properly most beans can last for as long as 25 years or even longer. Ideally, you should store different types of beans so you have a variety of foods to eat when dealing with a long-term survival scenario. Beans are considered a good survival food because they have a very long shelf life. However, dry beans take a longer time to cook. If you plan on stocking up on beans, especially dry beans, you should also stock up on water, along with an emergency stove and extra fuel. When choosing which beans to stockpile, you must consider other factors like cooking time. Even pre-soaked beans take a long time to cook. This might not be a problem if you have a wood stove, but you will still need a lot of fuel if you have to cook beans during a power outage. When cooking beans, you should also measure your ingredients so you don’t have to worry about leftovers. When it comes to cooking time, white beans are your best choice. Red and yellow lentils are also good options since they also cook rather quickly. (Related: Prepping essentials: 11 Forever foods for your food storage pantry.) Listed below is the simmer time (minutes) of different kinds of beans: You should also consider the fat content of beans if you want to stock up on them before SHTF. Even when stored in sealed containers with oxygen absorbers, fat will still go rancid over time, especially if you live in a state with hot temperatures. Fortunately, most beans are very low in fat. However, some beans, like chickpeas and soybeans, have higher amounts of fat. If you live in a hot climate, you might want to choose other beans for your survival supply. Here are two healthy beans and legumes to stock up on before disaster strikes: Garbanzo beans/chickpeas Garbanzo beans, also called chickpeas, are full of dietary fiber and protein. One cup (164 grams) of cooked chickpeas contains 269 calories, 14.5 grams of protein, 4.25 grams of fat, 12.5 grams of fiber, and 45 grams of carbohydrates. The same serving also contains: Research has found that beans and legumes, such as chickpeas, and hummus, a dish primarily made from chickpeas, offers many health benefits. Chickpeas can help reduce post-meal blood sugar and increase insulin sensitivity. A small study found that eating a low-sugar snack with hummus led to a five percent decrease in afternoon blood sugar levels compared with eating granola bars which have a higher sugar content. Eating hummus was also associated with a reduced appetite and decreased snacking on desserts later in the day. Because chickpeas and other legumes are full of dietary fiber and beneficial plant compounds, eating them regularly may also help improve the composition of your gut bacteria. Lentils Lentils are rich in vegetarian protein and can be a good addition to soups and stews. One cup (198 grams) of cooked lentils contains 230 calories, 17.9 grams of protein, 0.752 grams of fat, 39.8 grams of carbs and 15.6 grams of fiber. The same serving also offers: Lentils are one of the best sources of iron. Iron is a trace mineral that your body needs to make hemoglobin, a protein in your blood that transfers oxygen. Adding lentils to meals can help boost iron intake, which may be beneficial for vegans and vegetarians since they may be at risk of iron deficiency anemia. Additionally, lentils can help reduce blood sugar. In a study that involved 48 healthy adult volunteers, replacing half of the carbs from rice or potatoes with carbs from cooked lentils resulted in significant decreases in post-meal blood sugar levels. In another study that included more than 3,000 participants, researchers reported that people with the highest intake of lentils and other legumes had the lowest rates of diabetes. Lentil sprouts may also help heart health by reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL or “bad”) cholesterol and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL or “good” cholesterol. If you are on a tight prepping budget, stock up on dry beans since they are often very cheap. To save money, choose the cheapest beans. As of writing, these are the cheapest beans and lentils: Lastly, when choosing which beans to stockpile for emergencies, consider how you will use them. Beans are a versatile ingredient. White beans are usually considered the most versatile and you can use them to make dips, spreads and sauces. White beans can also be used to make traditional bean recipes like casseroles. Soybeans are another versatile bean and you can use them to make soymilk and tofu. When gathering supplies for your stockpile, make sure you don’t waste your money by buying emergency foods you don’t like or eat in your daily life.

https://food.news/2023-04-03-food-dyes-damage-dna-structure-cause-cancer.html,Research shows food dyes can damage DNA structure and cause cancer,0,"Advertisement According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), common food dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5 are made from petroleum and pose many health risks. The health risks linked to these artificial colors in food include hyperactivity in children, allergic reactions and cancer. Back in 2008, the CSPI petitioned the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban the use of harmful food dyes. The British government and the European Union took action to help end the use of dyes throughout Europe. Unfortunately, at least 15 million pounds of food color additives are still sold annually in the United States. These food dyes are used to make food more appealing and increase sales as a result. Adding to the issue of harmful food dyes is the mindset of consumers preferring food that they think looks “fresh and attractive.” Sadly, this food misconception is held by many shoppers in the country. (Related: Candy carcinogens: Petroleum-based additives are being used in popular children’s candy.) Several food dyes have already been banned because of the health problems associated with them. But some are still permitted by the FDA. According to research, some of these food dyes, like Red No. 3, can damage DNA in human liver cells and disrupt the function of the thyroid. Parents should also think twice when buying groceries because children who consume food with Red No. 3 are at greater risk for a lifetime of health problems. Additionally, children’s foods often have the most dyes in them. Michael F. Jacobson, CSPI’s executive director, warned that food dyes are synthetic chemicals that do not improve the nutritional quality or safety of foods. Instead, these dyes only “trigger behavior problems in children and, possibly, cancer in anybody.” The FDA has not done much to eliminate Red No. 3 from the food supply. The agency recognized its potential to cause cancer as early as 1985, and banned it from any products that go on the skin. However, food dyes are still being used in foods and many of Big Pharma’s medications. In September 2012, the International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine reported that Red Dye No. 3 causes cancer in animals, which suggests that the same thing could happen to humans. Data also suggests that some dyes consumers are often exposed to are carcinogenic. Yet, pressure from the food additive industry keeps the FDA from banning these dyes altogether. Data from the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology revealed that certain consumable dyes can harm the pituitary gland and sperm in humans. This means food dyes can harm your mental and physical health, as well as your reproductive health. Red No. 3 (erythrosine) is a cherry-red coloring that is often used in candy, popsicles and cake-decorating gels. Meanwhile, Red No. 40 (Allura Red) is a dark red dye that is used in candy, cereals, condiments and sports drinks. It is made from petroleum and is approved by the FDA for use in foods and drinks. According to research, artificial food dyes are linked to hyperactivity, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some studies have also suggested a connection between the consumption of products with food dyes and increased ADHD or hyperactivity in children. Foods that contain red food dye Red dye 40 is one of the most popular color additives. Most food products that come in a package are processed and often contain food dyes such as red dye 40. When buying groceries, check the ingredients list for red dye 40, which can also be listed as: You should also keep in mind that ingredients are listed on food labels by weight. Foods that commonly use red dye 40 include: To avoid dyes, you should take note of the foods that you are purchasing that have dye in them, then try a healthy alternative. If your kids love cereal that contains food dye, find one that doesn’t. Then explain to your family why you made the switch. You should also tell teach your family to read labels to avoid food dyes. It can be hard to determine the exact cause of certain side effects because red dye is commonly used with other food additives that may also lead to symptoms. Potential side effects of the food dye may include: Additionally, red dye 40 contains benzene, a known cancer-causing substance. If you suspect that your child has a red dye allergy, screen for red dye 40 intolerance at home. First, try eliminating all foods with red dye 40 for one or two weeks. This can result in an improvement in behavior. However, it might be hard to confirm how the dye affects your children until you reintroduce foods containing the dyes and observe their reactions. Remember that medication for children, like chewable tablets or liquid cough syrups, can also contain food dyes. To avoid the dyes, opt for dye-free versions. These dangerous food dyes are in too many products that both children and adults consume, yet most consumers don’t think twice about consuming or using them. Take action now and protect your loved ones from the health problems linked to food dyes like cancer before it’s too late. Watch the video below to know more about the dangers of eating foods and medications that contain food dyes. This video is from the Take Control of Your Health! channel on Brighteon.com.

https://food.news/2023-03-29-foraging-101-the-universal-edibility-test.html,Foraging 101: The universal edibility test,0,"Advertisement As a prepper, it’s important to get your preps ready for different survival scenarios. This means even if you have a bug-out bag, you should take the time to learn how to forage for wild edible plants. If SHTF and you lose your gear or run out of supplies, knowing how to conduct the universal edibility test can help you find wild herbs and plants that are safe to eat. (h/t to TruePrepper.com) The universal edibility test will guide you through a detailed process to determine which plants or plant parts are safe to eat. While the test may seem tedious, doing each of these steps properly ensures that you can stay safe and avoid poisonous plants while trying new plants. Through the test, you will gradually expose yourself to the plant in a controlled manner. It will also help you monitor any symptoms that may develop between exposure. This wilderness survival skill will be useful both in the wild and in your own backyard after dealing with a long-term scenario where your food supply may run out. If you are planning to do the universal edibility test, focus on a plant that you can harvest a lot of. The universal edibility test is a thorough and lengthy process, and the last thing you want to do when your supplies are running out is to waste time doing it if you don’t have plenty of the plant you are testing. Start by putting all the plant parts into separate piles for testing: Make sure you try each part of the plant separately since some components could be toxic while others are edible. One example is rhubarb, where the plant stalks are edible but the leaves are toxic. You should also check the plant you forage. It must be in good shape, not rotting and doesn’t have any insects in this step. (Related: Prepper foraging tips: 6 Wild lettuce lookalikes to avoid.) Picking a part of the plant that you can harvest a lot will help make sure that the time you spend on the test is worth it. If the plant you select has an unpleasant odor, do not eat that part of the plant. Strong or acidic smells should be avoided. Avoid any plant or part that smells like almonds since that is an indicator of a toxic compound. Touch a piece of the plant to your wrist for 15 minutes. If you experience itching, burning or numbness, do not eat that plant part. Wait for eight hours until moving on to the next step to check for the development of rashes or other reactions. Do not eat anything during this step. If you want, you can cook the pieces of the plant for this. Prepare it as you would eat other vegetables. Cooking plants is preferred because some plants are toxic when eaten raw, but not when cooked. Once the plant part is prepared, touch it gently to your lips to test for any burning, itching or numbness. If you experience any of these side effects in the next three minutes, do not eat that part of the plant. Once you confirm that you can safely touch the plant to your skin, try placing a small portion of the plant in your mouth. Place the plant on your tongue for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, chew the plant and then hold it in your mouth for another 15 minutes without swallowing. If the plant tastes soapy or bitter, spit it out. Do not eat that part of the plant. Swallow the plant part. Wait for at least eight hours for any adverse reactions. If you don’t notice any negative side effects, prepare at least 1/3 cup of that plant part and eat it. If you have no reaction after waiting another eight hours, then that part of the plant is edible. Keep in mind that you need to repeat this entire process for all of the parts of the plant. In some cases, the entire plant could be edible, but some plants may have select parts that are edible. Here are more tips that can help you forage for wild edibles safely when SHTF: Do your research When foraging for plants, make sure you can identify a plant properly before touching or consuming it. Improve your foraging skills by attending plant walks with an expert, studying basic botany, cross-referencing different illustrated and updated guidebooks, or using educational websites. Familiarize yourself with the area Study up on the area you plan to forage. Read up on poisonous or endangered plants that grow there, and find out what edibles are abundant. Avoid locations near factories, golf courses, roads, or places where the water and soil could be contaminated. Look for off-trail areas away from human activity, which are usually safer. Harvest responsibly Check local land management guidelines for any harvesting or foraging limits. Forage only in areas and amounts that are permitted so you don’t get in trouble. Take only what you need and leave enough for the wildlife and for regrowth. This means taking no more than five percent of one species in a certain area. Look for edible weeds When foraging, look for weedy patches where edible species grow in abundance. Look for edible weeds like dandelion and nettle. Walk lightly Be mindful of your impact when venturing off the trail while foraging. Leave no trace and walk on durable surfaces like logs and rocks. Avoid trampling other flora as you explore an area. Read up on poisonous plants and mushrooms Once you learn how to recognize edible plants, take the time to also learn how to identify poisonous plants. Some poisonous plants can give you a rash, but others could kill you if you consume enough of them. Learn how to recognize the traits of toxic species, especially those that look similar to edible and medicinal plants. If you want to save time, buy and review an illustrated edible plant guide. Remember that the universal edibility test does not work for mushrooms or other types of fungus. If you want to forage for mushrooms, get a mushroom guide. Learning about local plants using a guide may be easier, but knowing how to test a plant’s edibility is a useful skill for any prepper. Visit GreenLivingNews.com to read more articles about foraging.

https://food.news/2023-03-29-hersheys-remove-toxic-metals-linked-to-cancer.html,Hershey’s CFO says company will remove TOXIC metals linked to CANCER in its chocolates,0,"Advertisement Hershey’s CFO Steve Voskiul has announced that the company will be removing the toxic heavy metals found in their chocolate. This announcement comes after Consumer Reports tested Hershey’s chocolate and discovered traces of lead and cadmium in the chocolate. Studies have revealed that these heavy metals can cause cancer and reproductive health problems when ingested. Consumer Reports revealed last year that “dark chocolate bars contain cadmium and lead – two heavy metals linked to a host of health problems in children and adults.” Consumer Reports conducted a test on 28 different chocolate brands to find out which ones contained these heavy metals. The shocking results revealed that all chocolates contained heavy metals, but Hershey’s dark chocolate bar contained the most amount of lead – 265 percent more than California’s maximum allowable dose level. Lily’s, another chocolate brand from Hershey’s, was rated “high in lead” and “high in both lead and cadmium.”‘ Lily’s “Extra Dark Chocolate” bar tested for 144 percent in lead and their “Extremely Dark Chocolate” bar tested at 143 percent lead and 101 percent more cadmium than the allowable dose level. Consumer Reports warned that “heavy metal poses particular concerns and no amount of it is considered safe.” (Related: Dr. Bryan Ardis says compound from licorice root may stop hyperclotting caused by venom peptides.) Voskiul insisted that cadmium and lead are found in Hershey’s products because the metals are naturally occurring minerals in agriculture that get transferred into the product via cocoa beans. Still, the fact remains that out of the 28 brands tested, Hershey’s had some of the highest levels of lead and cadmium. Consumer Reports focused on the dark chocolate bars made by Hershey’s at the end of 2022. The organization cautioned that they “contained possibly harmful levels of lead, cadmium or both for people who eat more than one ounce per day.” The three bars mentioned weigh in at 1.45 ounces and 2.8 ounces. This announcement has led to a class action lawsuit against the Hershey company for its “deceptive and misleading business practices.” The plaintiffs argued that Hershey’s didn’t disclose on the products’ packaging that the chocolates contained lead and cadmium. Lead is a dangerous metal, especially when consumed by pregnant women and children. Researchers also warned that there is no level of lead that is safe. Tunde Akinleye, the CR food safety researcher who led the testing project, explained that consistent, long-term exposure to small amounts of heavy metals can result in many health problems. The danger is greatest for pregnant women and young children because heavy metals can cause developmental problems, affect brain development and result in lower IQ. There are also health risks for people of any age. For example, frequent exposure to lead in adults may cause hypertension (high blood pressure), immune system suppression, kidney damage, nervous system problems and reproductive issues. According to the lawsuit, children, specifically those younger than six, are prone to lead poisoning that can lead to developmental and health problems. Cadmium is also mentioned as a product that is used in various materials like batteries, pigments, metal coatings and plastics. The metal is also found in cigarette smoke and is known as carcinogenic to humans. With the news about Hershey’s chocolate containing toxic heavy metals, it’s better to make changes to your snacking habits. The cacao bean that’s used to make chocolate is full of heart-healthy flavonols and antioxidants. According to a study, people with hypertension who consumed chocolate bars with at least 70 percent cacao showed improved blood vessel flexibility. Follow the tips below to make sure that the chocolates you eat are actually good for you: Check the ingredients list When buying chocolate, read the ingredients list. Like other food products, fewer ingredients are usually better. Keep in mind that true chocolate is made with only cacao beans, cocoa solids and sugar. Buy products that are at least 70 percent cocoa or cacao The higher the percentage of cocoa or cacao, the less sugar the chocolate contains. A bar that is 70 percent cocoa or cacao (the terms are often used interchangeably on labels) will have 30 percent sugar. A bar with 85 percent cocoa or cacao will contain only about 15 percent sugar. Dark chocolate contains at least 50 percent cacao, has a more pronounced chocolate flavor and is a good source of heart-healthy flavanols and antioxidants from the cacao. Milk chocolate, or chocolate products with 49 percent or less cacao, also contains milk solids and additional sugar, resulting in a sweeter taste. Despite the name, white chocolate does not contain any cacao, only sugar, milk solids and cocoa butter. If a bar is not labeled with a percentage, this means it’s probably full of sugar. Avoid chocolate with ingredients like artificial colors or flavors and high-fructose corn syrup. Research has found that a chocolate bar with 70 percent cacao offers health benefits, and that 85 percent dark chocolate can help boost your mood. Read up on good and bad additional ingredients Additional ingredients like nuts, which contain healthy fats, can add more nutritional benefits to chocolate. On the other hand, flavors like caramel only add extra sugar and have no nutritional value. Choose chocolates with lower sugar Try looking for chocolates with only eight grams or less per ounce. Bars sweetened with agave, coconut sugar, dates or honey are fine, but those sweeteners still contain calories that will elevate your blood sugar. If you have diabetes, look for products made with sugar alternatives such as stevia. Follow recommended serving sizes While dark chocolates are considered a healthy treat, read the nutrition facts and know the recommended serving. Try to stick to one to two ounces of chocolate per day. Visit Ingredients.news to learn more about other harmful ingredients lurking in processed foods.

https://food.news/2023-03-27-nutrient-therapy-helps-with-mental-health-issues.html,Brain food: Nutrient therapy can help address mental health issues,0,"Advertisement Health experts have made significant advances in researching and treating mental health problems. But despite the development of new medications to control various mental health issues, mental illness is still a persistent issue in America. It is common knowledge that following a balanced diet is key to maintaining overall health and well-being. Researchers have found that nutrient therapy may offer benefits for those with mental health issues. In 2019, the Pan American Health Organization reported that mental health issues “are the single largest cause of disabilities in the world.” These pertain to disorders such as anxiety, depression, dementia and alcohol abuse. Fortunately, research into the root causes of mental health issues points to promising solutions. For example, the Walsh Research Institute has made significant breakthroughs in terms of understanding the biochemistry behind anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia. While mental illness remains a significant issue, health experts are hopeful because of promising research into nutrient-based therapy protocols and other alternative solutions that may one day revolutionize mental health care. (Related: Food for the brain: Review examines the link between diet and mental health.) According to the Walsh Research Institute, most mental health diseases are associated with the balance of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin. People diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, schizophrenia and other behavior disorders have a chemical imbalance. While chemical imbalance may not cause your mental illness and may be a concurrent result of other factors or arise due to mental distress, they can be used as a potential avenue for treatment. In modern medicine, medications designed to increase serotonin levels in the brain are based on the assumption that an imbalance is causing depression. Unfortunately, these drug interventions have produced very limited success and an alarming list of potential adverse effects. If you have mental health issues and are looking to avoid the side effects of pharmaceuticals like antidepressants, you should consider nutritional interventions, which are generally much safer. Addressing specific nutrient needs can help alleviate many health conditions since these deficiencies can cause systemic issues. At the same time, the nutritional basis for treatment is different from current pharmaceutical interventions. Advanced nutrient therapy was founded by Dr. William Walsh of the Walsh Research Institute and is based on research data on more than 20,000 patients with various mental health issues. These patients have all undergone biochemical mapping. Nutrient therapy is purely nutrition-based and helps give people a deeper understanding of their struggles. Research in the field of nutrient therapy has helped experts develop new, nutrient-based therapy protocols and other alternative solutions that expand beyond the realm of medication and psychotherapy. As the science behind biochemical mapping continues to improve, researchers are one step closer to learning how to dial in specific nutritive solutions for mental health issues that suit each person’s specific needs without relying on medications. But many mental health issues aren’t only based on nutrient deficiencies or biochemical issues. Some patients may develop depression and anxiety due to significant changes in their social environment and daily lives. This means treating mental illnesses also involves addressing social issues. Nutritional interventions are a relatively safe treatment for mental health issues, but they also come with potential side effects. Excessive storage of certain nutrients in the body could be more damaging and cause severe physical and mental health issues. One such nutrient is copper. Research has found that elevated copper levels can drastically affect dopamine and norepinephrine production, resulting in hormone imbalance. Several mental and behavioral health issues, such as ADHD, anxiety, autism, depression, poor concentration and learning difficulty, may be linked to high copper levels. When prescribing nutrient-based treatment, health experts often avoid “enriched” foods that might contain copper and those that contain it naturally, such as organ meats. For the last few years, researchers have found that earlier studies are behind over-generalizations in medicine, diet, nutrition and medication recommendations. Through a growing understanding of epigenetics and biochemistry, scientists have discovered that all individuals have a unique biochemical makeup and highly personalized nutritional needs. And when those needs aren’t met, your physical and mental health may suffer in various ways. Because of the stark genetic differences in how different bodies process foods, following the traditional “food pyramid” or sticking to a generalized diet may cause a deficiency in much-needed nutrients or an overflow in others. Even if you don’t have mental health issues, these tips can help improve your physical and mental well-being: Follow a balanced diet and improve your eating habits to help boost your mental health.

https://food.news/2023-03-16-can-you-eat-processed-foods-anticancer-diet.html,Health and nutrition: Can you eat processed foods while following a diet to reduce cancer risk?,0,"Advertisement Following a balanced diet and eating a variety of nutritious foods is key to maintaining your overall health. But can you eat processed foods while following a diet to reduce cancer risk? Karen Collins, a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN), takes a closer look at the role of processed foods when following a diet to reduce cancer risk. Almost all food is processed in some way. This even includes cooking and chopping “whole” foods. But when you’re talking about processed foods, the real debate involves products called commercially processed foods, especially items that are more highly processed or items referred to as “ultra-processed” foods. Studies use this system to differentiate between processed foods: Minimally processed foods These foods contain no added fats, salt, sugar or other additives. They include the “natural edible food parts of plants and animals.” Examples: Processed foods Processed foods contain fat, salt, sugar or additional starch ingredients added to a minimally processed food. They are usually not eaten on their own but are used to prepare minimally processed foods. Examples: Ultra-processed foods Ultra-processed foods are made with industrial equipment and ingredients that break down whole foods like fruits and vegetables and combine them with other ingredients, usually ingredients not found in your kitchen. This processing produces foods with an extended shelf life that are ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat. Unfortunately, some “hyper-palatable” foods are made with fine-tuned combinations of fat, salt and sugar that trigger your brain’s reward system in ways that make you want to eat more. (Related: Study: Ultra-processed foods linked to increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease.) Examples: The list shows how the category of ultra-processed foods covers a wide range of products. This is one of the reasons that making sense of research on ultra-processed foods and cancer risk gets complicated. There are many studies about possible adverse effects of ultra-processed foods on people’s health. Weight Consuming a lot of ultra-processed food as a whole category is linked to a greater likelihood of weight gain, increased waist size and greater risk of being overweight and obese. One research, which involves cross-sectional studies, can’t establish whether eating more ultra-processed food actually caused weight gain. But the link is observed in prospective studies that show changes in someone’s weight, waist and body mass index (BMI) over time. Compared to those who consume the least ultra-processed foods, people who ate the most are more likely to become overweight or obese. If they are already overweight, they are more likely to develop obesity. Cancer and heart disease Ultra-processed foods that increase obesity risk can also inherently increase the risk of developing chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease that are linked to health issues like obesity. Additionally, ultra-processed foods could raise health risks independent of weight gain. This means some may influence factors like your blood pressure, blood sugar spikes, insulin levels and the gut microbiome. However, after adjusting for weight, evidence from human studies is inconsistent regarding the link between ultra-processed food consumption and chronic disease. This is due to how hard it is to separate the influence of ultra-processed foods from the quality of the overall dietary pattern. The high consumption of ultra-processed foods may also affect lifestyle and socioeconomic factors that are linked to the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. For reduced cancer risk, the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) recommendation to limit processed foods focuses on foods that promote weight gain. Analysis for AICR’s Third Expert Report found that foods high in fats, added sugars or refined grains promote weight gain when consumed frequently or in large portions. Follow the AICR’s recommendations below to improve your eating habits: As a dietitian trying to provide advice about healthy eating, Collins is worried about messaging that wraps up a wide range of foods under one umbrella term of processed foods. These foods are not all the same and she recommends limiting your intake of processed foods high in sodium. While you don’t have to completely give up refined grains like Italian bread or juice, you have to make sure you don’t let processed foods with reduced fiber and nutrient content make up the bulk of your diet. When processing removes valuable nutrients or most of the fiber in food, choose the ones that you enjoy the most in moderation. Balance this by giving less-processed foods like fruits and vegetables the largest part of your plate. If budget or time and food prep is an issue, choose processed foods that can make healthy eating easier and more attainable. Healthy eating doesn’t mean eating only whole foods. It means choosing the foods and portions that help you create overall eating patterns that promote overall wellness. If you want to follow a diet to reduce cancer risk, don’t let sensational headlines distract you from the overall picture of what research shows about how healthy eating patterns can reduce cancer risk.

https://food.news/2023-03-15-food-safety-6-ways-avoid-bacterial-infection.html,Food safety tips: 6 Ways to avoid bacterial infection at home,0,"Advertisement Avoiding bacterial contamination is important when handling and cooking food. You need to make sure everything is hygienic, and that things like food are protected from possible bacteria, to prevent the spread of illness and infections. Avoiding bacterial contamination is even more important when you are dealing with a survival scenario, where you will likely have fewer resources if something goes wrong. Bacterial contamination is the contamination of food via bacteria. Contamination occurs when bacteria multiply within the food, causing it to go bad. If you eat food that has been contaminated, you will get sick. For example, food poisoning is caused by bacterial contamination. Preventing bacterial contamination is important, especially in a post-SHTF world where you have limited resources and limited access to medical services. Handling food carefully ensures that you can avoid bacterial contamination as much as possible. Most establishments and services that sell food to the general public are required by law to abide by many health and safety guidelines designed to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination in food. But in your everyday life, especially at home, you must be careful and take the right steps to lower the chances of you contaminating your food, and becoming ill from it. (Related: Abbott Nutrition’s infant formula was recalled after claims of bacterial contamination, infant deaths.) These factors can affect just how sick you get because of a bacterial infection: Prevent food poisoning by following these six tips to avoid bacterial contamination: Wash your hands thoroughly Your hands touch different things and surfaces throughout the day, and some of these things have also been touched by other people. Unfortunately, even if you practice proper hygiene, you can’t say the same for others. Bacteria is everywhere, from your smartphone to door handles. Always wash your hands before and after preparing and cooking food so any bacteria you might be carrying doesn’t transfer onto the food that you are going to eat. Washing your hands is also important if you’re dealing with raw food. Use antibacterial soap in your kitchen and wash your hands often. Be careful when handling and preparing raw food Raw food contains different bacteria, and some of them can be bad and cause food poisoning. This is one reason why most foods need to be cooked since your body won’t be able to process the number of bacteria on raw food. Store raw food separately from the rest of the food when buying groceries. If possible, place raw food into a different shopping bag from the rest of your items. When preparing raw food, wash your hands and the surfaces. This ensures that no other food comes into contact with the liquids of the raw food. Avoid dirt Dirt can contain many harmful substances and bacteria that might contaminate the food you touch. Even if you’re not dealing with food, if you get dirty or touch dirt, you should wash your hands. Otherwise, you risk transferring that dirt onto your skin, or to sensitive areas such as your mouth or eyes, which can then cause bacteria to infect you. Wash your hands regularly and keep your hands and face free from dirt. Maintain proper hygiene in bacteria-prone environments Bacteria will thrive and spread quickly in certain environments. Be careful of bacteria-prone environments and avoid storing food in them to prevent contamination. For example, bacteria reproduce a lot faster at room temperature and in places that have high levels of moisture and in which mold can grow. You should store food either in the refrigerator or in a dark and dry cupboard where it won’t be exposed to moisture. Always follow the directions on labels and packaging to make sure you are storing food correctly. This helps prevent food spoilage. Lastly, never eat something that has gone out of date. Avoid cross contamination Cooking can be stressful and chaotic, and if you’re not experienced, it can become overwhelming. This is one of the reasons why cross contamination happens often: It is easy to accidentally forget and reuse the same surface. Cross contamination occurs when you mix cooked food with raw food or place something cooked on a surface that was used for cutting raw meat, like raw chicken. When this happens, the bacteria from the raw food will spread to the cooked food. This can happen accidentally, like when you are using the same cutting board to cut raw meat then chopping vegetables with a dirty knife. Stay calm and organized while preparing food, especially raw meat, to prevent cross contamination. Avoid cross contamination by always using a clean cutting board. If possible, have separate cutting boards for fresh produce and another one for raw meat, poultry and seafood. Once cutting boards become excessively worn or develop hard-to-clean grooves, replace them. Don’t wash chicken and other raw meat Don’t place raw chicken under running water to wash it. This is unnecessary since you’re going to cook the chicken, so the bacteria will die. Washing raw meat is also discouraged because this just leaves traces of the raw chicken all over the sink. Small bits of the chicken can also splash onto other surfaces around the kitchen, which can then cause bacterial contamination. Maintain proper hygiene and be careful when handling raw meat to prevent bacterial contamination. Watch the video below for tips on how to maintain food safety in a cafeteria.

https://food.news/2023-03-15-consistent-intermittent-fasting-remission-patients-with-diabetes.html,Study: Consistent intermittent fasting can cause remission in over 50% of patients with Type 2 diabetes,0,"Advertisement According to a study, intermittent fasting may offer significant health benefits for those with Type 2 diabetes. Researchers who conducted the study found that the dietary intervention resulted in complete remission for more than half of the study volunteers. Details of the study were published in the AAA Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism. Intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating is an eating plan that involves consuming calories only during a specific “window” of time, which is often for periods of eight to 10 hours. Fasting means your body naturally gets fewer overall calories. The fasting state also causes: These changes in your hormones are also linked to an increase in your metabolic rate. These factors of intermittent fasting can also help with weight loss. There are several ways to do intermittent fasting, such as skipping meals and eating only during a certain time. You can also restrict your calorie intake on certain days of the week and eat normally on other days. The most common intermittent fasting diets include a 16-hour daily fast, a 24-hour fast on alternate days, or a two-day-a-week fast on nonconsecutive days. For the study, researchers observed volunteers with Type 2 diabetes who followed an intermittent fasting routine for three months. The patients experienced significant improvements in their condition. Scientists revealed that an impressive 90 percent of the 36 patients were able to reduce their prescribed treatments, such as insulin and blood sugar-lowering medications. At least 55 percent of the participants experienced total remission. They remained free of Type 2 diabetes for at least one year after discontinuing their medications. Remission is defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels under 6.5. HbA1c is a measure of blood sugar control over time. Dongbo Liu, the study’s lead author, thinks the study results can offer significant benefits for the more than 537 million adults across the globe with Type 2 diabetes. “Type 2 diabetes is not necessarily a permanent, lifelong disease,” explained Liu. (Related: Intermittent fasting helps reduce inflammation, scientists find.) But how did intermittent fasting help the participants with diabetes? Researchers found that fasting was beneficial due to the body’s sleep-wake cycle or circadian rhythms. They suggested that following a “consistent daily short window of feeding” can improve someone’s well-being by helping to align the circadian rhythms of multiple organs. This then helps the body with the coordination of different processes and helps to manage diseases. They also warned that chronic circadian rhythm disruption, which shift workers often go through, may compromise the immune system. The disruption also increases the risk for chronic metabolic diseases by triggering various health issues like weight gain, glucose intolerance and fatty liver disease. The study on intermittent fasting and Type 2 diabetes built on earlier research that looked into the benefits of intermittent fasting. According to data, intermittent fasting can also help reduce body weight, even though volunteers are not usually instructed to consciously reduce caloric intake. Recent human studies also suggest that time-restricted eating can help reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes. Experts also think that intermittent fasting can help improve glucose sensitivity, lower high blood pressure, reduce inflammation and decrease unhealthy cholesterol levels. According to an animal study published in the journal Cell Metabolism, time-restricted eating influences gene expression in a way that can help manage diseases. Results of the animal study revealed that at least 40 percent of the genes in the animals’ adrenal glands, hypothalamus and pancreas were affected, which is promising because these organs have an important role in hormonal regulation. Intermittent fasting offers benefits for people with Type 2 diabetes, but the researchers highlighted that “maintaining a consistent, long overnight fast can significantly reduce the risk of chronic disease.” Individual recommendations vary, but the eating window that is often between eight and 12 hours long should not “open” until at least one hour has passed after waking. The eating window must also “close” at least three hours before the onset of an eight-hour sleep cycle. The scientists emphasized that consistency is important and that those with Type 2 diabetes should maintain the same schedule on workdays and weekends. If you have Type 2 diabetes, consult your physician before starting intermittent fasting. The following foods should be part of a balanced diet if you have Type 2 diabetes: The following lifestyle habits are also key for diabetes prevention and management: Lui advised that diabetes remission is possible if those with the disease try to lose weight by changing their diet and exercise habits. If you have diabetes, trying intermittent fasting can help you manage your condition and improve your overall health. If you have diabetes, here are some things to do before trying intermittent fasting: Consult your doctor Talk to your physician before starting intermittent fasting. This is important because this will help you finalize a safe approach and adjust any of your medication doses as needed. You should be twice as careful if you are on insulin because if you’re on it and restrict your eating, you may be at a greater risk of low blood sugar. This is bad because it can result in dizziness and confusion, along with life-threatening symptoms such as seizures, or loss of consciousness. If left untreated in people with diabetes, low blood sugar or hypoglycemia can be fatal, warned the American Diabetes Association. Devise a plan that works for you Intermittent fasting plans vary depending on various factors. Some people may restrict calories two or three days a week or limit eating to certain periods of the day. There are also stricter plans that include fasting for up to 36 hours at a time for seven or 14 days, but the latter isn’t ideal if you have Type 2 diabetes. Whatever your IF plan is, you need to find one that you can stick with long-term because consistency is key for your future health. Prepare for side effects Intermittent fasting may cause uncomfortable side effects like cramps, constipation, diarrhea or headaches, especially if you are not used to the time-restricted eating plan. You should also listen to your body. If you don’t feel fine, stop fasting. Intermittent fasting can make you hungry, but you shouldn’t be lethargic or start throwing up after you change your eating habits. Eat nutritious foods You may be eating less food, but you still need to follow a balanced diet that includes whole, unprocessed foods, such as non-starchy vegetables, protein and healthy fats. You should also take a multivitamin and drink lots of water to prevent dehydration and headaches. Following a balanced diet will help you lose or manage your weight and keep your blood sugar steady as you fast. Keep your expectations in check While intermittent fasting offers many health benefits, it doesn’t work for everybody and your medical team may not recommend it if you aren’t well enough to try it. Always consult your doctor before trying intermittent fasting because going for long periods without eating if you have Type 2 diabetes can be dangerous. In some cases, it might not offer benefits for you. Get support Once you confirm that you can safely try intermittent fasting, you can follow the plan with your family or a friend. You can also join an online community or social support network so you can motivate each other to stick with it.

https://food.news/2023-03-09-study-broccoli-kale-microgreens-are-nutritious-superfoods.html,"Study: Broccoli and kale microgreens are nutritious superfoods, but their phytonutrient levels vary depending on growth conditions",0,"Advertisement Microgreens are used as gourmet ingredients in upscale restaurants, but dishes from these places are often more expensive compared to meals made with common ingredients. To save money, gardeners and home cooks have learned how to grow microgreens at home. But despite their “superfood” label, the levels of healthful compounds like phytonutrients in most varieties of microgreens are unknown. To address this, scientists conducted a study about these small but nutrient-rich superfoods. Their findings show that kale and broccoli microgreens grown on either windowsills or under commercial growing conditions are full of phytonutrients, but the levels of some compounds may vary “considerably” between the two different environments. Details of the study were published in the journal ACS Food Science & Technology. Many health enthusiasts have started growing different microgreens on their windowsills. Some of the most commonly planted varieties of these small seedlings are from the Brassica family, which includes vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, kale and mustard. The mature, fully-grown versions of these vegetables are full of vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals. According to the study, environmental conditions can impact the plants’ nutritional contents. (Related: Grow microgreens in your own home with these simple steps.) However, not much is known about the levels of these compounds in young microgreens. In a previous study, Pei Chen, Thomas Wang and colleagues discovered that red cabbage microgreens had higher amounts of phytonutrients that have antioxidant and anticancer properties compared to full-grown vegetables. But similar assessments haven’t been done on other Brassica seedlings. In a recent study, scientists set out to measure the levels of polyphenols and glucosinolates in broccoli and kale microgreens. They then compared data from those grown on windowsills to those grown in commercial growth chambers. To observe the differences, scientists placed trays of newly planted broccoli and kale seeds either on a windowsill in natural sunlight or inside a temperature- and humidity-controlled, refrigerator-like growth chamber with artificial sunlight for 12 hours a day. Following 10 full days after seeding, the researchers harvested the plants and measured the phytonutrient content using a liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry system. The data showed that the broccoli and kale microgreens were rich in polyphenols and glucosinolates regardless of how they were grown. The research team also found that there was considerable variability in the amounts of individual compounds when comparing the two growth environments. To illustrate, three flavanol compounds that contribute to the plant’s dark color and bitter taste were higher in windowsill-grown microgreens. On the other hand, chamber-grown plants had higher levels of two glucosinolates, which are antioxidant- and anticancer-related compounds. The researchers found that, overall, the growth environment for kale and broccoli microgreens affects the abundance of individual phytonutrients and this could affect their flavor and potential health benefits.

https://food.news/2023-03-07-fernleaf-biscuitroot-medicinal-herb-used-1918-influenza.html,Treat symptoms of colds and flu with fernleaf biscuitroot – a medicinal herb used by Native Americans during the 1918 influenza epidemic,0,"Advertisement If you’re trying to avoid the adverse effects of over-the-counter medication for the common cold and the flu, consider using fernleaf biscuitroot (Lomatium dissectum) This natural anti-viral herb can be used to help treat symptoms of colds and flu caused by viral infections. It is often administered in tincture form and is a powerful microbial. (h/t to ReadyNutrition.com) Fernleaf biscuitroot is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial used to address the symptoms of viral infections. It is a species of flowering plant in the carrot family. The herb is also known by the common name fernleaf biscuitroot. The plant is native to much of western North America and it grows in different habitats. The perennial herb can reach up to 1.4 meters tall and it grows from a thick taproot. Fernleaf biscuitroot is a medicinal plant commonly used in Native American cultures. The potent antiviral plant was used by Native Americans during the 1918 influenza epidemic. According to a report from the University of California, the herb “may prove to be a strong modern-day cold and flu remedy.” (Related: Prepper medicine: How to use chokecherry, a versatile medicinal plant.) In an article about fernleaf biscuitroot, experts reported that the Native Americans called the medicinal root of this plant “the Dortza” or “heap powerful medicine.” The natural medicine is extracted from the hard root and turned into a tincture. The Washoe Indians collected fernleaf biscuitroot in the months of September and October, which was when the richest supply of oils was concentrated in the large underground root. According to data, the aromatic root contains at least five or six gums, oils and oleoresins. After collecting the plant’s root, slice longitudinally to expose the volatile oils to the oxidizing (polymerization) effects of the air. This then converts the oils to a stabilized resin. Here are some of the culinary uses of fernleaf biscuitroot: The plant’s antiviral action is derived from the volatile oils in the root. These oils can help clear respiratory issues that are present in viral infections because of inflammation like cough, sore throat and a stuffy and runny nose. Fernleaf biscuitroot was used to address the secondary infections caused by many strains of influenza. To use fernleaf biscuitroot as an antiviral treatment for cold or flu symptoms, take one-fourth teaspoon of the tincture every three to four hours for five days in one cup of hot water. Make sure you keep track of your usage on a dosing chart. If you can’t grow fernleaf biscuitroot in your home garden or forage for it, you can also buy tinctures to treat cold or flu symptoms if you are sick.

https://food.news/2023-03-07-8-science-based-health-benefits-olive-oil.html,8 Science-based health benefits of olive oil,0,"Advertisement Olive oil is a superfood powerhouse and scientific data proves that it is worth all the hype. This cooking oil is flavorful and full of healthy fats. When incorporated into a balanced diet, olive oil can offer many benefits, such as supporting gut health and protecting against heart disease. Olive oil is a type of fat that comes from olives. There are different types of olive oil, but all of them are made through a process that involves washing, crushing, milling and pitting olives to extract their oil. The finished product contains a combination of beneficial compounds such as fatty acids, polyphenols and vitamin E, all of which can help boost your overall well-being. Olive oil is a main component of the Mediterranean diet, a healthy eating plan traditionally followed by people who live in countries along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Countries that follow the diet include Greece, Italy, Spain, North Africa and parts of the Middle East. (Related: Regular olive oil consumption found to reduce mortality risk.) Balanced diets incorporating olive oil have been shown to support health in different ways. Various studies have also identified special compounds in olive oil that have beneficial protective effects on the body. Here are eight of the most impressive science-backed health benefits of olive oil. Olive oil contains various compounds that help regulate inflammation in the body such as the polyphenols hydroxytyrosol (HT) and hydroxytyrosol acetate (HT-ac). These compounds help inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways and reduce the upregulation of inflammatory enzymes like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Data from a 2015 review of 30 studies published in the journal Nutrients revealed that using olive oil daily in doses ranging from one milligram to 50 mg significantly decreased levels of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 compared to control treatments. Olive oil naturally contains anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds like polyphenols that help fight against atherosclerosis or the buildup of plaque in the arteries. Olive oil compounds help minimize oxidative stress and improve blood vessel function. Additionally, olive oil helps decrease the production of inflammatory molecules like adhesion molecules2, which has a large role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. According to a 2021 article published in the journal Stroke, those with heart disease who followed an olive oil-rich Mediterranean diet for seven years had decreased atherosclerosis progression compared to people on a low-fat diet. Data suggests that diets rich in olive oil can also help boost high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lower high blood pressure. This is why olive oil intake is often associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. Data from a 2021 study in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology revealed that U.S. adults who consumed more than seven grams of a one-half tablespoon of olive oil per day had a 14 percent lower risk of heart disease compared to those who didn’t consume olive oil. Olive oil is mostly composed of monounsaturated fatty acids. It is also low in saturated fats, so it remains liquid at room temperature. While olive oil’s high content of unsaturated fats means it can support heart health, following a balanced diet is key to disease prevention. Maintaining a healthy balance of bacteria in your digestive tract is crucial for your well-being. According to research, using olive oil may help reduce disease-causing bacteria and stimulate the growth of protective bacteria. Olive oil can also help boost the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs are a byproduct of the bacterial fermentation of fiber. SCFAs fuel intestinal cells and strengthen the gut lining. These fatty acids also help fight against inflammation. Data from human studies revealed that diets rich in olive oil can help boost levels of beneficial lactic acid bacteria (LAB). On the other hand, animal studies have shown that olive oil consumption may help shift the gut-bacteria ratio in a way that prevents colon cancer. According to a 2022 study published in the journal Nutrients, those people with mild cognitive impairment who were supplemented with 30 mL of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) per day for six months experienced significant improvements in behavioral and clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores. Scientists who conducted the study reported that the EVOO also helped boost the function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a barrier between the blood vessels of the brain and the brain tissue that prevents harmful substances from reaching the brain. The breakdown and dysfunction of the BBB have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease. Research has also found that the use of olive oil may reduce the accumulation of amyloid plaques linked to the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s. Olive oil’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties make it an ideal choice for people with Type 2 diabetes. Diets rich in olive oil can help reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes and olive oil supplementation may help improve certain health parameters in individuals with the condition. A 2017 review in the journal Nutrition and Diabetes revealed that people with the highest intake of olive oil have a 16 percent reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes compared to people with the lowest intake. The 2017 review also revealed that olive oil supplementation significantly reduced the long-term blood sugar control marker hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting blood sugar in those with Type 2 diabetes compared to those in the control groups. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble nutrient that acts as an antioxidant in the body and helps protect cells against oxidative damage. The vitamin also have crucial roles in immune function and cellular communication. However, many people’s diets don’t include enough of this essential nutrient. According to research, at least 90 percent of men and 96 of women in America have insufficient intake of vitamin E. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), one tablespoon of olive oil provides around 20 percent of the recommended intake for vitamin E. But studies show that the vitamin E content of olive oil varies significantly depending on factors like the type of olive the oil was derived, the ripeness of the fruit and the climate where it was grown. This is why you need to use high-quality olive oil. A 2022 article from the International Journal of Trichology showed that olive oil can help nourish hair by providing protection from sun damage, moisturizing the hair cuticle and soothing the scalp. Olive oil may also help heal small wounds and burns. The oil also has occlusive properties, meaning it can help seal water on the skin. Note that the oil itself is not moisturizing. Unlike other cooking oils, olive oil is safe to use every day. Research has found that those who regularly consume olive oil have a lower risk of health conditions like heart disease and obesity. If you’re not sure how to choose high-quality olive oil, experts recommend buying organic, cold-pressed extra virgin olive oils. Here are some healthy ways to incorporate olive oil into a balanced diet: Store olive oil in a cool, dark place like your pantry. Heat and sunlight can make the oil degrade and this can result in unpleasant changes in its taste and aroma. Visit Superfood.news to learn more about superfoods that help boost overall health.

https://food.news/2023-03-06-how-to-ensure-drinking-water-is-safe.html,Hydration and health: How to ensure that your drinking water is safe,0,"Advertisement Drinking enough water every day is important because this will help you stay hydrated. But how can you tell when water from the tap is safe to drink? If you are worried about your family’s health and the water quality in your area, read on to learn how to make sure that your drinking water is safe. With recent catastrophic events like the Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and its effects on the environment, many people are wondering if their water is safe to use and drink. Detailed below are tips that will help you avoid common sources of water contamination and how to keep drinking water safe. Public water systems or municipal systems in the U.S. provide water that is considered one of the safest in the world. The quality is regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. Succeeding laws set the drinking water standards for chemicals known to be in some municipal water systems. (Related: Scientists challenge WHO draft guidelines for PFAS in drinking water.) Unfortunately, municipal water contamination is more common in systems serving fewer than a thousand people. A lot of older municipal systems also have lea?d-?containing pipes. These pipes should be replaced with non-lead alternatives as soon as possible. If you’re worried about the quality of your local water system, check with your municipality about the system’s construction. You can also call your local public health department to check. Private wells aren’t federally regulated. If you have a well on your homestead, you need to regularly test the water for coliform bacteria, nitrates and other environmental toxins like aluminum, arsenic or uranium. Consult local, state and tribal authorities because they can provide testing guidelines. If you want to test your well water, public health departments will sometimes test well water for free. Keep in mind that both municipal water systems and private wells are vulnerable to contamination. Some water contaminants to watch out for include: Local water companies are required to give annual reports about what is in the water. Remember the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Safe Drinking Water Information Hotline (1-800-426-4791) and Emergency Response Hotline (1-800-424-8802). Call these numbers if you have any questions about the water in your area or if you need to report an oil or chemical spill. Homesteaders or preppers with private wells should have well water tested for coliform bacteria and nitrates yearly. Testing for other contaminants should be done after at least every three years. Some private wells may require reverse-osmosis filtering systems. If your well has been contaminated, contact an expert in well construction and repair. If you are concerned about the quality of your plumbing, run the faucet for three to five minutes each morning before using the water for cooking or drinking. This helps flush the pipes and lessens the probability of contaminants being present in the water that you use. Contact the local water department to see if the standpipe from the water main to your house contains lead. If it does, make sure it is replaced immediately. Clean your faucet’s screen or aerator regularly. Debris, lead and sediment can build up in the aerator and contaminate the water. If you think your drinking water has been contaminated with bacteria and other germs, boil it for at least one minute, then set it aside to cool. However, boiling does not remove toxic chemicals and may even concentrate some chemicals. If your water has an off-taste or odor, get a point-of-use filter made with activated carbon or other absorbent material to help address these issues. Alternatively, you can use filters that will help remove some harmful chemicals in the water. Using cold water for cooking and drinking will help prevent exposure to contaminants that can build up in hot water heaters. If you have babies at home, test well water for nitrates before giving it to infants. When dealing with an emergency and you don’t have access to clean drinking water, you can buy bottled water. But if you don’t have bottled water in your pantry or stockpile, you can boil water, use chlorine bleach, or use iodine to treat non-potable water to make it safer to drink. Boiling water The most common method of treating water is to boil it. Boiling water for a sufficient time will kill microbes. This method can also help get rid of some toxic chemical contaminants. Use a stovetop burner or electric kettle to boil water. Place the non-potable water in a pot. Place the pot on a burner or electric kettle and heat the water to a rolling boil. Keep the water at a rolling boil for at least one minute. Set the water aside and let it cool down before pouring it into a clean container for use. Chlorine bleach Unscented household bleach can help kill bacteria in the water if boiling water isn’t an option. Bleach contains chlorine, the chemical used to make municipal water supplies potable. The water this produces is called chlorinated water. If the water is cloudy, filter it through a cloth before treating it. Add 1/8 teaspoon (eight drops) of unscented household bleach to one gallon (16 cups) of water. Mix the water and bleach well. Set the water aside for at least 30 minutes before drinking it or cooking with it. You can also use bleach to sanitize the containers that you will use to store water. Make a sanitizing solution of one teaspoon of bleach in one quart (four cups) of water. Pour the solution into the container or wipe it inside the container to coat it. Let the sanitizing solution sit for 30 seconds, then pour it out. Allow the container to air dry, or rinse it with treated water. If the water is contaminated with a chemical, disinfectants will not make it safe to drink. Iodine Iodine solution, crystals or tablets are often used by hikers who need to treat water in their water bottles while on the trail. Iodine can kill viruses and bacteria and is easy to use. However, it is not effective against more resistant organisms such as Cryptosporidium. One downside of iodine is that it gives water a noticeable aftertaste. If you have iodine, follow the directions provided on the product. The amount used will vary for iodine solutions, crystals and tablets. Use warm water whenever possible. Add the iodine to the correct amount of water in your container. Mix the iodine well with the water. Make sure some of the solution also coats the lid and threads if you are storing the treated water in a screw cap bottle. Set the water aside for 30 minutes after the iodine has fully dissolved before using it. If the water is cold (below 40 F), wait for at least one hour before using it. Using bottled water Use bottled water as a last resort, such as when there is known contamination of the source. Bottled water is expensive and it generates a lot of plastic waste, which is another environmental contaminant. Depending on the brand, bottled water may be tap water that has been carbon filtered. Some bottled water manufacturers promote their brands as being UV-filtered, to assure consumers that bacteria has been removed. Some manufacturers may also say that bottled water has been through water distillation or the reverse osmosis process. Before drinking bottled water, check the container for any signs it has been previously opened and refilled. Check the expiration date if it has one and check the bottle carefully for cracks. If you are not sure about the safety of the water, boil or treat bottled water before drinking it. Visit Tapwater.news for more information about tap water in the United States.

https://food.news/2023-03-03-turn-trash-can-into-a-root-cellar.html,Food storage tips: How to turn a trash can into a root cellar,0,"Advertisement Root cellars are ideal if you need an effective method for long-term food storage and preservation. It will help keep food fresh and protect your stockpile from spoilage, pests and other common threats. If you have the budget, you can build a large root cellar on your property to maximize storage space. But if space or money is an issue, you can build a simple root cellar with a new trash can and some dirt. (h/t to AskAPrepper.com) Follow the steps below if you want to make a root cellar using a trash can. (Related: Prepping skills: 15 Food storage and preservation methods to learn before SHTF.) You will need: Steps: Choose the site for your root cellar Try to locate a spot that never gets direct sun. If you decide on an area with soft ground, it will be easier to dig the hole quickly. Avoid a low-lying area because heavy rain could cause a temporary dam or large puddle that will submerge your drum and ruin the food inside. Turn the can upside down and use the power drill to carefully make several ventilation holes in the bottom of the trash can. Place the trash can or steel drum Mark the outermost circumference of the drum and clean any weeds in the area for approximately one foot in width. Start digging the hole. Make sure the trash can’s top six to 12 inches is above the soil line. You will create a shoulder so the trash can be entirely isolated, but raising the lid will ensure that the trash can does not become submerged. Measure the depth you need to gain on the shovel’s handle. This can help you keep track as you continued to set up the trash can root cellar. Cover the trash can in plastic sheeting then place it put in the hole You can use an old paint drop sheet as a protective “tube” for the can or drum. Place the covered trash can inside the hole. Cover the entire top of the drum so none of the dirt ends up inside the drum. Cover the trash can to protect against water damage Once the trash can is secured, cover it with corrugated sheeting and old shade netting to keep the water away and hide it from looters. Shade net is a lightweight knitted polyethylene fabric that helps protect plants from the sun. Its material is rot- and mildew-resistant and it doesn’t become brittle. Shade net is water permeable and it offers superior ventilation, making it a great addition to your trash can root cellar. You also need to make sure that the trash can root cellar is hidden well so others won’t be able to find it when supplies become scarce. Root cellars are a great way to store and preserve food on your homestead. The underground room will provide a dark environment that helps maintain the freshness and nutritional value of the food in your stockpile. Once you learn how to control the temperature and humidity in a root cellar, you can slow down or stop food perishability altogether. This makes even a small trash can root cellar one of the best ways to stockpile food for long-term storage and emergency preparedness. The darkness in the root cellar will also help protect the food from sunlight, which can accelerate the breakdown of food nutrients. Typical items stored in a root cellar include: You can also use a root cellar to store other food items like butter, cheese, eggs, beer and wine. Plan ahead and rotate your supply regularly to keep food and items in the root cellar fresh. If you have a backup power source on your homestead, you can also store food in a fridge. If you store fresh produce that has not been dried, moisture inside the trash can or steel drum may cause issues. Generally, a root cellar needs proper ventilation to maintain a proper temperature and humidity level. Good air circulation helps prevent mold, mildew and other organisms that cause spoilage from developing on stored food. Without proper ventilation, the air in a root cellar can become stale, which creates a hospitable environment for these organisms. Proper ventilation can help prevent root vegetables like potatoes and onions from sprouting in the root cellar. If you build a root cellar in an extra room on your property, you can achieve proper ventilation by using a fan to move air in and out. For a garbage can root cellar, you can install a small vent or drill holes at the top of the root cellar or at the bottom of the garbage can. If you cannot provide any ventilation for the trash can root cellar, take additional steps to dry the air inside it. Do this by adding completely dry wood shavings or newspaper inside a root cellar to wick up moisture and dry the air. Alternatively, you can use straw or hay. Wood shavings can absorb moisture, making it easier to maintain the desired humidity levels. Use newspapers to line surfaces or shelves inside the root cellar. The newspaper will help absorb water. Both materials are inexpensive, so they are ideal for building a root cellar on a budget. Once you install the trash can root cellar, keep these tips in mind to extend the shelf life of food that you will store in it: Shake off loose dirt from vegetables instead of washing it off. Many root-cellar vegetables store better this way, but leaving them wet can encourage rot. Carrots and beets are easy to store. Brush off any loose dirt, clip foliage back to about an inch above the root and store the vegetables in boxes of moist sand or peat moss. Handle vegetables carefully. Even slightly rough treatment can cause invisible bruising, which makes the produce start decomposing. Stock a root cellar as late in the season as possible. If possible, chill the produce in the fridge before putting it in the trash can root cellar. Several vegetables like onions, potatoes, pumpkins and winter squash must be “cured” for several days in warm temperatures before going into storage. Most fruit “breathes,” but others like apples and pears must be wrapped in paper to slow the release of ethylene gas. This gas can cause spoilage in other produce in the root cellar. Check your vegetables regularly. Remove vegetables with any signs of rot to ensure that the rest of the produce in the root cellar isn’t also going bad.

https://food.news/2023-03-01-healthy-blood-sugar-sweet-potato-pumpkin-soup.html,Support healthy blood sugar levels with this delicious sweet potato and pumpkin soup,0,"Advertisement Blood sugar isn’t just something people with diabetes monitor. Your blood sugar levels are also important if you are pregnant or want to maintain your overall well-being. Blood sugar balance is linked to other factors like your energy levels and mood. There are many ways to maintain healthy blood sugar levels, like staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, doing regular exercise and following a balanced diet. There is no specific diet that supports healthy blood sugar, but preparing meals that feature a balancing trio of protein, fats and fiber-rich carbohydrates can help slow the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. One way to do this is by making a comforting and delicious sweet potato and pumpkin soup with peanuts. The recipe below is inspired by a West African peanut soup. This soup is made with fiber-rich vegetables, plant-based protein and good fats that help support heart health. (Related: Craving a sweet potato-based dinner? Try these 5 easy and nutritious recipes.) Ingredients for 8-10 servings: Preparation: If you have diabetes, you can eat a balanced, healthy diet without giving up your favorite foods. If you want to achieve an effective diabetes diet, you must focus on moderation and make careful food choices to maintain healthy blood sugar levels. For example, eating carbohydrates makes your body release insulin. This hormone helps your body use and store these carbohydrates, lowering blood sugar levels. But if you have diabetes, your body doesn’t release or use insulin as it should. In turn, this makes your blood sugar levels remain high. If you have diabetes, talk to your doctor or dietitian before making any significant dietary changes. Eat non-starchy vegetables Non-starchy vegetables should be part of a balanced diet, especially if you have diabetes. There are two main types of vegetables: starchy and non-starchy. Starchy vegetables are full of carbs, which can raise your blood sugar levels. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends eating at least three to five servings of vegetables each day. One serving is defined as half a cup of cooked vegetables or one cup of uncooked vegetables. Here are some non-starchy vegetables to add to your diet: Most vegetables are sold fresh, canned or frozen. If you are consuming raw vegetables, it is easy to roast and steam them. You can also cook vegetables in moderate amounts of olive oil to get more healthy fats into your diet. Eat whole-grain foods Whole grains are a healthy alternative to highly processed or refined grains because they contain the endosperm, bran and germ of a grain. Refined grains only contain the endosperm and they offer less nutritional benefits. Whole grains also contain more dietary fiber while refined grains only include the starchy part of the grain. Eating the starchy endosperm alone may cause your blood sugar levels to rise rapidly. Look for products with 100 percent whole-grain ingredients. Include these whole grains into your diet: Incorporate whole grain products into meals or snacks to help manage your blood sugar levels. Eat fatty fish Fatty fish like herring, mackerel and salmon are full of protein and omega-3 fatty acids. The high protein content is particularly healthy if you have diabetes since it has a low impact on your blood sugar. It is filling and provides essential nutrients to help your body grow and repair. Eating foods rich in omega-3s may also help reduce your risk of heart failure and support cognitive function. If you have diabetes, try adding fatty fish to your diet twice per week. When preparing fatty fish, avoid using sugary marinades and grill or steam the fish instead of frying it. Follow a balanced diet and eat nutritious food to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.

https://food.news/2023-02-28-seafood-omega-3s-help-prevent-kidney-disease.html,Eating seafood high in omega-3s helps protect against kidney disease,0,"Advertisement Not sure what to make for lunch? Try featuring seafood in your main dish. According to new research conducted by an international team of scientists, eating seafood and oily fish full of omega-3 fatty acids may help lower the risk of developing kidney disease. While plant-based foods also contain omega-3s, consuming seafood regularly was also found to help slow down declines in kidney function. Details of the study were published in The BMJ. According to data, at least 700 million people worldwide have chronic kidney disease (CKD), a condition that increased the risk of kidney failure and death. The results of animal studies have linked omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) to maintaining kidney function. However, the data from human studies remain unclear. Unlike animals, whose diets are strictly monitored, human diets differ from person to person. Additionally, there may be some human error when it comes to over- or underestimating how much of one food someone eats. But despite limited human evidence, current nutritional guidelines recommend the consumption of a healthy amount of seafood and fatty fish. To learn more about the link between human health, seafood consumption and omega-3s, the study authors reviewed 19 studies from 12 countries that measured n-3 PUFA biomarkers in adults and their risk of CKD. The biomarkers included: EPA, DHA and DPA come from seafood but ALA is found in plants like leafy green vegetables, nuts and seeds. (Related: Curcumin found to slow chronic kidney disease progression.) The researchers assessed the risk of chronic kidney disease by estimating the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which shows how well the kidneys eliminate waste and excess fluid from the blood. A normal eGFR is 90 to 120 ml/min/1.73 m2. Upon examining data from 19 studies, the researchers discovered that 4,944 volunteers (19 percent) developed chronic kidney disease during an 11-year observation period. After excluding other factors like age, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, smoking and other health conditions, the findings revealed that seafood helped reduce the risk of kidney disease by at least eight percent. On the other hand, omega-3s in plant-based foods were not linked to a lower risk of chronic kidney disease. According to the scientists, the study results are only observational and they can’t directly link omega-3s in seafood to better kidney health. They added that there may be other factors connected to kidney disease that they did not consider. “Although our findings do not prove a causal relation between seafood n-3 PUFAs and CKD risk, they are supportive and consistent with current clinical guidelines that recommend adequate intake of seafood as part of healthy dietary patterns, especially when seafood replaces the intake of less healthy foods,” concluded the study authors in a media release. The researchers said confirming the benefits seafood offers in preventing chronic kidney disease will require more randomized clinical trials. If you already have kidney disease, you need to watch what you eat and drink because your kidneys cannot remove waste products as they normally should. A kidney-friendly eating plan can help you stay healthier and slow down damage to your kidneys. These tips are for people who have Stages 1 to 4 of chronic kidney disease and are not on dialysis. Different people will have different nutrition needs. If you are not sure where to start, consult a dietitian to create a kidney-friendly eating plan that suits your dietary needs. A kidney-friendly eating plan can help protect your kidneys from more damage. This diet will also include foods that are easy on your kidneys and limit other foods and beverages so certain minerals in those foods, like potassium, don’t build up to high levels in your body. Your kidney-friendly eating plan may change over time, but it will always give you the right amount of these three essential nutrients: Make sure you get the right amount and the right types of protein Not getting enough protein can result in weak skin, hair and nails. On the other hand, consuming too much protein can make your kidneys work harder, which can cause more damage. This happens because when the body uses protein, it produces waste products that your kidneys have to filter. To ensure your overall health, you may need to adjust how much protein you eat. The amount of protein you need depends on your activity level, body size and health. Check with your doctor or dietitian to see if you need to limit protein or change the type of protein you eat. Choose the right types of fat Fat gives you energy and helps you utilize some of the vitamins you get from your food. Fat from food is also essential for your well-being. However, too much fat can cause weight gain and heart disease. Limit fat in your meal plan and choose healthier fats like olive oil when cooking. Choose whole grain carbohydrates Eating too many carbs may also cause weight gain. When you have kidney disease, it’s better to eat whole grains and healthy carbs like fruits and vegetables. Unhealthy carbs include hard candies, honey, sugar, soda and other sugary beverages. Eat the right amount of calories Your body needs calories for energy. Calories come from the carbs, fat and protein in the foods you eat. How many calories you need depends on your age, size, gender and activity level. If you need to lose weight, you may need to adjust how many calories you eat. Some people will need to limit the calories they eat while others may need to have more calories. Choose and prepare foods with less salt Sodium (salt) is a mineral found in almost all foods and it has crucial roles in various bodily functions. The amount of sodium found naturally in foods is enough to keep a healthy level in your body, but eating packaged foods and adding salt to your meals can lead to eating too much sodium. Too much sodium can make you thirsty and make your body hold onto water, which then results in swelling and an increase in your blood pressure. Too much sodium can cause more damage to your kidneys and make your heart work harder. If you have kidney disease, you may benefit from limiting your sodium intake. Generally, you should consume less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day. You can limit sodium by avoiding salt and using more herbs and spices to season dishes while cooking. If possible, use fresh or frozen vegetables instead of canned vegetables. If all you have is canned vegetables, drain and rinse them to remove extra salt. When eating out, ask your server to tell the chef not to add any salt to your meal. Follow a balanced diet and eat seafood rich in nutrients like omega-3s to boost your kidney health.

https://food.news/2023-02-27-decipher-packaged-food-labels-avoid-harmful-ingredients.html,Learn how to decipher packaged food labels and avoid harmful ingredients,0,"Advertisement Processed foods are convenient and affordable, but many of these products contain various ingredients that are hard to pronounce. Chemical-sounding ingredients like sodium or calcium propionate are often linked to adverse health effects. They can increase your risk of developing health problems like obesity or diabetes. Learn more about natural and artificial additives to protect your family from the potentially harmful side effects of various common food ingredients. According to a 2021 survey from food safety and nutrition nonprofit International Food Information Council (IFIC), at least two-thirds of Americans prefer foods made with “clean ingredients.” But aside from fresh produce and other raw foods, the term clean ingredients are open to broad interpretation, particularly since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t have a formal definition for the use of “natural” on food labels. The IFIC survey also revealed that many consumers are paying more attention to ingredient lists. They are also choosing clean ingredients and avoiding chemical-sounding ingredients. “When these respondents were asked how they define clean ingredients, ‘not artificial or synthetic’ was the top choice,” reported IFIC. Dietitian Anna Rosales, senior director of government affairs and nutrition at the Institute of Food Technologists, a food science group, said understanding food ingredients can help consumers make better food choices. However, what seems like a simple task can become confusing because various products list scientific names on ingredient labels “as required by regulations.” While any listed ingredient is FDA-approved or classified “generally regarded as safe,” the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups have expressed concerns about the agency’s approval processes and effects on children’s health. Experts are also worried about the different chemicals used in extracting food ingredients from natural sources. In a 2022 IFIC survey, over 80 percent of American consumers reported that they regularly have shelf-stable, canned or other packaged foods on hand in their pantries. Even if you are meticulous about following clean-label diets, it’s difficult to avoid all unfamiliar food additives in certain products. Read on to learn more about common food additives and their potential side effects. Acidulants are common acids used in food to enhance flavor and preserve flavors. Common acidulants include: All acidulants are naturally occurring, but they are often chemically synthesized for use in food products. Benzoic acid and other acids preserve food by making food and drink more acidic, in turn making them a hostile environment for unwanted organisms. All acids can be sourced from either plants or human-made. While acids are widely viewed as safe, some ingredients like benzoic acid may cause allergic reactions. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) are synthetic antioxidants used to prevent rancidity. According to the FDA, these chemicals are safe in food in low doses. However, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) gives an “avoid” rating to BHA and TBHQ and “caution” to BHT due to cancer risks. Dietary fiber has a crucial role in digestion and gut health. But according to data, almost all Americans don’t get enough dietary fiber. Fiber is isolated from fruits, vegetables, grains and other plants, but some forms can be synthesized and added to food. Fibers can also help thicken, emulsify, gel or change the texture of food. The FDA has only recently recognized some types of fiber as sources of dietary fiber that were all already recognized as safe. This is why more “prebiotic” products containing inulin and other fibers are being sold. Depending on the person, some fibers may be more likely to cause side effects like gas and bloating than others. Common sources of fiber added to foods that are often derived from plants include: While less common, these fibers are often plant-sourced and still regarded as safe: The CSPI warned consumers to “cut back” on polydextrose and the FDA requires a label over a potential laxative effect if more than 15 grams per serving are present. Nitrites and nitrates are naturally occurring in the environment and in some foods. They are often used to preserve meats and enhance their color. According to the National Cancer Institute, a high intake of nitrites or nitrates can increase the risk of cancer. Potassium benzoate naturally occurs in cranberries and is commonly added to sodas. Combining potassium benzoate with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and heat or light produces the carcinogen benzene. But as a preservative, potassium benzoate doesn’t carry proven health risks beyond possible allergic reactions when consumed sparingly. Potassium sorbate is one of the most common chemical preservatives and it helps prevent spoilage without changing other qualities in food. Aside from other than rare allergic reactions, studies have not identified health hazards for humans when less than 25 milligrams of potassium sorbate per kilogram of body weight are consumed. (Related: Toxic ingredients in oral care products linked to health issues.) Processed foods may include naturally sourced or synthetically produced preservatives to prevent the growth of mold, bacteria and other microorganisms. Some brands claim that their products are “preservative-free” or “‘nitrate-free” to ease concerns that consuming too much of any of these ingredients may have adverse side effects. Other products may list the origin of their preservatives. To avoid preservatives, you can look for products that are pasteurized, canned or frozen. Sodium or calcium propionate is often used in baked goods to prevent mold. It has been considered safe even at relatively high levels, but a Harvard University study linked propionate to increased risk of obesity and diabetes. In 2018, McDonald’s removed propionate from its buns. Sulfur dioxide is used to prevent discoloration in dried fruit or prevent bacterial growth in wine. The use of sulfites such as sulfur dioxide, to preserve fresh fruits and vegetables has been banned by the FDA for over 35 years. Sulfites also cannot be used on foods that contain vitamin B1. While sulfur dioxide is regarded as safe for most people, you should avoid it if you have asthma or sulfite allergies. These ingredients have also been linked to adverse health effects and allergies in some people. Carrageenan is derived from red seaweed and it acts as a thickener, emulsifier and preservative in various food products. Common sources of carrageenan include almond milk, coffee creamers, cottage cheese, ice cream and dairy-free products like vegan cheese. According to an animal study, exposure to carrageenan increased levels of fasting blood sugar and glucose intolerance, especially when combined with a high-fat diet. Test-tube and animal studies have also revealed that carrageenan can trigger inflammation. Data suggests that carrageenan can negatively impact digestive health. It may also be linked to the formation of intestinal ulcers and growths. One small study showed that when people in remission from ulcerative colitis took a supplement containing carrageenan, they experienced an early relapse than participants given a placebo. Mono- and diglycerides are emulsifiers commonly used found in bake mixes, margarine and other foods. While the FDA and other organizations have not linked these ingredients to negative health outcomes, they can contain trace amounts of trans fats. Data suggests that trans fats can increase bad cholesterol and reduce good cholesterol. Propylene glycol has different uses. It can modify flavors and textures and retain moisture. The FDA limits the amount of propylene glycol that can be added to food because toxicity can occur at high levels. When consumed in small amounts, studies have not found health effects for those who are not allergic to the ingredient. Review food labels to avoid harmful ingredients like nitrates and propionate.

https://food.news/2023-02-27-intermittent-fasting-key-to-addressing-diabetes-pandemic.html,Study: Intermittent fasting is key to addressing diabetes pandemic,0,"Advertisement Health authorities have been warning since 2017 that Type 2 diabetes has achieved pandemic status. Diabetes has spread from affluent industrialized nations to emerging economies such as Africa, Asia and Latin America. Experts have also warned that worldwide cases of the disease can reach 642 million by 2045. Fortunately, one study has found that intermittent fasting may be key to addressing the diabetes pandemic. Researchers have discovered that intermittent fasting led to complete remission for more than half of the study volunteers. Details of the promising study were published in the Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism. Intermittent fasting, also called time-restricted eating or Chinese Medical Nutrition Therapy (CMNT), involves consuming calories only during a specific “window” of time, usually eight to 10 hours. In the small study, researchers found that volunteers with Type 2 diabetes who followed an intermittent fasting routine for three months saw “dramatic improvements in their condition.” The scientists reported that 90 percent of the 36 patients were able to reduce their prescribed treatments, including insulin and blood sugar-lowering medications. (Related: Intermittent fasting helps reduce inflammation, scientists find.) Additionally, 55 percent of the study volunteers experienced total remission. They remained free of Type 2 diabetes for at least one year after discontinuing their medications. For the study, remission is defined as HbA1c levels under 6.5. HbA1c is a measure of blood sugar control over time. Dongbo Liu, the study’s lead author, is hopeful that the results can help benefit more than 537 million adults worldwide who have Type 2 diabetes. “Type 2 diabetes is not necessarily a permanent, lifelong disease,” explained Liu. But how did intermittent fasting benefit the study participants? According to the researchers, the method’s success is linked to the body’s circadian rhythms or sleep-wake cycle. They concluded that following a consistent daily short window of feeding can promote health by helping to align the circadian rhythms of multiple organs. In turn, this helps the body coordinate different processes and aids in the management of diseases. They also warned against chronic circadian rhythm disruption, similar to what shift workers go through, because it compromises the immune system and increases the risk for chronic metabolic diseases by triggering adverse effects such as fatty liver disease, glucose intolerance and weight gain. The new study supports earlier research that emphasized the benefits of intermittent fasting. Research has found that the diet helped reduce body weight even though study participants aren’t normally advised to consciously reduce their caloric intake. Recent human studies have produced promising results on time-restricted eating and its ability to reduce the risk of health issues such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Experts think intermittent fasting can also help: In a different animal study published in the journal Cell Metabolism, scientists reported that time-restricted eating changes gene expression and may offer benefits for managing diseases. Based on the results, almost 40 percent of the genes in the animals’ adrenal glands, hypothalamus and pancreas were affected. This is important because these organs are crucial for hormonal regulation. Intermittent fasting is based on the theory that maintaining a consistent, long overnight fast can significantly help reduce the risk of chronic disease. While individual recommendations vary, the eating window, which is normally between eight and twelve hours long, shouldn’t begin until at least one hour has passed after waking. The eating window should then end at least three hours before the onset of an eight-hour sleep cycle. The study authors advised that consistency is key when practicing intermittent fasting. This means if you start the diet, you should try to maintain the same schedule on both workdays and weekends. If you haven’t tried intermittent fasting yet, check with your physician if it is safe for your condition before starting. If you are taking prescribed medications for diabetes, do not stop taking them unless your doctor explicitly recommends it. While the study suggests that intermittent fasting offers impressive benefits for reversing Type 2 diabetes, the diet may also present some risks for people with the condition. If you use insulin or medications and suddenly eat much less than you normally do, you may experience hypoglycemia, a condition where your blood sugar can drop too low. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), hypoglycemia can cause the following symptoms: If you have diabetes, intermittent fasting can also increase your risk of developing hyperglycemia or high blood sugar. Hyperglycemia can happen if you eat more than you normally do, which can happen if you’re very hungry after intermittent fasting. High blood sugar levels can increase the risk of these diabetes complications: Before starting intermittent fasting or other weight loss plans, check in with a member of your diabetes care team, such as a dietitian or a physician, to make sure it’s safe for you. When done safely, intermittent fasting may offer some benefits if you have diabetes. If you are diabetic and the diet helps you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight, you may eventually be able to reduce the amount of diabetes medication you take. Other potential benefits of intermittent fasting for diabetes include: If you already have Type 2 diabetes, experts recommend managing your condition by eating these nutritious foods: If you want to prevent Type 2 diabetes before it starts, follow a balanced diet and avoid fried foods along with sugary and heavily processed foods and beverages. Getting enough sleep and exercising regularly can also help protect against diabetes. “Diabetes remission is possible if patients lose weight by changing their diet and exercise habits,” advised Liu. While these recommendations are commonly given regardless of your disease, trying intermittent fasting can help you reach your health goals.

https://food.news/2023-02-22-storing-white-brown-sugar-for-long-term.html,Stockpiling tips: How to store white and brown sugar for the long term,0,"Advertisement Sugar is a staple ingredient for any survival stockpile. Knowing how to store it properly ensures that white sugar and brown sugar will last as long as possible in your stockpile if you’re prepping for a long-term survival scenario. (h/t to AmericanPreppersOnline.com) Check out the tips below if you want to learn how to store sugar long-term. You can store sugar indefinitely if you do it correctly. Doing this ensures that when SHTF, you have access to a versatile ingredient in your emergency food shortage stockpile. Sugar has an almost unlimited shelf life. It doesn’t support microbial growth as long as it’s not exposed to other elements. Keeping sugar dry ensures that it won’t go bad even if you don’t use it for a long time. Remember these tips when storing sugar long-term: If you decant sugar from its original container, write the expiry date from the original packet and the date that you transferred it to another container. This will make it easier to track your supplies and decide which container of sugar needs to be used up first. While you can refrigerate or freeze sugar, it’s not recommended unless you have a pest problem getting into your supply. Because there are different kinds of sugar, you need to know how to store them correctly. White sugar is a popular option if you want to buy sugar in bulk. It’s cheaper than other types of sugar and more widely available in larger quantities. The amount of white sugar you buy will depend on the amount of storage that you have. If you buy white sugar in larger quantities, such as two kilograms or more, you can decant them into other containers for long-term storage. One option is to portion them into smaller containers or resealable plastic bags so it’s easier to divide them into different places like a bug-out bag or emergency food stockpile. (Related: Prepper essentials: 50 Emergency items to stock up on before disaster strikes.) Keep in mind that decanting sugar exposes it to the air and possibly moisture. Before you decant sugar, make sure new containers are sterilized and completely dry before transferring the sugar. If you want to keep white sugar in the original paper bag that it comes in, you need to store this paper bag in an airtight container to keep it away from moisture. There are different grades of brown sugar, but this article will focus on light brown sugar since it’s the most popular among preppers. Like white sugar, light brown sugar can be bought in bulk and stored in your emergency stockpile. Light brown sugar is cheaper than dark brown sugar. It also has a similar texture to white sugar so you can store it in similar ways. Here are the main ways to store light brown sugar: If you need another alternative to sugar, you can also stock up on honey. Since honey has a very long shelf life, it’s easy to store. Honey’s shelf life can be indefinite if you store it in ideal conditions. Keep honey in its original container and store it in a cool location away from direct sunlight. If you want to decant honey, you can use a clean glass jar or an airtight container. Avoid storing honey in metal containers because it can oxidize and spoil. Use a dry spoon when decanting honey to avoid starting off the fermentation process, which may happen if you use a wet spoon. Honey can be refrigerated, but it’s not ideal because it will harden in cold temperatures. When prepping for a survival scenario, store white and brown sugar properly to make it last a long time in your stockpile. It’s best to use glass and plastic containers when storing brown and white sugar long term. Visit FoodStorage.news for more tips on proper food storage.

https://food.news/2023-02-22-protect-against-food-shortage-useful-prepping-practices.html,Protect yourself against food shortage with these useful prepping practices,0,"Advertisement According to experts, by 2050 the world could have more people than food. They also warned that a worldwide food crisis “is imminent and approaching fast.” The leading solution suggested by Professor Julian Cribb and other experts in the field is a global switch to vegetarianism, but this alternative comes with its own challenges. Experts think that 10 billion is the max cutoff point for the population and supporting more people than that is almost impossible. This means that even if everyone agrees to avoid eating meat, issues related to soil, climate, land and access should still be considered. If you are worried about a food shortage, protect your family by starting useful prepping practices like home gardening and food preservation. (h/t to AskAPrepper.com) Dwindling food access is a bigger concern than running out of food. Several factors contribute to food access, and getting food from the farm to the table is a complicated process that has already seen some issues in recent years. Before SHTF, protect yourself against a food shortage with the practices detailed below: Foraging refers to the act of gathering food from the wilderness. This is a great option if you are looking for a way to supplement your diet without spending money. Foraging food gives you access to a seasonal “supermarket” beyond your homestead. It’s also a great way to save money or make ends meet. If you plan to forage, here are some things to keep in mind: If you’re serious about foraging, invest in these essential tools: What to forage There are many edible plants to forage and with some knowledge and experience, you can gather a substantial amount of food for personal use or for selling. However, what you forage will depend on where you live. Blackberries and raspberries Blackberries and raspberries can be found growing throughout the world. Blackberries are most abundant in autumn and are easy to identify. Pick berries and freeze them as a quick treat or preserve them to use throughout the year. Berries can also be used for jams or pies. Chestnuts There are many wild nuts to forage and one of the most popular is the sweet chestnut. Sweet chestnuts can be used to make pesto. You can also add it to holiday stuffing. Chestnuts can also be roasted and enjoyed on their own. They can be found throughout the United States. Dandelion Dandelions are considered an annoying weed by most homeowners, but when SHTF, this edible plant is a godsend. Dandelion is easy to identify and can be safely consumed after washing thoroughly. You can eat dandelion raw or use it in your cooking. While all parts of the plant are edible, they are a little bitter. Elderberries and elderflowers Forage for elderberries and elderflowers from late May to early July. Elderflowers are often used to make cordial, a delicious, liqueur-like beverage. The flowers can also be used to make jams, sorbet, or yogurt. Nettles Stinging nettles are a wild green and they are easy to identify, but you will need a pair of thick gloves. Stinging nettle grows abundantly throughout North America and the plant thrives in damp soil. The plant is often harvested for food and it can grow up to six feet tall in some locations. Look for stinging nettles growing along the roadside in dense patches. Wild garlic You can find wild garlic along the banks of streams and rivers since it thrives in damp ground. Wild garlic is a versatile ingredient and can be foraged from late March onwards. When foraging for wild garlic, look out for its strong, pungent aroma that is reminiscent of garlic. Be careful when foraging for wild garlic in Canada and the United States. Lily of the valley is a wild garlic look-a-like, but the flowers, leaves and fruits of the lily of the valley plant are poisonous. Compared to foraging, home gardening is a more reliable way of protecting yourself against a food shortage. Whether you live on a homestead in the countryside or in a small apartment in the city, you can grow your own food outdoors or indoors. (Related: Home gardening tips: How to grow onions from seed.) Growing crops indoors If you live in an apartment, you can still grow vegetables indoors and in a small space. Use pots and planters to grow your favorite herbs and vegetables. Here are some foods you can grow indoors: You will need basic tools and supplies for your indoor garden. Not all these things are mandatory, but they can help increase your chance of success. Growing food in an outdoor or indoor garden could save your life during a food shortage so start planting today. If you have a garden, learning how to preserve can help make the excess food you grow last longer. Learning to safely store food and preserve it long-term will help you overcome a food crisis. If things go well, you can also earn extra money with this skill. You can store and maintain foods using a root cellar or cold storage. Store crops like beets, carrots and garlic in a root cellar. You can also preserve food by drying or dehydrating it. You can either get a food dehydrator or use alternative methods like an oven or sun drying. Another option is to learn canning. Invest in a professional canner and other canning equipment. If you want to save money, use a method called a water bath. In water bath canning, you need a large stock pot to seal jars and preserve the contents. Canning food can make it last for weeks, months and even years. The meat industry relies on processing and transportation to get food to consumers. But issues in production will take their toll and can hinder your ability to access meat and dairy. If you are willing to put in the work, you can also raise livestock on your homestead. This practice is ideal if you also want to eat eggs, dairy and meat with vegetables from your garden. Depending on where you live, you can raise large animals like cows or smaller ones like chickens or small animals on your property. Chickens will provide you with eggs and poultry. Meanwhile, cows can give both milk and meat. Before you raise livestock, check the laws in your state to ensure that you can house, raise and slaughter animals on your homestead. If a food shortage hits the U.S., life will be challenging for preppers and non-preppers alike. Find ways to become more self-sufficient so you can provide for your family when SHTF.

https://food.news/2023-02-21-prepping-livestock-5-animals-to-raise-homestead.html,Prepping and livestock tips: 5 Animals to raise on your homestead,0,"Advertisement Food shortages, soaring gas prices and an unreliable supply chain can make people reconsider their priorities. And if you’re a prepper who lives in a crowded city, it might be a good idea to start homesteading after moving to a rural area. If you want to become self-reliant or try a new hobby, you can look into raising animals on your property for meat or dairy. (h/t to Survivopedia.com) While chickens are the first choice for many homesteaders, animal husbandry goes beyond chickens. Here are some animals that you can raise on your homestead for food: When deciding between grazing animals, you can keep either a cow or sheep. What you choose will depend on what you need the animal for. If you want milk, get some sheep. Sheep will also produce wool that you can use to make your own clothes, which you can also use for textile production as a source of income. Keep in mind that if you get a lot of sheep, you will have to make sure that you have enough space to accommodate all the grazing animals. You can also get lamb or mutton from sheep, but not everyone will like the taste of mutton. If you don’t like mutton, it might be better to raise cows since they will produce more meat. Depending on the breed, your cows can also be a source of both milk and meat. If you have a small homestead, one or two grazing animals may be enough for your family. However, if you want to raise livestock for profit, you will need more space for your animals. Cows Cows are the best choice for your homestead if your goal is to have a source of food. Before buying a cow, do your research to decide which breed is best for your budget, meat preference and location. The most popular beef cattle are Angus, Hereford and Texas Longhorn. If money is an issue, the number of cows you keep will impact your homesteading budget since feed costs will go up, depending on the number of animals you have. Cows will also need enough pasture. (Related: Chickens, cows and more: Things to consider before choosing livestock for your homestead.) Sheep Get sheep as starters or training animals since their feed costs and maintenance are pretty low. Unlike cattle, sheep don’t require heavy-duty fencing and this helps significantly reduce your costs. Sheep also don’t require feeders or waterers as they can survive on grass alone. Sheep are prey animals and they tend to live in social communities to provide extra security and protection from predators. Sheep live in a group called a flock and if one is separated from its flock, it can become anxious, nervous and depressed since it will feel vulnerable to danger. Give your sheep peace of mind by always trying to keep it with other sheep or at least other livestock animals like goats. If you are going to purchase sheep, plan on purchasing several to provide a flock environment. Ideally, your flock should have at least four to five sheep to provide a secure flock setting. One downside to keeping sheep is they are more susceptible to parasites and worms compared to cattle. An infestation could do real damage to sheep before you can control it. Ducks are also great layers. Like chickens, ducks are all-around birds that will provide you with meat and eggs. If you’re not sure what breed to get, look up Muscovy ducks. Technically not a duck, Muscovy ducks have geese descendants. These ducks haven’t been hybridized and are wilder than the average duck, but this makes them more self-reliant. They are great foragers, but they may take to the sky if you don’t clip their wings. A Muscovy duck can grow up to 15 pounds and provide double the meat of an ordinary duck. They are not as productive as chickens, but the eggs ducks lay are more nutritious. A miniature dairy goat is a great choice for many homestead beginners since they are low maintenance and provide milk. Miniature dairy goats are obtained by breeding Nigerian dwarf goats with purebred American goats. There are many breeds to choose from, but the Nigerian Dwarf breed is ideal for newbies. You will need a buck and a doe since the does will produce milk to feed their young. They will lactate for up to eight months after giving birth, and they don’t mind sharing their milk. Nigerian dwarf goats are an all-around breed and they are highly productive even though they are small. Each doe will produce at least two quarts of milk per day. With one buck and two does, you will get more kids as the does give birth. If you want to limit the breeding, separate the buck from the does. When the buck is isolated, it will get depressed, stop eating and may even die, so a separate pen nearby is often best. You can keep the goats together if you have a wether (castrated buck). Wethers are less aggressive, are less prone to separation anxiety and they live longer. Wethers can keep either the does or bucks company, and can be used for meat. If you want to raise pigs, keep in mind that they are harder to raise than other animals. Make your life easier by getting Kunekune pigs, which originate from New Zealand. These medium-sized pigs have a more pleasant temperament compared to American pigs. Kunekune pigs are fat and round. The females grow between 100 and 180 pounds and the males grow between 200 and 250 pounds. These pigs have short snouts and they won’t challenge fences. Kunekune pigs are grass-based and they love to forage for food. They don’t depend on grains like other breeds, and if you have a pasture for the cows or sheep, Kunekune pigs are an ideal choice. Meat rabbits are an ideal choice for a small homestead since they don’t require much space if they are housed in cages or hutches. They also cohabitate well with other animals, especially fowl, so you can build a large chicken or duck coop and house both your chickens and rabbits in it. A rabbit farm can be highly productive because rabbits breed a lot and they provide ample meat. Should you end up with too many bunnies, you can sell the offspring to earn some money. If you also have a home garden, use rabbit poop as a natural fertilizer with high nitrogen content. It’s easy to place a bucket or trough under your hutches or to hang rabbit cages above a mulch pile to catch the poo. Just be sure to have drainage holes so the urine flows out. Doing so means the poop will compost with the mulch and help get rid of the smell. Once you get animals for your homestead, you need to feed them properly to keep them healthy. Feeding cows Feeding ducks Feeding pigs Feeding goats Feeding rabbits While raising animals on your homestead isn’t too complicated, it requires some trial and error, patience and a lot of hard work. Do your research and consider what you need on your homestead so you can choose the right animal(s) for you. Watch the video below to help decide if you should raise chickens on your homestead.

https://food.news/2023-02-21-nanoparticles-food-coloring-may-harm-gut-health.html,Study: Nanoparticles in common food coloring and anti-caking agents may harm gut health,0,"Advertisement Many processed foods and beverages like cereal and sports drinks contain food coloring and anti-caking agents. According to a study conducted by scientists from Binghamton University and Cornell University, these ingredients and additives may damage your gut health. The study revealed that metal oxide particles in particular could be disrupting the health of your intestines. Details of the study were published in the journal Antioxidants. Elad Tako, senior author and associate professor of food science at Cornell, warned that people are consuming nanoparticles from food coloring and anti-caking agents on a daily basis. He cautioned that they still don’t know how much people consume and there is no definitive data on the long-term effects of this consumption. Through the study, Tako and his colleagues were able to demonstrate some of these effects. Tako added that the study findings could be used to learn more about gastrointestinal health and development. In earlier studies, Binghamton researchers led in vitro cellular assessments and screened different nanoparticles used frequently in food and pharmaceutical industries.” The research team then narrowed its focus to specific metal oxide nanoparticles to confirm proper testing dosages that are suitable for human consumption. For the collaborative study, experts from Binghamton and Cornell used human-appropriate doses of titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide in the laboratory’s in vivo system. The model helped the researchers monitor the display of a health response comparable to that of real humans, and they injected the nanoparticles into chicken eggs. After the eggs hatched, the scientists observed changes in the functional, structural and microbial markers within their blood, the duodenum or upper intestine, and the cecum or pouch that connects the small and large intestines. Results revealed that titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide, two nanoparticles commonly used in food, “may negatively affect intestinal functionality.” Specifically, the nanoparticles have a negative effect on “key digestive and absorptive proteins.” (Related: These 3 foods can boost your heart and gut health.) The research team also studied zinc oxide, a micronutrient, and iron oxide, an iron fortification supplement, to see how they function. Their findings revealed that zinc oxide nanoparticles help support the intestines and may help them compensate after suffering damage. On the other hand, iron oxide nanoparticles seemed to negatively alter intestinal function and overall health. This means that while iron oxide may serve as a viable option for iron fortification, it is not the best option for maintaining gut integrity. Researchers reported that zinc oxide would be the best choice. While these findings about currently available food-grade nanoparticles aren’t all positive, the research team doesn’t think their use should be banned completely without further research to back up that decision. They also recommended that more feasible developments would have to be made to introduce “healthier, more cost-effective and sustainable alternatives.” Dyes are used in foods to make processed food look more attractive, but they have no nutritional benefit. Protect your gut health by following the tips below to avoid food dyes: Choose organic foods Look for organic foods with the green-and-white United States Department of Agriculture-certified organic label. Remember that some foods labeled “made with organic ingredients” may still contain synthetic dyes. The best way to remove artificial food dyes from your diet is to prepare meals using whole, unprocessed foods that are full of various nutrients. These foods are naturally dye-free: Watch out for the term “artificial” The terms “artificial color,” “artificial color added” or “color added” mean that nature-derived pigments were used and that synthetic dyes must be listed by their names. Avoid numbers in ingredient lists You can pick out man-made food dyes that appear in ingredient lists if there is a name of a color with a number following it, like Blue 1 and 2, Citrus Red 2, Green 3, Red 40 or Yellow 5 and 6. Avoid these products to steer clear of food dyes. Seek out natural colorants Once you’ve learned about artificial food dyes like Blue 1, look for natural colorants like annatto, beet, carotenes or capsanthin (a paprika extract).

https://food.news/2023-02-17-processed-foods-protein-hunger-contribute-to-obesity.html,"Study links processed foods to PROTEIN HUNGER, which causes overeating and contributes to obesity",0,"Advertisement When you’re hungry and craving a quick snack, it’s tempting to make some instant noodles or reheat leftover pizza instead of cooking something healthy. However, enjoying these processed foods regularly may have a negative effect on your overall health. Data reveals that at least two-thirds of American adults are either overweight or obese. At the same time, millions of people eat fast food every day. According to a large-scale population study conducted by researchers from the University of Sydney (USYD), eating highly-processed (ultra-processed) snacks can promote overeating, contribute to unwanted weight gain and even increase your risk of developing chronic disease. The study was published in the journal Obesity. For the study, researchers examined data from more than 9,000 volunteers obtained by the Australian Bureau of Statistics regarding nutrition and physical activity. After analyzing the data, scientists found that highly-processed and refined foods cause protein hunger, a condition that triggers overeating and contributes to obesity. The researchers said that the findings help to confirm the “Protein Leverage Hypothesis” or the theory that people overeat fats and carbohydrates because their body craves protein more than other nutrients. Worth noting is the fact that the food consumed in Western diets contains lower amounts of protein, something highly lacking in processed foods. Additionally, processed foods continue to make up larger proportions of many people’s daily diets. Dr. Amanda Grech, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Sydney‘s Charles Perkins Center, explained that as people consume more junk foods or highly-processed and refined foods, they continue to “dilute their dietary protein and increase their risk of being overweight and obese.” David Raubenheimer, study co-author, a professor and the Leonard Ullmann Chair in Nutritional Ecology at USYD, confirms the negative effects of improper nutrition. “Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease – they’re all driven by diet, cautioned Raubenheimer. The research team discovered that participants who consumed lower amounts of protein in their first meal of the day increased their overall food intake throughout the day, which could be due to an attempt to compensate by consuming more calories. The participants who also lacked protein consumed higher amounts of discretionary foods or high-calorie foods that are also full of saturated fats, trans fats, salt, sugars, chemical sweeteners or alcohol. Additionally, they consumed vegetables, fruits, fewer grains, dairy products and meats. Meanwhile, the participants who ate foods with a higher proportion of protein at their first meal tended to eat less fat and carbohydrates throughout the day. Other factors like physical activity levels, eating patterns and sleep routines can also contribute to obesity, but Raubenheimer concluded that protein hunger due to eating processed foods is a major cause. He believes that the concept of protein mechanism in appetite is a “revolutionary insight” with significant implications for global health. The USYD study isn’t the first to highlight the adverse effects of poor eating habits, weight gain and disease risk. In a 2012 review also published in the journal Obesity, researchers identified three major contributing factors to obesity in Western populations. This “triple whammy” includes: Obesity isn’t the only adverse outcome. Having poor eating habits can also increase the risk of potentially life-threatening degenerative diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. In a 2019 study of 100,000 adults published in The BMJ, scientists reported that a 10 percent increase in ultra-processed food intake was linked to a corresponding 10 percent increase in heart disease risk. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines processed food as any raw agricultural product that has been: Eating whole foods is good for you, but it’s also fine to eat food that has had some degree of light processing. Just make sure you limit your intake of or avoid ultra-processed foods like cakes, cookies, chips, frozen meals, instant soups and soda because they are bad for you. If you love processed foods but want to improve your eating habits, try some of the tips below: Make healthy snacks If you want something sweet, pair Greek yogurt with raspberries. You can also eat apple chunks with almond butter. If you like cheese and fruits, mix a small amount of raw, unpasteurized cheese with fresh papaya. If you want a savory snack, eat hummus with carrot sticks and cucumber. You can also eat cherry tomatoes with cashew cheese drizzled with a bit of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Instead of eating junk food with empty calories, choose healthy snacks like fruits, vegetables and nuts that are more satisfying. They also contain antioxidants, dietary fiber, healthy fats, essential vitamins, important minerals and higher amounts of protein than most commercial snack products. (Related: Cut down on processed food intake with these simple steps.) Boost your protein intake Increase your daily intake of protein, which your body needs for the repair and production of cells, by eating grass-fed beef, pasture-raised poultry, eggs or wild-caught fish. If you are vegetarian, choose plant-based protein sources like beans, legumes, quinoa, soy and wheat germ. Try to buy organic products to avoid pesticides in fruits and vegetables. Eat more fruits and vegetables Fruits and vegetables are rich in various nutrients. They contain dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals and plant compounds that help fight inflammation and prevent cell damage. Many large observational studies have found a link between high fruit and vegetable intake to a reduced risk of health problems like cancer and heart disease. If possible, eat fresh vegetables and fruits since most of them can be consumed raw immediately after picking and washing. Here are some tips on how to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your regular diet: Drink more water Water is the most natural beverage you can drink: It is free from harmful additives, sugars, artificial sweeteners or other unhealthy ingredients. You also need to drink enough water every day to prevent dehydration. Staying hydrated may also help you achieve a moderate weight. Avoid sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and store-bought fruit juices that have been linked to diseases like Type 2 diabetes and obesity. If you are not sensitive to caffeine, unsweetened coffee and tea are also good choices. These beverages offer several health benefits. If you don’t like drinking plain water, add sliced fruit or the juice of a lemon or lime to naturally add flavor to a glass of water. Avoid processed foods like cookies and potato chips and prepare healthy snacks like veggie sticks with homemade dip to prevent overeating and avoid unhealthy weight gain.

https://food.news/2023-02-16-cherries-promote-weight-loss-boost-heart-health.html,"Study shows cherries can promote weight loss, boost heart health and treat gout",0,"Advertisement Cherries are a delicious fruit, and studies found that they also offer several health benefits. According to studies, cherries can promote weight loss and even protect against gout. Cherries come in both sweet and sour (tart) varieties. The fruit is full of a potent and beneficial antioxidant called anthocyanin. Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments that, depending on their pH, make certain foods black, blue, purple or red. Cherries are also rich in vitamin C, a nutrient you need for immune health. They are also a great source of dietary fiber (Related: Study: Cherries can help fight heart disease, diabetes and other inflammatory diseases.) One cup of sweet, raw cherries without pits offers the following nutrients: Fresh sour cherries are more difficult to find compared to sweet cherries. One cup of fresh cherries without pits contains: If you’re trying to lose weight, you can enjoy cherries as a healthy snack. Cherries are low in calories and full of dietary fiber and they can help you feel full faster so you eat less. In a 2009 study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food, researchers observed rats split into two groups. Both were given a high-fat diet for 90 days. One group of animal subjects received whole tart cherry powder and the other did not. The research team found that the animals who received the cherry powder did not gain as much weight or build as much body fat. Additionally, their blood showed much lower levels of inflammation compared to the rats who did not get cherry powder. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. At least 697,000 people died from heart disease in 2020, which accounted for one in five deaths. Heart disease costs America a whopping $229 billion annually, which includes the cost of healthcare services, medicines and lost productivity due to premature death. Key risk factors for heart disease include diabetes, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure (hypertension), obesity, smoking, having an unhealthy diet, not getting enough exercise and the excessive use of alcohol. If you are worried about your heart health, you can switch to a healthy diet to help lower your risk of developing heart disease. Research suggests that the anthocyanins, flavonols, vitamins and dietary fiber in cherries and other berries can help lower your risk of developing cardiovascular disease and improve heart health. Data from clinical studies in healthy humans; those with health issues like diabetes, dyslipidemia (an excess of cholesterol or fats in the blood), high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome; and those who smoke show a significant decrease in cardiovascular disease risk factors after they ate berries. The same study also suggests that the anthocyanins in cherries can help boost heart health by reducing metabolic risk factors, improving low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, improving glucose metabolism and reducing fat and cholesterol levels in the blood. In a 2013 study published in the journal Current Pharmaceutical Design, scientists reported that sour cherry seed extract had a cardioprotective effect in rabbits with high cholesterol. Researchers who conducted the study also discovered that the rabbits who were given sour cherry seed extract had significantly improved cardiac function and a decrease in atherosclerotic plaque formation and infarct size. An infarct is a small, localized area of dead tissue that forms due to a lack of blood supply. Gout or hyperuricemia is a form of arthritis that causes symptoms such as inflammation, redness and severe pain. It occurs when you have too much uric acid in the blood and it crystallizes in your joints. Gout usually affects the small bones in the feet, particularly the big toe. Gout is very common and it affects over nine million people in America or at least 3.9 percent of the adult population. You can develop gout when your body produces too much uric acid or your kidneys do not filter enough out. Additionally, foods high in purines can trigger an attack of gout because your body breaks down purines and turns them into uric acid. Avoid these foods since they can trigger gout because of their high purine content: Cherries have long been used as a remedy for gout because they can help cleanse the blood and prevent inflammation. In another study published in the journal Arthritis and Rheumatism, scientists observed 633 volunteers with gout to find out if cherry extract could decrease the number of gout attack sufferers experienced. The participants who were given cherry extract had a 35 percent lower risk of gout attacks compared to the people in the control group. After adding allopurinol, a medication used to lower uric acid levels in the blood of people with gout and certain types of kidney stones, to the cherry extract group, the risk of gout attacks was reduced by as much as 75 percent. Cherries naturally contain melatonin, the hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles. Other foods that naturally contain melatonin are bananas, eggs, fatty fish, goji berries, milk, nuts and pistachios. Melatonin has many important functions in the human body. It supports regular sleep cycles and circadian rhythm and it has been shown to improve immune system function. The sleep hormone also has neuroprotective effects and helps slow processes linked to aging. Some fruits and vegetables are particularly susceptible to the accumulation of pesticides, and cherries are especially prone to these buildups. According to the consumer advocacy group the Environmental Working Group (EWG), commercially grown cherries are on their top 12 list of fruits and vegetables with the highest levels of pesticide residues. According to the EWG’s 2022 Shopper’s Guide to Pesticides in Produce, 90 percent of cherries tested had residues of two or more pesticides. To reap the health benefits of cherries and avoid harmful pesticides, buy only organic cherries.

https://food.news/2023-02-16-6-superfoods-that-can-help-ease-anxiety.html,Healing with whole foods: 6 Superfoods that can help ease anxiety,0,"Advertisement Anxiety is a feeling of fear, dread and uneasiness. It can be triggered by stressful situations, like feeling under pressure from work or family life. An estimated 40 percent of Americans suffer from anxiety. Cutting out caffeine, exercising regularly and getting eight hours of sleep every night can help relieve anxiety. But if you are still feeling anxious, making some changes to your eating habits can help. Studies suggest gut and anxiety are closely linked and that a lack of some vitamins and nutrients may trigger feelings of worry and concern. Anxiety is also linked to inflammation in your body. Fortunately, certain superfoods can help counteract this and reduce damage to your cells. Fight anxiety with these superfoods: Blueberries are a superfood powerhouse and researchers have found that the benefits of blueberries may also help reduce anxiety. According to research, blueberries can help reverse cognitive decline, protect against dementia and lower heart disease risk. The berries are also full of vitamin C and scientists think this can help prevent anxiety. Vitamin C helps reduce the amount of cortisol or the stress hormone that is released in response to a stressful event, meaning the vitamin can help reduce feelings of anxiety. Small-scale studies also suggest a link between eating blueberries and lower levels of anxiety. In a 2020 study, 64 adolescents were given a daily supplement of blueberries for four weeks. At the end of the study, the young participants were all reporting fewer symptoms of depression. Additionally, blueberries are full of antioxidants, which can help reduce cell damage caused by stress. Health authorities recommend that women should get about 75 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C a day while men should get 90 mg. One cup of blueberries contains about 25 percent of the daily requirement for vitamin C. Dark chocolate contains flavonols, or plant compounds that are antioxidants. These compounds can help reduce damage to the body caused by stress. Studies also suggest that dark chocolate can boost blood flow to the brain, which can boost alertness and help you adjust better to stressful situations. Eggs are a controversial food, with some saying they are linked to high cholesterol and others claiming they should be part of a balanced diet. Like other superfoods, when consumed in moderation, eggs offer many benefits. Eggs are one of the few foods full of vitamin D, which your body uses to produce and release serotonin, the “feel-good” hormone. Data from earlier studies have found that boosting your vitamin D intake can help raise serotonin levels. This then helps boost your mood. (Related: Study: 5-HTP can boost serotonin levels and promote healthy eating habits.) Papers have also suggested a link between vitamin D deficiency and anxiety. Adults need about 400 to 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day. One large egg contains about 44 IUs of vitamin D or 10 percent of your daily needs. Estimates suggest that one in two Americans is deficient in vitamin D, which is more prevalent among people in the black ethnic group. Symptoms of vitamin D deficiency include fatigue, poor sleep quality and feelings of depression or sadness. Some say eating hummus can help combat anxiety. Hummus is a Middle Eastern dip made from chickpeas and it is full of tryptophan. The body uses tryptophan to make melatonin, the sleep hormone, and serotonin. More serotonin can help improve your mood and fight feelings of anxiety. Research also suggests that melatonin can help you get a good night’s sleep. Getting enough sleep may help to lower feelings of anxiety. If you have trouble falling asleep, try taking melatonin shortly before your bedtime. Small-scale studies have suggested that getting more tryptophan can lower anxiety. The data is also backed up by large-scale studies. In one study, 15 adults were exposed to a stressful environment twice: Once when they had normal tryptophan levels in their blood and when they had lower levels. Results revealed that anxiety, tensions and feelings of nervousness were higher when the participants had lower tryptophan levels. This suggests that the amount of tryptophan in the body may contribute to anxiety levels. Additionally, tryptophan may help improve memory and learning. It can also help you get a good night’s sleep. If you follow a balanced diet, you should be able to get enough tryptophan. Experts suggest that you need about 250 to 425 mg of tryptophan a day, but estimates suggest that most individuals are already consuming more than 900 mg every day. Experts often recommend the Mediterranean diet because it can help you live longer and make you less likely to develop dementia. Researchers also suggest that eating salmon, a key ingredient of the Mediterranean diet, may also help lower levels of anxiety. Salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which previous studies have suggested can reduce inflammation in the body and lower anxiety. According to previous large-scale studies, a diet rich in omega-3s is associated with lower levels of anxiety. In a 2020 meta-analysis of 19 clinical trials involving 2,240 participants, researchers observed an improvement in anxiety symptoms when the participants consumed more foods containing omega-3s. Small-scale papers also detected a link. In a paper from 2014, men who ate salmon three times a week for five months reported lower anxiety levels than other participants eating a similar amount of beef, chicken, or pork every week. Omega-3 fatty acids can also help lower the risk of heart disease or stroke and reduce symptoms of eczema and some types of arthritis. The American Heart Association recommends that adults get from 500 to 1,000 mg of omega-3s per day. Yogurt is full of good bacteria, which can contribute to building and maintaining a healthy gut microbiome. A healthy gut microbiome can help reduce the risk of one of the symptoms of anxiety, an upset stomach. This is often caused by stress hormones interfering with the digestive system. In one study involving 66 postmenopausal women, scientists reported that eating probiotic yogurt once a day for six weeks was associated with lower levels of reported anxiety. The best types of yogurt for combating anxiety are probiotic yogurts like Greek yogurt and kefir. If you are still feeling anxious after trying some of the superfoods above, the culprit may be one of the trigger foods detailed below: Alcohol Drinking alcohol can make you feel more relaxed, but this good mood is often temporary. In the long run, alcohol is a depressant. Drink alcohol in moderation and drink lots of water to stay hydrated. Candy and sweets Many people have a sweet tooth, but desserts only give you a temporary high. Sugar is absorbed quickly into the bloodstream and the absorption causes an initial high or surge of energy. Eventually, that surge wears off as your body increases its insulin production to remove the sugar from your bloodstream. After eating sweets, you will just feel tired and low. Processed foods According to a study, processed foods like hot dogs, sausage and cakes may cause anxiety after eating since a diet of processed and fatty foods increases the risk for depression. In the study, the participants who mainly ate high-fat dairy products, fried food, processed meat and sweetened desserts had a 58 percent higher risk of depression than those who ate “whole” foods, like fish and vegetables.

https://food.news/2023-02-15-2-cups-coffee-daily-healthy-blood-pressure.html,Study: Drinking at least 2 cups of coffee a day helps maintain healthy blood pressure,0,"Advertisement If you start each morning with a cup (or two) of coffee, here’s something that might cheer you up: According to a study, those who drink at least two or three cups of coffee per day have lower blood pressure than people who consume less. The study was published in the journal Nutrients. Coffee is an integral part of the culture in Italy and the beverage also has many fans worldwide. In 2020 and 2021, estimates revealed that the world consumed a whopping 10 million tons of coffee. While experts don’t always agree on coffee’s health implications, data from recent studies suggest that drinking coffee can help lower the risk of several conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and neurodegenerative and liver diseases. But what causes these benefits remains a mystery. Arrigo Cicero, the study’s first author and a professor at the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences at the University of Bologna, explained that caffeine is only one of several coffee components and that it’s not the only component with an active role. Cicero added that positive effects on human health have also been recorded in people who choose to drink decaffeinated coffee. While data has shown that caffeine can increase blood pressure, other bioactive components in coffee “seem to counterbalance this effect with a positive end result on blood pressure levels.” (Related: 5 Caffeine FACTS and 5 caffeine MYTHS.) To learn more about the heart benefits of coffee, researchers analyzed a sample of 720 men and 783 women from the Brisighella Heart Study. The research team compared blood pressure levels, coffee consumption habits and other clinical data points for each participant. The results revealed that peripheral blood pressure was significantly lower in the people who drank one to three cups of coffee a day compared to the non-coffee drinkers. Peripheral blood pressure describes blood pressure measured from the upper arm. Thanks to the study, researchers were also able to confirm these effects “with regard to the central aortic pressure, the one close to the heart,” where experts observe an almost identical phenomenon “with entirely similar values for habitual coffee drinkers compared to non-coffee drinkers.” High blood pressure is closely linked to heart disease because of the high force of blood consistently pushing against the walls of your blood vessels. This forces the heart to work harder so it can pump blood. The findings from the University of Bologna study are valuable because they offer another potential nutritional avenue for naturally lowering blood pressure and protecting against heart disease. Professor Claudio Borghi, who led the study, explained that it is the first study to observe this association in the Italian population. The findings also confirm the positive effect of coffee consumption on cardiovascular risk. Hypertension (high blood pressure) affects one-third of all adults in the U.S., and only less than 50 percent of them have the condition under control. This is bad because high blood pressure can cause serious health problems without showing any warning signs. When your blood pressure is too high for too long, it puts you at risk for conditions like heart disease, kidney damage, stroke or an aneurysm formation. Fortunately, making good lifestyle changes can help you naturally lower your blood pressure. Exercise regularly Regular physical activity is crucial for your overall well-being. Exercise helps control high blood pressure and it can also help you manage a healthy weight, strengthen your heart and lower stress levels. If you are fit enough, aim for at least 150 minutes of exercise per week of moderate-intensity physical activity, like brisk walking. While any type of aerobic activity like dancing, jogging or walking offers benefits for your heart health, try to find activities you enjoy doing so it will be easier to commit to a regular routine. Increase your potassium intake Potassium offers many benefits. It can help regulate heart rate and it can also reduce the effects of sodium in the body. The nutrient helps your body eliminate sodium and also eases tension in your blood vessel walls, both of which help to lower blood pressure. The most effective way to increase your potassium intake is by adjusting your diet and eating potassium-rich foods such as: Incorporating these superfoods into your diet can help boost your heart health, but if you’re not sure check with your doctor about the potassium level that’s right for you. If you have significant kidney disease, avoid consuming too much potassium because your kidneys may not be able to eliminate it. Reduce your salt intake Most people consume too much salt without even realizing it. The American Heart Association estimates that the average American consumes a whopping 3,400 mg of sodium a day. The recommended daily intake is only 2,300 mg, with an ideal limit of less than 1,500 mg per day, especially for people who have high blood pressure. Making a small reduction in your sodium intake can still help improve your heart health. It can also reduce your blood pressure if you have high blood pressure. Follow these tips to decrease sodium in your diet: Moderate your alcohol consumption According to some studies, drinking alcohol in moderation can benefit your heart. But drinking too much alcohol can trigger a sudden spike in your blood pressure. If you do drink, the American Heart Association recommends that men limit their alcohol consumption to two drinks per day. Women should limit their alcohol intake to one drink per day. A drink is considered one 4 oz. of wine, 12 oz. beer, 1.5 oz. of 80-proof spirits, or 1 oz. of 100-proof spirits. If you’re currently taking medication to treat high blood pressure, closely monitor your alcohol intake since it can reduce the effectiveness of blood pressure medications. Manage your stress levels Stress is a common part of your daily life and when a stressful situation is resolved, your heart rate and blood pressure usually returns to normal. But be wary of chronic stress because it may put you at risk for many long-term health problems like high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke. Stress can also increase your blood pressure levels if your coping mechanisms involve snacking on junk food, drinking alcohol or smoking. It’s impossible to eliminate all stressors from your life, but learning to cope with them in a healthier way can benefit your overall health and wellness. This can then help lower your blood pressure. Avoid stress triggers and try to avoid putting yourself in unnecessary stressful situations. If the commute to work means you often get stuck in rush-hour traffic, try leaving for work a few minutes early. You should also take time to relax and enjoy. Spend a couple of hours on the weekend doing things that make you happy. It can be as simple as preparing a healthy and delicious meal, reading or enjoying a cup of coffee with your best friend. Follow a balanced diet, maintain a healthy weight and drink two to three cups of coffee a day to help reduce your blood pressure. Watch the video below to know more about organic fair trade coffee.

https://food.news/2023-02-15-natural-healing-6-superfoods-help-relieve-headaches.html,Natural healing: 6 Superfoods that can help relieve headaches,0,"Advertisement People of all ages suffer from headaches, whether it’s a low-grade tension headache or a debilitating migraine. If you suffer from chronic headaches and are hesitant to take over-the-counter medications that often cause negative side effects, try natural remedies and superfoods like ginger or yogurt. Headaches have many causes. Factors like colds and other seasonal illnesses, changes in sleep patterns, insomnia, stress, travel and interrupted routines can cause one. Some headaches like debilitating migraines can also be hereditary. Headaches can also be triggered by eating certain foods. But some foods and drinks can help relieve and reduce the occurrence of headaches. Caffeine is considered a valuable and safe option for relieving headaches. In a 2012 study published in The Journal of Headache and Pain, researchers reported that a mix of 1,000 mg of paracetamol and 130 mg of caffeine was as effective and as safe as 50 mg of oral sumatriptan when treating headaches. In a different study published in the journal Nature in July 2020, results showed that caffeine is safe and effective when treating acute migraine and pairing it with painkillers. But scientists warn that drinking too much coffee may lead to chronic migraine and sudden caffeine withdrawal may cause migraine attacks. If you suffer from migraines, closely monitor your caffeine intake and avoid exceeding 200 mg per day. Studies on the link between diet and headaches revealed that increasing daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids benefits headaches and may even help prevent migraines. Seafood is a traditional dietary source of omega-3 fatty acids. But if you are vegan, you can try flaxseed as a plant-based source of omega-3s. Flaxseed is one of the best plant sources of omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid. If you suffer from constant headaches, try flaxseed to improve your symptoms. If you haven’t tried flaxseed yet, keep in mind that it is not for everyone. Flaxseed has anticoagulant properties so avoid it if you are: Ginger has been used as an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine for 2,000 years. It is also a common medicinal ingredient in Indian and Arabic medicine. In a 2018 study by the International Headache Society published by Sage Journals, scientists discovered that adding ginger extract to routine treatment of acute migraine can “significantly reduce pain more effectively than conventional therapy alone.” In another 2014 study published in the journal Phytotherapy Research, findings showed that the benefits of ginger powder are similar to the common migraine drug sumatriptan. However, ginger had fewer side effects. In a 2019 study published in the International Journal of Preventive Medicine, researchers reported that more than 70 percent of patients experienced headache relief after using nasal drops of oil with a concentration of 1.5 percent peppermint. Additionally, 42 percent of the patients felt a significant reduction in headaches. Almost 50 percent of the participants reported that their headaches subsided within five minutes of using the peppermint nasal drops. In a 2012 study published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice, findings showed that applying a 10 percent menthol solution to the forehead and temples could effectively relieve pain and nausea. The study also revealed that the menthol solution was a safe and effective treatment option for migraine. (Related: 10 Possible triggers of an afternoon headache.) Plain yogurt is full of vitamin B2 or riboflavin which helps reduce the number of migraine attacks in patients. Riboflavin is an essential nutrient that assists mitochondria in human cells to generate energy. In a randomized controlled trial, volunteers who were given 400 mg of riboflavin, 600 mg of magnesium, 150 mg of coenzyme Q10 and multivitamins for three months reported that their migraine symptoms improved. Several journals identified links between magnesium deficiency and mild to moderate tension headaches and migraines. According to double-blind random placebo control trials, magnesium can effectively help relieve headaches. In several countries, medical guidelines recommend oral magnesium when treating headaches. Magnesium also has a role in neuromuscular function and neurotransmission. The nutrient helps prevent neurons from overreacting, and balancing neurons may help prevent migraines. Green leafy vegetables are also rich in magnesium, especially spinach. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 100g of cooked spinach contains 87 mg of magnesium. If you’ve ruled out other causes like a cold or insomnia, here are seven other reasons you might have a headache: Alcohol intake Any kind of alcohol can trigger headaches. It is a common cause of cluster headaches and migraines. Some people often get headaches after drinking only a couple of ounces of red wine. Experts have yet to find out if the alcohol itself is causing headaches or if another component in the drink causes the problem. Caffeine withdrawal If you normally consume caffeine in beverages like coffee or tea, going cold turkey may trigger a migraine. This may be because caffeine makes blood vessels constrict. Without consuming caffeine, your blood vessels widen and bulge out with each heartbeat, which can cause the pounding pain of migraines. Diet Hunger can trigger a migraine or tension headache. On the other hand, eating certain foods may trigger migraines. For some people, eating just one type of food, like beans or nuts, can cause migraines. For others, many foods like avocados, bananas, cheese, chocolate, citrus, herring, dairy products and onions can cause migraines. According to experts, processed foods with monosodium glutamate, nitrates, nitrites, or yellow food dyes can be “especially problematic.” Environment Cluster headaches seem to be seasonal and people often experience them in the spring or fall. According to researchers, something in the environment triggers cluster headaches but they have yet to figure out the exact cause. Environmental factors such as bright light, cold weather, humidity, intense scents, or smoke are linked to migraines. Hormones Changes in estrogen levels are linked to migraines in women and women suffer from migraines more often than men. Menstrual cycles may be linked to migraines in younger women. Varying estrogen levels during perimenopause can sometimes trigger migraines in women who never experienced them before. Estrogen therapy may also be a migraine trigger. Fortunately, menopause seems to end migraines in most women. Lack of sleep Not getting enough sleep can also cause migraines and tension headaches. Experts don’t know why, but they think getting enough sleep can help relieve pain caused by headaches. Some people report feeling better after taking a nap. Stress Stress can cause tight muscles in your shoulders and neck, which can then cause tension headaches. It may start in your muscles, suggests experts. If you often get tension headaches, the pain in your shoulder and neck muscles is interpreted by your brain as pain in your head. Stress is also a common migraine trigger. If you suffer from frequent headaches, try drinking ginger tea or eating some pumpkin seeds to relieve your symptoms.

https://food.news/2023-02-14-drinking-oolong-tea-can-help-reverse-aging.html,Study: Drinking oolong tea can help reverse aging,0,"Advertisement According to a study published in the journal Aging, drinking oolong tea regularly can help improve longevity. For the 2021 study, researchers conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial of 43 healthy adult men. The volunteers were between the ages of 50 and 72. Results of the study suggest that making evidence-based lifestyle changes could help reduce biological age. The test group took part in an eight-week treatment program that included guidance on health-related factors like: Those in the control group received no intervention. After eight weeks, the research team took saliva samples to measure the participants’ health. Upon examining data from the volunteers, the researchers discovered that the people in the group that made changes to their diet and lifestyle habits had healthier DNA. Data suggested that those in the treatment group appeared to reverse their own aging by as much as three years. If the study findings are correct and can be duplicated in a longer experiment with both male and female volunteers, adopting some of the healthy habits of the treatment group can also help boost your longevity. For example, drinking three cups of oolong tea was one of the health practices given to the volunteers in the treatment group. (Related: 6 Primary types of tea and their science-backed health benefits.) In an article, Dr. Kara Fitzgerald, one of the co-authors of the study, explained that oolong tea contains a plant compound called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Research has shown that EGCG can help protect against Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, insulin resistance and obesity. Other studies also suggest that drinking oolong tea daily offers several health benefits. In a review article published in May 2022 in the peer-reviewed journal Food Science and Human Wellness, scientists reported that oolong tea has “antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-biotic, and anti-obesity properties.” Additionally, oolong tea was found to improve the gut microbiome and protect the heart and liver. “In spite of its popularity in Asian countries, studies on health promoting effects of oolong tea and its characteristic compounds … have attracted limited attention as compared to the knowledge of preventative and therapeutic effects of green and black teas,” said the study authors. Most of the studies compiled in the review were controlled laboratory experiments on rodents, but the broad benefits of oolong tea on human health have also been observed in other studies. Experts believe that these health benefits could be due to theasinensins, a spectrum of important compounds in tea. Theasinensin A is a natural compound found in oolong tea. In a 2015 study conducted on the chemistry and health benefits of oolong tea and theasinensins, scientists found that the different processing methods for the tea plant Camellia sinensis change these molecules in various ways. Using certain methods produces different biochemical effects in different tea types like black, green and oolong tea. Theasinesins help stabilize your blood sugar, which is an anti-diabetic effect. The compounds may also help athletes recover more quickly from vigorous exercise. Oolong tea also contains gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), another beneficial compound, along with theanine. Both substances complement the caffeine tea so when you drink oolong you feel calm, clear-headed alertness instead of the jittery energy that comes with drinking coffee. With data that confirmed the benefits of GABA and after finding a market for GABA-enriched foods in Asia, researchers discovered a way to multiply the amount of GABA in tea by letting it ferment in nitrogen gas. The process helps keep oxygen out. GABA-enriched teas are produced in Japan and Taiwan and these products are popular in both countries. In a 2019 study, scientists looked into the effects of GABA-enriched oolong on heart health and stress levels. They monitored participants’ hearts with EKGs. The participants were also asked about their current feeling of stress and given tests of mental arithmetic as a stressor. After drinking one cup of oolong tea, with half GABA-enriched and half regular, the perceived stress levels of the volunteers were significantly lower after consuming GABA-enriched tea, Their heart rate variability was also lower and this is significant since it is an important metric of heart health and fitness, especially in response to stress. Oolong means “black dragon” in Chinese and the tea comes from China. It is especially popular in Taiwan. Most teas are made from the plant Camellia sinensis and depending on how the plant is processed, it can become black, green, oolong, pu-erh, white or yellow tea. Green, white and yellow teas are processed with sundrying and heating. These processes don’t oxidize the tea leaves. However, black tea is fully oxidized and the oxidation process happens before the tea leaves are processed. On the other hand, oolong tea is only partially oxidized by at least 10 to 70 percent. The partial oxidation gives oolong tea a softer, woodier flavor. Some oolongs are so lightly oxidized that they may taste like green tea but a little more mellow. Other oolongs that are mostly oxidized have a warm, muted flavor. While each variety is different, several oolong teas contain less caffeine than black teas. Like other superfoods, oolong tea must be consumed in moderation. It’s also best not to drink oolong on an empty stomach because it can make you feel hungry and dizzy, an unpleasant state that Chinese people call “tea drunk.” If you want a good night’s sleep, don’t drink oolong tea within three or four hours of your bedtime. Even if oolong tea has calming effects, it still contains caffeine that can make you jittery and make it harder to fall asleep. Drink oolong tea while it’s still warm for the most delicious tea-drinking experience. To make oolong tea, use clean-tasting water. Oolongs thrive with full-boiling or just-off boiling water. Brew the tea for short amounts of time. Savor oolong teas in a series of small infusions to appreciate their changing character as you drink. This means using at least a minimum of five grams of tea per 100 milliliters of water. For darker oolongs, you can use as many as eight to 10 grams for that same volume, then steep them in a series of short 30-second infusions. Adjust as you make your tea. Maintain healthy habits like exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet and drinking oolong tea daily to boost your overall well-being.

https://food.news/2023-02-13-adding-milk-to-coffee-helps-fight-inflammation.html,"Adding milk to coffee can help fight inflammation, suggests study",0,"Advertisement Coffee is one of the most popular beverages around the world. And while some people like drinking it with other ingredients like creamer, sugar or flavored syrups, others prefer drinking black coffee. But according to a study, drinking coffee with milk can help protect against inflammation. In a preliminary study of isolated cells, researchers found that the specific combination of coffee and milk may have inflammation-fighting properties. The study was conducted by scientists from the University of Copenhagen who set out to determine how polyphenols, the compounds commonly found in plant foods like coffee that are known to fight inflammation, bind to milk proteins and boost their anti-inflammatory effects. The research team caused artificial inflammation in immune cells and then treated those cells with either polyphenols alone or polyphenols that had reacted with proteins in milk. Upon examining data from their experiments, the researchers found that the immune cells that received the polyphenols-milk protein combination were twice as effective at fighting inflammation. This suggests that enjoying your breakfast with a combination of the polyphenols found in coffee and milk proteins may help protect your body against inflammation. The researchers specifically tested coffee drinks with milk to confirm if the phenomenon occurred. Professor Marianne N. Lund, one of the lead authors of the study, explained that the results showed that the reaction between polyphenols and proteins also occurred in some of the coffee drinks with milk that they studied. (Related: Study: Cherries can help fight heart disease, diabetes and other inflammatory diseases.) Lund also thinks that the polyphenol-protein anti-inflammatory benefit can also occur in other food or beverage pairings. She suggested that something similar could happen in a meat dish with vegetables or a smoothie made with some protein like milk or yogurt. Since this is a preliminary study on isolated cells, the research team plans to continue studying this phenomenon in animals and then humans to learn more about it on a more practical level. “It is clearly imaginable that this cocktail could also have a beneficial effect on inflammation in humans. We will now investigate further, initially in animals. After that, we hope to receive research funding, which will allow us to study the effect on humans,” concluded Lund. While scientists continue to examine the potential health benefits of coffee and milk, here are other polyphenol-rich foods that can help prevent inflammation: Eat more foods full of polyphenols According to data, there are over 100 foods that are known to be rich in polyphenols. Here are some polyphenol-rich superfoods that you can add to your regular diet: Aside from milk, you can add some superfoods from this list to your morning coffee like cocoa powder, dark chocolate or flaxseed. Try using a collagen supplement If you also want to boost your bone and skin health, try adding collagen powder to your coffee. A high-quality collagen supplement that contains proteins and antioxidants can support your immune system along with your bone and skin health. Stick to plain coffee While the study suggests that drinking coffee with milk may help fight against inflammation, that doesn’t mean you should start every day with a sugary iced coffee. Many coffee drinks with different add-ons have more sugar than a can of soda. This is bad for your health, especially if you drink a lot of syrupy sweet iced coffee, because sugar is known to trigger inflammation. Preliminary research suggests that the polyphenols in coffee and the proteins in milk react to help boost your cells’ inflammation-fighting powers. While more research can help scientists understand this impressive health benefit, follow a balanced diet and eat fruits and vegetables full of compounds like polyphenols to protect against inflammation. Aside from adding milk, here are other ways to make your cup of joe healthy: Choose a quality brand of organic coffee The quality of your coffee will depend on the processing method and how the coffee beans were grown. Coffee beans are often sprayed with synthetic pesticides and other chemicals that are bad for your health. If you are worried about the pesticide content of your coffee, try buying organic coffee beans. Organic coffee beans should contain much lower amounts of synthetic pesticides. Add a bit of cinnamon Cinnamon is a flavorful spice and it also pairs nicely with the flavor of coffee. According to research, cinnamon can help lower blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides in people with diabetes. If you need some flavor, but are watching your sugar intake, add a dash of cinnamon to your cup of joe. To lower the risk of potential adverse effects, buy Ceylon cinnamon instead of the more common Cassia cinnamon. Add some cocoa Cocoa is a superfood full of beneficial antioxidants. It is also linked to several health benefits, such as a lower risk of heart disease. The next time you’re making coffee, add a dash of cocoa powder for some added flavor. Many coffee shops serve caffe mocha, a chocolate-flavored version of caffe latte. However, caffè mocha is usually sugar-sweetened, which can be bad for your health if you need to monitor your sugar consumption. Instead, check recipes online and make caffe mocha at home, but skip the added sugar. Don’t add too much sugar Coffee by itself is healthy, but adding too many ingredients like sugar and flavored syrups can turn it into something harmful. Keep in mind that added sugar is probably one of the worst ingredients in the modern diet. Sugar, mainly due to its high amount of fructose, is linked to many health issues such as obesity and diabetes. If you can’t drink black coffee, try a natural sweetener like stevia or add a bit of cinnamon or cocoa to your cup of joe. Avoid low-fat and artificial creamers If you love coffee, but are watching your weight, using ingredients like low-fat and artificial creamers may seem like a good idea. But products like commercial low-fat and artificial creamers are usually highly processed and may contain ingredients with adverse effects. Also, there isn’t much research on how non-dairy coffee creamers affect human health. While their contents vary by brand, some may be healthier than others. However, in general, it is better to use whole, natural foods. Instead of a non-dairy creamer, try adding some full-fat cream in your coffee, preferably from grass-fed cows. According to research, milk products contain some important nutrients. Dairy is a great source of calcium and it may help reduce the risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures. Grass-fed cow’s milk contains some vitamin K, which can also help boost bone health. Drink coffee with a bit of milk to help protect your body against inflammation.

https://food.news/2023-02-10-increase-daily-intake-fruits-vegetables-live-longer.html,"Increasing your daily intake of fruits and vegetables can truly help you live longer, reveals study",0,"Advertisement Research has proven that following a nutritious diet is key to maintaining your overall health. According to a study, eating more fruits and vegetables can help you live longer. Fruits and vegetables contain carbohydrates, dietary fiber and protein. Research shows that they also offer vitamins, minerals, carotenoids and polyphenols that can help protect against chronic diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease. The study was published in The Journal of Nutrition. The research team was led by Atsushi Goto, a professor at Yokohama City University, and Hitoshi Nakagama, president of the National Cancer Center Japan. The researchers conducted a 20-year research survey on the link between eating fruits and vegetables and all-cause mortality. Upon examining data from volunteers, they discovered that those who ate more vegetables and fruits had a seven to eight percent lower risk of death over 20 years, compared to those who consumed fewer vegetables and fruits. According to Goto, earlier European and American studies had confirmed that “eating more fruits and vegetables can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease and the risk of all-cause mortality effectively.” But the heredity, lifestyle and diet of westerners are different from Asians. For the Japanese study, scientists selected 95,000 male and female volunteers aged 40 to 69. The volunteers resided in 11 Japanese prefectures and cities between 1990 and 1993. After excluding people with cancer, cardiovascular disease and liver disorders, the remaining volunteers were chosen for a long-term questionnaire survey. The researchers gathered the results of the questionnaire, then they compiled statistics on the daily fruit and vegetable intake of the participants. The participants were divided into five groups based on the amount of intake, from highest to lowest. The group with the lowest fruit and vegetable intake was the control group and they were compared to the other groups for subsequent risk of death from all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. In 2018, 20 years after the study began, the follow-up results revealed that the risk of all-cause death was reduced by at least eight to nine percent in the high fruits and vegetables intake group. Meanwhile, the risk of death from cardiovascular disease was reduced by nine percent. The analysis of fruit intake found that the risk of all-cause death was reduced by eight percent in the highest intake group while the risk of death from cardiovascular disease was reduced by 13 percent. It was particularly noticeable in the female participants. (Related: Improve your well-being and boost longevity with the Blue Zones diet.) After reviewing the volunteers’ vegetable intake, the researchers found that the group that consumed the most vegetables had a seven percent lower risk of death than the group that consumed the least. And when mortality was analyzed separately for the male and female participants, results revealed that higher fruit intake in men was linked to lower respiratory mortality. The same in women was linked to lower cardiovascular mortality. After studying the result of the analysis, the scientists concluded that fruits and vegetables full of vitamins and dietary fiber have a crucial role in people’s health. They recommended the intake of more than 300 grams (10.5 ounces) of vegetables and more than 140 grams (five ounces) of fruits daily. “I hope this research result can provide data as a basic reference to the general public about the daily intake of fruits and vegetables,” concluded Goto. In another study, researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and other institutions examined data from at least 1.9 million people worldwide. Their findings also showed that consuming an appropriate amount of fruit and vegetable daily can help extend life expectancy. The research results were published in the journal Circulation. The researchers reported that not all vegetables and fruits can reduce the risk of mortality. Specifically, starchy vegetables like corn, peas and potatoes and some fruit juices aren’t associated with lowering the risk of death from all-cause or certain chronic diseases. The research team advised that eating green leafy vegetables like kale, lettuce and spinach, berries, citrus fruits and carrots, which are full of beta-carotene and vitamin C, have all shown benefits in reducing the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Eating healthy requires a lot of discipline. If you need help increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables, check out the tips below: Stock up on healthy snacks In a 2018 study, scientists compared the food choices people made when given three options: The results suggest that getting rid of the less healthy options was more likely to result in healthy choices than any other scenario. While it’s good to eat more fruits and vegetables, eliminating junk food alternatives will also help improve your eating habits. Start your day with a fruit smoothie If you don’t like the taste of kale or spinach, you can “hide” the taste by making a fruit smoothie for breakfast. Add fruits and vegetables to your favorite dishes If you cook at home, you can increase your intake of fruits and vegetables by adding them to your favorite foods. For breakfast, you can add fruit to cereal or yogurt. You can also add blueberries or strawberries to pancakes. Another option is to stuff an omelet with extra vegetables like mushrooms, bell peppers and chopped carrots. Add more vegetables to a sandwich and add vegetable toppings if you’re having some pizza. When making pasta or your favorite casserole, add leafy greens like spinach or kale. Do more meal prep If you’re busy, save time on meal prep by chopping up vegetables in advance and storing them in your fridge. This makes it easier to add more veggies to your meals. Make a list of your favorite plant-based recipes You can also save time on meal prep by making a list of your favorite recipes for plant-based dishes. Before you buy groceries, check your recipes so you can easily buy the missing ingredients. Choose three or four to buy every week. Prepare vegetarian dishes Try to make vegetarian dishes at least once a week and prepare a new vegetarian recipe for dinner. Once you get used to eating meatless dishes, try to prepare vegetarian dishes several times a week. Enjoy healthy snacks Instead of gorging on candy and junk food with no nutritional value, enjoy healthy snacks like a piece of fresh or dried fruit. Make sure you buy products without added sugar. If you prefer something savory, prepare carrot and celery sticks with a low-fat dip or make baked chips with fresh salsa. Buy canned and frozen produce If you don’t have access to fresh produce, you can opt for canned and frozen fruits and vegetables, which are just as nutritious as fresh produce. You can also save a bit of money since canned and frozen products are usually more cost-efficient. Remember to check labels because some canned options can have lots of added sodium or sugar. Shop seasonally To make the most of your shopping, buy fruits and vegetables in season. Save money by visiting a farmers market and taking note of which products are in season.

https://food.news/2023-02-07-high-fat-diet-junk-food-rewires-brain.html,High-fat diet and junk food rewire the brain and regulate appetite,0,"Advertisement Eating fatty foods and junk food like burgers and fried chicken can make you overweight, but in a way that affects your brain health. According to a study, eating junk food and following a high-fat diet rewires your brain. This can reduce your ability to “regulate appetite and regulate calorie consumption.” The researchers hope that their findings can one day be used to develop an anti-obesity pill that targets neurons in the brain. Details of the study were published in The Journal of Physiology. According to data from animal studies, cells called astrocytes control a chemical pathway to the gut. But the new study shows that continuously consuming fatty and sugary foods disrupts this crucial link. Dr. Kirsteen Browning, the study’s lead author from Penn State College of Medicine, explained that calorie intake seems to be regulated in the short term by astrocytes. Following a high-fat or high-calorie diet for at least three to five days has the greatest effect on astrocytes and triggers the normal signaling pathway to control the stomach. Eventually, astrocytes seem to desensitize to high-fat food. Browning added that after following a high-fat or high-calorie diet for 10 to 14 days, astrocytes fail to react and the brain’s ability to regulate calorie intake is lost. This then disrupts the signaling to the stomach and delays how it empties. (Related: Consuming too much fast food can cause irreversible brain damage, warn health experts.) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 40 percent of U.S. adults are obese. This increases their risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. Experts believe that learning more about the brain’s role and the complex mechanisms that lead to gluttony can be used to develop therapies for treating weight gain. Astrocytes initially react when you eat junk food, which then releases gliotransmitters. Gliotransmitters are chemicals that stimulate neurons that ensure the stomach “contracts correctly to fill and empty in response to food passing through the digestive system.” When something inhibits astrocytes, it disrupts the cascade. The decrease in signaling chemicals results in a delay in digestion because the stomach doesn’t fill and empty appropriately. For the study, researchers used behavioral observation to monitor food intake in more than 200 lab rodents fed either a normal or high-fat diet for one, three, five or 14 days. The behavioral observation was combined with pharmacological and specialist genetic techniques to target distinct neural circuits. This allowed the scientists to specifically inhibit astrocytes in a particular region of the brainstem – the posterior part that is connected to the spinal cord. The scientists then studied how individual neurons behaved when the animal subjects were awake. They reported that if the same mechanism occurs in humans, medication could be used to safely target the mechanism if the treatment doesn’t affect other neural pathways. According to Browning, more research is needed to confirm “whether the loss of astrocyte activity and the signaling mechanism is the cause of overeating or that it occurs in response to the overeating.” She added that the research team wants to find out whether it is possible to reactivate the brain’s apparent lost ability to regulate calorie intake. If this is the case, the research could be used to develop interventions that can help restore calorie regulation in humans. If you eat a lot of junk food and are worried about your health, make lifestyle changes to lower your risk of developing many health issues like obesity, diabetes and heart problems.

https://food.news/2023-02-03-artificial-sweeteners-weight-loss-increase-diabetes-risk.html,"Using artificial sweeteners for weight loss can increase diabetes risk, warn researchers",0,"Advertisement Maintaining a healthy weight is necessary for your overall well-being. Some people are using artificial sweeteners thinking it will help them lose weight. But according to a review, using artificial sweeteners for weight loss can increase your risk of developing diabetes. Using artificial sweeteners to reduce your calorie intake can also affect your gut health, warned health experts. In a review published in the journal Endocrine Practice, researchers analyzed studies that focused on the long-term and neurohormonal effects of artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, saccharin and sucralose. According to the review findings, acute and chronic users of artificial sweeteners experienced changes in their gut microbiome, pointing to an inflammatory pattern of gut microbiota. The older study published in the journal Nature also had similar and alarming conclusions. Data showed that even non-caloric sweeteners can still damage gut health. In some cases, the use of sweeteners also caused glucose intolerance in mice and some people. The research team reported that these observed changes were nearly identical to the gut changes previously associated with health issues like diabetes and obesity in humans. While conducting the Nature study, scientists discovered that the animal subjects that received a 10 percent solution of one of three commonly used artificial sweeteners (aspartame, saccharin or sucralose) had elevated glucose levels in their blood after 11 weeks compared to the mice that were given plain water or even a 10 percent glucose solution. Elevated glucose or hyperglycemia is linked to health issues like insulin resistance, diabetes, early heart disease and other serious health complications. Hyperglycemia has also been associated with a higher incidence of mortality. Data revealed that saccharin had the most pronounced effects on gut health out of the three artificial sweeteners used. However, all three affected the microbiome and, eventually, glucose levels. In follow-up experiments, the animal subjects were given a high-fat diet and a 10 percent saccharin solution. The resulting changes in glucose metabolism reproduced the results found when the mice were fed a regular diet and a much higher saccharin dose. This suggests that higher fat consumption could worsen saccharin’s metabolic impact. Results of metagenomic sequencing showed that animal subjects that received saccharin had a different gut bacteria profile compared to the mice that received water or a glucose solution. The researchers were then able to identify a specific microbe-mediated mechanism that let the artificial sweeteners affect glucose metabolism among the test subjects. (Related: Not so sweet: Study links artificial sweeteners to liver damage.) The researchers also observed a similar metabolic response and change in gut bacteria in humans. The research team observed 381 non-diabetic volunteers who answered questions about their eating habits. The volunteers who reported that they used artificial sweeteners also had higher fasting glucose levels. The same volunteers also exhibited poorer glucose tolerance and altered gut microbe profiles compared to the people who did not use artificial sweeteners. These differences were more noticeable when people consumed higher amounts of artificial sweeteners. The differences also persisted even when the results were corrected for body mass index (BMI). The results of the animal studies and human trials confirm that using artificial sweeteners that are allegedly safe can cause health issues like diabetes and obesity instead of helping you prevent these conditions. The connection was hinted at in previous studies, but the Weizmann experiments are crucial because they provided concrete evidence on how exactly these sweeteners alter the population of intestinal bacteria. Having a healthy gut bacteria profile is crucial because these microbes direct metabolism and convert the food you eat into energy for your body or as stored fuel for later use. Despite the adverse effects linked to artificial sweeteners, these food additives are some of the most widely used worldwide. People who are unable to tolerate sugar and others who are trying to lose weight often consume products containing these alternative sweeteners. If you have diabetes, it can be a struggle if you want to follow a balanced diet but enjoy the occasional dessert. Instead of depriving yourself of your favorite foods and binge eating, improve your eating habits and be disciplined so you can have a bit of cake and eat it too. Get smaller portions If you have diabetes, you can still have desserts, but in moderation. This means you can get some cake, but ask for a smaller slice or share it with somebody. If you are eating at home, cut baked goods into smaller pieces so you don’t overeat. Swap carbs If you want to have some dessert, skip a starchy vegetable or other carbohydrates at mealtime. Skipping a carbohydrate serving during your main meal can help you avoid spiking your blood sugar levels when you eat dessert later. Keep in mind that this is only something you should do occasionally since most starches in your main meal, like a serving of potatoes, are probably going to be more nutritious than dessert. Prepare homemade desserts By making desserts at home, you can control the ingredients that you use to make the dessert. This means you can substitute ingredients, like whole-grain flour instead of all-purpose flour, to make the dessert fit into your diet plan. Making desserts at home also helps you avoid buying packaged sweets and desserts that usually contain many harmful additives. Eat dark chocolate Dark chocolate with no added sugar may offer benefit if you have Type 2 diabetes. Chocolate offers several potential health benefits, such as helping control blood sugar levels. According to a study paper published in 2017, chocolate could have some benefits for managing Type 2 diabetes. But researchers also warned that many manufacturers add a lot of sugar to their products, which can be bad if you have diabetes. If you’re craving something sweet, eat dark chocolate in moderation. Dark chocolate is also very rich, making it easy to satisfy your craving without eating too much chocolate. Snack on fruit and fruit salads Fruits are high in sugar, but they also contain many nutrients like vitamins and fiber. According to the American Diabetes Association, you can eat fruit or fruit salads as a way to satisfy cravings for sweets. If you have diabetes, make sure you choose fresh, frozen or fruit canned in water instead of fruit salads canned in sugary syrups. Avoid the harmful side effects of artificial sweeteners to reduce your risk of developing diabetes. Instead, improve your eating habits and snack on fresh fruits.

https://food.news/2023-02-02-barley-grass-gut-health-protect-against-cancer.html,Beneficial enzymes in barley grass can boost gut health and protect against cancer,0,"Advertisement Supplements can help you get the nutrients you need, but it’s also important to follow a balanced diet and eat a variety of nutritious foods like green foods, which provide your body with essential nutrients. Green foods like barley grass contain beneficial enzymes that provide your body with vitamins, minerals and other nutrients in the most natural and readily available way. If you’re still on the fence about adding barley grass to your diet, read on to find out why you should try it. Barley grass is worth trying because it offers several health benefits. Data suggests that barley grass can support a healthy gut microbiota. It can also help your body eliminate accumulated toxins by relieving inflammation in the gut. (Related: These 3 foods can boost your heart and gut health.) Incorporating barley grass into your diet helps boost your immune system, promotes optimal acid-alkali balance and naturally cleanses and detoxifies your body. Barley grass contains potent antioxidants that can protect against radiation and cell damage by helping regenerate damaged issues. Barley grass can also help prevent the development of several diseases linked to oxidative stress. It works with vitamin E and beta carotene and functions as a supplier of the critical enzyme superoxide dismutase. Data suggests that barley grass can be used to prevent and treat cancer thanks to superoxide dismutase. This enzyme helps neutralize the effects of oxygen-free radicals produced during energy metabolism. The enzymes in barley grass help suppress the rapid growth of cancer cells by decomposing and counteracting the effects of toxic hydrogen peroxide, which is generated during respiration. Barley grass can also help you maintain healthy skin and bones and promote agility. It can even help the body deal with stress and keep cholesterol levels in check. When paired with a healthy lifestyle and a balanced diet, barley grass can help purify the blood. The vitamin E in barley grass helps regulate optimal hormone balance. Barley grass also contains vitamin K, which has a crucial role in assuring normal bone metabolism. Barley grass also helps boost concentration and reduces the effects of learning disorders. Barley grass leaves are full of vitamins and minerals such as: Barley grass contains at least 30 times more vitamin B1 and 11 times the amount of calcium in cow’s milk. Compared to spinach, barley grass contains nearly five times more iron. It also contains at least seven times the vitamin C in oranges, four times the vitamin B1 in whole wheat flour and 80 micrograms of vitamin B12 per 100 grams of dried barley plant juice. To add barley grass to your regular diet, consume it as a juice extract from cereal grass sprouts. You can also buy it as a green powder and use it to make juices or smoothies.

https://food.news/2023-02-02-prepping-food-safety-freeze-dry-dehydrate-storage.html,Learn how to freeze-dry and dehydrate food for long-term storage,0,"Advertisement If you want to avoid harmful ingredients in food like added chemicals and other dangerous ingredients, you can learn how to preserve food using methods like freeze-drying or dehydration. (h/t to AllNewsPipeline.com) Consumers are often dealing with food shortages and increasing food prices. If you want to secure more supplies for your stockpile before SHTF, invest in appliances that you can use to preserve food like a freeze-dryer or a dehydrator. You can also start a home garden to grow fresh, organic food for your whole family. (Related: Food preservation tips: How to salt meat for your stockpile.) Freeze-drying machines are the more expensive option, with used machines being sold for at least $1,000. New freeze-drying machines can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $4,000. To save money, you can also opt to freeze-dry food at home using alternative methods. The home freezer method Freeze-drying food may seem overwhelming, but you can also do it with a home freezer. However, since you don’t have a freeze-dryer this method will take longer. To freeze-dry food using your freezer, you will need the following items. Preparation: The dry ice method The dry ice method doesn’t require special machinery. You will need the following items: Since dry ice lets all moisture from food evaporate very quickly, this method is much faster than using a home freezer, unless it is incredibly humid in your area. Ideally, you should start the freeze-drying process when the humidity level is low if not zero. This is because the more moisture in the air, the longer the freeze-drying process will take. Preparation: If you prefer a faster method, learn how to make dehydrated food. Knowing how to dehydrate food can also help prevent food waste since you can preserve items to be used later before they go bad. There are two ways to store dehydrated food for long-term storage: Using a canning jar sealer and using Mylar bags and oxygen absorbers. To dehydrate foods like fruits and vegetables, you will need a dehydrator and vacuum-sealed bags to store food. You can also store dehydrated food in clean canning jars, airtight food containers or freezer bags. Vegetables Vegetables must be dehydrated at 125 to 135 F for eight to 12 hours. Generally, when dehydrating food that you eat raw you don’t need to pre-cook it before drying. However, vegetables like broccoli, celery and corn should be blanched before dehydrating. Blanching means cooking the food item in boiling water and submerging it in cold water. Blanching denatures enzymes that may affect the shelf-life and quality of the vegetables. To cut this step out, you can dehydrate frozen vegetables since they are already pre-cooked/blanched and ready to dehydrate. Fruit Fruit needs to be dried at 135 to 145 F for eight to 15 hours. Before dehydrating, some fruits like apples and bananas need to be treated with a citrus wash to delay browning. If you want to dehydrate other fruits, check food-specific recipes for the best results. After drying, the fruit’s moisture content should be around 20 percent. Even if you’re extra careful, the fruit will dry unevenly. Fruit also requires an extra step before storing. After the fruit cools completely, store it in plastic bags or glass jars for seven to 10 days. Shake the jars daily. Once done, store the fruit as is or ground it up into a powder. During this time, condensation should not develop. If it does, it means there is too much moisture in the fruit, so process it again in your dehydrator. Jerky Jerky should be dried at 160 F for four to eight hours. When processing meat to make jerky, follow recipes properly to avoid the risk of harmful bacteria. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Jerky and Food Safety Fact Sheet, bacteria in meat can survive the temperatures of a dehydrator (150 to 160 F) when cooked at a warm temperature for a long time. To minimize the risk of food born illnesses from E. coli and salmonella, meat and chicken need to be pre-cooked at 160 F and 165 F, respectively, before dehydrating. Doing this helps destroy harmful bacteria that would survive under a dehydrator’s temperature setting. Note that the shelf life of homemade jerky is one to two months. Meanwhile, store-bought jerky can last from eight months to one year. Here are different foods that you can dehydrate at home: Fruits: Vegetables: Herbs: Here are other methods to try if you don’t want to spend money on a dehydrator: Sun drying Sun drying is one of the oldest and simplest methods used to dehydrate foods. With this method, you need to lay fruits like figs or mangos on a mesh screen or tray made with wooden dowels. Next, cover the food with a second screen to protect it from pests and insects. You can use this method if you are in a sunny area with low humidity and a minimum temperature of 86 F. When using this method, avoid screens made with hardware cloth because they may oxidize and leave residue on your food. Note that sundrying fruits may take several days to fully dry. Air drying Air drying is another simple dehydration method that doesn’t require any special equipment. Like sun drying, air drying places food in the shade instead of the sun. This helps protect foods from the sun’s powerful rays and it’s a great method for dehydrating herbal teas, leafy greens and spices. Solar drying Solar dehydrators are powered by the sun and they can be used to dehydrate food even without electricity. Some solar dehydrators look like a tabletop greenhouse. You can buy one or make it at home using materials that you can get from the local hardware store. Oven drying An oven that reaches a temperature of at least 140 F can also be used to dehydrate food. While oven drying can take at least six to 10 hours depending on the specific food, this method is ideal if you don’t want to buy a dehydrator. Make sure your oven can be set to a temperature of 140 F or less since higher temperatures will cook food instead of drying it. Prop the door open while dehydrating foods so extra moisture can escape during the drying process. Secure supplies for your survival stockpile by learning how to properly freeze-dry or dehydrate food like fruits and vegetables. These food preservation methods can also help you save money and avoid food waste. Visit Foodstorage.news to read more articles with tips on food storage and preservation.

https://food.news/2023-01-27-research-curcumin-turmeric-helps-with-ibd-symptoms.html,Research suggests curcumin from turmeric can help with IBD symptoms,0,"Advertisement Digestive issues like bloating and cramping are common, but if you have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), your symptoms are more severe. IBD symptoms can even be life-threatening. There is no mainstream cure for IBD, and treatment options range from pharmaceuticals like steroids and immunosuppressants. Following specialized diets and taking herbal nutraceuticals can help if you have IBD. According to data presented at a Crohn’s & Colitis conference, curcumin, the active anti-inflammatory compound in turmeric, also offer benefits for people with IBD. The latest study findings presented at the 2023 Crohn’s & Colitis Congress included these three new developments in treatment options for IBD: Treating Crohn’s disease in oxygen chambers A meta-review of the use of hyperbaric oxygen revealed that this therapy was effective at reducing inflammation. Data showed that the treatment helped improve symptoms among study participants. Predicting IBD flares with an Apple Watch Experts found that the nervous symptom markers measurable on wearable devices like the Apple Watch can help predict IBD flares. The ability to predict these flares can help patients start their treatments earlier, which makes them more effective. (Related: Study: Ultra-processed foods linked to increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease.) Plant-based therapy against ulcerative colitis A combination treatment of two herbal compounds, curcumin and Qing Dai, an herbal formula popular in Chinese medicine, was found to be “significantly more effective at reducing symptoms” compared to a placebo in people with active ulcerative colitis. Alternative, herbal and plant therapies have been taken seriously and studied for more than a decade as treatment options for those living with IBD. These new findings can also be used to bolster modern medicine’s approach to disease in general. Studies, like those presented at the 2023 Crohn’s & Colitis Congress, also highlight how beneficial additional options and complementary therapies can be. Even if you don’t have inflammatory bowel disease, using herbal compounds like curcumin offers some health benefits. Consuming curcumin from turmeric can also provide joint comfort and support the immune system. The compound can also help boost your digestive health. Note that turmeric has low bioavailability, which means using the spice while cooking may fall short if you want to enjoy its therapeutic benefits. To boost your overall health, it is recommended to take a supplement specifically formulated for your needs. Always use quality supplements that are recommended by experts. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the term for two conditions, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, that are characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Prolonged inflammation causes damage to the GI tract. Here are the common symptoms of IBD: The exact cause of IBD is unknown, but the condition is often the result of a weakened immune system. One possible cause of IBD is when your immune system responds incorrectly to environmental triggers like a virus or bacteria, which will then lead to the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD might also have a genetic component. If you have a family history of IBD, you are more likely to develop the condition. IBD is diagnosed by: While it remains to be seen what the optimal dose of curcumin is, consuming turmeric through your regular diet may still offer some benefit. According to data, combining turmeric with black pepper can significantly enhance absorption. Piperine, black pepper’s signature compound, helps boost the absorption of turmeric by an impressive 2,000 percent. Add more turmeric to your diet and use it in foods like: No specific diet has been shown to prevent or treat inflammatory bowel disease, but some diet strategies can help you manage IBD symptoms. To identify problem foods, keep a detailed record of what you eat. Take note of when symptoms worsen to help you identify patterns that indicate which are your problem foods. There are different approaches to diet during flares and in the absence of flares. Regardless of your health issues, it’s best not to overly restrict your diet. Focus on avoiding problems foods and eating nutritious foods. Avoid foods that may increase stool output like fresh fruits and vegetables, prunes and caffeinated beverages. Decrease your alcohol consumption or avoid it completely. Limit or avoid concentrated sweets in your diet like candy, juices and soda. This will help decrease the amounts of water pulled into your intestine, which may cause watery stools. Incorporate more omega-3 fatty acids in your diet. Omega-3s have an anti-inflammatory effect and you can get them from fatty fish like herring, mackerel, salmon and sardines. Some patients reported that smaller, more frequent meals are better tolerated. Improving your eating habits can also help increase the amount of nutrition you receive every day. If you have a poor appetite and trouble tolerating solid foods, consider taking nutritional supplements. If you have strictures, avoid beans, kernels, nuts and seeds. You should also avoid foods that may increase stool output like fruits and vegetables, prunes and caffeinated beverages. Eating cold foods may help reduce diarrhea. If you are lactose intolerant, follow a lactose-free diet. Lactose intolerance causes symptoms like bloating, cramping, gas and diarrhea 30 to 90 minutes after eating milk, ice cream or large amounts of dairy. Take a breath hydrogen test if you think you have lactose intolerance. If your stools are oily and foul-smelling, fat malabsorption could be the culprit. Treat fat malabsorption by following a low-fat diet. Discuss your symptoms with your doctor or a nutritionist. Take smaller, more frequent meals because they are better tolerated and can help maximize your nutritional intake. If your appetite is decreased and you have trouble keeping solid foods down, you might benefit from taking nutritional supplements. Follow a balanced diet, avoid problem foods and incorporate turmeric into your diet to boost your digestive health and overall well-being.

https://food.news/2023-01-26-5-herbs-that-help-boost-respiratory-health.html,Medicinal plants: 5 Herbs that can help boost respiratory health,0,"Advertisement Cold and the flu are common during winter. You may need a home remedy to improve your symptoms so you can get some work done. If you’re looking for natural remedies for colds and the flu, try growing medicinal herbs like elderberry and ginger to boost your respiratory health. (h/t to TheOrganicPrepper.com) Before the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), people wouldn’t always feel the need to go to the doctor’s clinic if they are experiencing respiratory ailments. Many respiratory illnesses are viral, and a doctor would often send a patient home with the advice to rest, drink plenty of fluids, take some medication and a large medical bill. If you have the winter sniffles, here are some herbal alternatives to consider if you prefer natural remedies. You can grow echinacea, specifically Echinacea angustifolia and E. purpurea, if you want to have access to an herbal medicine that can help with certain health issues. According to Cat Ellis book “Prepper’s Natural Medicine,” cold and flu aren’t the best use of this herb. However, Ellis recommends echinacea in her elderberry and echinacea elixir, which is effective against rhinovirus. (Related: Study shows compounds in ancient herbal medicine can help increase longevity.) Elderberry syrup is easy to make and it can help with colds and the flu. Elderberry is an antiviral herb, meaning it attacks and destroys invading virus cells. If you take elderberry syrup within 48 hours of contracting the flu, it can help shorten the duration of your sickness. The herb is also a natural immune booster. Elderberries are full of beneficial flavonoids, especially anthocyanins which are responsible for their deep purple, almost black, color. These powerful antioxidants help boost your immune health. Anthocyanins clear your body of free radicals that damage cells at the DNA level. These compounds also have antiviral properties that may prevent or reduce the severity of certain common infections. Keep in mind that if you want to make elderberry syrup, you should only use the fruits and berries because the rest of the plant is toxic. If you want to grow elderberry, note that the plant is a large bush. If you are going to grow elderberry in a container, you should use a container that’s at least 24 inches across and 20 inches deep. You might need two compatible plants since elderberry requires cross-pollination. Also, elderberry might take over your garden so keep it contained in a large pot or bucket. Another option is to forage for elderberries to make syrup. Try the recipe below to make elderberry syrup at home: Ingredients: Preparation: Dose recommendations: You can grow some ginger at home by placing a fresh rhizome about two inches long in sandy soil and water. Moisten the ginger occasionally with a spray bottle of water. After about five weeks, you should have enough ginger to break a piece off of as needed. Care for the plant so it will continue to grow. Here is a recipe for a homemade ginger honey lemon tonic: Ingredients for one serving: Preparation: Slippery elm has many uses. It can help support respiratory health and relieve associated ailments. Star anise can help with respiratory ailment support, but make sure you are using the Chinese evergreen Illicium verum. Don’t take Illicium anisatum, the Japanese version, which is toxic. Follow this recipe if you want a soothing tea made with ginger, slippery elm and star anise. This will help if you are dealing with a cough and sore throat: Ingredients for one serving: Preparation: Note: The longer you let the mixture sit, the more gelled (thicker) the slippery elm bark will become. If you increase the amount of slippery elm powder, the tea will have a more gelled consistency. This cough drop recipe is made with ginger and chocolate, orange and honey. Take some cough drops if you have a cold, a cough or a sore throat. Ingredients: Preparation: Grow plants like elderberry or ginger in your garden so you have access to medicinal herbs that can help boost your respiratory health and protect against a cold or the flu.

https://food.news/2023-01-26-how-to-salt-meat-for-your-stockpile.html,Food preservation tips: How to salt meat for your stockpile,0,"Advertisement When you’re building a stockpile of emergency food and supplies, meat is one item that should be part of your list. Learn how to preserve meat through salting and curing if you want to save money on groceries. Dry salting or using a salt brine are meat preservation methods that you can use even without electricity, so it’s worth learning how to cure meat if you are worried about long-term power outages in your area. (h/t to ModernSurvivalBlog.com) Salt is used to cure and preserve meat because it inhibits the growth of microorganisms, including those found in meat. Salt preserves meat by drawing out water from the microbial cell by osmosis due to the high concentration of salt outside the cell. The cell loses water until it reaches a state where it cannot grow and is unable to survive. When stored properly, salt will also last a long time in your stockpile. To save time on moving salt to bigger containers, you can buy salt sold in 10-pound pails. You can also buy special salt specifically used to cure meat. While you can use almost any kind of food-grade salt for curing meat, some people recommend kosher salt (a coarse grind). Here are some tips and recipes that you can use to salt and cure meat. Salt beef Salt beef is also called corned beef and the use of the term “corned” stems from the fact that the Middle English word corn could refer to grains of salt and cereal grains. You can salt meat by adding dry salt or using brine. Try the recipe below to make salt beef at home. Ingredients for 8-10 servings: Preparation: Dry salting Dry salting or corning is a food preservation method that uses coarse “corns” or pellets of salt to dry-cure meat. Irish corned beef is made from beef brisket, but any cut of meat can be corned. Salt brine curing Salt brine curing uses brine made with salt to preserve meat. In the past, people added salt to the brine until they can float an egg in the liquid. However, it is more accurate to use a hydrometer. You can also keep things simple by following a reliable recipe. Once the brine is mixed and placed into your preferred container, submerge the meat you want to preserve in the salt brine. Note that brine curing usually produces an end product that is less salty compared to food preserved with dry curing. You can also inject brine into the meat to speed up the curing process. The salting meat process for preservation is rather straightforward. First, you must rinse the fresh meat in cool water. Pour a thin layer of salt, such as kosher salt, all over the meat and rub it in. Hang or set the meat out in a cool environment that is under 50 F but not below freezing for several weeks to dry it out. Before cooking the meat, rinse off the salt with water. (Related: 12 Food preservation and food storage techniques you can use when SHTF.) If you’re only using salt with no other preservative method, it’s best to use a 20 percent salt concentration on the surface of the meat to effectively kill off most types of microbes and fungi that can spoil the food.

https://food.news/2023-01-17-study-fast-food-consumption-fatty-liver-disease.html,Study links fast food consumption to fatty liver disease,0,"Advertisement A study has determined that eating fast food increases your risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) even if you follow a healthy diet. NAFLD causes fat buildup in your liver and can be fatal. Researchers from the University of Southern California found that people who are obese or have diabetes and get more than 20 percent of their daily calories from fast food have “severely elevated” fat levels in their livers compared to those who consume less or no fast food. Results of the study also showed that among the general population, “if more than a fifth of a person’s diet consists of fast food, it will increase fat levels in their liver.” Details of the study were published in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. Dr. Ani Kardashian, a hepatologist with Keck Medicine and lead author of the study, explained that healthy livers contain a small amount of fat, usually less than five percent. However, even a moderate increase in fat can result in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Kardashian added that the “severe rise in liver fat in those with obesity or diabetes” is alarming. She noted that this may be because these conditions increase your risk of having fat build up in the liver. This isn’t the first study to suggest a link between fast food consumption and obesity and diabetes. However, it is one of the first projects to highlight the negative impact of fast food on liver health, specifically. The study results also showed that consuming modest amounts of high-carb, high-fat fast food can harm liver health. Kardashian said if you only eat one meal a day at a fast food restaurant, you might think it isn’t bad for your health. But if that one meal makes up at least one-fifth of your daily calories, you are putting your liver at risk. (Related: Glutathione helps fight fatty liver disease, reveals study.) Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or liver steatosis, can cause cirrhosis or scarring of the liver. In some cases, cirrhosis may eventually cause liver cancer or failure. More than 30 percent of the U.S. population has liver steatosis. For the study, researchers analyzed the most recent available data from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Doing this helped researchers find out the impact of fast food consumption on liver steatosis. For the study, the scientists characterized fast food as meals like pizza from either a drive-through restaurant or an eatery without a wait staff. The researchers evaluated the fatty liver measurements of at least 4,000 adult participants and then compared their responses regarding fast food habits. Among the survey participants, 52 percent reported eating some fast food. Within that group, 29 percent consumed one-fifth or more of their daily calories from fast food. Notably, only that 29 percent experienced an increase in liver fat levels. The association was intact for both the general population and those with obesity or diabetes even after researchers accounted for additional factors like age, sex, race, ethnicity, alcohol use and physical activity levels. The results are worrying since fast-food consumption has increased within the last 50 years, regardless of socioeconomic status, said Kardashian. She added that they also observed a “substantial surge in fast-food dining during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is probably related to the decline in full-service restaurant dining and rising rates of food insecurity.” The researchers are worried that the number of those with fatty livers has continued to increase since the time of the survey. The study authors hope that the results of their research can help encourage more doctors and healthcare providers to educate their patients when it comes to nutrition, particularly about the dangers of eating too much fast food. Keep in mind that the only way to treat liver steatosis is by switching to a balanced diet. Since the first line of treatment for NAFLD is weight loss, you can reduce your calorie intake, improve your eating habits and exercise regularly. The diet for fatty liver disease includes: Additionally, the amount of weight that you should lose to treat NAFLD will depend on the amount of excess body fat that you have. Consult a physician to determine an appropriate weight loss goal based on your overall health. Health experts recommend a nutrient-dense, whole-food-based diet full of foods rich in fiber, protein and unsaturated fats for those with NAFLD. These superfoods should be part of a healthy liver diet: Leafy greens Compounds found in leafy greens like spinach may help fight fatty liver disease. The results of a 2021 study revealed that eating spinach specifically lowered the risk of NAFLD, possibly because the vegetable contains nitrate and distinct polyphenols. For the study, researchers focused on raw spinach since cooked spinach did not have the same strong results. This could be because cooking spinach and other leafy green vegetables may result in lower polyphenolic content and antioxidant activity. Fatty fish Fatty fish like salmon, sardines, trout and tuna are full of omega-3 fatty acids. Studies suggest that supplementing with omega-3s may benefit those with NAFLD by reducing liver fat, boosting protective HDL cholesterol and lowering triglyceride levels. Oatmeal Oatmeal and other whole-grain, fiber-rich foods may help reduce your risk of developing NAFLD-related diseases. According to research, a nutritious diet that includes fiber-rich foods like oats is effective for those with NAFLD. It can also help reduce triglyceride levels. If you have fatty liver disease, you may benefit from avoiding certain foods or reducing your intake.

https://food.news/2023-01-16-tea-reduces-dementia-risk-improves-cognitive-function.html,Regular consumption of tea found to reduce risk of dementia and improve cognitive function,0,"Advertisement Dementia is characterized by symptoms like memory loss and impaired judgment. Once considered a disease primarily affecting the elderly, many people under the age of 65 are now getting diagnosed with dementia. Fortunately, a study has found that there’s an easy way to improve cognitive function. According to researchers, consuming tea can help inhibit or slow down the aging of the brain and improve cognitive function. Details of the study were published in the journal Translational Psychiatry. A team that includes neurology researchers from Fudan University-affiliated Huashan Hospital and the Department of Neurology of Qingdao University-affiliated Qingdao Municipal Hospital conducted a survey in the U.K. from 2006 to 2010. The results of the survey revealed that people who consumed tea drinks had a 16 percent lower overall risk of dementia than non-tea drinkers. (Related: Study: Drinking black tea helps increase longevity.) During that four-year period, the researchers selected 377,592 volunteers from 22 regions in the United Kingdom. The participants had an average age of 58.49 and 54.3 percent were women. The scientists divided the study participants into six groups: Data from proportional hazard regression models indicated a significant link between tea consumption and reduced risk of dementia. Specifically, the volunteers who consumed one to two cups of tea every day had their risk of dementia reduced by 17.7 percent. Those who drank three to four cups of tea reduced dementia risk by 20.8 percent and those who consumed five to six experienced a 19.7 percent risk reduction. The researchers added that among those who drank more than six cups per day, the risk of dementia was no different than that of non-tea drinkers. Further analysis into dementia types revealed that compared with the volunteers who did not drink tea at all, the people who consumed one to four cups a day had a 16.3 to 19.1 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. However, there was no significant difference after consuming over five cups of tea a day. In an analysis concerning vascular dementia, drinking one to six cups of tea daily was found to reduce the incidence rate by 25 to 29.2 percent. The scientists followed the volunteers for more than nine years and recorded a total of 5,122 cases of dementia. According to the researchers, tea consumption has been associated with protective benefits against several diseases. Tea leaves contain different biomacromolecules, the most notable among them being polyphenols in green tea. Polyphenols are linked to many cellular antioxidant and nerve rescue activities that prevent memory deficits. Biomacromolecules also have anti-inflammatory effects, which can help prevent cognitive decline. Experts believe dementia and Alzheimer’s disease are caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors such as diet and nutrition. Health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and obesity may also contribute to cognitive decline and these issues are usually affected by your diet. Following a healthy diet and eating a wide variety of nutritious foods is shown to help reduce the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease as you age. Aside from tea, these superfoods can help prevent cognitive decline and help you stay healthy as you age: Berries Fruits like blackberries, blueberries, cherries and raspberries are rich in anthocyanin. This flavonoid helps halt the progression of brain damage caused by harmful free radicals. These fruits and other berries are also great sources of beneficial antioxidants and vitamins that can help reduce inflammation and improve brain health. Cruciferous vegetables Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower are full of B vitamins and carotenoids that are found to reduce levels of homocysteine, an amino acid linked to cognitive decline, brain atrophy and dementia. You can eat more cruciferous vegetables by sauteing them in garlic and olive oil or using these superfoods to make soups or smoothies. Leafy greens Leafy greens such as collard greens, kale, spinach and Swiss chard are rich in essential B vitamins like folate and vitamin B9 that can help reduce depression. These nutrients can also help boost cognitive health. Add more leafy greens to your diet by eating salads and adding them to chilis, soups and stews. You can also puree leafy greens and add them to hummus, sauces and pesto. Nuts Nuts like almonds, cashews, peanuts, pecans and walnuts are full of healthy fats, magnesium, vitamin E and B vitamins that can all help boost cognitive health and stave off signs of dementia. According to a study, women older than 70 who eat at least five servings of nuts per week are shown to have significantly better brain health compared to other women in the same age group who don’t consume nuts. Results from another study revealed that the anti-inflammatory phytochemicals in English walnuts can help reduce inflammation of brain cells to maintain optimal brain health throughout the aging process. Omega-3s Foods like flaxseed, olive oil and fatty fish like mackerel, salmon and tuna are full of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids with DHA that boost brain health. Many studies have shown that omega-3s are effective at fighting and preventing dementia. Experts suggest taking 200 mg of DHA daily to achieve good brain health. However, the average daily intake of DHA in the U.S. is estimated to be only about 80 mg. Boost your brain health by consuming foods rich in omega-3s or taking quality DHA supplements.

https://food.news/2023-01-13-prepping-tips-building-one-year-food-supply.html,Prepping tips: How to start building a one-year food supply,0,"Advertisement If you truly want to be prepared for a long-term survival scenario, consider setting up a one-year food supply before SHTF. Since this can be time-consuming and expensive, work your way up to a one-year supply by starting with a more manageable goal, like a three-day supply of food for the whole family. (h/t to SurvivalSullivan.com) If you already have enough food supplies for one to two weeks, you’re one step closer to having enough food for one year. But if you are a prepping beginner or have only recently started stockpiling food supplies for emergencies, trying to stock up enough food for one year will seem very daunting. Start simple with a three-day supply of food, then move on to a one-week supply. As you get used to stockpiling food, add more supplies until you have enough for one month. Eventually, you should have enough for one year or so. (Related: Food supply 101: Tips for preparing a healthy food stockpile.) To find out how much food you need per day, start by figuring out how to determine your calorie targets. Multiply the number of people in your group or family by the number of days that you are planning for your stockpile. On average, one person needs 2,200 calories per day. Here are some sample equations: 2,200 cal x 4 people x 3 days = 26,400 calories in storage 2,200 cal x 4 people x 30 days = 264,000 calories in storage 2,200 cal x 4 people X 365 days = 3,212,000 calories in storage While a group of four people will require a lot of calories for one year, you can meet this need by scaling up when acquiring the food. The three-day supply is the gold standard for basic preparation. Common SHTF events that may last for three days or so include power outages. Your food choices are generally up to you, but you should consider stocking up on items that have a long shelf life and are easy to prepare. Make sure you buy things that you and your family don’t mind eating a lot of for three days. After you stock up on enough food for at least three days, aim for a one-week supply. This should be enough to get you through the aftermath of a serious localized disaster, like a long-term power outage. Keep things simple by duplicating your three-day supply and adding other new items so you have a variety of foods to make up the difference. A one-month supply of food on hand and in storage can help you and your family get through a significant regional disaster or other events that completely disrupt supply lines and your usual routine. Add more items to the list above, and make sure you store food properly so items stay fresh in your stockpile even after one month. You should also rotate supplies that don’t have a long shelf life to prevent spoilage. If storage space is an issue, consider setting up a separate room or building a secure shed for food storage. Items to add to your stockpile: A three-month supply of food can sustain a family or group of people through calamitous events like civil conflict or famine. Like with the one-month supply, you have to regularly rotate and inspect items to prevent spoilage. To stock up on this much food, duplicate your one-month food plan twice. Items to add to your stockpile: A six-month supply of food requires a significant investment of time and money that can help secure your survival when SHTF. However, the average home cannot hold a six-month supply of food without sacrificing most of the living and storage space. If space is an issue, invest in supplementary storage. To expand your stockpile into a six-month supply, duplicate your three-month purchase plan. Items to add to your stockpile: A one-year supply of food will prepare you and your family for almost any survival scenario, like the total collapse of an economy or civil war. Again, storage space will be an issue since you will have a lot more items in your stockpile. But if you have the room, this is achievable if you are dedicated to constantly expanding your supply over time. To build a one-year supply of food for your family, duplicate your six-month supply and add more items to prevent food boredom. Make sure your one-year supply of food lasts by storing items properly. Keep your storage location cool, preferably between 50 to 60 F (10 to 15 C) and under 75 F (24 C) if possible. Note that warmer temperatures accelerate spoilage, while cooler temperatures preserve food longer. Store food away from light, be it artificial light or sunlight, since it can promote decay. This amount of food is vulnerable to pests like rodents and insects, so make sure your stockroom is secured to keep out various pests. Pests like rats can still get into plastic containers. If possible, use air-tight metal containers for food storage. Before SHTF, make it a goal to have a one-year food stockpile so you can keep your family fed during a long-term survival scenario.

https://food.news/2023-01-05-prepper-projects-building-root-cellar-food-storage.html,Prepper projects: Building a root cellar for food storage,0,"Advertisement If you want to be more self-sufficient as a prepper, you can learn how to build a modern root cellar. Modern root cellars can be used to store local food and produce from your home garden. It can also be used as storage for canned goods throughout the winter. (h/t to PreparednessAdvice.com) A root cellar is a structure usually constructed below ground to store fruits, vegetables and dairy products. Here are several benefits of having a modern root cellar on your homestead: Read on to learn about tips that can help you build a modern root cellar on your homestead. Root cellars are often used to store fresh fruits, vegetables and dairy products. When considering your root cellar design, here are some factors you should take into account: Light Root cellars should be dark to prevent the growth of mold and mildew. Light can make food spoil quickly, which is why the area needs to be dark most of the time. Temperature The ideal temperature for storing fruits and vegetables in a root cellar is between 32 to 40 F. Below those temperatures, the cold air can make the food frozen. Above those temperatures, the heat may cause food spoilage. Humidity The ideal humidity level for storing fruits and vegetables is between 80 to 85 percent. Vegetables and fruit lose moisture over time, which is why the humidity level needs to be high. Note that if the humidity level is too high, it will cause mold and mildew to grow. Ventilation Root cellars must be well-ventilated to prevent the build-up of mold and mildew. Fresh vegetables and fruit create ethylene gas over time and the gas can increase spoilage over time. Setting up a good ventilation system will help prevent the ethylene gas from building up and causing food spoilage in the root cellar. The best location for a root cellar is in an area with cool temperatures and good drainage. While you can build a root cellar above ground, they are more commonly built below ground. When choosing a location for your root cellar, always consider the type of foundation you have, like dirt, concrete or stone. You must also factor in the size of space available and the climate in the area. A root cellar must also be kept cool so the root crops are kept cool enough to preserve them for several weeks or months. (Related: Prepping skills: 15 Food storage and preservation methods to learn before SHTF.) If you live in an urban or suburban setting, you may have to build a modern root cellar in a room of your house. When choosing a room, opt for one that you can keep at cool temperatures to ensure that the food stays fresh. This cold room will also give you easy access to your root crops and other food items. However, one disadvantage of having a root cellar in a room in your house is that the temperature and humidity levels may not be ideal for the long-term storage of certain fruits and vegetables. To keep the food cool and remove ethylene gas buildup in the room, you may need to install ventilation pipes and a proper ventilation system to have fresh air, especially during warmer temperatures. Additionally, you may need to insulate the interior walls to keep the room temperature consistent. If you have a home with a basement, you may want to use it to create a root cellar. Unlike an aboveground room, a basement root cellar has the advantage of being cooler and having better drainage. However, one disadvantage is that humidity levels in a basement can be high, which can cause the growth of mold and mildew linked to food spoilage. If you have a wine cellar that you don’t use, you may be able to repurpose it into a basement root cellar. Most of the time, a wine cellar is set up for a humidity level that is too low for cold storage. Fortunately, you can adjust it by adding pails of water for evaporative cooling in your root cellar. Before SHTF, build a modern root cellar on your homestead and use it as additional food storage for your survival stockpile. Watch the video below for a closer look at a 1920s root cellar.

https://food.news/2023-01-03-plant-cucumbers-early-avoid-downy-mildew-study.html,"Planting cucumbers early can help farmers avoid downy mildew, reveals study",0,"Advertisement Farmers who grow cucumbers in South Carolina experience huge crop losses every year due to a plant disease called downy mildew. Fortunately, researchers from Clemson University have discovered that planting cucumbers early can reduce growers’ losses from downy mildew to almost zero. Downy mildew is an oomycete or water mold that destroys plant foliage. The disease is common in cucurbits, a plant family that includes cucumbers, gourds, squashes and various melons. Pseudoperonospora cubensis, a pathogen similar to a fungus, causes cucurbit downy mildew. Infected plants develop angular, yellow or brown spots on their leaves. Cucurbit plants with downy mildew may die. Those that survive will have reduced or non-existent yields, and this can happen within a couple of weeks from the start of infection. It is important to catch a downy mildew infection early and take steps to prevent it. The study was conducted by Tony Keinath, a professor of plant pathology and Research and Extension vegetable pathologist at Clemson’s Coastal Research and Education Center (REC) in Charleston, and Felipe Silva, an assistant professor of agricultural economics in Clemson’s Department of Agricultural Sciences agribusiness program. Their findings revealed that growers can avoid downy mildew issues by planting cucumbers early. According to Keinath, downy mildew is the number one disease of cucumber plants in South Carolina. In their study, at least 72 percent of the crop planted late was lost to the disease, while there was no loss incurred for cucumbers that were planted early. Planting early can help crops mature before downy mildew can spread, said Keinath. This can help growers save money often spent on fungicides and labor. Based on the study findings, growers must plant cucumbers closer to the beginning of the planting period before temperatures get warm. Downy mildew outbreaks usually occur in mild, wet weather when rainwater washes spores out of the air and onto leaves. After the disease infects a plant, it will continue to spread even in dry weather if temperatures stay above 60 F. Keinath explained that planting earlier will help ensure that farmers can harvest their crops before downy mildew sets in. Early planting offers benefits for both conventional growers and organic growers. Most conventional growers use fungicides like Ranman, alternated with a protectant such as chlorothalonil or mancozeb before symptoms appear. Conventional growers can apply Gavel after symptoms appear to control downy mildew. Keinath added that organic growers can apply copper sprays to control the mold. Additionally, planting early can result in higher yields. The study revealed that cucumbers planted on March 24 yielded 1,648 cartons per acre, while cucumbers planted on May 12 yielded only 930 cartons per acre. P. cubensis does not overwinter in South Carolina but spreads from more southern states through windblown spores. The water mold can travel up to 1,000 miles in two days.

https://food.news/2023-01-03-emergency-food-supply-forage-cook-slugs-snails.html,Emergency food supply tips: How to forage and cook slugs and snails,0,"Advertisement In a survival scenario, you may have an easier time harvesting insects than trying to hunt animals for meat. Read up on how to forage for and cook something slower and easier to catch: slugs and snails. Slugs and snails might be the last thing you want for dinner, but you can’t afford to be picky when your supplies are running out in a post-SHTF world. (h/t to PreppersWill.com) People in countries like France, Portugal and Spain consider escargot, or cooked snails, as a delicacy, but the average American might have second thoughts about this unusual dish. Escargot is French for snail and this snail dish is often served exclusively at French restaurants. Depending on how you cook them, snails are fairly nutritious since they are high in protein and low in fat. Escargot is usually served as an appetizer or main entree. Traditionally, French-style cooked snails are served with parsley and garlic butter. The snails are then served hot and you get them out of their shell before eating. Shelled gastropod mollusks live in the oceans, in freshwater and on land. Those that have lost their gills and breathe air are the easiest to identify. Snails and slugs (or a snail without a shell) are high in nutrients, particularly protein and numerous minerals. Mollusks are relatively easy to find if the environment is damp, making them an accessible food source. Slugs and snails are nocturnal, meaning it’s best to hunt them at night. (Related: Food supply 101: Fish, a cheap and easy survival food.) Slugs are gastropod mollusks with no shells. Many slug species are generally regarded as being shell-less, but they actually have a reduced internal shell. The two common slug groups are round backs and keeled slugs. Slugs in the round back group have dome-shaped bodies, like the common garden slug. Keeled slugs have a ridge, or keel, running along their back. The keeled slugs are the larger slug and they can reach up to seven or nine inches in length when fully stretched out. Slugs use the retractable tentacles on their head to smell and detect food up to several meters away. Slugs are black, rubbery-like creatures covered in sticky mucus and live mainly in leaf litter. Slugs have a rasp-like radula or tongue and chitinized jaw that they use to eat succulent plants. They can also eat carrion and fungi. Snails are slugs with shells that are made from calcium and form a spiral column in which the snail lives. Unlike the sausage-shaped slug, the snail’s body has a bag-like structure. The visible part of a snail is the foot, with the head at one end identified by the two retractable tentacles. Like slugs, snails secrete mucus that is used to lubricate the surface over which it is moving. When dry, the mucus forms silver-colored lines that you can often see in the morning. Snails also have a rasping radula tongue that they use to eat tender young plants. While essentially vegetarian, some snails are carnivorous and can feed on earthworms and other snails. To catch slugs and snails, look in damp areas or dew-laden grass early in the morning. Both slugs and snails avoid dry, hot areas and are usually more active during the evening. To be safe, only collect slugs and snails which are alive. Generally, snails are nocturnal and sleep during the day. The mucus they secrete seals their shell, preventing the snail from drying out. You can also eat hibernating snails, but you have to check if the seal around the shell entrance is intact and not receding. If you collect snails with receding seals, you have to discard them because they are either dead or on their last day of life. Only collect slugs and snails in areas free of poisonous plants or fungi. Snails, especially slugs, can process the toxins ingested from eating poisonous plants and fungi for their own benefit. Depending on the plant, cooking the slugs and snails won’t always break down the toxins to make them safe to eat. This is why you have to properly purge their stomachs for at least 24 hours before cooking. Since slugs are more prone to eating poisonous plants or fungi than snails, people tend to avoid them in favor of snails. Purging Purging helps remove body waste and the remains of toxic plants from the stomach so the slugs or snails are safe to eat. To purge slugs or snails, soak them in salty water for at least 24 hours. If you don’t have salt, place them in a container with harmless plants or vegetables. As they eat the plants, they will excrete what’s in their stomach. If you can forage for something like wild garlic or another strong herb feed them this. Garlic or herbs will also infuse into the slug or snail’s flesh and help improve their taste. Alternatively, you can feed them breadcrumbs or bran as these will help absorb any toxin present, which is then excreted. Never eat slugs or snails raw. Traditionally, snails are boiled, but you can also cook them in the embers of a fire. Another option is to fry them in garlic butter. Cook snails for about eight minutes. If you are boiling them, don’t place too many in the pot at the same time. As snails get hotter, the water will begin to froth because of the slime released from the body. Enhance the taste by adding a spice or strong herbs, like wild garlic or mint, to the water. While the foot itself may be a little rubbery, the rest of the snail should be soft and tender. You can also cook snails by wrapping them in edible leaves with a few herbs and a drop of water. Cover the leaf with wet mud and cook in the fire’s coals for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on how many snails you have and how big they are. Because the snails will cook in their own juices, they don’t lose the “meaty” taste you lose with boiling. You can also try this method by cooking them in aluminum foil. Snails you forage in the wilderness will be smaller than the large white snail (Helix pomatia) often eaten in France. When SHTF and you run out of food, forage for slugs and snails. Clean and prepare them properly if you need nutritious survival food. Watch the video below to know how to forage for hickory nuts. This video is from the SHTFPrepping101 channel on Brighteon.com.

https://food.news/2022-12-22-is-coffee-bad-for-probiotics-in-gut.html,A cup of joe and gut health: Is coffee bad for the probiotics in your gut?,0,"Advertisement When you take a probiotic supplement, it’s normal to want to maximize its benefits on your body. But does that mean you have to stop drinking coffee every morning? Here are some things to consider if you need a cup of joe every morning but are also worried about your gut health. Dr. Lea Ann Chen, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine and pharmacology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, defines probiotics as “living microbes that confer beneficial effects on their host.” This means probiotics are “bacteria that support your gut health and function.” You can find probiotics in different things, from fermented foods to dietary supplements. Probiotics can be important in various settings to help maintain a balanced gut microbiome. (Related: Study: People who drink coffee have lower risk of early death.) Like other aspects of your health, lifestyle factors like your eating habits, stress reduction, good sleep habits, exercise habits and other factors can affect the composition of your gut microbiome. In turn, this can influence your well-being. If you eat a lot of junk food or don’t get enough sleep, you may experience issues with the good probiotics in your gut. To keep your gut health in check, eat a “diverse and healthy diet” that is plant-based and full of dietary fiber. You can also improve your gut health by avoiding overly processed foods full of added sugar and fat. But is coffee bad for your gut health? The answer depends. Dr. Zhaoping Li, a nutrition researcher, professor of medicine, and chief of the Division of Clinical Nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that drinking black coffee moderately may offer benefits for your gut health. In a small study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, researchers examined the gut microbiome samples taken during routine colonoscopies. The results revealed that those who consumed two or more cups of coffee daily throughout the previous year had better gut microbiome profiles than people who had less or no coffee. Experts think that the chlorogenic acid in coffee may help increase the diversity in the gut microbiome. This may be one of the mechanisms “by which it can impact metabolism and provide health benefits.” However, consuming too much coffee with a lot of added sugar and fat could be bad for your gut health. If you drink one or two cups of coffee regularly, make sure your beverage is low in sugar or has no sugar at all to maintain gut health. As for coffee directly affecting the probiotics you consume, experts say it’s unlikely to cause an issue and that there is no sufficient data to suggest that coffee can harm the prebiotics in your gut. Fortunately, there are several ways to support a healthy gut. One of the best ways to have long-term sustainable equilibrium in your gut microbiome is to incorporate some important key lifestyle factors for your gut health program. This includes following a diverse diet full of plant-based foods. Your intestines are home to hundreds of species of bacteria, each of which has a specific role in health and requires different nutrients for growth. A diverse microbiome is generally considered a healthy one because the more species of bacteria you have, the more health benefits you may be able to contribute. If you eat different food types, you can help cultivate a more diverse microbiome. But the typical Western diet is not very diverse and is full of fat and sugar. Data suggests that at least 75 percent of the world’s food is produced from only 12 plants and five animal species. Yet, diets in certain rural regions are usually more diverse and richer in the different plant sources. Because of this, some studies have found that gut microbiome diversity is much greater in people who live in rural regions of Africa and South America compared to those from urban areas in Europe or America. Eating a lot of fruits and vegetables is also good for your gut health since produce is the best source of nutrients for a healthy microbiome. Fruits and vegetables are full of dietary fiber, which your body can’t digest. But certain bacteria in your gut can digest fiber, and this stimulates their growth. Beans and legumes are also full of fiber. Here are some fiber-rich foods that are good for your gut bacteria: According to a study, following a diet rich in fruits and vegetables prevented the growth of some disease-causing bacteria. Research also suggests that superfoods like almonds, apples, artichokes, blueberries and pistachios can all help increase Bifidobacteria in humans. This is good because Bifidobacteria are considered beneficial bacteria and they can help prevent intestinal inflammation and boost your gut health. Fermented foods have undergone fermentation, a process wherein the sugars they contain are broken down by yeast or bacteria. Healthy fermented foods include: Many of these foods are full of lactobacilli, a type of bacteria that offers health benefits. According to studies, people who eat a lot of yogurt seem to have more lactobacilli in their intestines. They also have fewer Enterobacteriaceae, which is a type of bacteria linked to inflammation and some chronic conditions. Data also suggests that yogurt may help enhance the function and composition of the microbiome. But like with coffee, many yogurts, especially flavored yogurts, are full of added sugar. To keep your gut healthy, choose plain, unsweetened yogurt or flavored yogurt with minimal added sugar and is made only of milk and bacteria mixtures or “starter cultures.” When buying yogurt, look for products with a label that reads “contains live active cultures.” You can also consume fermented soybean milk, which experts think may promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, while also decreasing quantities of other harmful strains of bacteria. Eating kimchi may also benefit your gut flora. Aside from following a plant-based and diverse diet, you can also improve your gut health by avoiding processed foods. You should also exercise regularly and try to manage your stress levels. Drinking coffee without added sugar and fat shouldn’t interfere with the probiotics in your gut. The most important thing you can do to take care of your gut bacteria is to eat well. Experts also recommend taking a probiotic supplement to support and encourage a healthy gut microbiome.

https://food.news/2022-12-20-reduce-food-waste-refrigerating-fruits-and-vegetables.html,Reduce food waste by refrigerating fruits and vegetables,0,"Advertisement Food waste is still a huge problem in the United States. But according to a U.K. study, this can be solved by making a change to your food storage habits. The study has found that refrigerating fruits and vegetables instead of keeping them in a fruit bowl on the kitchen counter can help extend their shelf life. The food charity Waste and Resources Action Program (WRAP) reported that different fruits and vegetables can be eaten up to 10 weeks after their “best before” dates if they are refrigerated. Researchers found that loose apples last longer when refrigerated at 7.2 F (4 C), almost 70 days longer compared to ambient conditions. For the study, the organization observed the effects of storing various fruits and vegetables at ambient conditions or in the fridge. Data showed that storing cucumber and broccoli at an optimal fridge temperature of 7.2 F gave significantly more life (15 days) compared to a sub-optimal fridge temperature of 16.2 F (9 C). Experts advised that maintaining a fridge temperature below 9 F and storing more fresh produce in the fridge can help fruits and vegetables stay fresher for longer. This also helps prevent food waste because consumers would have a much longer timeframe to consume what they purchase. Additionally, WRAP is urging U.K. retailers to sell fresh, uncut fruit and vegetables without best-before dates or plastic packaging. During the 18-month study, scientists experimented with five commonly wasted items: The produce was stored both in the original packaging and loose at varying temperatures. WRAP reported that selling these five fruits and vegetables loose and getting rid of best before dates could amount to a combined yearly saving of: Many supermarkets already sell some items loose, but the study presented compelling evidence for continuing the beneficial practice with many other fresh fruits and vegetables. According to WRAP, it shared its findings and recommendations with the U.K.’s largest food retailers. However, the food charity also acknowledged that implementing them would take time. Marcus Gover, WRAP’s chief executive, said the study findings “could be a game-changer in the fight against food waste and plastic pollution.” He added that the study helped demystify the link between food waste, plastic packaging, date labels and food storage. Preventing food waste isn’t just good for the environment. It can also help you save money on groceries and make the most of the food you buy. Follow these tips to reduce food waste at home: As reported in the study, refrigerate apples to make them last longer. While tomatoes should be stored on the counter, most fruits and vegetables should be refrigerated so they last longer. Before you run to the grocery store, check all nooks and crannies in your fridge. If you still have half a jar of pasta sauce that’s still good to eat, use it up before buying a new jar of sauce. Make the most of your groceries by planning meals weekly and making a list so you know exactly what to buy. If possible, use coupons and wait for sales to save more money. Starting a home garden takes some time and effort, but it’s worth it if you want to feed your family fresh, organic fruits and vegetables. If space is an issue or if you don’t have enough time to manage a full garden, opt for a container or window herb garden. With some practice, you can grow flavorful and nutritious herbs and microgreens for soups and salads. If you need other things you can’t grow at home, buy them at farmer’s markets. This is a better option because fruits and vegetables from a farmer are usually fresher than those from the supermarket. Save carrot tops and make pesto and use up old fruit and bread to make bread pudding. Wilted vegetables can be used to make vegetable stock. If you have stale bread, store it in another bag for bread pudding or croutons. If you still have food waste that’s no longer edible, use it to make compost for your garden.

https://food.news/2022-12-20-3-foods-that-boost-heart-gut-health.html,These 3 foods can boost your heart and gut health,0,"Advertisement Some of the best foods for heart health can also help boost your gut health. According to Dr. William Davis, a cardiologist and New York Times bestselling author, there is a lot of crossover between the two categories. Davis said doctors “should be experts in nutrition and the microbiome” because the gut microbiome can affect various bodily functions like immunity, brain function and heart health. He also talked about three foods that help boost both heart and gut health. Research suggests that a plant-based diet can boost heart health since limiting meat intake and eating more vegetables can help maintain healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels. According to a study in the Journal of the American Heart Association, people who followed a more plant-based diet enhanced their cardiovascular health by 16 percent. However, Davis said grass-fed, sustainably sourced meat can be a part of a heart-healthy food pyramid, especially organ meats. While divisive on the palate, organ meats like tongue, liver and kidney are full of essential vitamins and nutrients such as: But if you are too squeamish about eating organ meats, Davis recommends eating grass-fed meat bone-in and skin-on. For example, chicken skin contains collagen and hyaluronic acid while the bone and bone marrow contain various nutrients. Discarding chicken skin, bones and bone marrow means you’re also throwing away the gut- and heart-healthy benefits of the meat. Make the most of grass-fed meat and chicken by purchasing the highest-quality meat you can. Save the bones and fat and use recipes that make stews and soups out of it. (Related: Maintaining heart health may be the key to diabetes prevention.) Legumes are full of dietary fiber, which enhances heart health by decreasing and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or bad cholesterol, as well as total cholesterol levels. Your gut microbiome also feeds on plant-based fiber such as prebiotic fiber that promotes the growth of a good gut bacteria called Akkermansia muciniphila. When these bacteria are deprived of fiber, they will consume human mucus. This is bad because mucus is the protective layer of your GI tract. Once this gut bacteria turn to mucus, it can affect your gut health over time. Because your gut health is linked to many processes, it can also affect your heart, brain and skin health as well. To keep your heart and gut healthy, Davis suggests prioritizing your fiber intake by getting a healthy serving of legumes regularly. He also warned that people on “strict, low-carb diets and don’t pay attention to the intake of those sources of fiber may pay a long-term health price.” Essential oils are commonly used in aromatherapy, and Davis said food-grade oils may offer benefits for your gut and heart health. In a gut health setting, he noted that terpenes from essential oils “are very effective.” Study suggests that the ingestion of certain essential oils can offer benefits during moments of digestive distress. To illustrate, peppermint essential oil has been shown to promote gut comfort. Bitter orange oil, meanwhile, has been studied for its effectiveness in gastric health. Davis recommends using essential oils in a “very specific way” since the oils shouldn’t be taken directly. Essential oils are very caustic and they can burn so they need to be diluted properly to avoid adverse effects. Below are some essential oils you should never ingest: The recipes below include fiber-rich superfoods and limit sodium and saturated fat for a healthy gut and heart.

https://food.news/2022-12-16-does-orange-contain-enough-vitamin-c.html,Does an orange contain enough vitamin C to support optimal health?,0,"Advertisement Vitamin C or L-ascorbic acid is a water-soluble vitamin that’s an important part of a balanced diet. This essential vitamin has many bodily functions. For starters, vitamin C helps with collagen production and boosts your immune system. Many people think oranges are the best dietary source of vitamin C, but some fruits and vegetables are actually better sources of this essential mineral. Here is how much vitamin C is in orange. According to nutrient analysis data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), one medium orange contains approximately 68 milligrams of vitamin C. (Related: Avoid sun damage with superfoods that offer photoprotective benefits for your skin.) Surprisingly, a 3/4-cup serving of orange juice contains a little more vitamin C than an actual orange. Orange juice has a concentrated dose of around 93 mg of vitamin C. However, if you’re after more fiber, a whole orange delivers more dietary fiber, especially if you can stomach the white, spongy pith. Here’s a breakdown of other superfoods that either top the orange’s vitamin C capacity or come close, according to data from the USDA: You can also boost your vitamin C intake by preparing this eye-catching and nutritious salad with green beans and pomegranate. Green beans with pomegranate Ingredients for eight servings: Preparation: The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin C varies based on factors like your age and gender. Jessica Cording, a health coach and registered dietitian, said these are general recommendations. But it can vary in terms of what’s considered the optimal amount for you. You may have higher needs during different times in your life, but at a minimum, you should aim for the RDA. Data suggests that at least 42 percent of U.S. adults are deficient in vitamin C based on blood test results. At least 118 million American adults are also failing to consume adequate amounts of vitamin C daily from their diets. If you’re taking in more vitamin C than you need, you will urinate the excess since your body will get rid of it, said Dr. Zhaoping Li, the director of the Center for Human Nutrition and chief of the Division of Clinical Nutrition at David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). If you have a “megadose” of vitamin C, you may experience negative side effects, warned Li. According to the National Academies, the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of vitamin C is 2,000 mg per day. The UL is defined as “the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population.” Emily Achey, a registered dietitian nutritionist, said that vitamin C has a role in many important functions in the body. These include the following: Vitamin C is your body’s primary water-soluble antioxidant and it has a major role in neutralizing harmful free radicals and fighting reactive oxidative species (ROS) throughout the body. The vitamin can also help regenerate other antioxidants in your body, like vitamin E and glutathione. These nutrients work with vitamin C to protect different cells and tissues throughout the body. According to studies, getting sufficient levels of vitamin C helps support memory and cognitive function. Not everyone needs to supplement with vitamin C, especially if you get enough of it with a balanced diet. If you’re not sure, examine your diet to see if supplementation can offer benefits. What specific needs are you covering with food? Are there gaps in your diet? If you’re falling short of the ideal vitamin C intake from food, health experts recommend taking a vitamin C supplement. If you are having issues with immune system function, you should also consider taking additional vitamin C. Aside from the gap-filling approach, the science of vitamin C also offers potential benefits for higher potency dosing, such as increasing your dose from 500 mg to 1,000 mg, depending on your health goals. If you want to optimize your immune response or for the reduction of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory biomarker, and promote cardiometabolic health (e.g., blood pressure), data suggests that high-potency C dosing may be beneficial. Fresh oranges and orange juice are good sources of vitamin C, but there are other food sources of the essential vitamin. You can also supplement with vitamin C to boost your intake and support immune health.

https://food.news/2022-12-15-4-gut-health-supporting-spices-recipes.html,Promote gut health with these 4 powerful spices,0,"Advertisement A healthy gut is key to your well-being. According to ancient medical systems, all health outcomes begin in the gut. This may seem like an oversimplification, but many studies suggest that there is some truth to the belief that gut health is crucial for your overall health. If you want to achieve optimal gut health, eat nutritious foods and incorporate gut health-boosting spices like fennel and turmeric into your regular diet. Cloves are a spice with potent, powerful anti-inflammatory effects, thanks to the beneficial compound eugenol. Cloves contain fiber, vitamins and minerals. Using whole or ground cloves to give various dishes and beverages a flavor boost can also increase your intake of essential important nutrients. One teaspoon (two grams) of ground cloves contains six calories, one gram of carbs and one gram of fiber. The same serving also contains 55 percent of the Daily Value (DV) of manganese and two percent of the DV for vitamin K. According to studies, manganese is an essential mineral for maintaining brain function and building strong bones. Cloves are also a great source of antioxidants. These compounds help reduce oxidative stress, which is linked to the development of chronic disease. The eugenol in cloves acts as a natural antioxidant. According to a test-tube study, eugenol curbed oxidative damage caused by free radicals five times more effective than vitamin E, another powerful antioxidant. Cumin can help digestive enzyme production and bile secretion, which helps the body better digest fatty foods. Most recipes using lentils also add cumin to help boost their digestibility. Cumin is rich in vitamins and minerals like: Some studies suggest that cumin can help stimulate the production of pancreatic enzymes and help digestion. Research also evaluated the antioxidant content of cumin and results showed that it was more effective than other common antioxidants, such as vitamin C. Data also suggests that cumin can potentially be used to protect against cancer. Fennel seeds are powerhouses that can help improve digestion by supporting digestive enzyme production. It is also believed that fennel can help cool the digestive tract. Fennel stimulates the production of gastric juices. It also has carminative properties, meaning it can help relieve flatulence or gas. Additionally, fennel is used as an after-dinner digestive aid. It also has antispasmodic properties. If you are looking for a spice full of dietary fiber, use fennel seeds. It also contains metabolically inert, insoluble fiber that increases the bulk of the food you eat as it goes through your digestive system. Insoluble fiber helps ease constipation and protects the colon. Fennel also contains various antioxidants like quercetin, which can help protect against aging and diseases such as cancer. If you suffer from gut issues, steep some fennel seeds in warm water and drink it as a soothing herbal tea to help support your gut health. (Related: Agave fiber promotes gut health and weight loss, reveals study.) Turmeric is a popular spice because it has impressive anti-inflammatory properties that can help support healthy inflammatory pathways in the gut. The spice can also help support the gut lining. When using turmeric, add a bit of black pepper to help boost the bioavailability of the curcumin in turmeric. These recipes include the spices mentioned above and other superfoods that can promote gut health. Quinoa khichdi This recipe can help soothe digestion and includes quinoa and lentils.

https://food.news/2022-12-15-reverse-juicing-trick-boost-antioxidant-intake-berries.html,Try this “reverse juicing” trick to boost your antioxidant intake from berries,0,"Advertisement Nutrition experts recommend berries as part of a balanced diet because these tart, juicy fruits are full of beneficial antioxidants like polyphenols. Polyphenols offer several health benefits and one expert has a unique tip to help you get the most antioxidants when juicing berries. Polyphenols are a subgroup of antioxidants. These potent phytonutrients, or plant-based nutrients, are linked to many health benefits, such as supporting heart health, glowing skin and improved longevity. Dr. Steven Gundry, a respected cardiologist, shares one hack called “reverse juicing” that will help you extract even more polyphenols from nutritious berries. (Related: Top 8 tasty and nutritious vegetables for juicing.) If you have a juicer, use it like you normally would. Slice your fruits and vegetables to the correct size, then slowly insert them one after the other into the machine. Once activated, the juicer will press each piece into a nutrient-dense liquid. Most juicers will have an outlet that collects all the pulp so you can easily compost or save it for future recipes. If you’re using a blender to make fruit juice, you have to strain the pulp before drinking your beverage. Gundry recommends saving the pulp instead of throwing it away because it’s actually the best part of the juicing method. Here are the three steps to reverse juice your berries and fruits: Berries are a great source of polyphenols, and using this hack means you get more bang for your buck. Blueberries contain polyphenol pigments called anthocyanins that are needed to maintain brain health and for healthy aging. Other fruits like pomegranates contain ellagic acid, another polyphenol and powerful antioxidant that can support healthy skin and increase skin’s resilience against UVB rays. Instead of throwing away the pulp from your juicer, set it aside and add it to yogurt and smoothies for an antioxidant boost. If you don’t have a juicer, you can also take a supplement that includes pomegranate extract to get similar results. Look for a high-quality 100 percent pomegranate whole fruit extract with a concentrated dose (at least 60 percent) of total polyphenols. These supplements can help enhance photoprotection and promote healthy skin aging. Try beauty supplements with pomegranate extract to boost your skin health. When buying supplements, choose a product that contains only 100 percent pomegranate whole fruit extract (Punica granatum L.) that includes a relevant dose of at least 100 milligrams. Lastly, the supplement should include a verifiable botanical concentration of polyphenols. Brands will usually quantify the polyphenol amount. Strawberries contain high amounts of antioxidant polyphenols. This delicious snack made with fresh strawberries can help protect healthy cells from free radical damage. Homemade strawberry oatmeal bars These strawberry oatmeal bars are also great if you need a quick breakfast or snack. Ingredients for 16 servings of the crust and crumble: Ingredients for the strawberry filling: Preparation: Notes: If you love fruit juice, use your juicer and save the nutrient-rich pulp from berries. Add the fruit pulp to sweet desserts and breakfasts for a quick antioxidant boost. Watch the video below to learn more about cacao nibs, another superfood full of antioxidants.

https://food.news/2022-12-15-improve-health-boost-longevity-blue-zones-diet.html,Improve your well-being and boost longevity with the Blue Zones diet,0,"Advertisement Health-conscious people constantly aim to improve their overall well-being and longevity. According to an expert, one diet may be key to this goal: the Blue Zones diet. This diet, founded by longevity expert Dan Buettner, has been linked to populations with better cardiovascular, metabolic and overall health outcomes. According to Buettner, the Blue Zone regions are the world’s “longevity hotspots.” There are five Blue Zones in the world: Loma Linda, California; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece; Sardinia, Italy; and Okinawa, Japan. These five regions have a high concentration of people who live to be over 100 years old. After researching these regions, Buettner found that the diets and lifestyle practices of people from different countries shared some unique similarities. Loma Linda Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda are “extremely religious and follow a mostly vegan diet.” They avoid dairy, spices, shellfish and all meats. Nicoya Nicoya is a Costa Rican region that includes more starches and grains such as beans, corn and squash compared to other Blue Zones. People in this area consume a lot of vegetables like carrots, peppers and tomatoes and some fruits that are local to where they live like bananas, oranges and papaya. People from the area have an earlier, smaller dinner. They also treat grains like corn with lime, which boosts the bioavailability of the nutrients. Ikaria In Ikaria, people follow a more plant-based version of the Mediterranean diet. They eat more legumes and heart-healthy fats. They also drink alcohol, but only in moderation. Sardinia In Sardinia, the typical diet includes a lot of beans, vegetables, fruits and whole grains. The local diet includes heart-healthy monounsaturated fats from olive oil and a very small amount of meat. They also consume dairy like goat and sheep milk, which are usually easier to digest. Okinawa Okinawa is a region in Ryukyu Islands in southern part of Japan. The Okinawa diet has more fish, soy and vegetables compared to the diets of the other Blue Zones. In this area, people focus on starches low on the glycemic index, like rice and sweet potato, which make up 67 percent of their diet. They eat pork, but only for rare ceremonial occasions and in small amounts. Okinawans also follow a principle called ikigai or “purpose,” which gives them reasons to wake up in the morning. The Blue Zones Diet is based on the eating patterns followed in the Blue Zones. Regardless of the region each Blue Zone is in, they include the following in their diet: Plants People in the Blue Zones follow a mostly plant-based diet that includes lots of fruits, vegetables, fiber-rich whole grains, nuts, beans and seeds. While not totally plant-based, at least 95 percent of the foods in these diets come from a plant or a plant product. (Related: Health and nutrition: Study links eating a plant-based diet to lower risk of diabetes.) Healthy fats Those in Blue Zones consume healthy fats like olive oil, nuts and seeds. Many people eat a handful or two of nuts almost every day. Dark leafy greens Dark, leafy greens like kale, spinach and Swiss chard are also an important part of the Blue Zones diet. Beans Data has revealed that people from Blue Zones consume at least one cup of beans daily. Fish Fish is part of the Blue Zones diet but people usually consume no more than three ounces of fish daily. Data suggests that, on average, fish is on the menu only two to three times a week. Eggs Eggs are also eaten in the diets of all five Blue Zones, but they are only consumed an average of two to four times every week. Dairy Cow’s milk, dairy and yogurt aren’t as popular. Instead, people consume goat’s and sheep’s milk products, especially in the Ikarian and Sardinian Blue Zones. Whole grains Bread is a staple in Blue Zone regions and it is eaten almost daily. But instead of processed bread, those in the five zones favor whole grain or sourdough varieties. They also eat other whole grains for most meals, like barley, brown rice or oats. Limited meat intake Meat is part of the Blue Zones diet but only two ounces of chicken, pork and other meats are eaten about five times per month. No processed foods The Blue Zone diet focuses on a lot of whole foods that are minimally processed. This means people eat mostly foods found in nature, and nothing processed in a factory. Minimal added sugar Sweets are usually only eaten during celebrations, and they otherwise don’t consume a lot of added sugar on a daily basis. Moderate alcohol intake Alcohol is part of the diet, but people usually limit themselves to one to two glasses of red wine per day. Experts think alcohol offers certain benefits that may come from resveratrol, an antioxidant found in red wine. Other superfoods like berries, cocoa, grapes and peanuts also contain resveratrol. Like other balanced diets, the Blue Zones diet offers many benefits. People in these regions focus on more whole, natural foods instead of processed items often eaten in Western diets. The Blue Zones also prioritize other factors that contribute to a healthy lifestyle, like strong relationships, quality sleep and physical activity. Shifting to a Blue Zone diet may offer these benefits: Longevity Research suggests that people who follow the diet and stick to it live long, healthy lives up to their 90s and even 100s. Improved heart and brain health A study on the Blue Zone diet has shown that people who follow it, as opposed to the Standard American diet, found that they “experienced better cardiovascular health outcomes and cognitive function.” Boosts mental health Your physical health is often linked to your mental health and overall mood. Data also suggests that eating more high-quality whole foods is better for your mental state. Promotes healthy weight management The Blue Zones diet is ideal for anyone who wants to maintain a healthy weight because it encourages people to eat only until they are 80 percent full, which can help discourage overeating and unhealthy snacking. Increases nutrient intake If you’re tired of feeling sluggish because of all the processed foods that you eat, try the Blue Zone Diet to boost your intake of vitamins and minerals. While the Blue Zones diet is considered beneficial, one major critique is that many people think it means they have to be mostly vegetarian to be healthy. While the diet includes a lot of plant-based foods, it also includes a bit of high-quality fish, poultry and meat. Here are other critiques of the Blue Zone diet: It’s not recommended if you are sensitive to carbs The diet includes beans, legumes and whole grains, which are carbs. If you are glucose-sensitive, too many carbs could be bad for your hormones and blood sugar levels. It can be hard to maintain if you don’t cook all your meals If you eat out, you risk eating items that aren’t part of the diet. The Blue Zones diet isn’t sustainable if you don’t cook all your meals. It can be hard to get all your proteins from plants Going strictly vegan means you may have trouble getting all your proteins from plant-based foods. And while you can get all your protein from plants, United States Department of Agriculture guidelines suggest 0.8 grams of protein for one pound of body weight. Unless you’re being very intentional about your proteins, such as consuming more beans and legumes and fewer starches, you might not be getting enough. If this is an issue, you can address it by being more intentional when choosing your meals. If you want to improve your lifestyle habits and boost your longevity, start shifting to the Blue Zones diet. And if you can’t give up on meat completely, making changes to your current diet by eating more whole foods, limiting your meat intake and avoiding processed foods can help you live longer.

https://food.news/2022-12-14-positive-lifestyle-changes-help-reduce-cancer-risk.html,Positive lifestyle changes can help reduce cancer risk and boost the overall health of cancer survivors,0,"Advertisement Studies show that following a balanced diet, exercising and maintaining a healthy weight are key to reducing your risk of developing some common cancers and improving the well-being of cancer survivors. These good habits can also protect against other chronic diseases like heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. However, making changes can be difficult if you are used to an unhealthy lifestyle. If you’re struggling to maintain your habits, experts recommend starting small and working your way up to other health goals. A team of experts in the field of cancer prevention and survivorship from the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) suggests taking one action “to start lowering the risk of cancer and/or live healthier as a survivor.” Sheena Patel, the AICR’s Director of Nutrition Programs, recommends downloading the AICR’s Healthy Living Calendar. This calendar features a helpful 30-day checklist that will help improve your eating habits and encourage you to exercise more. This guide can also help you make healthy choices to reduce your cancer risk. The checklist includes suggestions like how to incorporate a healthy habit into your current routine, like cooking meals with a new vegetable or going for a bike ride. If you have a lot of unhealthy habits, the calendar can motivate you to accomplish different goals for each day of the month. These consistent reminders will help foster good habits that will promote long-lasting behavior changes. You can also join AICR’s Healthy10 Challenge, a 10-week interactive program that focuses on diet, nutrition and physical activity to reduce cancer risk and other chronic diseases. Justin C. Brown, an AICR grantee and director of the Cancer Metabolism Program at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University, recommends focusing on small sustainable changes instead of large and dramatic but short-lived changes. If you drink too much soda than you think is healthy, try to reduce your intake by one less drink a day. If you are overweight, focus on preventing additional weight gain instead of trying to lose 10 pounds in one week. Small and steady weight loss is crucial for your well-being. Alice Bender, an AICR Nutrition Consultant, says AICR’s Cancer Prevention Recommendations can help you find goals that are good for you. Instead of going vegan when you love red meat, start by adding one serving of vegetables to your lunch every other day of the week and limiting your intake of meat. (Related: Study shows apigenin, a compound in parsley, offers cancer-fighting benefits.) Karen Collins, a Nutrition Advisor at the AICR, suggests increasing your intake of dietary fiber. If you love fiber-rich superfoods like beans, make it a larger part of the plate and make another food smaller. Alternatively, you can choose a food with fiber like whole grains to replace a food with little or no fiber, like refined grains. If you have a limited range of fiber-rich foods in your usual eating habits, check out recipes on the AICR website recipes or other print or online cookbooks for tips on how other cultures make vegetables, whole grains and legumes as main ingredients for various dishes. Maintaining a healthy weight is important for cancer prevention. If you find yourself struggling to lose weight, weighing yourself daily can help give you a mental reminder to reduce unhealthy snacking between meals. Regular weight checks is one of the most powerful tools used by people who successfully lose weight, said Wendy Demark-Wahnefried, an AICR grantee. AICR Vice President of Research Nigel Brockton advocates regular physical activity. If you prefer social activities, play basketball with your friends. If you enjoy solo activities, try cycling. Whatever your preferences, any activity is good for you as long as it gets you off of the couch and sweating. If you hate going to the gym and lifting weights, look for an activity that you enjoy so you can motivate yourself to work out. AICR grantee Kathryn Schmitz said exercise offers benefits not just for cancer, but for many common chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease and obesity. Once you find fun activities that encourage you to work out, try to exercise for at least 150 minutes a week. You can reach your goal by taking a walk for 30 minutes a day and planning exercise sessions. Use a pedometer or other electronic trackers to reach 10,000 steps per day. A SMART goal is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-based, said Angela Hummel, a consulting dietitian with AICR. When starting a new activity, make a SMART Goal and specify the number of minutes or steps for your fitness goal. With the SMART Goal, you can continue to improve by increasing the number of minutes or steps each week. When starting a workout regimen, start by walking for at least 15 minutes three days a week. The next week, try to increase the number of days or number of minutes. As you get used to exercising, gradually increase the minutes or steps to meet your goals. These recipes from the AICR website include healthy ingredients linked to cancer prevention like fruits, leafy greens and other vegetables.

https://food.news/2022-12-13-good-habits-how-to-support-healthy-digestion.html,Good habits for better health: How to support healthy digestion,0,"Advertisement Having a healthy digestive system contributes to your overall well-being. Generally, your body takes between 10 hours to three days to move food through your entire digestive system. However, if you’re feeling more tired than usual or are dealing with gastrointestinal (GI) issues, things have likely “slowed down.” If you often experience symptoms like bloating, stomach issues and feeling fuller than usual after eating small meals, you may have issues with your gut health. If that’s the case, here are lifestyle changes that can help boost your digestion: Regular physical activity can help get things moving inside your digestive tract. According to a study published in the journal Gut, daily moderate exercise, which includes activities like cycling and jogging, may help reduce gut transit time by as much as 30 percent. If you prefer other activities or are older and want to try gentler workouts, here are some suggestions: Go for a walk Basic movement like walking can speed up your digestion by stimulating the muscles in your stomach and small intestine and helping move things along. Walking any time of the day offers health benefits, but research suggests that going for a walk after eating may be better for you. Studies suggest that taking a 15-minute leisurely walk after eating can help move food through your stomach much faster. Remember that this applies to a leisurely walk because going too hard can have the opposite effect. If you want to keep up the pace, walk briskly before eating instead. Pilates Pilates is a great choice if you prefer gentle workouts that are easier on the joints. Pilates has some similarities with yoga, but the former is generally considered more focused on the anatomical movements and less on the spiritual element linked to yoga. Pilates is focused on things that may benefit someone with a weaker body, like balance, flexibility, better posture and strength. These are all crucial for healthy aging, especially if you are over 50. Pilates doesn’t include high-impact movements. Rather, the activity focuses on simple, controlled movements. Swimming Swimming is one of the best cardiovascular exercises that put less stress on the joints. The water you’re swimming in takes a lot of the weight, making it the perfect choice if you want to exercise but have bad knees and hips or other health issues. And even if you’re a senior, swimming is a suitable activity for overall health and fitness. It can even help tone your body. Tai chi Tai chi is an ancient Chinese exercise that involves “slow, flowing movements.” This gentle martial art connects both your mind and body to perform these movements. Tai chi is gentle, but it can still get you moving. Try this activity if you also want to improve core skills like balance, coordination and core strength. Try a yoga flow Many yoga poses, like dandasana, janu sirsasana and savasana can help speed up your digestion. If you are new to yoga, start with a simple 10-minute sequence daily to physically support digestive processes and encourage regular elimination. According to Lee Holmes, a ?registered yoga teacher and gut expert, yoga involves twisting postures that can help enhance your digestion and “encourage the liver and kidneys’ detoxification processes.” Additionally, yoga can help with bloating by increasing the amount of oxygen in the area. Yoga can also get your digestion going by promoting relaxation. When you’re relaxed, the nervous system is in a parasympathetic state. This calming state, or “rest and digest” state, is important for proper digestion. Certain foods like sugar or refined carbohydrates and fried food can interfere with proper digestion. Fortunately, other healthy foods can get your digestion moving as it should. (Related: Improving digestion: 11 gut-friendly foods.) Probiotic foods Probiotic-rich foods like fermented foods are full of beneficial bacteria that can support your gut health. A study published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology found that yogurt, a popular probiotic food, helps speed up digestion. Yogurt can also support the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), the part of the immune system that lives in your gut. If you can’t consume dairy, you can try other probiotic-rich foods like: Two tablespoons of raw sauerkraut contain at least one million colony-forming units (CFUs) of good bacteria, so try adding it to your favorite sandwiches. Probiotic supplements Aside from eating foods that can support your gut health, you can also take probiotic supplements to speed up your digestion. Certain probiotic strains can support gut health and help maintain the healthy functions of the digestive system. These strains can also help reduce gas and bloating and improve total digestion time (or gut transit time), which is key to maintaining bowel regularity. Fiber-rich foods Fiber is also crucial for healthy digestion. There are two main types of dietary fiber: soluble and insoluble. Both types are important for your well-being, but insoluble fiber plays a bigger role in your digestive health. Your body is unable to digest insoluble fiber or absorb it into the bloodstream. But this type of fiber is crucial because it makes up the weight and bulk of stools in your body. In other words, insoluble fiber acts as a “broom” thanks to its laxative effect that helps pull water into the stool and pushes things out. You also need prebiotic fiber. This type of fiber comes from superfoods like: Prebiotic fiber acts as a food source for probiotics, the beneficial bacteria in your gut. Chewing is also crucial for your digestive health. If you eat in a rush and don’t chew your food properly, this will “cause more work for your stomach, which further impedes the digestive process down the line—it’s a negative ripple effect,” warned Dr. Frank Lipman, a functional medicine doctor. Try to chew until your food is liquefied, or chew at least 20 to 30 times. Consuming enough fluids is key to digestive health. If you don’t drink enough water, you may have a hard time with your bowels. Keep in mind that you should avoid caffeinated drinks like coffee and sugary beverages like soda. Stay hydrated by consuming these beneficial liquids: Bone broth Bone broth offers two benefits for your digestion: It helps keep your gut hydrated and it also contains gelatin and gut-supporting minerals, electrolytes and bioactives such as calcium, chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, magnesium and phosphorus. Herbal tea Apart from plain water, you can try herbal teas. Herbal teas can help with your gut health, and certain teas offer other benefits. For example, dandelion tea can help stimulate muscle contractions and help push food through the digestive system. Fennel and senna teas have a stronger laxative effect. Water If possible, drink water regularly and limit your intake of sugar and other harmful additives. Water is important because it helps you digest your food and absorb nutrients. It also helps push the waste through and out of your digestive system. Experts recommend drinking nine cups of water a day for women and 12.5 cups for men. It’s best to limit your intake of coffee because it’s not recommended for proper hydration. If you need a cup of joe every morning, drink an extra cup of water for every cup you consume. Sluggish digestion may cause discomfort. If you are having gut issues, exercise regularly, eat more fermented and fiber-rich foods and stay hydrated to boost your digestion.

After all, smoothies are more filling. And unlike juicing, making a healthy smoothie at home means you get to enjoy the benefits of nutritious ingredients that are full of dietary fiber, like apples. When you make your own smoothies, you are also free to add healthful herbs and spices, as well as other ingredients that can boost the nutritional content of your beverage. If you’re a fan of delicious and healthy smoothies, try making an apple pie smoothie. An apple pie smoothie is loaded with dietary fiber from the pulp of apples and their bioflavonoid-rich skin. Fiber and bioflavonoids can help keep your uric acid in check. Uric acid is a natural waste product generated by the digestion of foods that contain purines, such as beer, organ meats, red meat and sardines. Your body also forms and breaks down purine. Normally, your body filters out uric acid through the kidneys and via urination. However, if you consume too much purine or if your body is unable to eliminate this by-product fast enough, uric acid can build up in your blood. A normal uric acid level is under 6.8 mg/dL; blood levels above that can cause hyperuricemia, a condition that can lead to gout. Gout causes painful joints, courtesy of accumulated urate crystals. Hyperuricemia can also make your blood and urine too acidic. This healthy apple pie smoothie boasts anti-inflammatory and glucose-controlling benefits, thanks to spices like cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. It is also a great source of “good” fat from Greek yogurt, raw almond butter and almond milk. Ingredients for 2 servings: Preparation: This recipe is based on the classic snack pairing of apples and peanut butter. Ingredients for 1 serving: Preparation: Did you know that there are 7,000 different cultivars of apples? They are also the most widely consumed fruit worldwide. (Related: Researchers explore the properties of Apple of Sodom (Dead Sea Apple) that make it a staple in traditional Kenyan medicine.) Sweet, juicy apples are often used in recipes for desserts like cookies and pies. Apples are also used to make jams, muffins, oatmeal, salads or smoothies. While apples can be enjoyed on their own, you can eat apples wedged and with a bit of nut butter. Apples have several scientifically-proven health benefits. The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating two cups of fruit daily for a 2,000-calorie diet, emphasizing whole fruits such as apples. One medium seven-ounce (200-grams) apple contains these nutrients: The same serving also provides two to five percent of the DV for vitamins B1, B6 and E. Vitamin B1, or thiamine, is crucial for normal growth and development. You need vitamin B6 for protein metabolism, while vitamin E acts as a fat-soluble antioxidant. Apples are also full of polyphenols, an important group of antioxidants. These compounds help prevent free radical damage that is often linked to the development of chronic conditions such as cancer and heart disease. Experts believe antioxidants like polyphenols are behind the health benefits of apples. To get the most out of apples, eat them with their skin on. Apple peel contains half of the fiber and most of the polyphenols in apples. Here are some of the benefits of eating apples: Helps protect your brain The quercetin in apples may protect your brain from damage caused by oxidative stress. In one animal study, researchers reported that quercetin helped protect the brain and nerves of rats from oxidative damage. The compound also helped prevent injuries that can result in degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. Additionally, high intakes of flavonoids like quercetin has been linked to a lower risk of stroke. According to one study, for every 1/5 cup (25 grams) of apple slices you consume per day, your risk of stroke can decrease by as much as nine percent. Good for your heart Research suggests that apples help lower the risk of heart disease. Experts attribute this to their high soluble fiber content, which helps lower blood cholesterol levels. Meanwhile, flavonoids like epicatechin in apples help lower blood pressure and reduce LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol oxidation. They also help prevent atherosclerosis, or the harmful buildup of plaque in the arteries. Helps improve gut health Apples contain pectin, a type of fiber that functions as a prebiotic. Prebiotics feed your gut microbiota, or the “good” bacteria in your gut. The state of your gut microbiota is crucial to your overall health because a healthy gut can help strengthen your defenses against diseases. Since your body can’t digest dietary fiber, pectin from apples reaches your colon intact and promotes the growth of good bacteria. Pectin helps improve the ratio of Bacteriodetes to Firmicutes. These are the two main types of bacteria in your gut. According to research, apples can beneficially alter your gut microbiota and offer protective benefits against chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease, obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Helps support weight loss goals Apples are high in fiber and water, which makes them a filling snack. Eating healthy foods like apples can make you feel full for longer, which can help you achieve your weight loss goals. When you feel full, you can avoid unhealthy snacking between meals. This can then help reduce your energy intake. One study showed that eating whole apples increased feelings of fullness for up to four hours compared to consuming an equal amount of apple puree or juice. Researchers found that this was possible because apples can reduce gastric emptying, or the rate at which the stomach empties its contents. According to studies, eating apples can also help reduce your body mass index (BMI), a weight-related risk factor for heart disease. Data also suggest that apple polyphenols may have anti-obesity effects. Maintain a healthy weight by following a balanced diet and eating nutritious apples.

https://food.news/2022-12-09-homemade-recipes-no-knead-artisan-bread.html,Homemade recipes: No-knead artisan bread,0,"Advertisement Enjoying a warm loaf of artisan bread for breakfast is a great way to start your day, but the costs can add up if you buy bread too often. To save money, learn how to make delicious no-knead artisan bread at home. The recipe below only takes about five minutes a day and only requires five ingredients you may already have at home. The final product is a loaf of bread with a soft and fluffy inside with a crunchy crust. (Related: 8 Survival bread recipes for preppers.) These tools aren’t required, but having them will make it easier to bake the bread at home. The whole family will love this freshly baked bread, which is best used to make garlic bread, various sandwiches, or torn and dipped into a hearty soup. Fresh bread is also a great snack with a dollop of butter. Ideally, if you want to bake bread you should already have this dough sitting in the refrigerator. This helps save time instead of gathering ingredients to bake a fresh loaf of bread or having to let your dough rise to room temperature first. This dough works best straight from the fridge, but if this is your first time baking this bread, you will need to make the “master dough.” You need the following ingredients to make the master dough: Flour You can use whole wheat or fresh ground flour, but reduce the flour to five and a half cups and increase only if the dough is too wet and won’t hold its shape. Avoid measuring errors by spooning the flour into a measuring cup and leveling it with the edge of a dull knife. Salt You can use sea salt, but if you don’t have it table salt will do. Vinegar The recipe requires apple cider vinegar. You can also use other kinds of vinegar to help create a better texture in no-knead bread recipes. Water The master dough needs water that is warm enough to activate yeast, but not so hot that it kills it. If using a thermometer, the water must be 115 F or warm to the inside of your wrist. Use water that is free from chlorine or other contaminants because this can affect baking. Yeast Use active dry yeast or instant yeast. Store the yeast in the fridge to help prolong its shelf life. Follow this recipe to make artisan bread at home. Preparation: Try these baking tips the next time you want to bake bread: Banneton bowl alternatives If you don’t have a proofing bowl, use a clean bowl that is made of ceramic, glass or stainless steel instead. You can also use a small wicker basket or a colander. Expect the dough to be very wet Remember that the dough will be wet. Since the recipe is for a wet dough, don’t keep adding flour to make the loaf form. This “free-form” loaf of bread is no-knead and it needs to be wet for the gluten to form properly. Use flour for easy baking Keep the wet dough from sticking to your hands, tools and work surface by sprinkling flour before you get started. You don’t need to use too much dough, but a well-coated surface will make it easier to work the dough. Use a cookie sheet if you don’t have a Dutch oven If you don’t own a Dutch oven, use a cookie sheet for the bread. Cover the sheet with parchment paper. Place a metal broiling pan in the oven on the lowest rack and preheat it and the cookie sheet to 450 F. Place the loaf in the oven and quickly pour a cup of hot water into the broiler pan. Shut the oven and bake for 45 minutes. Wait before you slice It can be tempting to slice the bread the minute you take it out of the oven, but waiting is worth it. Wait at least 20 minutes before slicing into the loaf because slicing into a hot loaf means you will end up with a gummy center that will seem underbaked. Use butter for a softer crust If you don’t like bread with a crunchy crust, immediately brush the loaf with butter the second it comes out of the oven. The butter helps soften the crust just a bit so it’s not too crunchy. Use linens bags to keep bread fresh longer If you have leftover artisan bread, store it in a linen bread bag. You can also use plastic wrap or a Ziploc bag, but using a linen bread bag helps homemade bread last for up to six days before drying out. By day four, the bread will be a bit drier, but it’s still easy to slice and soft on the inside. Linen bread bags can also be used to store dinner rolls, homemade biscuits and English muffins. Note that if you have softer, crusted bread, like sandwich bread or homemade rolls, it will dry out after one or two days. Linen is better than cotton for bread storage because the former is stronger than cotton so it will last longer in your kitchen.

https://food.news/2022-12-09-gardening-tips-starting-tomatoes-from-seed.html,Home gardening tips: How to start tomatoes from seed,0,"Advertisement Familiarizing yourself with home gardening basics means improving your skill set so you can eventually start crops that are beyond those that beginners are planting. If you’re not sure where to start, try learning how to start tomatoes from seed. Starting tomato plants from seed offers several benefits. First, it gives you an early start to enable a longer harvest. It can also help prevent diseases, which means you make the most of your plants in the garden. Knowing how to start tomatoes from seed can help you save on groceries, especially since prices are steadily increasing store prices. If you know how to start tomatoes from seed, you no longer have to spend money on garden shop tomato plants. (Related: Home gardening 101: 5 Secrets for growing great tomatoes.) The most important step is to get the right seeds for starting. Ideally, you should have a steady supply of tomato seeds from previous harvests. If you are new to seed starting, try new varieties. Here are some options to consider: Tomatoes that are beginner-friendly If this is your first time growing tomatoes, you may want to grow a variety that’s large, delicious and produces a large harvest. Tomatoes for fresh eating Cherry tomatoes are an ideal choice if you like eating fresh tomatoes. They can also be used to make sauces with a hint of sweetness. Low-acid or yellow tomatoes If you do not eat raw tomatoes, you should consider low-acid or yellow tomatoes. For example, Lemon Boy tomatoes grow quite large. They also ripen early and are great for tomato sauce. Amana Orange grows larger than Lemon Boy tomatoes. As an heirloom variety, you can save Amana Orange seeds to plant by next spring. Sweet tomatoes Sweet tomatoes are perfect if your priority is taste. Some large varieties are also rather sweet, such as: Tomatoes for sauces If your family loves pasta, choose tomatoes that are suited for pasta sauces like: Sunrise Sauce is an orange, low-acid paste tomato. It is very productive and has a long shelf life. You can store it on your counter from September to November without it going bad. Oxheart tomatoes are also great for sauces and they grow very big. These barely have any seeds and are so satisfying to grow for pasta sauces. If you want to try paste tomatoes, experiment with San Marzano Gigante. Note that if you are in an area with a shorter season, you may experience some drawbacks. The days to harvest San Marzano varieties is 90. If you consider the frost-free days in your area you might have trouble growing them. But if you have a microclimate with temperatures that are at least 20 degrees warmer, you might be able to grow San Marzano tomatoes. To start, calculate 90 days from the normal transplanting date of June. You will end up with Sept. 1, meaning you don’t have a lot of time to bring in a crop. If this is an issue, choose a smaller San Marzano variety that matures at least two to three weeks sooner. If you want bigger San Marzano tomatoes, you can try extending the harvest by starting your seeds early. This means starting tomato seeds six to eight weeks before you transplant them into your garden. Based on the calculated dates, you should start the seeds from April 1 to 15. For large, leafy plants with well-developed roots, you should start the tomato seeds as early as Feb. 1 to 15. To start tomato seeds, use peat pellets. These pellets hold the right amount of water, which can ensure that your starters do well. If you don’t have peat pellets or a special seed starting mix from the garden shop, you can stick with sterilized soil from your garden. Always pasteurize pots before planting to avoid introducing diseases to plants that are already established in your home garden. Before finalizing how many seeds you want to start, add some extras if you want to give away plants to family and friends or if you plan to sell them for extra money. Remember that tomatoes germinate best at temperatures of 70 to 80 F, which is warmer than most people keep their homes in winter. If you’re worried, check which areas of your house have a warm spot for starting seeds. Gardeners often keep germinating seeds in warm areas like the top of the refrigerator. If this isn’t applicable to you, keep your starter seeds on the mantle above a wood stove insert if you have one. If you can’t find a warm place for germinating seeds indoors, you may need a heat mat for seedlings. Take notes so you don’t miss the timing for your seeds. The first set of leaves usually emerges after seven to 10 days. True leaves will start developing several days later. By then, the seedlings will need to be placed under grow lights or in a very sunny window in your home. If your windows don’t get enough sun in the winter for growing, use LED grow lights. Try to keep the plants about two inches under the lights for maximum light coverage and some heat from the lights. Keep the lights on for 12 to 16 hours daily and water as needed. When the plants grow two sets of true leaves, transplant them into a larger container. You can use milk cartons or washed pint-sized sour cream containers for the first transplanting. Get quart-sized yogurt containers for the second transplanting. Try not to touch the main stem of tomato seedlings since they have juicy tissues that are easily bruised. Bruises in the stems will act as entry points for fungi that cause seedlings to rot. The main stem can also be damaged if a seedling falls over, which can happen if you have a weak-stemmed tomato seedling that develops into a top-heavy seedling with new leaves. Prevent this by sprinkling additional seed starting mix around the base of leggy seedlings, then press it in. Add support for the seedlings until you can repot them by propping up leaners with toothpicks or a wooden skewer. When transplanting, try to use taller containers instead of wider ones so you can send the roots deep. Whenever you transplant, add a shallow layer of soil on the bottom to cushion the roots. For the first transplanting, remove the first leaves (cotyledons) carefully. Do not strip the leaf down the stem and avoid taking some of the stem with it. Tomatoes are unique because their stems have little hairs emanating from the stem that can develop into roots. Set the tomato seedling on top of the thin layer of soil and carefully fill the soil around it. Water seedlings well and fertilize lightly weekly. You can repeat this step several times before the tomatoes are eventually planted in your garden. Your tomatoes should also be hardened against strong winds. Like all plants, tomatoes need the wind to develop strong stalks. You can do this by gently brushing your hand over the tops of the tomato plants several times a day. Follow all of these stops to produce large, lush tomato plants that cost less compared to buying them.

https://food.news/2022-12-08-gardening-tips-grow-greens-and-microgreens-indoors.html,Gardening tips: How to grow greens and microgreens indoors,0,"Advertisement Being frugal is an important prepper skill, especially if you want to be more self-sufficient and save money on rising food prices. Starting a home garden can help if you want to cut food costs. But if you don’t have enough space for a garden, you can still feed your family nutritious food by growing greens and microgreens indoors. With the right techniques and tools, you can grow and harvest greens and microgreens even in winter. Growing salad greens is easier compared to growing microgreens. If you have a home garden or an indoor garden, you may already have the equipment you need. The ideal location for indoor greens is a bright, south-facing window. If you live in a colder area, it might be better to use grow lights. Note that the winter sun’s light is usually weaker than during summertime because of the Earth’s rotation and tilt of its axis. When planting greens in winter, when the tilt puts your windows further from the sun, the light coming through them is weaker. The winter cold will also affect plants by a window so you can help your greens by using grow lights and a heat mat. If you’re using grow lights, place them in an upstairs bedroom since heat rises. If you don’t have grow lights, you can use cheap fluorescent shop lights instead. Suspend fluorescent lights on chains and S-hooks from the ceiling of the designated spot. You don’t need the very intense lighting systems that hydroponic growers use. Unlike hydroponically grown plants, vegetable and herb seedlings live indoors for only several weeks and regular fluorescent lights will meet their needs. After the seedlings are up and growing, you can gradually expose them to more sunlight in a window to prepare them for life in the garden. (Related: Sprouts vs. microgreens: Is one healthier than the other?) Make sure the light for your indoor greens is less than two inches from the tops of plants. Some seedlings grow faster than others so raise any of the slower growers by placing them on top of boxes so they can get closer to the light they need to grow. Get trays or pots with proper drainage, potting soil or other growing media. Fill the containers with a mixture of half soilless sterile potting soil suitable for seeds and half compost. If you want to save time, you can also use an all-purpose potting mix. Push the potting mix into corners to fill the containers. Well-filled trays mean more soil for the roots to explore, and this is key for stronger plants. Shake and tap the container to level and settle the potting mix after the trays are filled. Lastly, get the seeds for your preferred greens. Once the seeds are planted, water them and make sure they get 12 to 14 hours of light every day. Within 30 to 60 days, your salad greens should be ready for harvesting. Not sure what greens to plant? Here are some nutritious vegetables to choose from: Asian greens, arugula and mustard Mizuna is an Asian green that’s best for salads since it has a contrasting feathery texture, a mild peppery tang and various nutrients. Mizuna is great in stir-fries. Arugula is a delicious leafy green if you prefer something peppery. Mustard has a complementary warming flavor with colorful leaves for eye-catching salads. Iceberg lettuce Iceberg or crisphead lettuce forms a dense head of lettuce that looks like cabbage. Iceberg is the most popular variety of lettuce bought from the market and it has a refreshing crunchy texture with a sweet, mild flavor. Leaf lettuce Leaf lettuce comes in either green or red varieties that are often used for sandwiches, salads and wraps. Mache Mache, also called corn salad or lamb’s lettuce, is another mild leaf that’s very prolific. Once you grow mache, you can enjoy lots of leaves for winter salads. Mesclun If you want seeds for winter planting, try a fast-growing mesclun or braising mixes (stir-fry mixes). Scatter the seeds thickly across the soil surface, cover them with a bit of compost and water them well. Pea shoots Hardy varieties of pea shoots produce leaves with a sweet and fresh pea taste. Pea shoots are best for salads, but you can also use them as a garnish on soups. Once the shoots are eight to 10 inches tall, harvest the top few inches so you can keep harvesting. Romaine lettuce Romaine lettuce is known for its long, broad leaves around compact hearts. This lettuce is sweet with a crisp texture. The outer leaves of romaine lettuce are often used as wraps instead of bread. Winter lettuce Oak-leaf lettuce and various leaf lettuces are a great base for salads. Winter lettuce is also a great choice if you want to continue harvesting as you remove a few leaves every week and extend production over a longer period. Winter purslane Winter purslane or miner’s lettuce of Claytonia is a very hardy winter green with lush, almost juicy leaves with a smooth, mild taste. Don’t let their size fool you. Microgreens are very tiny but they are packed with nutrients. If you know how to grow them, you’ll have fresh greens for soups and salads year-round. A microgreen is the cotyledon and first true leaves of a plant. They’re usually cut at 1″ to 1 1/2″ high and you won’t be able to save the seed from them. Microgreens are different from sprouts, which are germinated seeds that are produced almost entirely in water. You can add sprouts to your diet and like microgreens, are a great way to use up old seeds. Microgreens are full of beneficial antioxidants. They also contain nutrients like carbohydrates, fiber, protein and various vitamins and minerals like magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc and vitamins B and C. You need soil or peat moss, coco coir or seed mats to grow microgreens. You don’t need a deep space like a nursery pot because microgreens won’t develop deep roots. Instead, get a shallow tray that drains well. To save money, wash food containers instead of buying trays for your microgreens. If using a food container, carefully add drainage holes. Drainage helps prevent mold from developing. First, prepare the nursery flats or trays, soak the seeds and seed them. Water the seeds, give them plenty of light and keep them warm. Seed them heavily so you have more greens. Crowding won’t be an issue since you will harvest the greens long before then. Covering the seeds with plastic or a humidity tent can speed up germination. Uncover the seeds the moment they break the soil. You don’t have to grow microgreens to maturity and the greens can be ready to eat within 14 days. If you consume a lot of microgreens, try succession planting by planting one flat every week so you can harvest fresh greens one week at a time. A variety of seeds can be used to grow microgreens, such as: If you plan on using old excess seeds for this purpose, make sure you only use untreated seeds. Many seeds intended for garden use are treated with fungicides to inhibit damping-off disease and these aren’t good for growing microgreens. When growing microgreens, you will need more seeds than what you would get in a standard garden seed packet. For example, you may need five grams or more of seeds to seed a flat of micro-greens. To save money, buy microgreen seed packets or untreated extra seeds. Unless you have a lot of old seeds, buy seeds specific for growing microgreens instead of using garden seeds. You should also avoid bird or wild animal seed partly because of how it has been packed and treated. When growing microgreens follow the steps properly to avoid contamination risks, such as E. coli. Some seed varieties are more susceptible than others and the risk increases the longer you store uneaten greens. There are several ways to prevent contamination when growing microgreens. You can use commercial chlorinated packets or rinse the plants frequently as they grow. Another option is to spray chlorinated water from the tap before eating. Note that the shelf life of microgreens is 10 to 14 days after harvest. If several days have passed and your microgreens are starting to look rather unusual, don’t eat them so you don’t get sick. Once you start producing greens or microgreens, use them to make tasty salads, soups or sandwiches. Visit HomeGardeningNews.com for more tips on how to grow vegetables indoors.

https://food.news/2022-12-06-heres-what-happens-go-on-keto-diet.html,Here’s what happens when you go on a keto diet for a week,0,"Advertisement Dieting can be hard, especially if you are used to drinking sugary beverages and eating a lot of junk food. But trying something like the keto diet offers many health benefits, from helping promote weight loss to boosting your overall health. If you have a busy schedule but are interested in going keto, the tips detailed below can help. “Going keto” means regularly putting your body into a state of ketosis, where your liver produces ketone bodies from fat and burns those ketones for fuel. Ketosis happens when the body doesn’t have the insulin supply to convert carbs into energy. Instead, it uses ketones. Ketones are produced during a process called ketogenesis, which occurs when your body breaks fatty acids and ketogenic amino acids into ketones. You can trigger ketosis by limiting your carbohydrate intake and fasting intermittently. Both methods work well together, but if you need a little help going keto, you can also try using ketone ester powder. A ketone ester powder will help raise ketone levels in your blood to help put the body into a state of ketosis. But once you’re on the diet, don’t get discouraged if you don’t see results right away. The diet affects people differently and what works for others might not always work for you. (Related: 5 Tips for a successful keto diet.) The most popular choice for intermittent fasting is known as 16:8 fasting, which involves 16 hours of fasting with an eight-hour eating window. You can also try a 12-hour eating window if that works better for you. You may encounter some issues, like not finding certain meals satiating or having trouble when dining out. The best way to avoid these issues is to plan ahead. Using ketone ester powder also ensures that your body gets its daily ketosis boost. To avoid feeling deprived, look up tasty keto recipes that will help you feel full. If you love burgers, look for a keto-friendly alternative and try the recipe. Start with a healthy breakfast, make a keto-friendly lunch and end the day with a nice dinner. If you crave a midnight snack, eat some dark chocolate, a hard-boiled egg or half an avocado. You can also start your day with a refreshing keto smoothie made with fatty ingredients like full-fat coconut milk, almond butter and avocado. Within your preferred eating window, indulge in high-fat snacks like cottage cheese and raw nuts. To reap all the benefits of ketosis, make sure you also use ketone ester powder. According to studies, ketosis is linked to stable blood sugar levels, lower triglyceride levels and cognitive health. Add ketone ester powder to a glass of water and the juice of half a lemon to make it easier to drink. If you are occasionally tempted to indulge in carb-heavy foods like fresh bread or pancakes, don’t get discouraged. Try again the next day and add a second scoop of ketone ester powder to your keto breakfast smoothie to help turn your off days back on. After going keto for one week, you may experience benefits such as less sporadic energy levels. Since ketone bodies are a fantastic fuel source for the brain, your focus can also improve. These recipes may be keto-friendly, but they’re nutritious and flavorful. Cheesy broccoli This recipe uses the whole plant so you don’t trim off and discard too much of your broccoli stems.

https://food.news/2022-12-06-food-allergies-symptoms-allergens-testing-nutrition-tips.html,"Food allergies: Symptoms, allergens, testing and nutrition tips",0,"Advertisement An allergy occurs when your body reacts to a substance as if it were toxic. To date, experts still don’t know what causes food allergies, or why more people have them now compared to 30 years ago. If you think you may have food allergies, get tested, learn to recognize symptoms of an allergy and avoid your food triggers. In America, recognized food allergies affect at least 7.6 percent of children and 10.8 percent of adults. Unfortunately, some people with food allergies either don’t know they have them or haven’t reported them. This means the exact number of people suffering from some degree of allergic reaction to otherwise perfectly safe foods is probably higher. Allergies aren’t just annoying. In some cases, they can even be potentially life-threatening. A food allergy is an immune response to a specific protein in food. To qualify as an allergen, the food must be normally harmless for most people. In short, an allergy occurs when your immune system overreacts and rejects substances that otherwise would not be a problem. When you eat a food that you are allergic to, your immune system produces antibodies to surround, neutralize, destroy and eliminate the allergen. This reaction is usually a good thing because it helps protect you from a cold or an infection. The antibodies then travel to cells that release various chemicals that cause allergic symptoms. These symptoms often occur in your nose, lungs, throat, sinuses, ears, stomach lining or skin. Allergies that may be immediately life-threatening often manifest within minutes of eating your trigger food or allergen. There are two basic allergy pathways: One that acts quickly involves an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). The non-IgE pathway can take at least several hours or even longer to happen. Allergies are different from food sensitivities and intolerances. Food sensitivities usually trigger a subtle immune response, like fatigue, joint pain and rashes. Meanwhile, food intolerance tends to be exclusively gastrointestinal in nature. A major allergic reaction may cause a life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis. In America, at least one in 50 people experience anaphylaxis from food and other causes. Food allergy symptoms usually occur within five to 30 minutes, or sometimes even up to one hour, of coming into contact with the allergen. Food allergy symptoms can include: Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency, but it can be treated with an epinephrine autoinjector (e.g., an EpiPen) until you can reach emergency medical care. Not all allergic reactions are severe. Non-anaphylactic reactions may include: Food allergies can affect both children and adults, although they are more common in children. Sometimes, people can outgrow childhood food allergies, like eggs or cow’s milk. However, other food allergies persist through adulthood, such as those triggered by fish, peanut, tree nut and shellfish allergies. Some adults can also develop new allergies throughout their lives. Since an allergy is an overreaction of your immune system, almost any kind of food could trigger an allergic response. These foods are responsible for 90 percent of allergic reactions in the U.S. and the U.K.: In 2021, American immunologists added a new food to the list of major food allergens. On April 23, 2021, the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research (FASTER) Act was signed into law. It declared sesame as the ninth major food allergen recognized by the government. To give food manufacturers time to comply with the new labeling requirements, the change will take effect on January 1, 2023. If you’ve had an allergic reaction to food or if you think you may have a food allergy, consult an allergist to help confirm your condition. They can help you devise a treatment plan and teach you what to do in case of anaphylaxis. (Related: Got an egg allergy? Iron treatment may help, says research.) Allergists often start with a skin prick test where they take a small amount of extract made from the suspected allergenic food and place it directly on your skin, like your back or arm. If a raised bump or small hive develops within 20 minutes, you may have a food allergy. Since a skin prick test often has a high false positive rate, it is mainly used to rule foods out. The results will then be used to form a list of possible allergens to investigate further. While researchers have yet to fully understand what causes allergies, one popular theory on what causes food allergies is the “hygiene hypothesis.” According to this theory, growing up in very clean and “antibacterial” environments can make it hard for your immune system to find out what’s harmful and what’s not. Data supports this theory, especially since children growing up in larger households have a lower incidence of allergic disease compared to children from smaller families. Environmental exposures early in life, like growing up on a farm and living with companion animals, are also linked to a diverse bacterial experience and reduced risk of allergic sensitization. Children who live with pets like cats and dogs when they are infants are also less likely to develop allergies as they get older. (Related: Prevent asthma by cleaning less: Increased exposure to allergens and pet dander actually reduces risk.) While some people can outgrow food allergies by adulthood, there’s no known cure for food allergies. Fortunately, if you have food allergies you can make lifestyle changes to diminish their impact on your daily life. The most important one is to avoid the foods you’re allergic to. Even if it’s a healthy food that is usually recommended as part of a balanced diet, look for safer alternatives. Always check food labels When buying groceries, you should always read food labels carefully, especially when buying something you have never tried before. Common food allergens like eggs, nuts and soy are very prevalent in the industrialized food supply. Processed foods are also a common cause of allergies because they contain many food additives. Processed items tend to include hidden proteins from eggs, milk and soybeans to enhance flavor and increase the protein content. Foods like dips and sauces often contain peanuts or tree nut products for texture and flavor. Be careful when ordering food at restaurants While it’s possible to eat out if you have food allergies, you need to be more careful. Always let the restaurant staff know about your allergies. Ask if the food you want to eat contains food triggers. Always bring your allergy meds Even if you’re very careful when buying groceries or dining out, it’s better to always have your allergy meds with you in case of an emergency. You can also try safer natural alternatives like herbs or a saline spray. Increase your intake of dietary fiber If you have food allergies, it’s important to give your immune system its best chance to stay balanced and responsive. You can do this by eating a lot of whole foods and avoiding processed foods. A fiber-rich plant-based diet can’t cure food allergies, but it may offer some benefits. Not getting enough dietary fiber may play a role in the development of food allergies. Introducing more fiber in your diet may also help with symptoms of allergic reactions. Research suggests that a high-fiber diet had a significant impact on gut bacteria, immune system cells and allergic reactions to food compared to a low-fiber diet. Fruits and veggies contain their own type of fiber. Consuming lots of fiber and different kinds of fruits and veggies keeps “good” or beneficial bacteria in your gut healthy, which then helps keep the lining of your gut intact. This can help lower the risk of allergic reactions to food. Fruits and vegetables also contain beneficial antioxidants that help your microbiome thrive. Allergic conditions are characterized by inflammation and antioxidants help protect against inflammation triggers. Data from epidemiological studies have found that the greater the amount of antioxidants in the diet, the less frequent and severe the symptoms of allergic reactions. Choose healthy allergen alternatives After confirming your food triggers, use healthy alternatives to ensure that you get the nutrients you need to stay healthy. If you are allergic to tree nuts, try seeds. If dairy products are an issue, eat plant-based alternatives to cheese and milk. Food allergies can cause minor and severe symptoms so it’s best to confirm your trigger foods. Avoid these allergens and use healthy allergen alternatives to keep your symptoms in check.

https://food.news/2022-12-05-how-to-make-baked-chicken-breast-dinner.html,Prepper recipes: How to make baked chicken breast for dinner,0,"Advertisement If you’re a busy prepper, knowing quick and easy recipes can help you cut down on meal prep time. Try this recipe for juicy baked chicken breast which goes great with beans or baked potatoes. (h/t to FoodStorageMoms.com) Chicken, which is naturally lean, is a great protein source that you can use if you’re trying to keep your family healthy by limiting red meat. However, since chicken is lean you need to cook it the right way so it doesn’t turn up dry. This is why you need a meat thermometer. This tool will help you check if the chicken is cooked properly because it varies in size, from four ounces to a whopping 10 ounces. With the price of meat these days, you’d want to get the most bang for your buck. It’s best to buy boneless chicken breasts because they are all meat and have no bone. While the chicken breast is baking, you have enough time to prepare coleslaw, a tossed salad or open a can or two of green beans as a side dish. You will need: Ingredients for 6 servings: Preparation: Proper baking times for baked chicken breast You can bake boneless chicken breasts at 400 F (177 C). Note that cooking them at higher temperatures will help seal the juices in the meat. Times will vary based on the weight of each chicken breast, so using a meat thermometer is highly recommended. The internal temperature of properly baked chicken breast should be 165 F. Bake chicken breasts at 400 F for 22 to 26 minutes, but this will vary depending on the weight of the chicken breast that you have. Alternatively, you can cook chicken breasts at 350 F (176 C) for about 25 to 30 minutes, again depending on the weight of the chicken breast. Food storage and safety tips The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug (FDA) both recommend storing raw chicken breasts, legs, or a whole chicken in the refrigerator for one to two days. This means regardless of the size, you should only store raw chicken for a maximum of one to two days in the fridge. Cooked chicken should be stored in airtight containers or food storage bags for three to four days, according to the USDA and the FDA. To extend the shelf life of cooked chicken breasts, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap, an airtight container, or a freezer bag. The frozen cooked chicken breast will last for about three to six months in the freezer. Baked chicken breast goes well with mashed potatoes and gravy, but you should also try healthier side dishes like beans or a tossed salad. If you have some leftovers, slice the chicken and use the meat to make chicken sandwiches. Serve the chicken sandwiches with some BBQ sauce or other tasty condiments and homemade fries. Add more greens to your dinner by serving the baked chicken breasts sliced or cubed and added to a fresh salad. Add your favorite salad dressing and let your family enjoy a nutritious and tasty meal. (Related: 6 Easy homemade salad dressing recipes.) Chicken also goes well with plain rice and your favorite toppings like herbs and various sauces. Here are some dishes that you can serve with baked chicken breasts: Balsamic green beans with pearl onions This recipe pairs nutritious green beans with flavorful pearl onions caramelized in butter, garlic and balsamic vinegar. Ingredients for 8 servings: Preparation: Fall salad This salad includes kale and sweet Honeycrisp apples.

https://food.news/2022-12-02-prepper-projects-how-to-build-root-cellar.html,Prepper projects: How to build a root cellar for your food stockpile,0,"Advertisement Your survival stockpile is a crucial part of your emergency preparedness plans, especially if you want to stock up on enough food, water and other supplies for your family. Make the most of your basement or a spare room by turning it into a root cellar for food storage. (h/t to ReadyNutrition.com) A root cellar is a storage location that uses the natural cooling, insulating and humidifying properties of the earth to store food. You can store fruits and vegetables from your home garden or the local farmers’ market in a root cellar, especially if your area frequently experiences power outages. Before refrigeration, preppers used an underground root cellar to effectively store beets, carrots, onions, parsnips, potatoes, turnips, and other root vegetables that they grew in their gardens. Now, root cellars are making a comeback among modern preppers because they can prevent food from freezing during the winter. Root cellars can also keep food cool during the summer, which prevents spoilage. You can also use a root cellar to store jars of canned or pickled vegetables, canned meats and the bulbs or rhizomes of perennial flowers for your garden. Additionally, a root cellar can be used to store wine, beer, or other homemade alcoholic beverages. (Related: Upcycling for preppers: How to turn a broken freezer into a mini root cellar.) If you want your root cellar to work properly, it must be able to hold a temperature of 32 to 40 F (0 to 4.5 C) and a humidity level of 85 to 95 percent. Unfortunately, this means you may need to look at other options if you are in a warm, southern climate since the root cellar may not work properly. If you already have a dark underground area on your homestead, your work is almost over. If you don’t, you need to build your root cellar in a location away from places with a high water table or a septic system. Look for a close and easily accessible location. If your area experiences harsh winters, build your root cellar under a garden shed so you don’t have to remove snow to access it once winter comes. If you are building the root cellar yourself, the best method is to use the foundation walls on the northeast corner of the site as the two sides of the root cellar. Then, build the other two walls in the basement with stud and board. You need to insulate the interior walls, ceiling and door along with any pipes or ducts to keep the heat out. The root cellar will also need a ventilation system that allows cool, fresh air from the outside to be brought into the room so stale air can be exhausted. This will help prevent mold and mildew. If you already have a crawlspace, consider using it for a root cellar. The concrete foundation will provide the “walls” for the structure. Use what you have and if you don’t have ideal space, dig horizontally into the side of a hill on your homestead. If you want to dig in your root cellar, do so in an area with good drainage. Sandier soil works better and having an elevated slope helps because the water will run away from the pit as it moves downward. If your winter temperatures drop below 25 F (-4 C), dig the pit deep enough so that all the crops are under the soil’s surface. Sometimes, this can be too much for produce, especially during the cold winter months. If you don’t have a basement or extra space on your homestead, you can also use a clean metal garbage can to build a DIY root cellar. First, buy a metal garbage can at a local hardware store or at a big box store like Home Depot. A metal garbage can with a lid is ideal, as it will help eliminate water and keep your vegetables from getting wet. Next, dig a hole slightly larger than the diameter of the garbage can. The hole should be deep enough so that the can’s lid will be four inches above the soil level. Backfill dirt around the garbage can. Add straw inside the can as you place the crops. Cover the lid with straw or mulch and a sheet of plastic to keep everything dry. Here are other options to consider if you’re looking to build a root cellar on your homestead: Even if you only have a garbage can root cellar, root vegetables will store well in this environment, even during the coldest weather. Note that some vegetables like onions have to be “cured” before you store them in your root cellar. Before storing onions in your root cellar, cure them in warmer temperatures. Before SHTF, find out what kind of root cellar will suit your prepping needs. If you only have space for a small root cellar on your homestead, it’s still worth it to store excess crops from your home garden so you have more food when winter comes.

https://food.news/2022-12-02-optimizing-gardening-calories-for-your-survival-stockpile.html,Prepper food supply: Optimizing gardening calories for your survival stockpile,0,"Advertisement Many preppers who want to be self-sufficient start a home garden so they can grow fresh, organic fruits and vegetables for their family. If you have excess crops, you can also preserve fruits and veggies for your survival stockpile. But if you want to make the most of your garden crops, think of the gardening calories resulting from your vegetable garden. This means carefully choosing which vegetables to grow and the number of calories that you will get from those vegetables. (h/t to ModernSurvivalBlog.com) Another option is to plan on gardening to be a significant or exclusive source of calories together with other food sources, like raising other protein foods and livestock. You need to plan ahead because what you grow in your garden may be the only thing you can eat when SHTF and you can no longer get more supplies at the grocery store. Before disaster strikes, you need to learn how to maximize your caloric return for your time and effort when you’re growing a vegetable garden to feed your family without other ways to get more supplies. When it comes to survival, preparedness and self-sufficiency, crops you harvest from your garden will need to produce calories. However, many vegetables are low and very low in calories. Fortunately, there are some vegetables that contain more calories than others. All caloric quantities in the vegetable list below have been normalized to 100 grams (3.5 ounces) to compare properly. Note that some of the foods are not typically consumed in these amounts, but the results will let you know where they are when it comes to calories. Nutrition is not accounted for in this list. The food calorie data for each item was determined based on the common method of consuming the item, like some vegetables are consumed raw while others are typically boiled or cooked a certain way. Normalized to 100 grams (3.5 ounces): Generally, vegetables are not very calorie dense. Some notable exceptions are corn and potatoes. But if you want to maximize all the effort you put into your survival garden, you should prioritize calories to maximize the garden’s output based on the diversification of nutrition and the things that you like to eat. When SHTF, calories are going to be crucial when the whole family is in “survival mode.” When disaster strikes, you should plan ahead so you have other food sources aside from your home garden. You can also start growing fruit trees and bushes or shrubs. If you have the space to do so, raise animals like chickens, goats or pigs. You also need to account for failure, which is a normal part of prepping. Learn from your mistakes and try to control what you can control. If you like eating low-calorie but nutritious vegetables like juicy tomatoes, you can still grow them in your home garden. However, when it’s time to start planting, dedicate most of your time and effort on high-calorie crops that will help you feel full longer, like beans and potatoes. For example, if you have excess crops of regular potatoes, you can process or home can them or leave them in cool, dry and dark storage.

https://food.news/2022-12-01-millet-superfood-packed-with-protein-fiber.html,"Here’s why you should eat more millet, a superfood packed with protein and fiber",0,"Advertisement Millet is technically a seed, but its properties are similar to whole grain. This ancient grain may not be as popular as oatmeal or quinoa, but this corn-like seed grain is a great source of fiber. If you’re looking for an alternative to brown rice and oatmeal, try millet. Millet is a type of cereal grass from the Poaceae family. While millet is also commonly found in bird food, it is also a nutritious grain for the human diet. In fact, many countries worldwide consider millet a diet staple. Most of the millet you can find in grocery stores today is grown in countries like China, India and Niger. Millet is a naturally gluten-free grain that looks similar to a corn kernel. It has a relatively mild flavor with slight notes of a sweet, corn-like flavor. Its texture is fluffy like couscous and a bit denser than quinoa. Millet doesn’t alter the flavor of most recipes, making it a versatile ingredient that you can easily incorporate into different recipes. It’s also a great option if you’re looking for a more affordable grain to add to your meal plan. Like other whole grains, millet has an amazing nutritional profile. One cup of cooked millet contains six grams of protein and two grams of dietary fiber. Millet is also rich in folate, B vitamins and minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium and phosphorus. The combination of fiber and protein promotes healthy digestion since the insoluble fiber content acts as a prebiotic, which feeds the beneficial bacteria in your gut microbiome. In a review published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition, scientists observed a link between eating millet and higher levels of hemoglobin, the iron-rich protein that carries oxygen throughout your body. Results showed that regularly eating millet may help reduce iron deficiency anemia, a condition linked to at least 50 percent of anemia cases worldwide. Unlike other grains, millet is a relatively low-glycemic food. Earlier studies suggest that millet may be a helpful food for supporting healthy blood sugar levels. And that’s not all. Millet even offers environmental benefits. Millet is known to have a low carbon footprint because it doesn’t need much water compared to other crops and it grows well even at high temperatures. Millet and quinoa are both impressive superfoods, but the two have certain differences and similarities. Quinoa has all nine essential acids, making it a complete protein. Meanwhile, millet has to be paired with another grain or seed like chia or flaxseed to be a complete protein. As for the pH of these grains, quinoa is acidic and millet is alkaline. This means millet is a better choice if you have a sensitive stomach since it is easier to digest. Millet and quinoa also have some similarities. Both are naturally gluten-free and are considered whole grains. Because both quinoa and millet have prebiotic properties, they can help boost your gut health. Millet is a versatile superfood. Like rice or quinoa, millet is a nutritious carb or grain option to round out your meals. Millet flour Millet flour can’t be used as a substitute for all-purpose flour, but it can be a great addition to recipes if you want to boost your fiber and protein intake. To make the flour, grind up millet. This nutritious, gluten-free flour can be used to make your favorite bread and baked goods. Using millet Boiling is the best method if you want to prepare millet on its own. The common ratio of liquid to millet is 2:1 cups. When hydrated and cooked, millet can triple in size and take on a soft, fluffy texture. Cooked millet can be added to salads, soups, or chilis. It can also be served as a side dish.

https://food.news/2022-11-30-home-gardening-tips-grow-onions-from-seed.html,Home gardening tips: How to grow onions from seed,0,"Advertisement Instead of buying onions every time you’re at the grocery, learn how to grow them from seed so you can just harvest onions from your backyard whenever you need them. If you have excess crops, you can sell them or make preserved onions for your stockpile to consume throughout the year. Compared to other vegetables and herbs, onions are usually very low-maintenance once planted. If you plant the right varieties, you can store onions for up to 12 months. When growing onions, especially if you want to grow enough for your family for at least one year, you need to start by choosing the right type of onion for your growing zone. Narrow your choices down by finding out the types of onions that are good for long-term storage. You can also grow onions that aren’t good for long-term storage, but you should use those onions first. There are short-day, day-neutral and long-day onions. Onion cultivars are grouped according to the number of daylight hours or day length required to trigger the beginning of bulb development. Onion varieties you can grow include: You can try planting either pelleted or regular seeds, but loose seeds may germinate faster than the pelleted variety. While there is nothing wrong with pelleted seeds, you pay more for them per seed and they take longer to germinate. Onions usually have a lower germination rate than other vegetables you may be seeding starting indoors. When starting onions you may want to over-sow, so you don’t have to wait too long when some of your seeds don’t sprout. Follow the tips below to start onions indoors to plant in early spring. Use sterile soil Using sterile soil may seem counterproductive when you want to have a good variety of microorganisms, but if you are starting seeds it’s better to use sterile soil for two reasons: Choose the right container When growing onions, you need a container that’s a bit deeper than what you normally use for other vegetables for proper bulb formation. Simply repurpose the plastic clamshell containers that lettuce comes in at the grocery store. These plastic containers make a great greenhouse while the seeds are sprouting, and they are deep enough that you don’t need to pot up the onions before it’s time to plant them in the garden. Plant the seeds Use your finger and drag it across the soil in a line about 1/4 inch deep and one inch apart. Densely sow the onion seeds and cover them with just a sprinkling of soil. Thin them out later as needed. Water the seeds Use a spray bottle to water the soil until damp. Gently water the seeds so they don’t get moved around. The soil must be damp, not sopping or pooling. Never let the top of the soil dry out during the germination phase. To prevent this, check the soil throughout the day and keep the seeds damp. If you’re using a plastic clamshell container, you don’t need a grow light since you can keep the seeds in the kitchen where you can monitor them. Use a grow light Once the seeds have germinated or sprouted, move them under a grow light. The onions should start growing taller and they will look like tiny green onions. When the onion tops grow to about six to eight inches tall, trim them down with scissors to about four inches. The tops will keep growing so continue trimming them. The onion top trimmings can be used and eaten like green onions. When it’s time to transplant the onions in the garden, it’s important to harden them off to prepare the plants for colder temperatures. Onion sets can be planted outdoors about four to six weeks before the last frost date. This allows the bulbs to get about as big as the bulbs on onion sets that you buy from the store so you have extra growing time. Direct-sowing onions If you want to skip starting onions indoors, direct sow onion seeds once the soil temperature is 35 F. Note that if you do this, your onions will take longer to grow than planting onion sets (which is what you will grow indoors). Additionally, your harvest may be closer to a fall harvest rather than an early to mid-summer harvest. If you want to stock up on onions, learn how to plant, grow and harvest onions from seed.

https://food.news/2022-11-11-food-prep-storage-tips-emergency-food-supply.html,Food prep and storage tips for your emergency food supply,0,"Advertisement Proper food prep and storage are crucial for your survival stockpile. These two prepping essentials can help ensure that you and your family have access to enough food and clean water if you have to bug in at home during a long-term survival scenario. If you want to extend the shelf life of items in your survival stockpile, follow proper food prep techniques and use the right kind of food storage containers. (h/t to FoodStorageMoms.com) If you live in an area prone to major natural disasters, it’s wise to stock up on food before SHTF and your food supply is disrupted. If money is tight, try to always have at least a three-day supply of food for your family since it may take several days before your local grocery store can restock. If possible, you can stock up on enough food for at least a week or a month to cover all your bases. Here are some suggestions on what to stock up on before disaster strikes: Freeze-dried foods can be pricey, but if you have the budget for them they are great for your stockpile since they have a longer shelf life compared to dehydrated foods. Here are some of the other benefits of freeze-dried foods: When SHTF and utilities like water are disrupted, having foods that don’t require cooking, water or refrigeration means you can eat foods without any preparation. Salty food can make you thirsty, which can be a problem if you don’t have a lot of water in your stockpile or if the water supply in your area is limited because of a disaster. Having a variety of items that meet each of your family member’s dietary needs is crucial if you have a baby or if there are elderly family members living with you. Before SHTF, plan ahead and think of different recipes that will use up all the items in your food supply so nothing goes to waste. When buying food for your stockpile, consider what your family likes to eat and buy those items for storage. Stock up on canned goods like beans, fruits, veggies, meat, tuna and other items. You should also stock up on healthy foods like grains, nuts and healthy snacks. And while following a balanced diet is important, when SHTF both children and adults will still enjoy occasional treats like candy, chocolate and other snacks that can help boost morale when things are hard. If you have one or several pets at home like dogs or cats, make sure you also stock up on foods and supplies that they will need like pet food, some treats and water for drinking. When storing food for your survival stockpile, you have several options. You can save time by buying dehydrated emergency foods stored in big buckets from some big box stores and online. Alternatively, you can prepare and store your own food. This can help you save some money if you know how to do it properly. Here are some things to remember when storing food in your survival stockpile: Ideally, you should keep your food supply in a room that is dark, cool and dry, like a basement or root cellar. The ideal temperature would be between 40 F and 70 F. If you don’t have a room like this, make the best of the space that is available to you. Do a routine inspection and record the expiration date of items like dry packages and canned foods. Rotate the items in your stockpile before they expire and always replenish the things you consume so you don’t run out of anything when SHTF. If there is homegrown food stored in your stockpile, they often have to be used up after a year. Don’t leave food in its original paper cartons and boxes, especially if you have an insect or rodent problem at home. If you’re on a tight budget, wrap paper cartons and boxes in sturdy material. Better yet, invest in airtight containers that are also waterproof. Heat sources like refrigerator exhausts, heater vents, ranges and any other type of heat can make food age and spoil faster. These chemical products include oil, gasoline and harmful solvents. Note that certain foods can absorb the smell of these solvents and you don’t want your family members to accidentally eat any tainted food. (Related: Prepping skills: 15 Food storage and preservation methods to learn before SHTF.) Invest in these sturdy food storage containers to protect your food supply from pests and insects and to extend their shelf life Airtight containers are usually made from plastic and are available in different sizes. Airtight containers can be used for storing both dry goods and liquids in your pantry and refrigerator. Food-grade buckets are great for long-term food storage purposes. Some buckets also come with an oxygen absorber that helps maintain freshness. Always buy “food grade” buckets and containers to avoid other containers that may contain harmful chemicals that could seep into your food supply. Glass jars are ideal for either short- or long-term storage. The lids create an airtight seal and they are available in various sizes. Glass jars can also be reused. However, you need to be careful with glass jars because they may break easily. Mylar bags are often used for long-term storage because they can block air, moisture, light and odors. The bags are also very durable, so you don’t have to worry about any punctures or tears, especially if you get thicker bags. Store Mylar bags in sturdy buckets because mice or rodents can chew through them. A vacuum sealer is a machine primarily used for storing meats or fish, but you can also use one on dry goods and vegetables. A vacuum sealer removes all the air from the packaging to extend the shelf life of food items. You can use a vacuum sealer on quart and pint jars when storing dry items. When SHTF, you might lose electricity and it can be hard to cook for your family. Prepare for long-term power outages by making sure you can cook food without having to use electricity. Stock up on these items so you can prepare and cook food even during a power outage: Before SHTF you also need to have an emergency water supply. The recommended amount is one gallon per person per day for at least three days, but if you have the means to do so increase it to four gallons. With four gallons per person, you should have enough clean water for drinking, cooking, doing the laundry and personal hygiene. If you’re using water from a pond or river, boil, purify or filter it before using. The water should be boiled for one minute but if you are at altitudes above 6,562 feet, it should be boiled for three minutes. Alternatively, water from a pond can be treated with purification tablets. Follow the instructions on the package. You need water storage containers so you can stock up on water and keep it clean until you need it. When storing these containers, keep them away from direct sunlight. Rotate the water every six months if you used unscented bleach to avoid contamination. You can also collect rainwater in clean containers if you want to get more water for your supply. Get sturdy containers with covers to prevent contamination. For efficient water storage, invest in 55-gallon plastic drum containers. If space is an issue, you can also store water in smaller five-gallon containers. When storing water containers, keep them away from concrete by placing 2x4s on the floor or stacking them on pallets. This will protect the water from chemicals leeching from the concrete into the container and the water. Prepare before disaster strikes and stock up on food and water for the whole family. Store your supplies in sturdy food-safe containers to extend their shelf life. Go to Foodstorage.news for more tips and tricks on how to properly store food.

https://food.news/2022-11-09-7-health-benefits-eating-foods-omega-3s.html,7 Science-backed health benefits of eating foods high in omega-3 fatty acids,0,"Advertisement Research suggests that omega-3s offer many health benefits, such as improving your heart health and boosting immunity. Detailed below are seven amazing benefits of eating superfoods or taking supplements rich in omega-3s. Omega-3 refers to a group of unsaturated fatty acids with a specific double bond in their chemical structure like alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). According to Dr. Claire Thomas, a medical doctor and clinical content lead at Evergreen Life, omega-3s are called “essential fatty acids” since the human body is unable to produce them. You can only get omega-3s through your diet. You can boost your intake of omega-3s by taking dietary supplements and eating animal or food sources, such as: Animal sources Plant sources: Researchers have also been studying the potential health benefits of omega-3. According to a study published in the journal Nutrients, these nutrients may be the key factor in reducing inflammation levels, a major risk factor for several chronic diseases. Data also suggests that omega-3 could be crucial to your cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems. Thomas said that some studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3s may also offer benefits for health problems like rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory and degenerative joint conditions, along with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Here are seven reasons to incorporate foods rich in omega-3s into your regular diet. Data has found that omega-3s may be essential for the proper functioning of your central nervous system, especially the brain. The results of a study published in the International Journal of Molecular Science revealed that omega-3s may help prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s. Experts believe there are several reasons why omega-3s are good for the nervous system. In an article in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, scientists reported that omega-3s are found in abundance in the brain cell membranes. They added that the compounds may affect how neurons communicate with each other. In another review published in the journal Nutrients, data showed that DHA is one of the key components of healthy brain and eye development. The fatty acid may also have a crucial role in mental health throughout early childhood. Data from the article revealed that low intake of omega-3 may increase the risk of developing conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, bipolar disorder and depression. Research suggests that people who regularly consume omega-3 are less likely to experience depression. Many studies have been conducted to determine the benefits of omega-3s for cardiovascular health and many studies suggest that the compounds offer significant protective effects on the heart. The results of a major Cochrane systematic review found that omega-3s may significantly reduce the risk of dying from coronary heart disease and cardiac events. It also showed that ALA may help prevent arrhythmia. Omega-3 can boost your heart health in several ways. The compounds produce hormones that regulate blood clotting, the contraction and relaxation of artery walls and inflammation in the body. This can be beneficial for preventing heart disease as the compounds work to reduce plaque in the heart’s arteries. Omega-3s may also improve the functioning of the endothelium, the thin membrane that lines the inside of your heart and blood vessels. According to a study from the journal Atherosclerosis, the compounds may help control how much fluid is carried with the blood, and how your blood vessels dilate and constrict. Findings from research conducted on overweight patients with metabolic syndrome have revealed that the compounds may help balance blood lipids, particularly by reducing levels of LDL cholesterol or “bad” cholesterol. Studies have also revealed that omega-3s may have another potential benefit: boosting your immune health. Some studies suggest that omega-3s may affect the composition of your gut microbes. This can then have a positive impact on your gut health. Because your digestive system is the first line of defense against harmful microbes, omega-3 may have an indirect but wide-ranging effect on your whole immune system. In a study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, researchers reported that omega-3s can stimulate the production of antibodies and regulate the functioning of white blood cells. Omega-3 is a significant structural component of the retina so it’s no surprise that it also has a crucial role in eye health. Your retina captures the light that enters your eye and translates it into the images you see. Without omega-3s, you may experience problems with your eyesight. Omega-3 helps optimize “the variability of photoreceptor membranes, retinal thickness, function and provides a protective role.” Additionally, healthy levels of DHA can help prevent damage from bright light exposure and oxidative stress. In research published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, scientists reported that omega-3s may help prevent neovascular eye diseases like diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Both conditions may cause blindness and they both lack treatment options that don’t have any negative side effects. (Related: Healthy skin, vision and mood: 3 Lesser-known benefits of taking omega-3 supplements.) Omega-3s, especially EPA, can help promote healthier skin. Getting enough EPA helps keep your skin moisturized and also reduces the risk and effects of acne. As documented in a study published in the journal Clinics in Dermatology, the compounds may help improve skin hydration and balance out its oil production. Omega-3s can also help reduce the risk of premature aging. Additionally, omega-3s may have a role in the effective management of inflammatory skin diseases. In another study from the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, scientists discovered that the combined omega-3 and omega-6 supplementation was effective at treating symptoms of skin conditions like acne, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. In a review from the British Journal of Nutrition, researchers found that many studies suggest omega-3s may help improve bone mineral density and several bone turnover markers. In a meta-analysis published in the journal Climacteric, results showed that omega-3 may specifically affect the levels of osteocalcin in postmenopausal women. Osteocalcin is a protein hormone with a role in maintaining and regenerating bone tissue. This is crucial because postmenopausal women are at high risk of developing osteoporosis. Experts also discovered that different sources of omega-3 may have a different effects on bone remodeling processes. Flaxseed oil may be better at improving bone structure and fish oil may help boost bone mineral density. According to scientific data, the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 can help reduce pain intensity in many of the body’s joints. Research also suggests that the compounds can help improve joint pain in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Omega-3s also form the support for prostaglandins, which regulate your immune system and protect against joint inflammation. Lastly, studies have found that omega-3 may have a role in sleep regulation. In one article published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, data found that those with higher regular intakes of omega-3s seem to need less sleep. Omega-3s may also help improve sleep in infants since the compounds help organize and mature their sleep-wake routine without affecting total sleep duration or efficiency. Eat foods rich in omega-3s or take omega-3 supplements to boost your overall well-being and improve heart health. Watch the video below to know more about the health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids.

https://food.news/2022-11-09-12-food-preservation-and-storage-techniques-shtf.html,12 Food preservation and food storage techniques you can use when SHTF,0,"Advertisement If you want to prepare for a long-term survival scenario or societal collapse, you have to plan ahead and stock up on survival essentials like food and water for your family. To make things easier for yourself, you can start growing crops in your home garden. You can also learn different methods of preserving food so you have access to healthy fruits and vegetables even when they are not in season. (h/t to ModernSurvivalonline.com) Proper food storage and preservation techniques help prolong the shelf life of various foods so you can add more supplies to your stockpile before SHTF. If you are new to any of these methods, keep in mind that you must learn how to use them properly to avoid mistakes that can cause food poisoning. Here are 12 food preservation and storage techniques you can use when SHTF: When stocking up on liquids for your food stockpile, boiling is ideal because it can effectively kill any lurking microorganisms. Boiling works the same as other heating methods. When you boil something, you push the temperature of various microorganisms like bacteria, parasites and other organisms past the point they can survive. This kills dangerous organisms and they cease to pose a risk to the integrity and safety of the liquid. When SHTF, you can use a campfire, stove or other heat sources to achieve the sustained temperature required to boil liquids like water or milk. However, this method requires a lot of fuel, which might not be ideal if you want to conserve your resources. Burying is a primitive but effective food storage method that involves digging a hole and burying food in the ground. This method works best when you use certain foods and certain kinds of soil. Burying preserves food through a variety of mechanisms, specifically by depriving the bacteria that would eat the food of oxygen. The method also helps lower the ambient temperature, eliminates the light that reaches the food and sometimes lowers the pH level of the environment around the food. Burying food may also help draw moisture out of the food. Note that the drier and saltier the soil, the more effective it will be. You can also bury containers of food in frozen soil. Read up on different burying techniques for food preservation to make sure it suits the kind of food you want to bury. For example, root vegetables are perfect for burying because they are naturally resistant to spoilage under such conditions. Canning is a common food storage method that is often used to preserve fruits and veggies. Canning can also be used to preserve meats and dairy products. Canning food involves placing cooked or processed food in a sterilized jar that is then sealed. The jar of food is boiled to kill off bacteria that may already be present in the food. If done properly, the food is stored in an environment where no bacteria can get in. Canning helps significantly extend the shelf life of food, even without refrigeration. Chilling or cooling food helps decrease the rate of decomposition by slowing down the reproduction, growth and action of different microorganisms and the enzymes they produce that cause food spoilage. While chilling may not be necessary if you have a large fridge and a freezer at home, this method can be used by those who live in cold climates. If you are one of those preppers, you can cool food by storing things in sturdy boxes to protect against animals. Another option is to use a root cellar or icebox. When the grid goes down, you can cool food by harvesting ice and using an icebox for preservation even without electricity. Confit is a method that hails from France and consists of slowly cooking food fully immersed in grease, oil, or syrup at a low temperature. The food being preserved can also be immersed in its own rendered fat, like if you’re preserving meat. The food is then slowly heated to a relatively low temperature for a long period of time. Once the food is done, if you’re not going to eat it right away it can be stored in its own cooled and congealed liquid. Fruits can be turned into confit by cooking them whole or in pieces, especially when preparing larger fruit. Potatoes, tubers and other roots are also suitable for confits. When meats are cooked in their own rendered fats at a very low temperature, you never go higher than 185 F. Confit-preserved foods can be canned, jarred, or jugged. Freezing prevents decomposition by turning the moisture in food into ice. This helps stop the growth of almost all species of microorganisms that cause spoilage. One of the biggest advantages of freezing is that you don’t need additional work or preservatives as long as the food remains frozen. The food needs to reach a stable temperature of 15 F or lower to completely prevent typical bacteria from growing. This temperature also helps significantly extend the shelf life of food. For extreme long-term storage, freeze the food at an even lower temperature. Note that this may not be practical if you don’t have access to the necessary refrigeration technology. It’s best to freeze foods with a modest to low moisture content. These items can then be thawed before food prep with minimal loss of taste and texture. While foods with a high moisture content or delicate consistency may not taste as good as fresh after freezing, they are still safe to eat. Heating food helps kill microorganisms that cause spoilage by warming them to a temperature where they can’t survive. Note that after the food has cooled down or heat is no longer applied, bacteria can still continue to grow in the food. (Related: Food preservation 101: A step-by-step guide to air-drying fruits.) Jellying means preserving food by cooking it with ingredients that solidify into a gel form. Gelatin is often used for jellying, but other common ingredients include agar, arrowroot flour and maize flour. Animal-derived proteins that you can also use include those derived from eels and certain worms. Jellying is often used in North America to make fruit preserves, jams and jellies. It is also used to make savory jellying preparations like tomato aspic. While jellying meat or vegetables can still preserve foods at room temperature, they are often cooled via refrigeration or other chilling techniques for best results. Lye preservation involves the use of lye and sodium hydroxide to change the pH balance of food. Since lye is extremely alkaline, food treated with lye is rendered too alkaline, preventing bacteria from growing. This technique is used to make a famous traditional Norwegian dish called lutefisk, which literally translates to “lye fish.” Similar but less radical methods are used to soften olives, Lye preservation is also used to give bagels and pretzels a glossy, crispy crust while baking. Pickling is one of the most delicious methods of food storage. It involves preserving food in any liquid which inhibits or kills microbes that cause spoilage. It is used to make pickled cucumbers and pickled eggs. Pickling is great for preppers because it doesn’t require expensive tools. There are two broad categories of pickling: chemical pickling and fermentation pickling. Fermentation pickling works by hosting “good” bacteria in the liquid used to preserve the food. The bacteria produce an organic acid that acts as a preservation agent. Fermentation pickling is used to make popular foods like kimchi and sauerkraut. Chemical pickling uses an edible liquid agent like alcohol, salty brine, vegetable oils, or vinegar. This method used heating to ensure that the food in the liquid agent becomes completely saturated to help eliminate places bacteria could hide in. Chemical pickling is used to preserve foods like cucumbers, okra, peppers and corned beef. Here are other fruits and vegetables that you can use to make pickles at home: Salting or curing refers to the process used to preserve and flavor meat, fish, or vegetables with salt. Salt helps draw moisture out of the food via osmosis. Osmosis also increases the amount of salt in the food and simultaneously reduces the potential moisture that it can contain. This makes it hard for microscopic organisms to grow in cured food. Variations in curing are achieved with the addition of dehydration, smoking, sugaring, nitrates and other processes. Curing is also a great method for preppers because you can master it with a bit of research and some practice. Use curing to preserve meats and vegetables for your food stockpile. Like salting or curing, sugaring also draws water from food as it dehydrates and kills microorganisms. When sugaring, the food is dehydrated first and then packed or surrounded with pure sugar, either in crystal form or in a liquid or syrup form. Sugaring is often used to preserve fruit, which is ideal for this food preservation method because fruits often have high sugar content. You can also use this method to preserve vegetables, like root vegetables. One downside to sugaring is you may run out of sugar in a post-SHTF world if you are trying to process a lot of fruits. Additionally, sugar, especially crystalline sugar, attracts moisture. Yeast blooms may occur when moisture levels are sufficient, which can cause fermentation. Uncontrolled fermentation can cause food spoilage in your stockpile, so use sugaring with caution and store food properly to avoid it. Learn different methods of preserving food for your stockpile so you can still feed your family after SHTF. Watch the video below for more tips on how to make pickles.

https://food.news/2019-03-24-one-seed-at-a-time-tips-for-growing-your-own-vegetable-garden.html,One seed at a time: Tips for growing your own vegetable garden,0,"Advertisement It can be daunting to plan your own garden, especially if you’re a beginner. If you need some help, we’re sharing some tips that can help you design a bountiful home garden. (h/t to ReadyNutrition.com) When planning a vegetable garden, start by outlining your goals for the coming growing season. If you’ve already started gardening, take note of some mistakes that you made in the previous season so you can avoid them as you restart your garden. Here are five tips that can help you become a better gardener. Before you start planting seeds, formulate a realistic plan of action. Begin each year by making a list of plants that you want to grow. Creating this list will help you map out how much food you plan on growing for your family. Study which plants can be planted in close proximity – such as bunching onions, lettuce, and spinach – and which ones need lots of space – like melons and pumpkins. Next, research which vegetables and fruits are suitable for intercropping or interplanting. Intercropping means “planting two vegetables in the same space,” especially crops that can share space amicably. Try to plant early crops that will be removed from the garden next to late-season crops. Intercropping also combines plants to save space. Choose ideal pairs from the lists below. Fast growers: Slow to fill out: After you’ve done your research, start drawing out how your garden will look. Having an actual plan will help you stay on target for the space you will allot when you start planting in your garden. If you wish to create biodiversity in your future garden, start with the soil. You can make homemade fertilizers using items that are normally thrown out, like banana peels, egg shells, and used coffee grounds. These organic materials can produce a “nutrient-rich, full spectrum fertilizer” that will slowly release the nutrients to the soil in your garden. (Related: A beginner’s guide to gardening: 10 Expert tips everyone must consider.) Alternatively, you can help your crops grow by adding a compost bin to your garden. Composting will put brown and green items to good use since they are full of nitrogen and carbon-rich materials. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are anything grown in a laboratory using modern techniques, like gene splicing. GMO seeds produce vegetables that may contain allergens or toxins, which you don’t want in your food. If you’re buying seeds for long-term sustainability, you need non-hybrid and heirloom quality seeds. Non-GMO seeds will produce fertile seeds that can be stored for future harvests. Grow non-hybrid seeds using only organic fertilizers so your vegetables have access to the best nutrients that nature can provide. If you want to save money, start early by growing your own seeds. Check the optimum growing time for your location, then start around that time. Another way to get a head start is by making your own seed starting mix. This will save you money, and it can also give your plants the best chance at growing hearty roots. To make a healthy seed starting mix, use light, well-screened materials that promote root growth. These materials will also ensure that the mix doesn’t compact in small seed starting cells or containers. Other factors to consider are good moisture retention and drainage. Soil that is too moist may result in damping off, which can make pathogens grow. Damp soil can also kill or weaken seeds or seedlings before or after they germinate. Seeds need optimum growing conditions to grow healthy. After you choose your seeds, the early stages of your gardening process will involve starting your seeds. If the weather is dreary, get a head start on your future garden by starting the seeds indoors. Seeds started indoors can produce earlier and longer harvests. This gardening method doesn’t require special equipment – all you need is moist soil, comfortable temperatures, and a bit of hard work. Longer growing varieties such as broccoli, cauliflower, and onions will benefit the most from indoor growing methods. Doing this also allows you to control their growing environment. These tips should help you get your home garden started. In time, you will have access to nutritious and organically grown vegetables even after SHTF."
https://food.news/2019-03-23-acrylamide-health-risks-associated-with-french-fries.html,Say no to acrylamide: The 4 health risks associated with french fries,0,"Advertisement A burger isn’t complete without a plate of salty, greasy French fries. But did you know that fries contain a carcinogen called acrylamide? If you just can’t get enough of French fries, it’s time to read up on the four health risks of eating this popular fast food. French fries are full of fats that can make you gain unwanted weight. A single serving of French fries has 24 g of fat, but your daily diet shouldn’t include more than 65 g. According to a study conducted by the Diabetes and Obesity Center of Excellence at the University of Washington, a diet high in fats can damage the brain’s nerve cells that control body weight. French fries also contain high amounts of saturated and trans fats. The American Heart Association warns that these kinds of fat can increase blood cholesterol, which can then increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and Type 2 diabetes. The excess salt (sodium chloride) in fries can also cause water retention in your body, which results in weight gain. French fries are seasoned with a lot of salt. Anything salty consumed regularly may increase your blood pressure, which can cause heart and kidney ailments and even a stroke. According to the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), formerly called the Institute of Medicine, you should only consume 1,500 to 2,000 mg (or half a teaspoon) of salt daily. However, the average American consumes around two teaspoons of salt per day. A serving of French fries has at least one-third of the recommended daily intake (RDA) of salt or more than 600 mg. French fries are full of carbohydrates and “bad” fats. A serving of fries has 63 g of carbohydrates. When consumed in moderation, carbohydrates are beneficial and they give your body energy. Fiber is also a type of carb that promotes proper digestion and restricts the excess release of insulin. However, the potatoes used to make French fries are peeled, which strips them of fiber. Eating a lot of fries also increases your salt and starch intake along with fats from the oil used to fry them. All these factors combined can increase your risk of developing health problems like cancer, heart disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes. Pregnant women should avoid consuming French fries altogether because it contains acrylamide, a carcinogenic and neurotoxic agent. Acrylamide is found in foods fried at higher temperatures of more than 365 F. Fetuses and newborns are more susceptible to the effects of acrylamide since their blood-brain barrier still isn’t fully developed. According to a study published in the Plant Biotechnology Journal, baking, frying, or roasting starchy foods at higher temperatures produces acrylamide. To limit your intake of acrylamide, avoid frying food for a long time, reusing oil, or heating it excessively. (Related: Eating fried food just twice per week increases your chance of early death.) If you want to lower your risk of cancer, heart disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes, limit your consumption of French fries. You can try making healthier homemade fries by baking potatoes in olive oil instead. Try these healthy alternatives to French fries the next time you feel like munching on a savory snack."

https://food.news/2019-03-20-not-all-decorative-food-glitters-are-safe-to-eat.html,"Not all decorative food glitters are safe to eat, warn health officials",0,"Advertisement Kids love shiny things, and edible glitter seems like the best way to make a birthday cake prettier and more fun to eat. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that not all kinds of decorative food glitter and dust are safe for consumption. On December 2018, the FDA warned consumers that while manufacturers claim that their decorative glitter and dust can be safely used to decorate food, the products may actually contain ingredients that shouldn’t be eaten. According to the FDA, edible glitters and dust products are required by law to list their ingredients. These edible ingredients will often include: The FDA reported that edible glitter also contains color additives specifically approved for food use, like mica-based pearlescent pigments. The maltodextrin in food glitter is a white powder made from corn, potato starch, rice, or wheat. However, while maltodextrin is made from natural ingredients, the final product is highly processed. After the starches are cooked, acids or enzymes like heat-stable bacterial alpha-amylase are added to break it down further. The resulting white powder is water-soluble and has a neutral taste. Take note that maltodextrin is high on the glycemic index (GI). This means that it can cause a spike in your blood sugar very quickly, especially when consumed in large amounts. Avoid foods that contain this additive, especially if you have diabetes. Maltodextrin is also linked to weight gain because it is a sweetener and a carbohydrate with no nutritional value. The levels of sugar in maltodextrin can lead to weight gain. Since maltodextrin is often used as a cheap thickener or filler, it is usually made from genetically modified (GMO) corn. The FDA also warned that consumers must pay attention to labels on food products. Most edible glitters and dusts will say “edible” on the label. But products labeled “non-toxic” and without an ingredients list, like non-toxic craft glitter, should never be eaten, added the FDA. (Related: Are You Giving Your Child a Daily Dose of Toxins?) If you use non-edible products as food decor, always remove these decorations before serving and eating the food, advised the FDA. Dr. Zhaoping Li, professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Clinical Nutrition at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) suggested that even though the sparkly product is safe to eat, it is better to exercise caution when it comes to consuming items made with edible glitter. She concluded, “Our body can only take care of it if we only consume things like glitter foods once a while…in small amounts.” If you wish to use safer and non-toxic alternatives to edible glitter, consider using edible flowers as food decor. Edible flowers aren’t just beautiful, they also taste delicious. Do take note that you should only use organic flowers that haven’t been sprayed with pesticides or other chemicals. Purchase edible flowers from your local produce store or from reputable online sources. Before cooking with or serving edible flowers, clean them by gently washing the flowers in a large bowl of cold water. Let the flowers air-dry on a paper towel, then use them immediately or store them in the refrigerator for at least one week in an airtight container lined with a damp paper towel. Below is a list of beautiful and tasty edible flowers that you can use as garnish. Avoid using edible glitter to limit your exposure to toxic ingredients. Use safer and natural alternatives like edible flowers as food decor instead."
https://food.news/2019-03-19-6-health-benefits-of-boysenberries.html,6 health benefits of boysenberries,0,"Advertisement The boysenberry is a superfood that has many health benefits. According to several studies, boysenberries are linked to improved brain and lung health. The fruit can also help boost your digestion and immunity. Listed below are the six health benefits of boysenberries. Boysenberries can boost brain health because they contain anthocyanin, a flavonoid with antioxidant effects that can help boost memory. Anthocyanins can also prevent oxidative damage. Additionally, they can lower your risk of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline. Boysenberries are anti-inflammatory and can help boost your immunity and prevent different types of cancer, such as malignant esophageal and colorectal tumors. The berries also have vitamin C that can help fight off infections and eliminate cancer-causing free radicals. Boysenberries can improve heart health since they have the antioxidant vitamin C. The berries also have a good potassium-sodium ratio. A cup of boysenberries contains 183 milligrams (mg) of potassium, which can help balance out the negative effects of salt. This then helps reduce the risk of high blood pressure. According to a 2014 study published in the Journal of Nutritional Science and Vitaminology, the polyphenolic compounds of boysenberry juice can help reduce nitric oxide concentration through the “aortic endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation in hypertensive rats.” In short, boysenberry could be beneficial for heart health, and it may help lower blood pressure. (Related: Japanese study concludes that boysenberries help maintain vascular stability.) In a separate 2015 study, researchers determined that the polyphenols in boysenberry juice helped inhibit plasma triglyceride absorption levels in rats. Lung fibrosis can negatively affect the lung function of individuals with chronic asthma. In a 2016 study, scientists determined that eating boysenberries can support the development of fibrolytic lung macrophages with the airway capacity to promote balanced lung repair. The study findings also suggest that regularly consuming boysenberries can help limit lung damage in people with chronic asthma and other pulmonary diseases. A cup of boysenberries has 0.72 mg of manganese, which provides at least 36 percent of your recommended daily intake. Some studies suggest that individuals who have seizures also have lower manganese levels. Boysenberries can help digestive issues such as constipation since berries contain fiber that can promote regular bowel movements. Boysenberries, which are related to blackberries, are bluish purple-colored, juicy berries. The tangy, tart berries can be eaten on their own, but they can also be used to make: Boysenberries have a unique juicy, rich, sweet, and tart flavor. When buying boysenberries, look for fresh berries that aren’t bruised at farmers markets. Reddish, under-ripe boysenberries are very tart, so look for sweeter darker-colored berries. Boysenberries are full of nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and some protein. These berries contain Vitamins A, C, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, E, and K. Boysenberries also contain: The vitamin K in boysenberries can help prevent kidney stones. It can also boost bone strength, which can lower your risk of osteoporosis. Boysenberries contain vitamins A and C that can help address or prevent vision-related disorders. Add nutrient-rich boysenberries to your regular diet if you want to boost your brain and lung health."
https://food.news/2019-03-18-the-8-health-benefits-of-anti-inflammatory-bok-choy.html,The 8 health benefits of anti-inflammatory bok choy,0,"Advertisement Bok choy, a type of Chinese cabbage, is a popular anti-inflammatory food. The vegetable, which is also called pak choi or pok choi, offers many health benefits. Bok choy is good for heart health and it can also lower your cancer risk. Bok choy contains vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, C, E, and K. It also has betaine, choline, and folate. This cruciferous vegetable also contains fiber and protein. Bok choy also has the following minerals: Here are just some of the health benefits of eating bok choy. The vitamin C in bok choy can strengthen the immune system. The vegetable contains selenium which can stimulate killer T-cell production. This can then prevent illnesses caused by invading viruses and bacteria. Bok choy can lower your risk of breast, colon, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancer. It is also full of beneficial antioxidants like vitamin C and E, indole-3-carbinol, indole, isothiocyanates, lutein, nitrile, sulforaphane, thiocyanates, and zeaxanthin. The antioxidants indole, nitrile, and sulforaphane help prevent cancer since they can inactivate carcinogens and protect cells from DNA damage. According to several studies, eating multiple servings of cruciferous vegetables weekly can lower your risk of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. Bok choy is full of nutrients that are good for bone health: Bok choy is chock-full of beta-carotene and vitamin A that can both help prevent cataracts, improve low-light vision, and treat dry eyes. Beta-carotene can also help treat macular degeneration, an eye condition that results in vision loss. (Related: Amazing Health Benefits Of Bok Choy.) Bok choy has vitamin C which can grow collagen, a protein that is crucial for hair and skin health. Collagen can improve your complexion and smooth wrinkles. Bok choy has vitamin K and omega-3 fatty acids that can lower your risk of inflammation, which is associated with various health conditions. The vegetable also has choline and polyphenols that can minimize inflammation. Bok choy has calcium, magnesium, and potassium that can help lower your blood pressure naturally. The potassium in bok choy can limit the negative side effects of sodium, which can damage the cardiovascular system. The vitamin K in bok choy is also needed for blood clotting/coagulation. This process helps prevent excessive bleeding both inside and outside the body. The human body needs vitamin K to produce the proteins needed for the clotting process. An individual who is vitamin K deficient doesn’t have enough of these proteins and one of the symptoms of a deficiency is bleeding too much. Additionally, bok choy has folate and vitamin B6 which can both help prevent the accumulation of homocysteine. Experts believe homocysteine is linked to heart problems and damage blood vessels. Research suggests that cruciferous vegetables like bok choy can help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar levels. Bok choy is very low on the glycemic index, which is a must for any anti-diabetes diet. Consult a healthcare professional before you increase your intake of bok choy, especially since the vegetable is goitrogenic. This means bok choy has chemicals that interfere with thyroid hormone production. Additionally, bok choy is rich in vitamin K. If you are taking blood-thinners (e.g., warfarin) talk to a medical expert before you add this vegetable to your diet. Adding bok choy to your diet can help lower your cancer risk and boost your heart health."
https://food.news/2019-03-16-chicken-noodle-soup-is-not-healthy.html,A bowl of lies: Here’s why chicken noodle soup (especially store-bought ones) is not as healthy as you think,0,"Advertisement Chicken noodle soup is a comforting dish that’s often eaten on a cold day or if you’re recovering from an illness. However, not all kinds of soup are nutritious. In fact, eating canned chicken noodle soup could be bad for your health. Unless you’re making your own batch, store-bought chicken noodle soup may contain too much sodium or have unnecessary ingredients. According to Devin Alexander – celebrity chef and author of the diabetic-friendly cookbook called “You Can Have It!” – chicken noodle soup isn’t always a healthy dish. She warns that if you have high blood pressure, you need to be especially picky about the soup that you consume. Listed below are the common ingredients used in chicken noodle soup and how it can add or take away from a serving’s nutritional value. Chicken is full of protein, which can boost the immune system. However, since dark meat is less expensive than white meat, restaurants often use dark meat in their chicken noodle soup. Alexander notes that white meat is the healthier protein source for your soup. Kate Letten, a registered dietitian based in Riverside, Illinois, adds that diced chicken (or the white meat with the fat cut off) is a high biological value protein. This means diced chicken has all the essential protein that the human body can’t naturally produce. Letten explained that one cup of diced chicken has 43 g of protein while a cup of Campbell’s Homestyle Chicken soup only has 14 g of protein. Unlike homemade soup, canned chicken noodle soup only have around a third of the protein. If you make your own chicken noodle soup, you can control what goes into the dish. However, you need to be careful when following recipes that use rotisserie chicken. Alexander warns that rotisserie chicken contains too much fat and salt, so it’s better to follow other healthier recipes. She suggests poaching white meat chicken breast in stock so the meat stays lean. Noodles are full of carbohydrates that can help you feel full and satisfied. Most of the time, chicken noodle soup is made with white pasta instead of whole grain or whole wheat, unless you’re eating gluten-free soup. But even gluten-free noodles are made from rice instead of higher-fiber options. If you’re making soup at home, use high-fiber pasta like green lentil pasta, or one that has added protein. Hearty chicken broth has vitamins, minerals, and some fat. Warm broth can ease upper respiratory tract symptoms by providing hydration and stimulating nasal clearance. Bone broth and homemade broth can be nutritious, but it’s hard to make them without using some salt. If you want to limit the sodium content of your broth, make your own soup. Instead of salt, use spices like garlic and pepper, along with some fresh herbs. When you’re eating store-bought soup, check the label for its sodium content. According to the label on one brand of store-bought canned soup, it has “25 percent less sodium chicken noodle soup.” However, it contains 660 milligrams (mg) of sodium in half a cup and 1,220 mg in one cup. This is almost half of the recommended daily allowance of sodium for healthy individuals. (Related: Take a Look at the Chemicals in Processed Foods.) If you want to make healthy chicken noodle soup, use organic carrots, celery, garlic, and onions. Leave the skin on the carrots because they are full of nutrients. Carrots, celery, and onions have vitamins A and C, along with other antioxidants that can boost your immune system so you can fight off viruses. They may also help your body recover from illness more quickly. On the other hand, canned chicken noodle soup has little to no grams of fiber. Before vegetables like carrots, celery, and onions are added to soup stock, they’re usually sauteed in butter. If you want to make your chicken noodle soup “cleaner” and lighter, replace butter with extra virgin olive oil, which can also boost the flavor of the vegetables. Chicken noodle soup contains little to no calcium. To remedy this, you can eat fiber-rich apples and cheese as side dishes. Don’t serve store-bought soups to your family. If you want to help them recover from a cold, serve nutritious, homemade chicken noodle soup instead."
https://food.news/2019-03-16-5-types-of-foods-to-boost-your-bodys-immunity.html,Here are 5 types of foods that boost your body’s immunity,0,"Advertisement Following a healthy diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, and nuts and seeds can significantly improve your overall well-being. However, if you want to boost your immunity and prevent colds and the flu, consume more of these five types of foods rich in various nutrients. Carotenoids are a type of antioxidant, and they belong to a class of pigments found naturally in various plants. When you consume these fruits and vegetables, your body converts the carotenoids into vitamin A, which helps regulate your immune system. These foods are rich in carotenoids: Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of essential fatty acid that can help reduce inflammation and keep the immune system in check. Studies have yet to determine if omega-3s can help prevent infections (like the common cold), but research suggests that omega-3s can protect against immune system disorders like Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. These foods are rich in omega-3s: Zinc is an essential mineral that is needed for the production of certain immune cells. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), having mildly low levels of zinc can affect your immune function. Listed below are foods that contain zinc: Vitamin C is an essential nutrient that also functions as an antioxidant. Antioxidants help fight free radicals, and these unstable molecules can damage your immune system. Scientific data suggest that vitamin C can significantly strengthen your immune system if you are under major stress. Boost your vitamin C intake by adding the following foods to your diet: Vitamin E is another potent antioxidant. Studies suggest that “maintaining ample levels of vitamin E is crucial for maintaining a healthy immune system, especially among older people.” (Related: Quercetin is one of the most potent natural antioxidants on the planet.) You can boost your vitamin E intake by adding these foods to your diet: You can also strengthen your immune system by getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and managing stress levels. Other foods that can help boost your immune system include foods rich in probiotics (e.g., kefir and yogurt), garlic, and green tea. Add these nutritious foods to your diet to keep your immune system strong and prevent illness such as the common cold."
https://food.news/2019-03-14-mediterranean-diet-linked-to-lower-depression-risk.html,"Mediterranean diet linked to lower depression risk, according to study",0,"Advertisement There are various diets that can promote weight loss or prevent different diseases, but experts still consider the Mediterranean diet to be one of the healthiest. According to a study, this particular diet is also linked to a lower risk of depression. The study, which was published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, was conducted by researchers from Deakin University, University College London (UCL), University Hospital of Montpellier, and the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. The Mediterranean diet mostly includes plant-based foods, such as: This diet also uses healthy oils like olive oil. Instead of salt, dieters are encouraged to use herbs and spices to flavor foods. Steaks or other red meat should only be consumed a handful of times every month. According to the results of this study, “a diet low in saturated fat, sugar, and processed foods can reduce the risk of depression by 24 percent over a 12-year period.” For the study, the researchers did a meta-analysis of over 1.5 million healthy adults. The findings revealed that following a Mediterranean diet was linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality and overall mortality. The researchers reviewed studies that used various dietary measures to gauge participant adherence to the Mediterranean diet such as the Dietary Inflammatory Index and the Healthy Eating Index. The researchers noted that a lower inflammatory index was linked with lower depression incidence in four longitudinal studies. Aside from a lower risk of depression, the Mediterranean diet is also associated with a reduced incidence of cancer, along with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The study findings also suggest that women on the Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and mixed nuts could also have a lower risk of breast cancer. Because of these health benefits, several major scientific organizations advise healthy adults to have eating habits that mimic the Mediterranean diet. Dr. Camille Lassale, a research associate at UCL and a member of the research team that conducted the study, said that a plant-based diet that includes anti-inflammatory foods “can help prevent depression.” The researchers added that individuals who strictly followed a Mediterranean diet had a 33 percent lower risk of developing depression over the next eight to 12 years, unlike those who didn’t follow this diet. (Related: Mediterranean-style diet found to improve quality of life for people who are depressed.) On the other hand, an unhealthy diet full of processed food, saturated fat, and sugar was linked to a higher risk of developing depression. The researchers also suggested that dietary advice should be part of mental health treatment, especially since an individual’s physical and mental well-being are often intertwined. Mary Fristad, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral health, psychology, and nutrition at The Ohio State University, believes the study was “a nicely done systematic review.” She shared that everyone seeks comfort food “on a short-term basis,” and that there is a link between healthy eating habits and depression. However, Fristad warned that this link isn’t about cause and effect. The link between your diet and mental health is more about “changing the odds to be more in your favor,” especially since following a plant-based diet reduces inflammation in the brain. Studies suggest that there is a link between inflammation in the brain and depression. Fristad shared that she uses an educational approach on her patients called SEE, which stands for sleep, eating, and exercise. The professor noted that making positive changes to improve these three areas can improve the patient’s ability to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Fristad also highlighted the importance of avoiding inflammatory foods since inflammation can affect the brain. Inflammation can affect vasculation and increase insulin resistance. Dr. Lassale concluded that there is also emerging evidence which suggests that the link between the gut and brain could have a crucial role in mental health. This axis is “modulated by gastrointestinal bacteria,” which can be modified by following a healthier diet."

https://food.news/2019-03-14-how-does-a-plant-based-diet-help-diabetics-have-a-better-mood.html,How does a plant-based diet help diabetics have a better mood?,0,"Advertisement Following a healthy diet can help a person with diabetes manage their blood sugar and lower their risk for cardiovascular diseases. According to a study, a plant-based diet may even help enhance the mood of diabetics. The meta-analysis, which was published in the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care, involved researchers from the University of London. For the study, the team of researchers conducted a review to determine the best nutritional interventions for individuals diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. The findings suggest that plant-based or fully vegan diets were the best in managing this condition. According to the International Diabetes Federation, at least 642 million people will have diabetes by 2040. In the U.S., over 30 million people have already been diagnosed with diabetes. About 15 percent of all global deaths are due to diabetes, and the condition claimed the lives of five million people younger than 60 in 2015. Diabetes is often linked to depression, which then influences how well an individual manages their blood glucose (sugar) levels. The scientists explained that a plant-based diet was already associated with a reduced risk for Type 2 diabetes. In fact, this diet was also associated with improved biomarkers like cholesterol, which are linked to an individual’s cardiovascular health. The study authors noted that a plant-based diet is beneficial since it can help prevent diabetes. The foods included in this type of diet also contains antioxidants, fiber, micronutrients and unsaturated fatty acids that have protective factors against the condition. (Related: Following a plant-based or vegan diet can reduce risk factors of Type 2 diabetes, research indicates.) But prior to this meta-analysis, experts have yet to determine whether these types of diets could be linked to improved mood states in people with Type 2 diabetes, especially since the condition “is often comorbid with depression.” The researchers mentioned that they didn’t find any systematic reviews in the literature that solely focused on “the psychological and medical outcomes of plant-based diet interventions in adults” that have Type 2 diabetes. For the meta-analysis, the scientists analyzed over 1,200 articles, which were then reduced to 40 articles. The research team then selected 11 articles that best match the search criteria. Out of the 11 selected articles, 10 studies were conducted since 2009, while one study was from 1999. The 11 studies observed a total of 433 volunteers, with 219 in the intervention groups and 214 in the control groups. The mean size of the studies was 48 participants, and the average length was about 28 weeks. After a systematic critical analysis of the results, the researchers determined that both physical and emotional quality of life only improved in the patients who followed a plant-based or vegan diet. Depressive symptoms were significantly improved among the people who belonged to these groups. According to the study findings, the participants who were on plant-based diets also improved their blood glucose levels and lost more weight compared to those in the control groups. Additionally, those in the plant-based groups reported reduced levels of diabetic nerve pain. The researchers concluded, “Based on the evidence of the research analysis by this systematic review, it can be concluded that plant-based diets accompanied by educational interventions can significantly improve psychological health, quality of life, HbA1c levels and weight, and therefore the management of diabetes.” Individuals with diabetes should follow a plant-based diet, especially if they want to lose weight. This diet is beneficial since it lowers your risk of various weight-related health conditions such as heart disease. If you’re not sure where to start, add more whole, unprocessed plant foods to your diet that are loaded with water and fiber. These kinds of food can help you become “mechanically full” before you become “calorically full.” If you’re on a plant-based diet, eat more of the following foods: Individuals with Type 2 diabetes should switch to a plant-based diet if they want to manage their blood glucose and improve their mood."
https://food.news/2019-03-14-toxic-foods-that-may-cause-dementia.html,Toxic foods that may cause dementia,0,"Advertisement Your physical and mental health are closely intertwined. If you follow a healthy diet, you can significantly improve your overall well-being. Conversely, if you follow a diet full of processed food and soda, you will increase your likelihood of getting dementia, according to multiple studies. Consuming a lot of complex carbohydrates, processed foods, and sugar stimulates the production of toxins in the body. These toxins can then cause a buildup of plaque in the brain, which may cause inflammation. Experts believe chronic inflammation is often linked to disorders such as dementia. Sadly, not many people realize the importance of a healthy diet. When you eat lean meat, nuts, fresh fruits and vegetables, and seeds, you can boost your heart health, lower the risk of conditions like cancer and diabetes, manage blood pressure, and prevent various illnesses. On the other hand, poor nutrition can negatively affect your memory and increase your risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. According to several studies, which were published in the journals Alzheimer’s & Dementia and Stroke, individuals who often consume sugary beverages tend to have poorer memory. The researchers also warned that these people can also have smaller brain volume and a smaller hippocampus, the an area of the brain that is crucial for learning and memory. (Related: Elevated blood sugar levels have a DIRECT relationship with brain shrinkage.) Additionally, a follow-up study about diet soda and dementia revealed that individuals who consume diet soda daily were three times more likely to develop stroke and dementia when compared to those who did not. Dr. Matthew Pase, a neurologist at the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM), explained that the excess sugar from these beverages can result in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases such as heart disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes. Sudha Seshadri, a professor of neurology at BUSM and a faculty member at Boston University’s Alzheimer’s Disease Center, warned that consuming sugary beverages doesn’t have any health benefits. Seshadri added that replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners can also be bad for your mental health. In a separate study published in Alzheimer’s & Dementia, researchers analyzed data from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and cognitive test results conducted on individuals who drank more than two sugary beverages (like fruit juice, soda, and soft drinks) or three servings of soda per week. The findings showed signs of accelerated brain aging that were risk factors for early-stage Alzheimer’s disease. For another study, which was published in Stroke, researchers worked with participants who suffered a stroke or were diagnosed with dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease. The scientists monitored the volunteers based on their beverage intake. Based on the study findings, sugary beverages and stroke or dementia aren’t correlated. However, the researchers advised that individuals who consumed a diet soda per day were three times more likely to develop stroke and dementia. Aside from diet soda and other sugary beverages, the foods and drinks included in the list below may cause dementia or Alzheimer’s. Avoid the toxic foods listed above and make healthy food choices to lower your risk of developing dementia. Read more about ways to avoid toxic foods at StopEatingPoison.com."
https://food.news/2019-03-13-why-sprouts-are-the-ultimate-prepper-food.html,Why sprouts are the ultimate prepper food for cost-effective nutrition,0,"Advertisement Like fitness and survival skills, steady food supply is a crucial part of a prepper’s life. When setting up your stockpile, you can stockpile canned food and dry goods, but nothing beats fresh, nutrient-rich superfoods like sprouts. Sprouts are full of vitamins and minerals. Whether you live in a small apartment or you want to add more greens to your diet, this is a cheap and easy way to add nutrients to your diet throughout the year. (h/t to BeansBulletsBandagesAndYou.com) Sprouts refer to vegetable seeds that have germinated and turned into very young plants. You can grow different types of seeds, such as: Sprouts are often eaten raw, but they can also be lightly cooked before you consume them. Additionally, sprouts are low in calories but they are full of nutrients and beneficial plant compounds. The vitamin and mineral content of sprouts may vary based on the variety. In general, the sprouting process boosts nutrient levels. Sprouts contain more folate, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, protein, and vitamins C and K compared to un-sprouted plants. Once you select the seeds that you’re going to grow, soak them in water for the first half day or so. After that, keep the sprouts moist for a week, but don’t put them in standing water. Spread the seeds in a single layer, then keep them mostly in the dark until the last day. You can grow sprouts in jars, but the best option is to grow them in sprouting trays that you can buy online or in stores. Look for stackable trays so you can maximize your space. Sprouting trays have holes in the bottom that can drain water, but the holes are also small enough to stop the seeds from falling through. About one to three days after they’re soaked, you’ll see the first roots emerge from the seeds. The shoots will then grow quickly. The cotyledons, or the first two little leave that were pre-set in the seed, will come out. This is when you put the sprouts in some light, but not direct, strong sunshine, for one day so the leaves can start to turn green. You can eat sprouts once the first two leaves are out. Take note that sprouts have a short shelf life once they’re ready for consumption. Ideally, you should only keep sprouts in the fridge for a week, or less if it’s warmer. If you use sprouting trays, the roots will grow through the holes so you can rub them off after you water the sprouts. This makes it easier to harvest the sprouts as well. Different plants have different sprout flavors. Alfalfa produces very mild and fine sprouts, and it is “a quick, mild, high producer.” Both broccoli and radish make medium-thick, almost spicy sprouts. Bean sprouts, the largest and thickest, are the crunchiest. However, they’re not as flavorful as radish sprouts. (Related: Broccoli Sprouts: Nature’s Most Powerful Cancer-Fighting Food.) If you’re worried about the price of organic seeds used for sprouting, keep in mind that a bag of alfalfa sprouts is cheaper than buying sprouts from a health food store. Always buy organic seeds to ensure that the sprouts you grow are safe to eat and free from harmful chemicals and fungicide. To save your own seed for sprouting through the winter, let some plants go to seed then leave them until the pods are dry. Put a big bowl beneath your sprouting tray then gently mash the dried pods with your hands. This will make seeds and pod bits fall into the bowl. The seeds will settle in the bottom of the bowl while the chaff will remain on top. Pull off the chaff by hand or blow them away. This method is perfect for medium-sized seeds like broccoli and radish. Grow your own sprouts if you want to add nutritious greens to your diet without breaking the bank."
https://food.news/2019-03-12-nutritionists-break-down-what-should-be-in-your-eating-plan.html,Which diet is the best for heart health? Nutritionists review what should be in your eating plan,0,"Advertisement Fad diets aside, the ketogenic (keto), Mediterranean, and vegan diets are often considered the best ones for improving heart health. The vegan diet focuses primarily on vegetables and eliminates all meat and animal products. Dr. Kim Williams, a cardiologist at Rush University Medical Center, explained that substituting animal protein with plant protein can help reduce mortality and cardiovascular risk factors “over a period of time.” Earlier research has determined that the risk decreases the most when a person eliminates processed red meat from their diet. Unlike a diet high in meat, a vegan diet will also reduce high blood pressure. Data also suggest that a plant-based diet also helps reduce levels of C-reactive protein, one of the markers of inflammation in the body. Despite these benefits, the vegan diet isn’t perfect. Following this diet can result in a vitamin B12 deficiency because the vitamin is found in animal products. Vitamin B12 deficiency is also linked to anemia or reduced red blood cell counts. Anemia can also be caused by iron deficiency. The Mediterranean diet allows the consumption of animal protein, but fish is preferred over red meat. The diet also involves the heavy use of extra-virgin olive oil, one of the main components of this diet. A Mediterranean-based diet includes foods like: Data also suggest that this diet reduces levels of “bad” cholesterol and that it is connected to a lower risk of death due to heart disease. The keto diet is low in carbohydrates, high in fat, and allows a moderate amount of protein. Dr. Sarah Hallberg, the medical director at Virta Health, advised that the keto diet is a whole food diet and not a processed-food diet. When following this diet, you can consume some berries, dairy, non-starchy vegetables, nuts, and seeds that contain carbohydrates. However, you need to avoid foods such as grains and potatoes or anything that contains sugar. Dr. Hallberg added that the keto diet may help minimize risk factors for cardiovascular disease. (Related: The keto diet: Tips to make sure that the eating plan is working for you.) Researchers agree that regardless of which diet you choose to follow, whole foods are much better than processed foods. Dr. David Katz, a preventive medicine specialist at Yale University’s Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, warned that other diets are significantly better than the standard American diet, which is full of fried foods, red meat, and sugary foods. If you want to boost your heart health, reconsider your current diet and consume more whole foods."
https://food.news/2019-03-12-research-shows-that-berries-offer-the-best-ways-of-preventing-cancer.html,Research shows that berries are one of the best ways to prevent cancer,0,"Advertisement Berries are a delicious and nutritious addition to any meal or beverage. Several studies suggest that these antioxidant-rich fruits also possess potent cancer-fighting properties. According to scientific research, berries are rich in powerful antioxidants that protect cells from the damage that may cause cancer. Berries have positive effects on genes linked with inflammation in the body. In fact, berries can help reduce inflammation and prevent the growth and spread of cancer. For over two decades, Dr. Gary Stoner from the Medical College of Wisconsin studied the various ways that berries help prevent cancer. Over the course of his studies, Dr. Stoner found that a diet of freeze-dried strawberries or black raspberries helped inhibit esophageal cancer by at least 70 percent. Dr. Stoner also noted that berries inhibited colon cancer in the subjects by about 80 percent. Meanwhile, human patients diagnosed at higher risk for colon cancer experienced a 36 percent regression of rectal polyps after consuming black raspberry powder for nine months. (Related: Prevent cancer with proper diet: Compounds in turmeric, red grapes, berries, and apple peels found to shrink prostate tumors.) The study findings also showed that black raspberries and blueberries helped reduce breast tumor volume in rats by at least 70 percent after being consumed for six months. In a separate study, which was published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, researchers verified that the following berries had anti-cancer benefits: The researchers noted that these berries helped inhibit cancer growth and stimulate cancer cell apoptosis in vitro. Apoptosis is defined as a form of cell death where a programmed sequence of events results in the elimination of cells without releasing harmful substances into the surrounding area. Apoptosis has an important role in developing and maintaining the health of the body because it helps eliminate old cells, unnecessary cells, and unhealthy cells. The researchers added that “the stronger the berry extract, the more potent it seemed to be in preventing cancer.” Experts believe that berries help prevent cancer because they contain potent phytochemicals called polyphenols. The two most active types of polyphenols are ellagitannins, a source of ellagic acid, and anthocyanins, the flavonoids that give berries their bright color. Experts believe that the ellagic acid in berries such as blackberries, cranberries, and strawberries can inhibit estrogen production, and cut off the “fuel supply” of the tumor. Additionally, ellagic acid can help prevent bladder, breast, esophagus, lung, and skin cancer. Berries are also rich in fiber, manganese, and vitamin C. Various berries are also full of beneficial phenols like ferulic acid and quercetin. When buying berries, select organic fruits to ensure that they are free from pesticides and toxins. Organic fresh or frozen unsweetened berries also have more potent cancer-fighting abilities because they possess a higher concentration of key nutrients. Berries are a healthier alternative to a sugary dessert that has many artificial ingredients and preservatives. You can eat one or several types of berries as a simple snack or dessert, especially if you’re craving something sweet. Make a nutritious breakfast by adding berries and chopped nuts to a serving of cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, or ricotta cheese. Another option is to add berries to salads and other sweet or savory dishes. Researchers suggest consuming at least four to five servings of different types of berries every week to lower your risk of developing cancer. Studies have determined that consuming only two ounces of berries every day can naturally expel toxins and slow cancer cell growth."
https://food.news/2019-03-11-a-basic-guide-to-fermenting-vegetables.html,A basic guide to fermenting vegetables,0,"Advertisement Nutritious cultured or fermented vegetables are good for your gut health. But did you know that instead of buying expensive fermented foods from health stores, you can make them at home? One jar of fermented vegetables at a local urban provisions shop usually costs at least $10 to $15. But instead of shelling out this much money, which you can use to buy other items, you only need about five minutes of prep time and at least $2 worth of ingredients to make your own fermented vegetables. The simple three-step process detailed below can be applied to almost any kind of vegetable. First, decide on the vegetable that you want to ferment. Your options include: Take note that the finer you chop or shred the vegetables, the faster they will ferment. Finely chopping or shredding the vegetables also ensures that you can pack more of them in one jar. You can use almost any kind of vegetable when fermenting. Alternatively, you can combine different vegetables to make a healthy fermented side dish. Depending on the vegetable you want to ferment, wash and peel it the same way you would if you were going to eat it raw. (Related: 4 Good reasons why you should give fermented foods a try.) The salt in fermented foods prevents mold from forming in the final product. Salt also allows beneficial bacteria to grow in the fermented vegetables. Adding salt also helps produce crispy fermented vegetables. Store the vegetables in a Mason jar or fermentation crock, then cover them with a brine solution made from one tablespoon of salt per cup of water (use natural, non-iodized salt). Add herbs and other seasonings as desired. For this step, you need to keep the vegetables submerged in the brine. Otherwise, anything exposed to air will rot. When using vegetables that float, use something heavy to weigh them down. You can also use fermentation weights to keep them submerged. If you’re using a Mason jar, tighten the lid until it is barely snug. Doing this helps prevent oxygen from entering, but lets carbon dioxide escape from the jar. Otherwise, pressure can build up in the jar until it explodes. To avoid this, use a fermentation crock if you have one. Store the Mason jar or fermentation crock in a cool, dark place with a temperature that stays around 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Fermentation times may vary from three days to three months or more, depending on the vegetable you use, temperature, and other factors. Taste the fermented vegetables to determine if it’s ready for consumption. Once you achieve the desired taste, refrigerate the vegetables to prevent further fermentation. Experiment with other vegetables to make your own delicious fermented foods and save on grocery money. If you want to introduce healthy fermented foods to your kids, try this recipe for fermented carrot sticks. This crunchy and nutritious carrot snack has a fairly mild flavor. You can also add some garlic cloves and peppercorns for an extra kick. Ingredients: Instructions:"

The practice prioritizes the cultivation of food-producing plants and native perennials, and it helps home gardeners create green space and provide healthy, fresh food to their family. Replacing even just a fraction of traditional lawns with edible landscapes designed around locally appropriate plants offers various benefits. These benefits require little to no irrigation or fertilizer and can increase food production potential in cities, as well as attract pollinators and improve ecological diversity. Edible flowers are a common feature of edible landscapes. But flowering plants aren’t just pretty, they also attract pollinators that can help your fruit-bearing plants thrive. (Related: Edible Landscaping Ideas For Small Spaces.) Popular options include daisies, lilacs, pansies, and sunflowers. Edible flowers can also be used for food decorating and subtle flavoring. Herbs are another staple in edible landscapes. You can plant the following herbs in your yard: Another option is to grow herbal tea plants so you have access to ingredients for herbal teas all year long. Shrubs are a nice addition to your edible landscape because they’re often of medium height. Shrubs can be used to bridge the gap between trees and shorter plants, like edible flowers. Additionally, shrubs can function as wildlife deterrents and windbreaks. Plan ahead when selecting a shrub, and use a plant that produces something your family likes to eat. You also need to choose the right shrub for a site. Plant something that can thrive in your location so you don’t waste any of your resources. You can plant the following shrubs in your landscape based on your needs and preferences: If your yard is spacious enough, you can include fruit or medicinal trees in your edible landscape. Check which fruit tree varieties suit your geographic area. Your options include: If you already have a traditional vegetable garden plot but you still want to boost your crop yield, you can grow annual edibles in your regular landscape. Listed below are vegetables that you can incorporate into your edible landscape: You can also intermix these edible plants to make your landscape stand out. Like with other aspects of home gardening, the only thing that limits your edible landscaping ideas is your imagination."
https://food.news/2019-03-08-what-are-the-benefits-of-drinking-apple-cider-vinegar-before-bedtime.html,What are the benefits of drinking apple cider vinegar before bedtime?,0,"Advertisement Despite its pungent smell and intense taste, apple cider vinegar (ACV) is popular among health food enthusiasts because it’s a superfood that offers many health benefits. In fact, drinking ACV before you go to bed at night can help promote weight loss and prevent indigestion. Listed below are some of the amazing health benefits of apple cider vinegar, especially when taken before bedtime. Acid reflux is sometimes caused by hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid). If you have hypochlorhydria, you may have trouble fully digesting foods. Low stomach acid may also affect your body’s ability to eliminate harmful bacteria in your gut, which can lead to an unhealthy overgrowth of bacteria. Some of the acid could also end up in your esophagus. If you have acid reflux, add one tablespoon of ACV to a large glass of water. Mix well, then drink the ACV water about an hour before you go to bed. The ACV can help restore your stomach’s acidity, eliminate gut bacteria, and strengthen your lower esophageal sphincter. (Related: Apple Cider Vinegar Dosage for Optimum Health Benefits.) Some experts suggest that the bacteria that causes a sore throat can’t multiply in the acidic environment that ACV creates. ACV also has natural anti-microbial properties. If you have a sore throat, dilute one teaspoon of ACV in a glass with warm water one hour before you go to bed. After 30 minutes, take another teaspoon. Dilute the vinegar so you don’t damage your tooth enamel and burn your esophagus. You should start to feel a bit better when you wake up the next morning. If you constantly suffer from abdominal pain, you may have digestive issues. But instead of taking an over-the-counter (OTC) prescription that could be linked to negative side effects, try a natural ACV remedy. Health professionals suggest taking some ACV to ease digestive ailments like bloating and nausea. Add a teaspoon of ACV to a glass with water before going to sleep to relieve ingestion. Studies have determined that there is a link between sleep deprivation and obesity, and the higher your body mass index (BMI), the more likely you are to have trouble falling asleep. Consuming ACV before bed can help prevent the accumulation of fat by limiting your body’s ability to break down starchy foods (e.g., pasta and rice) into calories. ACV can help you lose weight by “promoting satiety and lowering blood sugar and insulin levels.” ACV lowers blood sugar levels by boosting insulin sensitivity. In a separate placebo-controlled study, researchers examined three groups of adults: those with pre-diabetes, those with Type 2 diabetes, or those with no health issues. The findings revealed that all of the participants had lower blood glucose levels after they consumed a high-carb meal (a white bagel with butter and a glass of orange juice), after taking an ounce of ACV. The researchers noted that the Type 2 diabetes group improved their blood glucose levels by 25 percent. Meanwhile, the participants with pre-diabetes reduced their blood glucose levels by almost 50 percent. If you’re not already on medication to manage your blood sugar levels, consider taking two teaspoons of ACV every night, just before you go to sleep. Always consult a healthcare professional before taking ACV, especially if you’re taking prescription drugs for diabetes. Follow the steps below to make your own ACV remedy. Ingredients: Directions: Consult a healthcare professional before you take any of these remedies and always use organic, unfiltered ACV (which has the most vitamins and acetic acid) if you wish to try these natural cures."
https://food.news/2019-03-07-can-the-mediterranean-diet-help-prevent-colorectal-cancer.html,Can the Mediterranean diet help prevent colorectal cancer?,0,"Advertisement Unlike other fad diets, the Mediterranean diet is popular because it promotes the consumption of more plant-based foods and whole grains. Aside from being good for your overall well-being, the diet is even linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. According to a study, following this particular diet can also help lower colorectal cancer risk. The study was presented at the 2017 ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology) 19th World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer. Following the Mediterranean diet means an above-average consumption of foods like: The Mediterranean diet also includes a high ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids. The diet also suggests a low intake of alcohol and red meat. For the study, the researchers completely eliminated soft drinks from diet of the participants since these beverages are associated with a higher risk of developing cancer. In the study, researchers worked with 808 volunteers undergoing screening or diagnostic colonoscopies. The participants were also instructed to complete a dietary questionnaire to help the researchers determine the details of their daily meals. The volunteers, who were between 40 to 70 years old, joined a medical and lifestyle interview. None of the volunteers had a high risk of colorectal cancer. The researchers set out to determine the link between the components of the Mediterranean diet taken separately or in combination, along with the risk of developing advanced colorectal polyps. The study findings showed that the volunteers who had advanced polyps consumed fewer components of the Mediterranean diet, unlike those who had clear colonoscopies. The researchers explained that eating at least two to three components of the diet also lowered the risk of advanced polyps by 50 percent. The results also suggest that people should include fruits and fish in their diet and avoid soft drinks to prevent CRC. The researchers noted that consuming more fish and fruits and avoiding soft drinks helped reduce the study participants’ risk of pre-cancerous colorectal lesions by 30 percent, unlike those who didn’t follow the Mediterranean diet. (Related: Mediterranean diet helps prevent cancer, nutrition science study finds.) The results also revealed that the risk of advanced polyps was reduced when the participants consumed more components of the Mediterranean diet. The researchers said that out of all the participants, those who had all the three healthy choices reduced their cancer risk by at least 86 percent. The researchers warned that a low-fiber diet full of alcohol, high-calorie foods, and red meat promotes the formation of intestinal polyps that could eventually result in colorectal cancer. These polyps may become malignant based on several factors, like their structure, size, and location. The Mediterranean diet is considered a “healthful, wholesome, and nutritious” diet for a reason. It can also help you stay fit and lean. This beneficial diet also helps prevent deficiencies since it includes whole foods that contain many essential nutrients. Additionally, the Mediterranean diet completely eliminates unhealthy foods and beverages from your diet, like processed meats, refined grains, salted and preserved foods, and soft drinks. This diet won’t just help you maintain your weight, it can also lower your risk of heart disease, obesity, stroke, and other lifestyle-related conditions. To maintain your overall health and lower your risk of developing colorectal cancer, make positive lifestyle changes and follow the Mediterranean diet."
https://food.news/2019-03-07-4-in-10-cancer-cases-can-be-prevented-with-these-lifestyle-changes.html,4 in 10 cancer cases can be prevented with these lifestyle changes,0,"Advertisement A study conducted by scientists from Cancer Research U.K. (CRUK) showed that positive lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking or maintaining a healthy weight, can significantly lower your cancer risk. The study findings were published in the British Journal of Cancer. In the landmark study by CRUK, researchers analyzed factors in peoples’ lives that cause cancer. They then calculated how many cases in the U.K. were associated with each of these risk factors. For this study, researchers used all the latest available data and evidence to provide more accurate estimates and update current data. The results of the study showed that over 135,000 cases of cancer (or four in 10 cases) could be prevented in the U.K. annually by making lifestyle changes. These cancer risk factors have already been confirmed, but the study results highlight the importance of how your daily habits can add up and affect your well-being. Dr. Katrina Brown, who led the analysis at CRUK, explained that the research team collated data from national surveys that showed how common each risk factor is in the population. The researchers also used data from the U.K. cancer registries showing how many cases of each cancer type there are. They then searched published research for data on how much each risk factor increases cancer risk using only “gold standard epidemiology research.” To illustrate, these studies compared the number of cancers in individuals who smoke to the number of cancers in non-smokers to get a relative risk of cancer in smokers. Using this information, together with data on how common smoking is in the U.K. and how many cases of smoking-related cancer types exist, the CRUK researchers estimated how many of those cancer cases were due to smoking. The researchers did this for all the modifiable risk factors. The results showed that in total, over 135,000 cases of cancer could be prevented through lifestyle changes like: The study findings confirmed that smoking is the biggest cause of cancer. Based on the new calculations, it’s responsible for a whopping 54,300 cases of cancer every year in the U.K. The new data likewise revealed that being overweight or obese increases the risk of about 13 different types of cancer. The findings suggest that obesity causes at least 22,800 cases of cancer in the U.K. annually, making it the second biggest cause of cancer in the U.K. after smoking. Unfortunately, only 15 percent of individuals are aware of the link between obesity and cancer. National campaigns can help educate the public about this dangerous link. What can American readers learn from this U.K.-based study? Your main takeaways should be: While prevention doesn’t guarantee that you will never develop cancer, making positive lifestyle changes can still significantly lower cancer risk."
https://food.news/2019-03-06-fructose-in-sports-drinks-raises-your-risk-of-type-2-diabetes.html,Fructose found in sports drinks raises your risk of Type 2 diabetes,0,"Advertisement Both fruits and sweetened beverages — which include soda and sports drinks — have fructose, also known as fruit sugar. However, fruits also contain dietary fiber which helps counterbalance the effects of fructose, something that the latter does not have. In a review published in the journal The BMJ, scientists found that consuming these sugary drinks can increase your risk for Type 2 diabetes. For the review, Dr. John Sievenpiper and his fellow researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada analyzed data from 155 nutritional studies on 5,086 individuals. The study included people with and without diabetes, measuring how blood glucose levels responded from various food sources of fructose, with the average follow-up ranging from one to 76 weeks. The findings suggest that fructose from fruit, fruit juices, and other natural sources are less likely to increase risk factors related to Type 2 diabetes, unlike fructose found in sugary beverages. The simple sugar fructose is naturally found in fruits and vegetables. However, it’s also used in high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is used to sweeten beverages like sodas. Sievenpiper, the study’s lead author and an endocrinologist at St. Michael’s Hospital, explained that when sugars provide excess calories, they may have negative metabolic effects that can increase your risk for diabetes. He also added that the effect was mostly observed in sugar-sweetened beverages which don’t have any nutritional value. These sweetened drinks increased both glucose and insulin while also providing excess calories. Since none of the studies included in the review measured Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C, a two- to three-month average of an individual’s blood sugar level), the researchers are unable to determine the effect of excess calories on HbA1C. But the research team warns that the negative side effect calories on glucose and insulin would also have an adverse effect on HbA1C. Sievenpiper said that even though fruits contained excess calories, they don’t negatively affect glucose or insulin. People with diabetes can consume fruit in moderation, especially if they want to control their blood sugar. Dr. Osama Hamdy, medical director of the obesity clinical program and director of the inpatient diabetes program at the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said that fruit can also help boost the intestine’s microbiota or the microorganisms that live in the gut. Fructose from natural sources like fruit also functions as a soluble fiber, which can help slow the absorption of fructose and reduce “bad”/low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. According to the American Diabetes Association, people should refrain from drinking sugar-sweetened beverages like energy drinks, fruit punch, soda, and sweet tea. Aside from raising blood sugar, sugary drinks can also add hundreds of empty calories to your diet. (Related: Sports and energy drinks are ‘essentially sodas without carbonation,’ state researchers exploring health risks of sugary beverages.) Empty calories are linked to weight gain, and being overweight is a risk factor for developing diabetes. If you need an energy boost, switch to natural energy-boosting options like: Sievenpiper warned that even though fruit is beneficial, fruit juice contains excess calories. He noted that you can consume at least half a cup of natural fruit daily if you use to complement a diet full of whole fruits and vegetables. Dr. Jan Rystrom, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator at the Swedish Medical Center who was not involved in the study, added that fructose’s effect on overall health deserves further analysis. She added that as a food additive, “fructose has a cumulative effect in tissue, particularly in the lens of the eye.” Several studies suggest this accumulation of fructose in lens tissue is linked to the development of cataracts, a common health complication of diabetes. If you wish to lower your diabetes risk, Dr. Hamdy suggested that you consume more whole fruit instead of drinking fruit juices. Limit your intake of foods that contain refined sugar, like cake, cookies, and candy. Always choose natural sources over sweetened beverages, and don’t overconsume whole fruit to stay healthy."
https://food.news/2019-03-05-green-tea-vs-white-tea-both-come-from-the-same-tree-but-each-offers-different-health-benefits.html,"Green tea vs. white tea: Both come from the same tree, but each offers different health benefits",0,"Advertisement If you’re new to tea culture, the many different varieties, from black to green to white teas, can be overwhelming. But while there is more scientific data on the health benefits of green tea, it shares similar pros and cons with white tea, another beverage that comes from the same tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Green tea is wilted in shade, then is either steamed or fried in a pan. The taste of green tea will vary depending on several factors, like where the tea leaves were grown, harvested, and processed. Green teas that have been steamed have a bittersweet aftertaste, while other teas are usually sweet. Most green teas can be divided into two types: Chinese tea (e.g., gunpowder green tea, Long Jing/Dragonwell) or Japanese tea (e.g., matcha green tea, Gyokuro green tea). They may come from the same plant, but the colors and differences between green and white tea are determined by the degree of withering and oxidation that the teas have withstood. Both tea varieties are full of polyphenols, which are antioxidant plant compounds that offer various health benefits. White tea, which originated from China, is a very lightly oxidized tea derived from the leaves and buds of the tea plant. It is named after the wispy, white-silver hairs on the unopened buds of the tea plant. White tea is neither white nor silver. Instead, it is faint yellow in color with a mild and smooth flavor. White tea is first dried directly under the sun, then it is dried indoors. The lack of processing allows the tea to retain its whitish color, especially when it is made from tea buds. White tea is lighter or paler in color compared to green tea. Some types of white tea include Eyebrow White Tea (“Shou Mein”), Silver Needle White Tea (“Bai Hao Yin Zhen”), and White Peony (“Bai Mudan”). White tea has a lower caffeine content compared to green tea. White teas from Fujian, China, often contain around 15 milligrams (mg) of caffeine in every cup. Meanwhile, green teas have about 20 mg per cup. Research findings suggest that white teas may be better at cancer prevention compared to green tea. In a 2000 study conducted by the Linus Pauling Institute, researchers tested four different kinds of white tea on rats to determine if it could prevent colon cancer. The study results revealed that white tea has more polyphenols and that it can minimize damage to DNA. This is crucial because this type of cell damage usually causes cancer. The scientists advised that further study is required to confirm if white tea offers the same benefit in humans. Additionally, polyphenols in white tea can boost immunity, prevent bad cholesterol from becoming oxidized, and relax blood vessels. These factors can help minimize your risk of heart disease. Experts suggest that green tea can help prevent the growth of cancer cells in breast, esophageal, prostate, and stomach cancers. Green tea can also help prevent atherosclerosis and the incidence of high cholesterol, which may also reduce your risk of developing heart disease. Green tea also has fat-burning abilities. In a 2012 report, which was published in the Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology, researchers said that green tea can help minimize the inflammation and bacteria associated with gum disease. (Related: Catechins in green tea found to improve symptoms of metabolic syndrome in obese people.) Both green and white teas are low in calories, as long as you consume them without added sweeteners or milk. Drink either tea if you want to lose weight naturally. Since both teas are lightly processed, they are considered “raw” teas. Lightly processed teas may upset your stomach, especially if you drink these beverages when your stomach is empty. To avoid this, drink tea at least 30 minutes after you eat a full meal. Consider these factors before you decide on what kind of tea you wish to consume. Whether you choose green or white tea, you can rest assured that you will reap health benefits such as cancer prevention and better heart health."

After all, you wouldn’t want to run out of resources just when the weather starts getting frosty again, would you? (h/t to MDCreekmore.com). While it’s better to grow your own vegetables, you need to consider some factors, such as space (or a lack of it), to devise a gardening system that works for you. If you don’t have a yard or a home garden, you can still grow herbs or sprouts indoors. Every step counts if you want to minimize your exposure to chemically-treated foods and other products. Below are some things that you need to consider, along with your own needs and growing zone, before you start growing crops that will survive during winter. (Related: How to prepare your survival garden for winter.) Will these crops thrive in your growing zone? Ask fellow home gardeners to learn what kinds of crops can grow in your zone. Make use of the space you have, and only grow what you can consume so you don’t waste time and effort. What kinds of dried, frozen, or tinned foods are cheaper to buy than cultivate? If dried beans, grains, and legumes are cheaper to buy, plant something else that can thrive in your zone. Can you eat or use the whole plant? You can compost any spent vegetables, but you must prioritize crops that have the most edible parts, even those that take up space for a long time, like: Before you switch to a diet of fruits, vegetables, and foraged foods, double-check the nutrient profiles of the foods you plan to eat to ensure that they provide you with enough nutrients. Consult a healthcare professional to determine if any of the crops that you grow will interfere with the medications that you take. Always plan ahead so when winter comes, you can still harvest crops in your home garden."
https://food.news/2019-03-01-dried-plums-show-promise-in-effectively-preventing-colon-cancer.html,Dried plums show promise in effectively preventing colon cancer,0,"Advertisement Dried plums, or prunes, are nutritious healing foods that offer many health benefits. According to a study, adults of any age can benefit from prunes since they can improve gut health and lower the risk of colon cancer in adults. The study, which was published in the journal Nutrition and Cancer, was a collaborative effort between researchers from Texas A&M University and the University of North Carolina. Earlier studies have determined that a healthy diet is crucial to improving metabolism and colon microbiota composition. This discovery can help researchers develop natural ways of preventing and treating different diseases. When gut microbiota is disrupted, you can suffer from intestinal inflammation, which may eventually result in colon cancer. Understanding the nature of the digestive system is key to preventing colon cancer, especially since trillions of species of bacteria live within your intestinal tract. To date, experts have only identified over 400 species in the gut. In 2015, colon cancer caused at least 49,700 deaths in the U.S. According to the American Cancer Society, colon cancer is the third leading cause of death from cancer-related complications in the country. The study findings can help address this concern, especially since the researchers confirmed that adding dried plums to your regular diet can help improve gut bacteria in your colon. This, in turn, may lower your risk of developing colon cancer. (Related: Here are the healthiest fruits you can eat.) In the study, the researchers tested the cancer-protective effects of prunes in rat models that had a strain of colon cancer similar to the human variety. While some of the test rats were fed a diet that included dried plums, the other subjects were given a control diet with no plums. The test results showed that the diet which included dried prunes reduced two primary kinds of bacteria in the colon: Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The rats that followed the control diet had less optimal levels of gut bacteria. However, the rats that consumed dried plums had lower numbers of aberrant crypts and aberrant crypt foci than the control rats. Experts usually consider aberrant crypt foci, or precancerous lesions, as an indicator of colon cancer. Prunes have phenolic compounds with various health benefits. These compounds are believed to be responsible for the anti-cancer properties of prunes. Phenolic compounds act as antioxidants that can neutralize free radicals which cause cancer and damage DNA. Consuming dried plums helps promote the retention of good bacteria and their positive metabolism in the colon, which can significantly help lower cancer risk. Continued research with human subjects will help verify the findings from this study, but the results highlight the fact that adding dried plums to your diet can help boost your colon health. Prunes contain vitamins A, B2, B3, B6, and K. They also have copper, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and potassium. Surprisingly enough, prunes contain more vitamin K than plums. The former also contains more B-vitamins and minerals. Additionally, prunes are higher in carbs, calories, and fiber than fresh plums. Aside from lowering your risk of developing colon cancer, dried plums also offer other benefits. Eat dried plums (prunes) regularly to prevent colon cancer, lower your blood sugar, and boost bone and heart health."
https://food.news/2019-02-28-you-know-about-the-health-benefits-of-olive-oil-but-how-about-avocado-oil.html,"You know about the health benefits of olive oil, but how about avocado oil?",0,"Advertisement Avocados are a popular superfood because they’re full of “good” dietary fats. But did you know that this nutritious fruit is also used to make avocado oil? The avocado (Persea americana) is rich in essential minerals and vitamins. The fruit, also called the “alligator pear,” offers various health benefits, and the same goes for avocado oil. This cooking oil is unique because while other plant oils are derived from the seed of the plant, avocado oil is extracted from the flesh of the fruit itself. Since avocado oil has an unusually high smoke point of 500 degrees Fahrenheit, the oil won’t break down and produce harmful free radicals, even at a high temperature. Take note that refined avocado oil has a high smoke point of 500 degrees Fahrenheit, but virgin avocado oil’s smoke point is only 350 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. This means only the former can be used to bake, barbecue, sear, or saute at high temperatures. Some people say that avocado oil has a slightly buttery or nutty taste, but in general, it is considered to have a neutral taste. Avocado oil is usually compared to olive oil because both are rich in healthy fats. However, the former scores higher when cooking over high heat due to its smoke point. Avocado oil has three different kinds of fat: Here’s why you should replace unhealthy cooking oils with beneficial avocado oil. It can enhance the absorption of essential nutrients. Certain nutrients need fat in order to be absorbed by the body. These nutrients include the carotenoid antioxidants or pigments found in various plant foods. However, fruits and vegetables that are rich in carotenoids are often low in fat. According to a small study, adding avocado oil to a salad with carrots, romaine lettuce, and spinach helped increase the absorption of carotenoids. It can improve eye health. Avocado oil has a carotenoid called lutein that is naturally present in the eyes. Lutein functions as an antioxidant that can help boost eye health. Increasing your lutein intake can help lower your risk of developing cataracts and macular degeneration. It can help relieve arthritis symptoms. Arthritis is a painful disease characterized by inflammation of the joints. Osteoarthritis, which involves the breakdown of cartilage in joints, is the most common form of this condition. The results of a 2015 study, published in the journal Cartilage, revealed that extracts from avocado and soybean oil called avocado/soybean unsaponifiables can help alleviate the pain and stiffness found in patients with osteoarthritis. The oil is extra beneficial for individuals with hip and knee osteoarthritis. It can prevent gum disease. Studies suggest that a combination of avocado oil and soybean oil extracts can help prevent gum disease. Gum (periodontal) disease is an inflammatory disease that may cause symptoms like swollen, red, and bleeding gums; the deterioration of bone and tissue near teeth; and bad breath (halitosis). It can even cause tooth loss. (Related: 5 Ways Avocado Oil Will Make You Healthier.) It can prevent inflammation. The antioxidants in avocado oil can help heal dry, flaky, and inflamed skin due to eczema and psoriasis. If you have a skin condition, perform a skin patch test first to determine if avocado oil can worsen or trigger your symptoms. Avocado oil is a versatile ingredient, and it can be used when making different savory dishes such as salads, soups, or roasted vegetables. The oil is also suitable for people following the Keto, Paleo, and vegan diets. Even though avocado oil is a little expensive compared to other cooking oils, it offers many health benefits when used in moderation."
https://food.news/2019-02-28-cayenne-pepper-improves-blood-circulation-in-your-feet.html,Prepper secret: Cayenne pepper offers a natural way to improve blood circulation in your feet,0,"Advertisement Cayenne peppers (Capsicum annuum) have an impressive nutrient profile and they are often used to flavor various dishes. But did you know that preppers also use cayenne peppers to make an herbal salve that can help keep their feet warm? (h/t to AskAPrepper.com) Keeping your feet warm is crucial to long-term foot health. But as you get older, the circulation in your feet can decline. To remedy this, preppers use cayenne salve keep their feet warm during cold days. Instead of buying cayenne salve at your local pharmacy or supermarket, it’s cheaper to make your own. A DIY cayenne salve can be also used to ease back and neck pain. This remedy works by warming the muscles and loosening them up. Cayenne salve works the same way on your feet. If you don’t have cayenne peppers on hand, you can use other kinds of chili peppers that contain capsaicin. Do take note that you need to be careful about using peppers that are too high on the Scoville scale because they might burn your skin. Meanwhile, peppers on the low end of the scale might not be hot enough to produce an effective salve. Alternatively, you can use homemade peppers to make the cayenne salve. Just dry the peppers first on a dehydrator or in the oven to remove all water, then use a grinder to turn them to cayenne powder. If you don’t want to apply cayenne powder to your feet, you can eat hot peppers to stay warm. Consuming hot peppers helps warm up your whole body because they contain the active ingredient capsaicin. Capsaicin gives hot peppers their medicinal properties. This active ingredient also gives peppers their hot taste. How hot a cayenne pepper tastes depends on its capsaicin content. The more capsaicin a cayenne pepper contains, the hotter it is. Additionally, capsaicin makes your blood vessels to dilate, which results in extra blood flow that provides warmth to your hands and feet. While some people feel the effect immediately, others can feel the heat increase over time. Hot peppers are also nutritious. They contain many anti-inflammatories, antioxidants, and vitamins. The quickest way to use hot pepper to warm up is to sprinkle a bit of cayenne pepper powder directly on your feet. Alternatively, you can also add some powder into your socks. You can control the amount of cayenne powder that you spread on your feet by combining the powder with a small amount of cornstarch. Start with 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and 1/4 cup of cornstarch or foot powder. Mix it well and add a teaspoon of the mixture into each sock. Gently move the sock around to evenly distribute the powder. Alternatively, you could also shake the powder evenly onto your feet from a sifter or a shaker jar. Applying powder directly to your feet will help keep your feet warm and dry. Use this method on a cold, wet day, or if you’re working outdoors on a snowy day. (Related: Foot care: An often forgotten practice when SHTF.) To make your own cayenne pepper salve, you’ll need a crockpot, an eight-ounce Mason jar, and a small heatproof jar. You’ll use these tools to infuse the oil and melt the beeswax.

https://food.news/2019-02-25-naturalness-impacts-the-success-of-new-products-food-market.html,Sign of the times: Consumer behaviorists find that “naturalness” impacts the success of new products to the food market,0,"Advertisement According to a study from the ETH (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule) Consumer Behavior group, a product’s success on the food market is primarily defined by whether or not consumers perceive it as natural. The authenticity of the food we consume significantly affects consumer acceptance and perceptions of quality, and a broad-based review study by ETH Professor for Consumer Behavior Michael Siegrist and his Spanish colleagues arrived at the same conclusion. (Related: All-natural: Does it mean anything?) Siegrist said, “The importance of naturalness for foodstuffs is of great practical relevance, yet it has never been the subject of in-depth research.” Out of the initial 1,000 scientific articles, the researchers handpicked 72 that were relevant to the research questions and could be correlated with one another. The definition of naturalness was measured using three main categories: how was the product grown? (e.g. organically or in the local region); how was it processed? (e.g. presence or absence of additives, colorings, flavorings, and hormones. How much processing did a product go through? – according to consumers, “the lower the better”); and lastly: how natural does the final product appear to end consumers? Important things to consider are health and taste, freshness, and ecological focus. “Naturalness” may seem like a cohesive term, but the study reveals that it is in fact highly abstract and evokes extremely varied associations. Siegrist shared, “It’s notable that all the studies conclude that popularity among a majority of consumers is closely linked to how natural a product is perceived as being. This was true for 85,000 participants from 32 different countries across a period of around 20 years.” But all of the studies were carried out in relatively wealthy industrialized countries in Europe, Asia, America, and Oceania. In developing and emerging market countries, heavily processed products can be received more positively because they are expensive, which can be associated with social prestige. The same inquiry might well produce the opposite result there: a lower status given to “natural” foodstuffs and a higher one to industrially produced products, suggests Siegrist. The comparison revealed that older people and women are more concerned with naturalness, unlike younger people and men. Consumers who buy organic products prioritize the naturalness of foodstuffs, which is the same case for people who support “traditional, sustainable, healthy, and organic products when shopping.” This implies that the study links an inclination toward naturalness with negative attitudes toward technological innovations in the food industry. This point led the researchers to this key conclusion: “companies working with innovative food technologies – keywords: in vitro meat and 3D-printed foodstuffs – need to keep the naturalness factor in mind.” Siegrist explained, “Even though human perception is clearly subject to certain distortions, the key role that authenticity plays in the acceptance of foodstuffs is a fact. This means that products which are perceived as artificial will not be accepted by consumers in [the] future, either.” To be successful, food producers must try to meet the “sometimes contradictory” demands of consumers.

https://food.news/2019-02-23-color-changes-our-perception-and-taste-of-food.html,Color changes our perception and taste of food,0,"Advertisement Certain colors can affect your mood while some kinds of food may evoke your most cherished memories. According to a study, color can also influence the taste of food while personal experiences and expectations can change how you taste food. The study, which was published in the journal Food Quality and Preference, was conducted by researchers from Penn State University (PSU). John E. Hayes, associate professor of food science and director of the Sensory Evaluation Center at PSU, explained that the color of a beverage can influence how a person thinks it should taste. To illustrate, yellow is often associated with drinks that are sour like lemonade. Meanwhile, red is associated with drinks that are usually sweet, like sports drinks. In the study, researchers wanted to find out if people could learn color-taste associations and if they can learn new color-taste associations. The PSU research team also wanted to determine why certain individuals “enjoy the bitter taste in some foods but not others.” Molly J. Higgins, a doctoral candidate in food sciences, said that even though bitterness may indicate toxicity, there are people who enjoy chocolate, coffee, and IPA-style beers. IPA stands for India Pale Ale, and it is considered one of “the most aggressively hopped beer style.” IPA-style beers have bitter, citrusy, earthy, floral, fruity, and piney flavor notes. For the study, Hayes and Higgins wanted to determine if there were differences between various bitter compounds. The researchers were also curious if people could taste those nuances. Finding out if there are different types of bitter tastes could explain why some individuals like the bitterness of coffee but not the bitterness of chocolate. Hayes posited that there may be different kinds of bitterness, even if experts don’t have the language to describe it yet. In the study, Hayes and Higgins tested if the participants could learn how to associate specific tastes with certain colors. They did this by creating solutions that tasted bitter, savory, sour, or sweet. Each solution was then paired with a unique color, like green for sweet or red for bitter. The researchers didn’t want to bias their sample so they refrained from using preconceived color-taste pairings, like red for sweet. In the first experiment, the volunteers were instructed to taste the colored liquids over four different sessions. After the first experiment, the participants were given uncolored solutions that they had to taste. The volunteers were also instructed to choose a color for each solution. (Related: Food scientists use VR to show how our perception of real food is altered by our surroundings.) The researchers found that the participants matched the correct color and taste 59 percent of the time in the first experiment. The results were noticeably higher than the researchers’ estimate from random chance, which would have been 25 percent. The scientists were surprised to discover that some volunteers learned how to associate new colors with different tastes after only four exposures. Inspired by the positive results, the researchers ran a second experiment to see if the participants could distinguish between three different bitter tastes: caffeine, quinine, and Tetralone, a hop extract found in beers. The researchers repeated the experiment with a new group of study subjects and they also assigned unique colors to each bitter chemical, like green for quinine and yellow for caffeine. But after four lab visits, the volunteers were unable to match the colors to the corresponding bitter compounds better than the researchers’ estimate from random chance. While the researchers didn’t get the results that they expected, they were fascinated by how quickly some of the volunteers learned new color-taste associations in the first experiment. Higgins concluded that certain individuals could “learn color-taste associations well, while others may be more resistant to changes or new color-taste associations.” Visit Food.news to read more articles about research findings on how perception affects the taste of food and beverages."
https://food.news/2019-02-22-eating-a-handful-of-nuts-every-day-may-be-the-best-way-to-keep-the-weight-off.html,Eating a handful of nuts every day may be the best way to keep the weight off,0,"Advertisement Nuts may be calorie-dense, but they’re a healthy snack that contain fiber and nutrients. According to a study, eating a serving of nuts daily can help with weight loss. The preliminary study, which was presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2018, was conducted by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). The California Walnut Commission partially funded the study. In the study, the researchers set out to determine whether consuming nuts can affect long-term weight change. Dr. Xiaoran Liu, a research associate in the nutrition department of HSPH and the study’s first author, noted that most people who are trying to manage their weight often avoid calorie-dense foods like nuts. During the course of the study, the researchers observed the effect of adding nuts to participants’ diets or trading nuts for other snacks, such as chips, desserts, fries, processed meat, and red meat. The results showed that both adding and swapping nuts for other kinds of foods offered benefits. Adding a daily serving (around 28 g, or a small handful) was associated with reduced risk of weight gain or becoming obese. Meanwhile, substituting one type of food with a daily serving of nuts was linked to reduced weight gain. For the study, analysis, Liu et al. worked with three separate study cohorts: None of the participants had a chronic disease and were not obese when the study began. To determine the amount of nuts that the volunteers consumed, the scientists used food-frequency questionnaires every four years over the course of each established study group, which went on for an average of 26 years. The findings revealed that walnuts were especially effective. The study participants were mostly Caucasian, and Liu notes that the results would be consistent across other populations since the link between nut consumption and other health outcomes is “pretty consistent” across populations in the U.S. and Europe. Registered Dietitian Lori Chong from the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center wasn’t involved in the current study, but she noted that the fiber content of nuts could be responsible for these findings. Chong said that since fiber is crucial for weight control, it might also be linked to a blood sugar response to nuts, unlike other snacks. Chong explained that anything that spikes blood sugar will spike insulin, which promotes fat storage. Snacking on something that doesn’t cause blood sugar spike doesn’t require insulin. (Related: Health Basics: Weight Loss 101.) Liu warned that when you enter adulthood, you may have a gradual weight gain of at least one pound a year on average. In 15 years, those extra pounds could be linked to health risks like cancer and Type 2 diabetes. Chong noted that if you really want to manage your weight, preventing weight gain is more effective than trying to lose weight after. She advised that the best way to do this is by avoiding processed foods, following a balanced diet, and exercising regularly. The findings revealed that calories aren’t the only marker of a food’s nutritional impact. Nuts are full of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, both of which are heart-healthy, especially when they’re replacing unhealthy saturated and trans fat found in processed snacks. Additionally, nuts contain fiber that boosts satiety and fullness. Fiber is also good for gut microbial diversity. According to a 2015 article in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, gut bacteria could have a role in immunity, weight, and risk for various diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, nuts contain three macronutrients (carbohydrates, fat, and protein). Nuts also have calcium, phytonutrients, and other minerals that can boost your overall well-being. When buying nuts, avoid products roasted in oil, with salt, or nuts with added sweeteners. Chong advised that nuts with added spices should also be avoided since they may include chemical flavoring. Choose some raw or dry-roasted nuts, such as: If you don’t want to eat plain, raw nuts, roast them at home then add herbs or spices for a boost of flavor. You can also add a tablespoon of nuts to cottage cheese, oatmeal, salad, or yogurt. Eat nuts the same way you would consume a portion-controlled snack if you want to properly manage your weight."

https://food.news/2019-02-18-simple-tips-and-ideas-to-avoid-food-waste.html,Simple tips and ideas to avoid food waste,0,"Advertisement Did you know that people who eat healthily are sometimes the biggest producers of food waste? However, with some careful planning and mindfulness, you can reduce food waste to help save the environment. Early in 2018, a study funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USA) revealed that American consumers waste at least a pound of food per day or 225 to 290 pounds annually. The average U.S. household throws out around 150,000 tons of food daily. By making some small changes in your daily life, you can make a big impact and help save the environment. Reducing food waste Shop smart. Make a list of things you need before you head to the store. Start meal planning and rotate the food in your pantry to avoid spoilage. (Related: Food waste is costing us all: The environmental and financial cost of spoiled food.) Familiarize yourself with food packaging terms such as “best before,” “best by,” “expiration date,” “sell by,” and “use by” so you can maximize the shelf life of the food in your kitchen. Buy in bulk for items that have a long shelf life. Buying in bulk reduces waste from packaging and saves some money, but only if you purchase items that your family frequently uses. Reuse leftovers. Freeze them, eat them the following day, or add them to your next meal. When cooking a dish that tastes best on the day it is made, make enough, so you don’t have leftovers. Grow your own food. Plant some herbs in your kitchen and cultivate produce in your backyard. When it’s harvest time, pick what you need then learn how to preserve extra produce. Preserve food to extend their shelf-life. Learn about useful food preservation techniques such as: Save vegetable scraps and use them in homemade broths and soup stocks. Clean them properly, then store them in freezer bags until you’re ready to use them. Use the rest to make compost for your garden. Stop using plastic and get reusable lunch or snack bags and shopping bags instead. Store leftovers in non-toxic reusable containers like food-grade stainless steel containers, glass containers, or Mason jars. Use high-quality insulated mugs, reusable water bottles, and thermoses. Purchase high-quality kitchenware and appliances. They may be pricey, but these items are worthy investments because you won’t have to replace them every year or so. Repair items instead of discarding them. Use cloth napkins and towels instead of paper products. Get rid of unused items at home by donating them to family and friends or local charities. Reduce plastic waste by buying reusable drinking straws for the whole family. Instead of purchasing cleaning towels, cut up old sheets and towels then reuse them for dusting and cleaning. Live a greener lifestyle by recycling office paper, or switching to a paperless documentation system. You can also recycle aluminum cans and plastic bottles. Contact your local county or municipality to find out which items can be recycled in your area. Most recycling facilities have their lists of acceptable items, but the majority of them don’t accept the following items: Rinse food debris from glass, metal, or plastic materials before recycling. On the other hand, paper materials must be empty, clean, and dry. Wet paper or food-soiled paper products may be compostable, so add them to your compost pile.

https://food.news/2019-02-13-eating-certain-carbohydrates-trigger-the-growth-of-cancer-cells.html,Eating certain carbohydrates triggers the growth of cancer cells,0,"Advertisement A diet full of sugary foods and drinks contains bad carbohydrates that can make you gain weight and increase your risk of various health problems. According to a study, bad carbs also promote the growth of cancer cells. Bad carbs are processed foods and sugary drinks. Various studies have determined that these foods are linked to a significantly higher risk of developing cancer. Meanwhile, good carbs like fresh fruits and vegetables help prevent cancer. Other foods that are considered bad carbs include: The body needs good carbohydrates because your cells and tissues turn the glucose in food into usable energy. Healthy carbohydrates fuel important organs and systems like the brain, central nervous system, heart, kidneys, and muscles. But unlike good carbs, bad carbs flood your body with excess glucose that is stored as fat. When your diet is full of bad carbs, your body becomes more conducive to the growth of cancer cells. This study, which linked bad carbs with prostate and other cancers, referenced health records that tracked more than 3,000 people since the 1970s. The data organized the foods consumed by the participants by glycemic index and glycemic load, which measures carbohydrate quality based on their impact on a person’s blood sugar levels. The foods eaten by the participants were then compared with resultant cancer rates. According to the study findings, individuals who consumed the most high glycemic load foods had a whopping 88 percent chance of developing prostate cancer. The researchers also found that eating foods full of unhealthy carbs “significantly increase the risk of prostate cancer,” the second leading cause of death in men due to cancer-related conditions. The research findings also revealed that people who consumed sugary drinks, such as sodas and sweetened juices, were three times more likely to develop prostate cancer. Those who consumed a lot of processed foods, such as meat sandwiches, packaged burgers, and pizza, had double the risk of prostate cancer. (Related: Soda Consumption Increases Risk of Prostate Cancer.) Sugary beverages were confirmed as the worst bad carb foods, and they are now associated with an increased risk of cancer, along with being considered a major cause of the diabetes and obesity epidemics in the U.S. In the same study, researchers noted that the participants who followed a diet that contained low-glycemic index foods such as fresh fruits, legumes, non-starchy vegetables (except corn and potatoes), and whole grains had a 67 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer. The consumption of legumes were also linked to cancer prevention and a 32 percent reduced risk for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. If you want to maintain your overall health and lower your risk of developing various types of cancer, exercise regularly, avoid bad carbs, and follow a healthy diet full of nutritious foods and good carbs."
https://food.news/2019-02-13-preventing-food-deserts-in-low-income-areas-research-finds-regional-food-sources-provide-healthier-more-plentiful-options.html,"Preventing food deserts in low-income areas: Research finds regional food sources provide healthier, more plentiful options",0,"Advertisement Researchers from Cornell University have revealed that they have finally “analyzed where Northeast supermarkets source the foods they sell to their low-income customers.” With data from these case studies, policymakers can learn how regional food systems can offer healthier food to low-income people in the Northeast part of the United States. Miguel Gomez, co-author of the study, says that regional food stores are crucial to “the communities that they serve,” especially within both”very rural and very urban areas.” While they’re not as important in the larger national market when it comes to volume, without regional food stores these areas would experience a “food desert.” The team of scientists observed 11 independent supermarkets – such as New York state stores in Harlem, Madison County, Syracuse, and Onondaga – and they tracked how food made its way from growers to stores. The researchers monitored eight items from the 11 supermarkets: apples, bread, canned peaches, cabbage, frozen broccoli, ground beef, milk, and potatoes. Since these items “are grown or could be grown in the Northeast, the team was able to compare regional supply chains with non-regional chains. Gomez, who is also an associate professor at Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management, shares that the studies provided detailed results, and that the researchers established metrics to measure “the value-added economic activity in the supply chain, the transportation efficiency of nonregional versus regional supply chains, and the percentage of each item that stores source from regional producers.” (Related: Experts believe regional foodsheds would reverse obesity epidemic.) Kristen Park, co-author and an extension associate at Dyson, adds that while the number of items analyzed was very small, the number of different supply chains was “far greater,” and that this gave them insight on the various “supply arrangements and supplier entities.” The research team learned three lessons: Even “dollar stores” are expanding, and some of them currently offer frozen and fresh fruits and vegetables aside from canned items. Gomez concludes that dollar stores, which can be found in rural areas that are lacking in stores, are “doing a great job of filling that gap.” If you wish to eat healthier and stay within a strict budget, check out this list of affordable superfoods: You can read more articles about fresh food and tips on how to eat healthy at Fresh.news."
https://food.news/2019-02-12-could-your-depression-be-caused-by-your-diet.html,Could your depression be caused by your diet?,0,"Advertisement What you eat significantly affects your physical health. If your diet includes a lot of sugary and fatty foods, you are at risk of health problems such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes. According to several studies, eating certain kinds of food can also negatively affect your mental health. Several studies have determined that eating certain kinds of food can affect your mental and emotional health, especially if your diet includes a lot of processed foods and refined sugar. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that you can safely eat desserts or drink sugary beverages if you use artificial sweeteners. While sugar alternatives like aspartame can lower your calorie intake, studies suggest that they can also drastically worsen symptoms in people who already have depression. In fact, researchers from the University of Northwestern Ohio were forced to cancel a study of artificial sweeteners because some volunteers developed suicidal thoughts. While the participants who did not have depression were not affected in the same way, evidence hints that artificial sweeteners can lower serotonin levels in the brain significantly. Research has determined that simple, refined carbohydrates lack nutrients and that they are linked to the growing obesity epidemic in the country. Columbia University researchers conducted a study to verify if simple carbs are also associated with depression. Using data collated from the Women’s Health Initiative, which tracked over 70,000 women, the results showed that the higher a woman’s blood sugar increased after eating refined grains and sugar, the greater her risk of developing depression. The study, which was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, also showed that the opposite is true. Women who followed a diet full of whole grains and healthy produce had a lower risk of depression. (Related: Recent study demonstrates how a healthy diet can reduce symptoms of depression.) Scientists are learning more about the connection between “sugar’s ability to raise levels of inflammation throughout the brain and body to higher incidences of depression.” According to study findings published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, brain inflammation was 30 percent higher in individuals who were clinically depressed. Findings from a separate study revealed that individuals who took medication to reduce inflammation caused by autoimmune or inflammatory disease had a lower chance of developing symptoms of depression. These results highlight the connection between sugar, which causes inflammation, and an increased incidence of depression. Avoid eating sugary foods and replace them with these anti-inflammatory foods to improve your mood. If healthy fats and oils, such as extra virgin olive oil, can lower the risk of various serious health conditions (e.g., depression and heart disease), the opposite is also true. According to a study, eating a lot of foods that contain unhealthy trans fats may increase your chances of depression by a whopping 48 percent. Almost all scientific studies analyzing the connection between poor diet and mental illnesses such as depression were focused on a specific food. However, research published in the British Journal of Psychiatry examined the diets of 3,000 people. The results determined that people who consumed the most processed foods had a much higher rate of depression. On the other hand, people who ate a lot of whole foods had a lower risk of the condition. The first step to successfully managing your depression is to eliminate processed and sugary foods from your diet. If you already have depression or if you wish to lower your risk, follow a healthy diet that includes fresh fruits, lean meats, and vegetables."
https://food.news/2019-02-11-high-fat-diet-associated-with-a-higher-risk-of-kidney-damage.html,High-fat diet associated with a higher risk of kidney damage,0,"Advertisement If you already have Type 2 diabetes, you need to learn how to properly manage your condition to avoid kidney damage. Consider the results of a new study, which determined that following a high-fat diet can also negatively affect your kidneys. The study was published in the journal Experimental Psychology. When a person has diabetes, their body is unable to use insulin properly. You need insulin because it is a crucial hormone for the regulation of your blood glucose levels. If you have diabetes, you may have too much glucose (sugar) in your blood. When left untreated, high blood glucose levels can cause diabetic kidney disease, a condition wherein waste products are not removed effectively from the body. The kidneys of an individual with this condition become overworked because of all the excess sugar that they are trying to process and eliminate from the blood. Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the condition, makes up a whopping 90 to 95 percent of all diabetes cases. According to the results of the study, the consumption of junk food and high-fat foods can increase your blood sugar levels just like Type 2 diabetes. (Related: PROVEN: Scientists say a high-fat diet is nutritionally poor and raises the likelihood of disease.) Together with the other researchers, Dr. Havovi Chichger, the lead study author, discovered that eating too much junk food or foods high in fat “create similar conditions in the body.” Dr. Chichger is a senior lecturer in biomedical science at Anglia Ruskin University in the U.K. For the study, the researchers used rat models that were fed diets of either chow with 60 percent fat for five weeks, or a junk food diet of cheese, chocolate, and marshmallows for eight weeks. The blood sugar levels of the subjects were assessed, along with the diet’s effects on different kidney glucose transporters. The scientists then compared the results with the findings from the rats with Type 2 diabetes. The rats with diabetes had high levels of sodium-glucose linked transporters (SGLTs), glucose transporters (GLUTs), and the corresponding regulatory proteins. These mechanisms aid the body with glucose reabsorption, a kidney process that filters the blood for glucose. If you have too much glucose in your blood, this process may become ineffective. The rats that had unhealthy diets showed similar elevated SGLT and GLUT levels as the rats with Type 2 diabetes. Because of this, the researchers posit kidney damage risk is just as high in individuals who follow an unhealthy diet. The scientists involved in the study hope that the study findings can be used to develop new solutions for safely reducing dangerous blood sugar levels. One such diabetic treatment involves blocking kidney glucose transporters to help lower a person’s overall blood sugar levels. Based on the results of this study, your diet has an important role in optimal blood sugar levels and your overall well-being. If you already have Type 2 diabetes, or you wish to lower your risk of diabetes and kidney damage, limit your intake of high-fat foods that can negatively affect your health. To keep your blood glucose levels and kidney health optimal, follow a diet that incorporates the following foods: Avoid junk food and foods that are full of unhealthy carbohydrates and starches to reduce your risk of Type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease."
https://food.news/2019-02-11-consumption-of-fried-foods-increases-cancer-risk.html,Health warning: Consumption of fried foods increases cancer risk,0,"Advertisement If you’re eating fried food right now, you might want to put your fork down. Many health experts warn that the consumption of foods fried in vegetable oil is associated with an increased risk of cancer. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, acrylamide is a probable carcinogen. This chemical may form in certain foods that are exposed to high levels of heat during cooking or processing. (Related: Acrylamide in Foods is a Major ‘Human Health Concern’ – International Researchers Report.) Fried foods that contain acrylamide tend to be full of trans fats as well, but the chemical can also be found in other food products. The chemical was discovered in 2002, but it has been occurring in foods since humans started cooking. Acrylamide is linked to a process called the Maillard reaction, which occurs when foods are cooked and there is an interaction between carbohydrates and proteins at the chemical level as they are heated. The Maillard reaction makes potato chips crisp, and it gives bread a golden-brown crust. But under certain conditions, this reaction can produce acrylamide. The Maillard reaction is responsible for the colors and flavors of foods such as: Out of all fried foods, potato chips have the highest levels of acrylamide. However, while regular potato chips have at least 2,000 ppm (parts per million) of acrylamide, fried sweet potato chips contain about twice that amount. Avoid these nine foods with high levels of acrylamide: Studies that have looked in the cancer-causing effects of acrylamide on rat models have revealed that the chemical is a probable carcinogen in animals. In a separate 2014 major review of acrylamide studies with humans, which was published in the journal Nutrition and Cancer, six out of 26 studies determined that individuals consuming the highest levels of the compound had a higher risk of cancer. Foods with the highest potential risk for acrylamide content are often made from starchy foods like potatoes and grains that are cooked at high temperatures for long periods of time. Meanwhile, processed foods that may contain higher levels of acrylamide include products like dry cereals and packaged cookies. Fried foods rich in trans fats are something you should avoid because they are bad for you. Their acrylamide content is also another thing to consider if you want to stay healthy. The best way to avoid the harmful chemical acrylamide is by following a diet full of simple and natural foods with minimal processing. Acrylamide doesn’t tend to form in cooked meat, dairy, fish, fruits, or low-starch vegetables. You can also eat more whole, organic, and minimally-processed foods to limit your exposure to acrylamide. Additionally, you can try going raw or using lower-temperature cooking methods such as boiling, sautéing, or steaming. Instead of buying fried foods, consume more of the healthy food groups listed below. Fruits Grains and protein Vegetables and herbs Avoid junk food full of trans fats and eat more fresh fruits and vegetables to lower your cancer risk."
https://food.news/2019-02-11-garlic-prevents-prostate-gland-enlargement.html,For the guys: Eat more garlic to prevent prostate gland enlargement,0,"Advertisement Men suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) don’t just experience an excessively large prostate. They’re also prone to health problems like urinary leakage or urinary tract infections (UTIs). Thankfully, a study has determined that garlic (Allium sativum) may be used to prevent BPH. The study, published in Phytotherapy Research, was conducted by researchers who assessed the effectiveness of garlic on rat models. BPH is a non-cancerous urologic disease that usually affects men older than age 50. The condition affects the prostate, a walnut-shaped gland that is part of the male reproductive system. This gland wraps around the urethra, the tube that urine flows out of. The prostate adds fluid to semen that carries sperm. When a patient develops BPH, the gland can clamp down on the urethra and restrict the flow of urine from the bladder. BPH is linked to symptoms such as: While there are conventional treatments for the BPH, most of them are linked to negative side effects. Because of these side effects, the search goes on for a natural and effective cure for prostate gland enlargement. Researchers are looking into the development of herbal medicines that can be used safely for the long-term to inhibit the progress of the condition. Earlier research has confirmed garlic’s anti?hyperlipidemic, anti?inflammatory, and cardioprotective properties. But to date, no study has been conducted to see if garlic can be used to treat prostate enlargement. (Related: Things You Should Know About Garlic – Health Benefits, DIY, Recipes, Tips and Tricks.) In the study, researchers tested garlic to determine its suppressing effects on rat models with induced BPH. The study findings showed that garlic administration helped reduce relative prostate weight ratio. Garlic also helped inhibit the mRNA expression level of AR, DHT serum levels, and the growth of prostatic tissue in the rats with BPH. Additionally, garlic administration decreased the levels of two inflammatory proteins in prostatic tissue: inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX?2). The scientists also reported the garlic-induced accumulation of death?inducing signal complex and activation of 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). They also observed a decrease in levels of anti?apoptotic proteins, such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl?2), B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl?xL), and survivin, during the course of the study. According to the researchers, garlic can potentially be used to develop natural remedies that can effectively prevent prostate gland enlargement in male patients. Below are some natural cures that can help ease some of the symptoms of BPH. You can read more articles about research on natural cures for benign prostatic hyperplasia at Research.news."
https://food.news/2019-02-10-walnuts-optimize-gut-microbiome-to-suppress-colon-cancer-cell-growth.html,New evidence shows that walnuts optimize the gut microbiome to suppress colon cancer cell growth,0,"Advertisement Walnuts (Juglans regia) are popular among vegans because these nuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Additionally, walnuts are full of nutrients that can help boost brain and cardiovascular health. But according to a study, walnuts can also help optimize the gut microbiome “to suppress colon cancer cell growth.” To date, colon cancer is the third most common type of the disease around the globe. The study, which was published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research, involved a collaboration between researchers from the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCONN) and Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine. For the study, the researchers set out to determine the cancer-preventive effects of walnut consumption in mice. The researchers observed two groups of mice that were fed two different diets. The first group of mice (the control group) received a standard lab mouse chow and the second group was given a chow that mimicked the nutritional profile of the typical American diet. Subsets of both groups of mice were given walnuts. The findings showed that the mice that were fed the American diet fortified with seven to 10.5 percent walnuts had fewer incidents of colon cancer. The researchers noted that the reduction in colon cancer rates was particularly pronounced in male mice, which had at least 2.3 times fewer tumors than the female subjects. Take note that the human equivalent to the average amount of walnuts given to the mice in the study is an ounce per day, or 14 half-walnut pieces. The study offers very promising results concerning the effects of walnuts against tumor growth. As the days go by, researchers uncover more proof that walnuts can help fight cancer. Experts posit that walnuts function as a probiotic that can help optimize the gut microbiome. In turn, this helps to promote a healthy colon while also suppressing both cancer cell and tumor growth. (Related: Walnuts inhibit cancer development, slow its growth, and kill cancer cells.) Walnuts are unique because they are the only with plant-based omega-3s. Walnut phytonutrients and lipid extracts possess multiple healing components that can help target and kill cancer cells. These nuts are also rich in vitamin E, which has been associated with cancer prevention. They also contain: Walnuts also have other unique cancer-inhibiting compounds such as the flavonol morin 4, the quinone juglone, and the tannin tellimagrandin. Aside from their cancer-fighting properties, walnuts can also help prevent various illnesses associated with poor lifestyle and diet choices. The regular consumption of walnuts may help lower your risk of diabetes, heart disease, and neurological disorders. Research also suggests that walnuts can help boost bone health. Based on the results of this study, it is safe to assume that eating walnuts can help lower your risk of developing colon cancer. You can add more walnuts to your diet by: To keep things simple, you can also eat on a handful of walnuts for a savory snack that will help you feel full. Just make sure you eat only one ounce of walnuts a day since consuming more than that may put too much stress on your digestion. Avoid walnuts if you are allergic to nuts, and supervise children when giving them walnuts because they may choke on larger pieces. To lower your colon cancer risk, eat walnuts regularly, exercise every day, follow a healthy diet, and make positive lifestyle changes."

https://food.news/2019-02-08-unusual-foods-that-you-can-pickle-now-for-use-in-an-emergency.html,"Unusual foods that you can pickle now, for use in an emergency",0,"Advertisement Pickling is a handy skill to have, especially when SHTF – and you don’t need expensive equipment or a large work area to start pickling. Pickling can easily extend the shelf life of many perishable food items like fruits or vegetables. (h/t to ApartmentPrepper.com.) Pickling, one of the oldest methods of food preservation, involves submerging your food of choice in either a salt or vinegar brine to keep it from spoiling. Here are some of the many benefits of pickling your own food: Controlled fermentation is encouraged in brine pickling, like when you make kimchi or sauerkraut. This allows beneficial bacteria to grow in the mixture and crowd out any bad bacteria that can make the food spoil. With brine pickling, you may notice that the flavor, look, and texture of the food changes. (Related: How to quickly pickle a variety of veggies.) When you use vinegar to make pickles, its high acidity prevents most bacteria from growing in the food. Food pickled in vinegar remains preserved as long as it is submerged in the solution. Kosher pickles are cucumbers preserved in a vinegar solution. Meanwhile, most dill pickles are preserved in brine. Dill pickles may include vinegar, but it is preserved in a mixture that includes dill and other pickling spices and salt. Did you know that you can also pickle fruit? Fresh fruits ripen quickly and pickling is a good way to preserve excess fruit. Additionally, natural sugars in fruits perfectly complement the salty and sour components that are introduced by the pickling process. Pickled fruits can also be added to salads and cheese plates. Here are seven unique foods that you can pickle, with a recipe included below for quick-pickled apples. Pickled fruits pair well with rich foods. When making this recipe for quick-pickled apples, you can use maple syrup instead of sugar to enhance the flavor of the final product. Take note that the apple slices will fade with time, but you can experiment with a redder-skinned apple. The recipe below produces a pint of quick-pickled apples. Ingredients: Steps: Serve quick-pickled apples with a serving of pork or a pulled pork sandwich. The apples can also be eaten on their own as a snack.

https://food.news/2019-02-06-proven-scientific-ways-to-prevent-the-common-cold.html,Proven scientific ways to prevent the common cold,0,"Advertisement Since the common cold and the flu both have similar symptoms, it’s important to know which is which so you can use the most effective remedies when you’re feeling under the weather. Listed below are several science-backed natural remedies that can protect you from the common cold. A diet full of different fruits and vegetables can help you get plenty of beneficial antioxidants. Immune-boosting antioxidants, like bioflavonoids; selenium; vitamins A, C, and D; and zinc can be found in brightly colored and green vegetables, such as: Selenium and zinc can also make your white blood cells more effective at fighting off bacteria and viruses. Ellie Isom, a nutritional therapist, advises that protecting yourself from these invaders can support the normal functioning of your immune system. In a 2018 review of 83 clinical studies, which was published in the American Journal Of Clinical Nutrition, researchers determined that “high intakes of fruits and vegetables lead to both a reduction in pro-inflammatory biomarkers [which can promote illness] and an enhanced immune cell profile.” A good night’s sleep helps your body rest and repair itself. For a study on sleep patterns, which was published the journal Sleep, scientists studied blood samples from 11 pairs of identical twins with different sleep patterns. The results showed that the twin with shorter sleep duration had a depressed immune system, compared to their sibling. Isom noted that poor sleep can significantly weaken your immune system. If you have trouble falling asleep, set a regular sleep-wake cycle. Increase your intake of calming nutrients like magnesium and theanine to sleep better every night. Natural sources of magnesium include beans, green leafy vegetables, nuts, pulses, and seeds. But for therapeutic levels, consider taking supplements. Green tea is the best source of theanine. But if the drink keeps you up at night, take theanine supplements instead. According to a 2017 a report published in the journal Nutrients, vitamin C can prevent and treat respiratory and systemic infections by boosting various immune cell functions at levels of 100 to 200 milligrams (mg) per day. To shorten the duration of colds and the flu, health experts advise supplementing with high doses of vitamin C (such as 8,000 mg daily) the moment you experience symptoms. Vitamin C-rich foods include: In 2017 major global study, published in the British Medical Journal, researchers found that boosting your vitamin D intake can help lower healthcare costs by minimizing the risk of colds, the flu, and other dangerous respiratory infections like bronchitis and pneumonia. The study findings showed that taking vitamin D supplements daily or weekly strengthened the immunity of all the participants, especially those who: cover themselves to protect against sun damage or for religious reasons; don’t go outside much; have dark skins that absorb less sunlight; or have vitamin D deficiency. Isom explained that since immune cell function is closely tied to vitamin D metabolism, vitamin D deficiency could be responsible for increased susceptibility to infection. The vitamin boosts the immune system’s ability to recognize pathogens and trigger a response against them, especially viruses that cause the flu and respiratory tract infections. (Related: Protect yourself from flu season with these natural cold remedies.) About 4000 IU (International Unit) of vitamin D is the safe upper limit, advised the Institute of Medicine (IOM). Do not take more than that without consulting a medical professional. Fat-soluble vitamin D can be found in foods like dairy, eggs, and oily fish. Vitamin D-rich foods also include zinc, which you can also get from sources like as beans, nuts, pulses, and seeds. The Global Handwashing Partnership reports that hand washing can help prevent at least 21 percent of colds and upper respiratory tract infections. Your hands are full of germs. According to the Center For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), individuals touch their face, nose, mouth, and eyes without even realizing it. This is bad because this allows germs to enter your body through these areas and make you sick. Always wash your hands, especially before and after preparing food; before eating; or after going to the toilet. Avoid the common cold by always washing your hands, exercising regularly, and following a healthy diet."

But did you know that eating red onions offers various health benefits and that they can help you manage your blood sugar? According to Haley Hooks, a dietetic intern at Tufts University’s Frances Stern Nutrition Center, onions are full of beneficial chemicals such as antioxidants, flavonoids, sulfur compounds, and vitamin C. Onions are nutritious whether you eat them raw or cooked. However, raw onions have higher levels of sulfur compounds. The sulfur compounds in onions are formed via an enzymatic reaction when they are cut or crushed. According to studies, these sulfur compounds offer several benefits such as promoting the breakdown of blood clots, which can lower your risk of developing heart disease and stroke. These onion compounds can also reduce the production of unhealthy cholesterol in the body. To maximize the sulfur content of red onions, it’s better to eat them raw. Cooking onions will significantly decrease the quantity of the compounds that offer various health benefits. The only downside is, these sulfur compounds are responsible for the pungent odor of onions. The compounds also make you teary-eyed when you’re slicing onions. If you can stomach the taste of raw red onions, add them to dishes like salads or sandwiches. If you prefer to eat cooked onions, cooking them lightly will still offer many health benefits. Serve grilled or roasted red onions as a side dish, or dice and saute them with some peppers to make a delicious and healthy relish for lean meat or grains. Here are several reasons to start eating raw red onions: Regardless of your food preferences, eating more red onions daily can help improve your overall well-being. It can even improve your cardiovascular health and lower your risk of developing cancer."
https://food.news/2019-02-04-sea-salts-are-not-as-sterile-as-previously-thought-mold-contamination.html,Toxic preservative? Sea salts are not as sterile as previously thought; mold contamination could potentially spoil food,0,"Advertisement Artisanal products such as sea salts are often prized by food lovers, but a study has determined that sea salts can cause spoilage molds. Based on the study headed by Kathie Hodge, a mycologist from Cornell University, and doctoral candidate Megan Biango-Daniels, there are varying levels of mold contamination in commercial sea salts. Among those molds were important food spoilage molds like Aspergillus and Penicillium, along with some notorious producers of mycotoxins (allergens). Biango-Daniels said, “This new finding contradicts the conventional wisdom that salts are sterile ingredients.” The research discussed the importance of knowing the risk that comes with using sea salt during food production. For the study, the researchers used seven different commercial salts. They then extracted living fungi from the sea salts, which was grown in the lab for identification. The fungi discovered in the salt have the potential to spoil food when used as an ingredient and can introduce mycotoxins when consumed. For the levels discovered in the study, which is an estimated 1.7 spores per gram, using sea salt on food that you’re going to eat immediately isn’t dangerous to your health. However, there can be dire consequences when sea salts are used at home or industrially for making cured meats, fermented pickles, or brined cheeses. Since these foods mature over time, molds introduced with sea salt can thrive and spoil food, which can make it very toxic. Hodge, who is also an associate professor in the Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology Section in Cornell’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, added “fungi can survive in surprisingly hostile places. They can’t increase or grow in a container of sea salt – nothing can – but spores of some fungi survive quite happily there. Later they can wake up and make trouble in our food.” Fungi can make their way into sea salts during production from seawater or during storage and packaging. Sea salt production begins when seawater is trapped in outdoor ponds called salterns. Once the seawater evaporates, salt crystals form and are scraped up from the ponds and dried. Fungi may remain from microbes that live in the salterns, or their spores may come from the air over weeks of evaporation. Once fungi are in the salt, they can grow again once they are stored in a moister environment. The researchers warned that microbial safety standards for this currently unregulated ingredient are necessary to avoid food spoilage. Food spoilage is often indicated by a change in appearance different from the food in its fresh form, like a change in color or texture, an unpleasant odor, or a strange taste. These factors often cause food spoilage: Because microorganisms can be found everywhere in the environment, there is always a risk of spoilage when foods are exposed to unsuitable conditions. Microbial spoilage is caused by bacteria, molds, and yeast. Aside from making food unpalatable, some types of spoilage can be caused by pathogenic bacteria, which can have serious health consequences. Clostridium perfringens (causes spoilage in meat and poultry) and Bacillus cereus (causes milk and cream spoilage) are also pathogenic. (Related: Scientists find the moringa leaf to be an effective preservative for meat.) When exposed to unsuitable storage conditions, such as the Danger Zone (between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit), pathogenic bacteria can multiply rapidly and release dangerous toxins that will make you sick if the food is eaten, even if it’s cooked to a safe internal temperature. Keep food out of the Danger Zone by keeping cold food cold, at or below 40 F (4.4 C), and hot food hot, at or above 140 F (60 C). Spoilage of food concerns both quality and food safety. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends the Four steps to Food Safety (Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill) to prevent food spoilage and reduce the risk of food-borne illness.

https://food.news/2019-02-03-what-are-the-best-food-sources-of-vitamin-k.html,What are the best food sources of vitamin K?,0,"Advertisement Following a healthy diet offers many benefits, such as improved overall physical and mental well-being. But did you know that eating foods rich in vitamin K can also boost your bone and heart health? The body needs vitamin K because it helps build and maintain healthy bones. This necessary vitamin is popular because it also has a role in blood clotting (coagulation). It allows the body to make the proteins necessary for the blood clotting process. Clotting is important because it can prevent the body from bleeding too much when you get hurt. Green leafy vegetables contain the highest amounts of vitamin K, but other natural food sources of this nutrient include blueberries, edamame, and soybeans. The average adult woman needs 90 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin K per day while adult men need 120 mcg. Do take note that if you use blood thinners like warfarin (Coumadin), your vitamin K intake could affect the dosage of your medication. Always consult your healthcare provider before you increase your intake of vitamin K-rich foods, and talk to a dietitian to determine the proper daily value of the vitamin for your condition. The vegetables listed below are some of the best sources of vitamin K: Prevent the formation of blood clots and boost your bone health by consuming these vitamin K-rich vegetables regularly."

https://food.news/2019-02-02-medicinal-benefits-of-cinnamon.html,Medicinal benefits of cinnamon,0,"Advertisement Cinnamon is a sweet-smelling spice that evokes warmth and comfort, especially during the holidays. But did you know that this aromatic superfood also offers several evidence-backed health benefits? Cinnamon is a spice that comes from the inner bark of trees that belong to the genus Cinnamomum. In ancient times, cinnamon was rare enough to be presented as gifts for royalty. However, cinnamon is now common and cheap. You can buy it in supermarkets, and it is often used as an ingredient in various dishes. There are two main types of cinnamon: Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum), or “true” cinnamon, and Cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia), or Chinese cassia. Cassia cinnamon is the more common variety of this spice. Consumers often mean Cassia cinnamon when they say something contains “cinnamon.” Cinnamon is made by cutting the stems of cinnamon trees. Once the inner bark is extracted, the woody parts are removed. The bark dries and curls into rolls that are called cinnamon sticks. Sometimes, these sticks are ground to make cinnamon powder. The oily part of the spice, which is rich in a compound called cinnamaldehyde, gives the spice its unique flavor and scent. Experts suggest that cinnamaldehyde is also responsible for cinnamon’s beneficial effects on health and metabolism. The spice is commonly used in home remedies and for medicinal purposes. While there is only a handful of supported clinical evidence that validates the health benefits of cinnamon, there are a lot of small studies which suggest that using the spice offers some advantages. One teaspoon of cinnamon only has six calories, making it a guilt-free addition for different drinks and dishes. Cinnamon is used in healthy recipes, and it is also commonly added to desserts. This spice boosts the flavor of any dish without the need for any sugar, and it is also full of antioxidants. The Cleveland Clinic recommends taking at least 1/4 to a teaspoon of cinnamon per day. Here are the four health benefits of cinnamon. Based on the results of a study, which was conducted by researchers from Wheeling Jesuit University, chewing cinnamon gum during a test “improved participants’ scores on tasks related to attentional processes, virtual recognition memory, working memory, and visual-motor response speed.” This study may be a small one, but you can try chewing on some organic cinnamon-flavored gum so you can concentrate better when you’re studying for an important test or trying to finish a work-related project. A 2015 review of studies revealed that cinnamon contains bioactive phytochemicals with antibacterial effects that can help clear breakouts. Make a DIY pimple-fighting topical face mask by combining two teaspoons of raw, organic honey (which also has antibacterial properties ) and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Apply the mixture to your face for at least ten minutes, then rinse it gently with a washcloth and warm water. (Related: 10 Surprising health benefits of cinnamon.) Several studies imply that cinnamon can help lower blood glucose levels in people with Type 2 diabetes. However, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) reports that the research is “too small and conflicting to state it as fact.” But the ADA added that individuals with Type 2 diabetes can use cinnamon as a beneficial health supplement to manage their condition. The results of a 2013 study showed that cinnamon extract “significantly promotes type I collagen biosynthesis within dermal fibroblasts.” This means that the spice can help address aging skin and wrinkles. Use a cinnamon face mask regularly to keep your skin supple and radiant. Take some cinnamon daily if you want to improve your blood sugar levels and keep your skin beautiful and pimple-free."
https://food.news/2019-01-31-anti-inflammatory-foods-that-prevent-breast-cancer.html,Anti-inflammatory foods that prevent breast cancer,0,"Advertisement Experts suggest that the most effective way to lower cancer risk is by making healthy lifestyle changes. To boost your overall well-being, maintain a healthy weight and eat anti-inflammatory foods that can also help lower your risk of developing breast cancer. According to Alexandra Rothwell, a registered dietitian and a specialist in oncology nutrition, being overweight is one of the main risk factors for breast cancer. Since inflammation is also associated with both breast cancer and being overweight, eating anti-inflammatory foods can help you maintain your blood sugar levels and minimize inflammation. The foods included in the list below aren’t just nutritious. They can also help reduce inflammation and prevent breast cancer. Add fish like herring, mackerel, salmon, and sardines to your diet because they are full of omega-3 fatty acids. Rothwell explained that omega-3s can help reduce inflammation in the body. Alternatively, you can also eat seeds and walnuts if you prefer a non-animal source of these fatty acids. A 2014 study, which was published in Cancer Causes & Control, suggests that consuming more omega-3s is also connected to a reduction in breast density. Various studies have determined that eating a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables regularly can help lower your risk of developing breast cancer. Experts posit that there are several reasons why a plant-based diet is good for you. A 2015 study revealed that fruits and vegetables are rich antioxidants, and the more antioxidants in a diet, “the lower the breast cancer risk may be.” A separate 2011 study, which was published in the European Journal of Nutrition, showed that the fiber found in fruits and vegetables can help fuel their ability to lower cancer risk. (Related: Reduce your risk of breast cancer by 21% by simply eating one more serving of veggies a day.) Rothwell recommends eating the following vegetables if you want to naturally lower your risk of developing breast cancer: However, Rothwell suggests that you should try to stick to low-sugar fruit varieties, such as berries. She added that you need to limit high-sugar fruit, like bananas, mangoes, and pineapples, to keep your blood sugar levels normal. Considered a healthy fat, olive oil offers many benefits. It can also help reduce breast cancer risk. Data from a 2015 study revealed that adding four tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil to a healthy diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables can help lower breast cancer risk by a whopping 68 percent. Additionally, olive oil “may come with an additional benefit relating to breast density,” another confirmed risk factor for breast cancer. According to a 2014 study, which involved more than 3,500 female participants, adding an extra 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil to your daily diet is linked to lower breast density. Turmeric, a spice commonly used in Indian cuisine, contains curcumin. This substance has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Studies have shown that curcumin can help reduce the toxic effects of certain breast cancer cell and that it can potentially prevent the growth of cancer cells. While there isn’t a scientific consensus on recommended daily dosage, common dosages in studies that offer health benefits range from 200 to 500 milligrams (mg) of curcumin daily. Exercise regularly to maintain a healthy weight and add more anti-inflammatory foods to your diet to lower your risk of developing breast cancer."

After all, knowing which plants are edible and which ones are poisonous can literally save your life when SHTF and your supplies run out. Keep your prepping skills updated by learning about the 10 poisonous plants included in the list below. (h/t to PreppersWill.com) Belladonna (Atropa belladonna) Belladonna, or deadly nightshade, is sometimes mistaken for blueberries. The whole plant is toxic, but its roots are the most dangerous. Belladonna contains a toxin called atropine which can increase your heart rate. Other side effects include dizziness and hallucinations. Belladonna is bitter and a single leaf is toxic enough to potentially kill you. Castor beans (Ricinus communis) This plant produces castor oil, but castor beans are lethal. The beans have a high ricin concentration that can kill the average adult. Castor beans lose their toxicity after they are heated to a certain temperature to produce castor oil. If you are exposed to castor beans before they are heated, you may suffer from permanent nerve damage. Doll’s eye (Actaea pachypoda) Doll’s eye, also called white baneberry, contains different poisons that may cause immediate death once eaten. The whole plant is poisonous, and doll’s eye berries are the most lethal since they have a high concentration of a cardiogenic toxin. The toxin will kill you by slowing the heart muscle until your heart stops beating. Tell your children to avoid this plant, especially since most reported cases of poisoning involve kids who enjoyed the sweet taste of the poisonous berries. Hemlock (Conium maculatum) Hemlock is considered one of the most poisonous plants in North America because it has flowers that look very similar to Queen Anne’s lace flowers or parsnip. These similarities result in numerous poisoning incidents. Hemlock has cicutoxin, a harmful chemical that can cause central nervous system damage. The symptoms of hemlock may include: Sometimes, hemlock poisoning can result in death. If you believe you have accidentally consumed hemlock, watch out for symptoms like seizures because they may cause kidney failure, muscle breakdown, and swelling in the brain. These can cause death if the patient doesn’t receive immediate medical attention. Horsenettle (Solanum carolinense) Horsenettle is often mistaken for heirloom tomatoes, especially since the former bears attractive fruits that look similar to the latter. However, horsenettle contains a poisonous substance called alkaloid solanine. Once consumed, this substance may cause significant abdominal pain and circulatory and respiratory issues. Oleander (Nerium oleander) The whole oleander plant is poisonous if consumed or burned. Oleander has a white, sticky sap that contains a toxin called cardenolide glycoside. This toxin is a type of steroid that can cause heart problems. Wash your hands immediately if you touch oleanders. Pokeberries (Phytolacca americana) Pokeberries are toxic, so avoid its fruit-bearing pinkish-purple stalks. (Related: Is it edible? 3 easy steps to determine if you’ve found something edible in the wild.) A handful of pokeberries can kill a child, and eating a bit more can also kill an adult. Other poisonous berry plants to avoid include: Rhododendron (Rhododendron ferrugineum) This bush, which bears clusters of beautiful flowers, is one of the most poisonous plants known to man. The poison is concentrated in rhododendron leaves, but the entire plant is toxic to both humans and animals once consumed. Avoid rhododendron nectar, which produces a toxic substance called grayanotoxin. This substance may cause side effects like diarrhea, nausea, overall weakness, and vomiting. Rosary pea (Abrus precatorius) Rosary pea, also called crab’s eye or jequirity, is used in beading. The plant contains abrin and this toxin is fatal to both humans and animals. Once ingested, abrin can cause liver failure, nausea, or even death. Wild cherry (Prunus avium) While wild cherries are edible, the plant’s leaves and pits (seeds) have toxins. The leaves start producing fairly concentrated cyanide as they wilt and the pits can do the same when they are ground up. Now that you know about the poisonous plants listed above, here are some edible plants that you can read up on. Learn how to identify these plants properly so you can safely forage for them when SHTF. Do your research on both edible and poisonous plants to avoid making a deadly mistake while foraging out in the wilds."
https://food.news/2019-01-31-chayotes-can-prevent-and-treat-skin-cancer.html,Chayotes can prevent and treat skin cancer,0,"Advertisement Chayote (Sechium edule) is an uncommon vegetable that belongs to the gourd family. Since it has a very mild flavor, it can be used in various dishes and cooked in different ways. According to a study, the versatile chayote can also be used to treat skin cancer. The study was conducted by biology students from Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) in Indonesia. Dr. Budi Setyadi Daryono supervised the study through the Students Creativity Programme UGM 2017. Lentigo maligna melanoma is a type of severe and malignant skin cancer that spreads rapidly. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are at least 3,300 new melanoma cases reported annually in Indonesia. Melanoma may appear on normal skin or start from a mole. However, people don’t always notice how a normal mole changes into melanoma, which can result in unreported and undiagnosed cases. To address this concern, a group of biology students from UGM tried to find a natural cure for lentigo maligna melanoma. For the study, the researchers used chayote to make an ointment that can help treat melanoma. Dwi Jami Indah explained that they used chayote because it is a common agricultural crop in Indonesia. While the vegetable is often used in various dishes, chayote skin remains underutilized even though it contains latex that is beneficial for the health. In fact, chayote has flavonoid and saponin compounds. These secondary metabolite compounds can be used to prevent skin cancer. To determine the anti-cancer compounds in chayote, the students ran qualitative, quantitative, and anti-proliferation tests using the cell line that has the same proliferation character as the cancer cell. The research team used chayote paste as a test sample. The researchers performed a thin layer chromatography test for the qualitative test. Meanwhile, they ran a spectrophotometric test for the quantitative test. For both tests, they divided chayote into three parameters based on the fruit size. The researchers operated under the assumption that a bigger chayote is older, compared to other samples. Indah said that testing using the three parameters confirmed that chayote contained saponin and flavonoid compounds. The researchers then processed chayote into an extract, which was then turned into an ointment. According to the results of the antiproliferative test, the chayote extract can help obstruct the growth of skin cancer cells. (Related: Vitamin B3 can reduce skin cancer risk by 23%.) Using the research data, the UGM students successfully produced Selasih Lalat, a chayote ointment that can be applied on cancerous moles. The students hope that their research can inspire others to use natural materials when developing cures for different conditions. Lentigo maligna melanoma refers to a type of invasive skin cancer. This condition develops from lentigo maligna or Hutchinson’s melanotic freckle. Lentigo maligna often develops on the outer surface of your skin. However, when lentigo maligna starts growing beneath the skin’s surface, it develops into lentigo maligna melanoma. The latter is the least common type of melanoma. While lentigo maligna grows slowly and is usually harmless, lentigo maligna melanoma may spread aggressively. The exact cause of lentigo maligna melanoma remains unknown, but experts posit that sun exposure is the biggest risk factor for developing this type of skin cancer. Individuals with sun-damaged skin and people who spend a lot of time outdoors are at high risk of developing lentigo maligna melanoma. Other risk factors for developing the condition include: You can read more articles about chayote and other natural cures that can help prevent skin cancer at Cancer.news."

Most of these beverages are marketed directly to children and adolescents. If drinks are combined with other drugs and alcohol, their negative side effects can get even worse. The caffeine in energy drinks significantly affects many of your vital organs, especially the cardiac and nervous systems. Here are some of the health problems that are linked to the regular consumption of energy drinks. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), energy drinks “may pose a danger to public health.” Meanwhile, the American Academy of Pediatrics warns that children shouldn’t be allowed to consume these beverages, which have little to no nutritional value. Adults also need to consider their risk for heart disease or stroke. Avoid energy drinks if you’re already predisposed to these conditions. To keep your stamina up, energy drinks contain caffeine, sugar, and additives like taurine. These ingredients, which are detailed below, have no nutritional value. The bad thing is, they’re also full of calories because of their sugar content.

https://food.news/2019-01-30-roasted-jackfruit-seeds-healthier-cappuccino.html,Study finds that roasted jackfruit seeds can be used to make a healthier cappuccino,0,"Advertisement Jackfruit is a unique and exotic fruit with a subtle sweet flavor. The results of a study revealed that aside from being a versatile ingredient, jackfruit can also be used as an alternative to cocoa powder used to make cappuccino. The study, which was published in the journal PLOS ONE, was conducted by scientists from the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) at the University of Sao Paulo’s Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ-USP) in Brazil. According to the researchers, they discovered a way to make a cappuccino mixture using jackfruit. Based on the study results, roasted jackfruit seeds can replace between 50 percent and 75 percent of cocoa blended with milk and coffee to make cappuccino, all without changing the aroma or flavor of the drink. Fernanda Papa Spada, a food scientist and a recipient of the scholarship, explained that flour made from roasted jackfruit seeds “naturally releases a mild chocolate aroma.” Spada worked with her supervisor Solange Guidolin Canniatti-Brazaca, a professor at FAPESP in the Department of Agroindustry, Food and Nutrition. The researchers were motivated to look for a natural cocoa substitute because of the increasing international demand for cocoa. Spada noted that this increase is caused by the rising demand for chocolate without a corresponding growth in supply, especially since cocoa-producing countries are unable to boost their output. The International Cocoa Organization revealed that 4.568 million metric tons (mt) of cocoa beans were processed in the 2017-18 crop year, which was almost the same as the total world production (4.645 million mt). The leading cocoa producer in 2017-18 was the Ivory Coast, which accounted for approximately 40 percent of the total. The country was followed by Ghana, Indonesia, Ecuador, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Brazil. According to Brazilian law, the formulation of milk chocolate drinks and other chocolate preparations must contain at least 25 percent cocoa powder. With the exception of dark and semi-dark chocolate with 35 percent cocoa powder, premium products usually contain less than 30 percent cocoa powder. Chocolate powder usually has about 30 to 50 percent cocoa powder and cocoa butter while dairy ingredients (e.g., butter, dried milk, flavoring, and sugar) make up the rest. Canniatti-Brazaca said that the increasing demand for cocoa and stagnant supply are major challenges for the food industry. These problems called for the search for new cocoa substitutes that can be used in chocolate and chocolate products. Jackfruit seeds were first identified as a chocolate-flavored ingredient during an earlier ESALQ-USP project, which was conducted from 2010 to 2013 by Canniatti-Brazaca’s group and Miriam Coelho de Souza, a researcher at Piracicaba Methodist University (UNIMEP) in Sao Paulo State University. Canniatti-Brazaca commented that based on study findings, out of all the fruit varieties studied, only the seeds of the hard jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) “released intense chocolate-like aromas.” The accidental discovery of jackfruit as a cocoa alternative happened during a class led by Souza. Students were working on the development of food products made from on waste left over from fruit processing, and one student baked a loaf of bread made from jackfruit seed flour. Surprisingly, the bread “smelled strongly of chocolate.” Following the accidental discovery, a handful of studies were performed at ESALQ-USP. The study published in PLOS ONE showed that flour could then be made from roasted dry or fermented seeds of hard jackfruit to produce an aroma similar to the chocolate used in cappuccino. Cappuccino is currently sold as an instant powder made with coffee, milk, and chocolate. However, the quality and amount of chocolate may vary depending on the manufacturer. Spada noted that while some expensive products use chocolate powder, others include artificial flavoring instead. Both coffee and chocolate have a unique flavor and aroma because of volatile compounds derived from roasting and fermentation. The researchers were tasked with determining the ideal conditions for roasting and fermenting jackfruit seeds to produce a flour with a chocolate-like aroma of optimal intensity “without impairing or even altering the coffee flavor of cappuccino.” To achieve this, the researchers studied the chemical composition of jackfruit seed flour, which had no flavor but releases a chocolate aroma after roasting. Spada explained that the flour must be fermented first to release the chocolate aroma. Through sensory analysis, the researchers determined that dry jackfruit seed flour can be incorporated as an ingredient in cappuccino formulations. Substituting jackfruit flour for chocolate powder at 50 to 75 percent was ideal since it doesn’t alter the acceptability and sensory characteristics of the final product. Spada commented that according to the test participants, “the aroma of the cappuccino preparations made with dry jackfruit seeds resembled cappuccino, chocolate, cinnamon, and coffee, with cappuccino and chocolate flavors.” Jackfruit is a large fruit with edible pulp and seeds.

https://food.news/2019-01-30-the-science-behind-comfort-food.html,The science behind comfort food: Why we reach for chocolate or potato chips depending on our mood,0,"Advertisement According to research, the concept of “comfort food” isn’t a one-size-fits-all scenario. You may want some chocolate if you’re feeling sad, but another person will reach for a bag of potato chips when they fail a test at school. Does indulging in sweet or salty foods really give you comfort? Or does a lack of restraint only give you temporary joy that’s immediately followed by guilt because you cheated on your diet? Several studies suggest that while indulging in your guilty pleasures can cheer you up temporarily, your choice of comfort food can also be influenced by your current mood. Sometimes, people crave comfort food because they’re trying to fill an emotional need instead of an empty stomach. In a 2015 study, Jordan D. Troisi and a team of researchers looked into the circumstances that resulted in the consumption of comfort food. The study results revealed that “securely attached individuals preferred the taste of comfort food (potato chips for example), after experiencing a belongingness threat.” In a second study by the same group of researchers, findings showed that securely attached individuals consumed more comfort food to deal with “naturally occurring feelings of isolation.” The researchers also acknowledged earlier research concerning the phenomenon and a preference for comfort food. For the purpose of the two studies, comfort food was defined as “foods people eat in response to specific circumstances, in order to feel pleasant or psychologically comfortable.” The scientists explained that a lot of individuals consume comfort food to escape negative emotion even though this form of attempted self-medication doesn’t always resolve the problem. Despite this fact, people want comfort foods because eating them produces feelings of relational connectedness, a result that is very evident in those who have strong social ties. This suggests that eating comfort food is associated with context, experience, and “relational associations with the food.” The researchers concluded that their reference material proves what people instinctively know: that sometimes, you want to eat food when you need emotional comfort to self-medicate whenever you are under psychological stress. Despite the stereotypes about comfort food choices, the researchers said that comfort food doesn’t always mean junk food. This means comfort food is food that “produces a pleasant emotional state.” According to self-reported definitions of comfort food, people focus more on the consumption experience and context, along with the associations and relational ties to a certain kind of food. However, for some people comfort food isn’t about the kind of food but their mindset. In a separate study, titled “Better Moods for Better Eating?: How Mood Influences Food Choice,” Meryl P. Gardner and a team of other researchers examined the connection between food and mood. The researchers referenced previous studies to verify that individuals often eat to “deal with negative emotions such as frustration, fear, boredom, stress, or anxiety.” These people tend to favor foods that fatty, full of carbohydrates, indulgent, and sweet because these items often give them immediate satisfaction. Comfort foods that meet these criteria may also have psycho-physical benefits. (Related: Six easy ways to get your emotional eating habits under control.) To find out how positive moods affect food choice compared to negative moods, the researchers conducted four experiments. The results imply that the answer is associated with the pursuit of long-term versus short-term benefits. Based on the results of the four experiments, a positive mood is linked to long-term goals like health, which then results in healthier food choices. Meanwhile, negative mood makes people crave more immediate mood management that makes someone consume indulgent foods. Not all comfort foods are bad for you. In fact, there are healthy foods that you can swap for junk food if you want to ease stress and anxiety. These feel-good food alternatives aren’t just delicious, they’re also nutritious. When you’re feeling anxious or stressed, don’t binge-eat cookies or chips. Experts suggest talking to friends or a therapist if you’re struggling to deal with fear, negativity, or situational anxiety. Talking about your feelings can help reduce your desire for temporary sources of comfort like junk food. The next time you’re craving salty chips or fries, try chatting with a friend to help ease your anxious mind."
https://food.news/2019-01-29-hot-coffee-has-more-antioxidants-than-cold-brew.html,"Hot coffee has more antioxidants than cold brew, new study concludes",0,"Advertisement There are several ways to prepare coffee, and there are people who prefer a hot cup of joe while others favor cold brew coffee. However, according to the results of a study, hot coffee contains more antioxidants compared to the cold brew kind. The study, which was published in the journal Scientific Reports, was conducted by researchers from Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University). The research team included Megan Fuller, Ph.D., assistant professor of chemistry, and Niny Rao, Ph.D., associate professor of chemistry. Fuller and Rao, who are both coffee drinkers, were curious to see if the chemical make-up of cold brew was different from hot coffee. Based on the study findings, the researchers determined certain “chemical differences between hot and cold brew coffee that may have health impacts.” The scientists noted that hot-brewed coffee has higher levels of antioxidants, which experts cite as the reason for some of the health benefits of coffee. The results of the study also revealed that the pH levels of both hot and cold coffee were similar. All coffee samples tested had pH levels that ranged from 4.85 to 5.13. Cold brew coffee is often promoted by coffee companies and lifestyle blogs as a healthier alternative to hot coffee. Claims state that since cold brew coffee is less acidic than hot coffee, the former is “less likely to cause heartburn or gastrointestinal problems.” In recent years, the popularity of cold brew coffee has skyrocketed and the U.S. market grew a whopping 580 percent from 2011 to 2016. However, the researchers found only a small number of studies about cold brew, which involves a no-heat and long-steeping method of preparation. On the other hand, the health benefits of consuming hot-brewed coffee are well-documented, such as a lower risk of certain types of cancer, diabetes, and depression. Fuller and Rao acknowledged that even if the overall pH levels were similar, the hot-brewed coffee method contained more total titratable acids. The researchers posit that these acids could be responsible for the hot coffee’s higher antioxidant levels. (Related: Coffee is great for your skin, too: Its antioxidants soothe red and inflamed breakouts.) Fuller shared that coffee is rich in antioxidants and that scientific data have confirmed that drinking caffeine in moderation can boost your overall health. However, Rao warned that even though hot and cold brews have similar pH levels, coffee drinkers mustn’t treat cold brew as a “silver bullet” for preventing gastrointestinal distress. Cold brew and hot brew refers to two different methods of preparing coffee. Cold brew coffee is usually prepared using a French press, Mason jar, or Toddy system. Coffee grounds are mixed with room temperature water, then left to sit from about three to 24 hours, depending on the equipment used, before the solids are filtered out. Most of the time, cold brew recipes require a higher coffee-to-water ratio: one part coffee to four parts tepid water, which is less compared to the ratio for a hot brew. When the grounds are removed, you are left with a black coffee concentrate that is thinned with either milk or water before it is served. Hot brew coffee is prepared with equipment like Chemex Coffeemakers, a French press, the moka pot, or a Vietnamese coffee filter. To make hot brew coffee, hot water is poured over a bed of coffee grounds at a general proportion of 1 oz. coffee to 8 oz. hot water. For a more home-friendly version, use two level tablespoons per one cup of water. This produces coffee that is separated from the grounds. Hot brew coffee is ideally consumed immediately after it has been made."
https://food.news/2019-01-28-the-skins-of-these-fruits-contain-many-health-benefits.html,Don’t throw it away! The skins of these fruits contain many health benefits,0,"Advertisement When you’re eating fruit, it’s second nature to throw away the peel, especially if you’re snacking on bananas or oranges. But did you know that eating certain fruit peels offer many health benefits? Like the fleshy insides of fruits, the peel or skin is also full of various nutrients. Below is a list of fruit peels that you can eat to boost your overall health. Apple peels store about one-third of the fruit’s nutrient content. An unpeeled raw apple has at least 332 percent more vitamin K, 142 percent more vitamin A, 115 percent more vitamin C, 20 percent more calcium, and around 19 percent more potassium than a peeled apple. Additionally, you lose half the apple’s fiber when you remove the peel. Eating a peeled apple only nets you 2.1 grams of fiber, instead of 4.4 grams. According to the Journal of Molecular Structure, apple skin also has antioxidants that can help fight free radicals that destroy cells in the body. Bananas are full of potassium. The yellow fruit also contains high levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter linked to appetite and mood. Bananas also contain both soluble and insoluble fiber. This means snacking on an unpeeled banana can help you feel fuller and relieve any minor gastrointestinal problems. Banana peels are easier to eat if you wait for the fruit to ripen, which will bring out the peels’ underlying sugary taste. You can either eat ripe banana peel on its own to get all its antioxidants, fiber, or nutrients, or you can cook with it. Try pureeing a small portion of sliced peels and add it into desserts, like cake. Guava is full of vitamins A and C. Guava peel also contains dietary fiber that is good for your digestive health. This nutritious fruit also has antioxidants and potassium. The dietary fiber in unpeeled guava can help promote healthy bowel movements and prevent constipation. In fact, consuming one guava will provide 12 percent of your recommended daily intake (RDI) of fiber. Snacking on guavas, which only have only 37 calories per fruit, can also help you lose weight. Eat this fruit if you want to feel full longer. If the thought of eating an unpeeled kiwi seems unappealing, remove the hairs on the surface of the skin before you consume the fruit. Kiwi skin, which is good for digestion and heart health, is also full of antioxidants and vitamin C. Kiwi skin is nutrient-dense. The results of a study revealed that eating kiwi skin can triple your fiber intake, compared to eating peeled kiwi. Add whole kiwis to a smoothie and make a nutritious and delicious fruity drink. Oranges have about 136 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C. This vitamin is necessary for the formation of collagen in your skin. A potent antioxidant, vitamin C also helps boost iron absorption in the body. If you’re not sure how to eat orange peels, brew them with warm water. Let it steep for several minutes so the vitamin dissolves, then drink the orange peel tea. (Related: Nine Good Reasons to Eat Orange Peels.) Alternatively, you can: Citrus fruit peels, such as lemons and oranges, also contain vitamins A and B, along with minerals like calcium and selenium. Orange peels also contain fiber and two flavonoids called nobiletin and tangeretin. These flavonoids may have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. The next time you’re snacking on these fruits, save the peel and cook with it or eat it right away to enjoy its nutritional benefits.

https://food.news/2019-01-28-fix-bloating-and-heartburn-with-these-easy-to-digest-foods.html,Fix bloating and heartburn with these easy-to-digest foods,0,"Advertisement Digestive issues like bloating or heartburn can be inconvenient and even painful, but knowing what kinds of food to eat can ease the discomfort that they cause. If you often suffer from these conditions, add more easy-to-digest foods to your diet. Various digestive problems like bloating, Crohn’s disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or indigestion can be treated by consuming foods that require “less digestive effort from your body.” The foods listed below are nutritious, and most importantly, they are easy on the digestive system. Some individuals may have trouble digesting nuts and seeds, which contain anti-nutrients. Thankfully, you can deactivate these gut-harming nutrients. When nuts and seeds are “activated” or soaked, the anti-nutrients in the skins of these foods are broken down and rinsed away. Soak the following nuts and seeds to make gut-friendly meals or snacks: Compared to cooked fruits, raw fruits have more enzymes and nutrients. If you have a digestive issue, your body will have trouble breaking down raw fruits. Cooking fruits give you a head start on digestion by making the food easier to break down. Always select non-citrus fruits because they are less likely to trigger reflux symptoms compared to acidic fruits. The following cooked fruits are easy to digest: To improve your digestion, peel and cook these fruits over low to medium heat. High heat can make them boil, which will increase their sugar content. Most fruits can be cooked on low to medium heat for 5-10 minutes, or until they start to break down. Take note that apples must cook longer compared to berries. Raw vegetables are good for you, but they can cause stomachaches in certain individuals. Raw vegetables have more fiber, unlike cooked produce. Cooking vegetables helps breaks down fiber, which makes them easier to digest. Here are some vegetables that can help ease indigestion when cooked: To make vegetables easier on your gut, cook them by roasting, sautéing, or steaming. People with digestive problems have difficulty breaking down red meat. If you want to relieve your stomach issues, eat eggs, poultry, and seafood. These foods are easier to digest and they require fewer enzymes, which means less gas or intestinal pains. Poultry and seafood are also easier for your body to process, unlike fattier cuts of meat. Easy-to-digest meats and proteins include: When you’re already bloated or gassy, avoid foods that can make your condition worse. The foods listed below are harder to break down compared to a regular meal, especially if you’re already diagnosed with a health condition prone to digestive problems. Cruciferous vegetables are chock-full of vitamins and minerals, but they also have a sulfuric quality that can cause severe digestive problems, even if they are cooked. (Related: The 5 Foods You May Want to be Avoiding in Your Diet.) Avoid these vegetables if you have digestive issues: Some people have trouble digesting foods that contain saturated fat, which requires more enzymes to break down than poultry. Some kinds of meat have a higher fat content that can cause discomfort if you have gallbladder issues or other low enzyme levels. If you have sensitive digestion, eliminate the following meats from your diet to ease your condition: Fruits are full of antioxidants and vitamins, but you may have trouble digesting them if they aren’t fully ripe or if you’re also eating the peel or skin of the fruit. Avoid eating these unripe fruits: As mentioned above, nuts and seeds have anti-nutrients. These proteins are designed to protect the plants from being destroyed in the wild. However, these anti-nutrients don’t automatically go away when nuts and seeds are harvested. To neutralize them, most nuts and seeds must soak for several hours or even one whole day. Keep in mind that beans and grains also have anti-nutrients that are difficult to digest. Unless you’re soaking these nuts and seeds, avoid eating them: If you have digestive issues, making small sacrifices can help prevent or relieve bloating or indigestion. Add these easy-to-digest foods to your diet to improve quality of life and address your digestive problems.

https://food.news/2019-01-27-mental-health-benefits-of-ginger.html,Here’s what research shows about the mental health benefits of ginger,0,"Advertisement Ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory that also offers other health benefits. In fact, the versatile plant can even help boost your mental health. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) comes from the rhizome or root of a flowering plant native to China, but the spice can grow in any area that is warm and humid. Aside from its use as a natural remedy for digestive disorders, ginger can also be used to address arthritis, memory loss and dementia, and muscle aches and pains. Thanks to scientific research, experts are beginning to understand how ginger works. To date, research has identified over 100 compounds in ginger. More than 50 of these are antioxidants, which is crucial to brain health since the organ is vulnerable to free radical damage. Ginger is often used as an anti-inflammatory, making it a popular natural remedy for arthritis. The plant’s anti-inflammatory property can also help people with brain disorders like ADHD, Alzheimer’s, anxiety, brain fog, and depression, which are often associated with chronic inflammation of the brain. Experts believe that ginger’s anti-inflammatory effects on the brain are due to two unique compounds called 6-shogaol and 10-gingerol. Like the Indian spice turmeric, ginger also has a compound called curcumin. This compound is a natural antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral. Curcumin is a potent herbal brain supplement ingredient that can help address anxiety, brain aging, depression, and neurodegenerative diseases. (Related: What Happens To Your Body When You Start Eating Ginger Every Day.) Your body is constantly under attack from oxidative stress. Oxygen in the body splits into single atoms with unpaired electrons, and electrons can often be found in pairs. These atoms, called free radicals, scavenge the body to find other electrons so they can become a pair. When these atoms are paired, they cause damage to cells, DNA, and proteins. Studies show that free radicals are linked to diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, atherosclerosis, cancer, and Parkinson’s, among others. Your brain is prone to free radical damage since it requires a lot of oxygen. Free radicals are caused by common factors like: Antioxidants in ginger can also protect the brain from further damage and memory loss after a stroke. Ginger increases the level of two of the most important brain chemicals: dopamine and serotonin. Depression is strongly associated with deficient levels of both chemicals. Dopamine is called the “motivation molecule” because it helps you focus and be productive. Dopamine is also in charge of your pleasure-reward system. Meanwhile, serotonin is known as the “happiness molecule” because it helps sustain a positive mood. The spice is traditionally used to treat memory loss and dementia and research has determined that ginger can help improve other cognitive functions besides memory. According to a study, healthy adults given dried ginger supplements showed improvements in attention, reaction time, and working memory. People with diabetes also rely on ginger as a natural remedy because it can help control blood sugar, especially if you are diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Ginger has antioxidants called gingerols that enhance insulin sensitivity and prevent certain neurological diabetic complications. Ginger is an effective remedy that can minimize the pain of migraine headaches. The spice has similar effects to sumatriptan, a commonly prescribed migraine drug that narrows blood vessels to the brain. But unlike sumatriptan, which is associated with negative side effects, ginger can relieve migraines without any side effects. Ginger, which comes in many forms, can be used as a food and as a supplement. Ginger supplements are available as capsules, crystals, essential oils, extracts, loose powder, and tinctures. A typical dose of ginger is one gram, and the best way to ingest this dose is by taking two ginger capsules. Most supplements contain at 500 milligrams (mg) per capsule. Below are some ginger dosage equivalents: When consumed as a food, especially fresh, ginger is considered very safe with little to no side effects. However, when too much ginger is consumed in other forms, especially powdered ginger, it may cause side effects such as bloating, gas, heartburn, and nausea. Ginger also functions as a blood thinner. Avoid taking it as a supplement if you take blood-thinning medication such as warfarin. If you take diabetes or high blood pressure medications, talk to a healthcare professional to determine adjustments to your medication if you want to take supplemental ginger. Ginger is a versatile herbal remedy that can help relieve digestive upset, and it also offers various benefits for brain health and function. Add fresh ginger to your diet or take it as a supplement to enjoy its many benefits and improve both your physical and mental well-being.

https://food.news/2019-01-26-nutritional-recommendations-age-related-macular-degeneration.html,It’s possible: Nutritional recommendations that prevent age-related macular degeneration,0,"Advertisement Saffron is a highly-prized spice with many uses. However, according to several studies, the spice can also be used to reduce your risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. Macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in adults aged 50 and older. In the U.S., over 11 million older Americans have some degree of macular degeneration linked to aging. At least 30 percent of individuals aged 75 have the eye condition in the country. Thankfully, studies have shown that some plant carotenoids can help lower your risk of developing macular degeneration or even delay its progression. Some studies have also determined that you can boost your eye health by taking at least 20 milligrams (mg) of saffron extract. Macular degeneration occurs when a person is exposed to ultraviolet light and visible light. The condition can also be caused by chemical stresses from too much glucose or oxygen in the bloodstream. These factors can make the retinal light-sensing cells break down. If you are continually exposed to these factors, you can eventually suffer from vision loss and blindness. To prevent degeneration, you need to preserve the structural integrity of the macula. You can do this by taking saffron supplements that can help protect the macula and prevent the breakdown of the light-sensitive cells at its center. Thanks to these benefits, saffron can help address the root cause of age-related macular degeneration. In an initial saffron study, patients who were in the early stages of age-related macular degeneration were given either a placebo or 20 milligrams (mg) per day of saffron. The study findings determined that the improvements in eye responses to light were noticeably stronger in the group that took saffron. This suggests that saffron intake is associated with healthier retinal cells. (Related: Saffron cures macular degeneration.) According to the results of a second saffron study, participants who took saffron had stronger visual acuity, that is, sharpness in distance vision. The researchers noted that saffron supplementation helped improve the light-sensing abilities of the eyes and delay the progression of macular degeneration. After three months, volunteers from the second study “could see another full line on the eye chart.” The researchers who conducted the second study said that taking 20 mg of saffron per day also had longer-term health effects. They found that after 14 months, participants could see two more additional lines on an eye chart. Researchers suggested that longer term supplementation of saffron may offer more benefits for eye health. If you wish to improve your eye health, increase your intake of the nutrient alpha-carotene. Individuals who have high levels of alpha-carotene in their systems have about a 32 percent lower risk of advanced age-related macular degeneration. Increase your intake of foods with alpha-carotene, and take saffron extracts together with other key retina-strengthening nutrients to keep your eyes healthy. Keep in mind that the benefits of saffron and alpha-carotene are boosted by the intake of nutrients such as astaxanthin, cyanidin-3-glucoside, lutein, and zeaxanthin are taken. The following foods contain nutrients that can boost the benefits of saffron and alpha-carotene: Saffron is a fragrant spice used in cooking and it comes from the crocus flower (Crocus sativus). In traditional medicine, saffron was used to treat health conditions like: You can read more articles about saffron and other superfoods that can boost eye health at Superfoods.news."
https://food.news/2019-01-26-taking-a-closer-look-at-how-ayurvedic-diet-prevents-cancer.html,Taking a closer look at how the Ayurvedic diet prevents cancer,0,"Advertisement Ayurvedic seasonal eating involves food consumption that is both physically and energetically aligned with a particular time of year. However, as seasons change, most people adopt the Standard American Diet (SAD) instead, which is often linked to increased rates of conditions like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and neurological disorders. To address this alarming concern, experts are advocating an eating plan called the Ayurvedic diet, which can help lower cancer risk. Ayurveda, a traditional Hindu system based on preventative health, is concerned with harmonizing all aspects of a person’s mind, body, and spirit. Ayurveda aims to balance the physical body, which is made up of five natural elements: fire, water, air, earth, and ether (space). These elements express themselves as doshas, or primary elements and energies that exist in the body. The three doshas are the Vata, Pitta, and Kapha doshas. Practitioners of Ayurveda believe that each person will express the doshas in their own unique way. The dosha also correspond to specific functions in the body. If your doshas are unbalanced, you can develop diseases. On the other hand, balancing these can boost your health. Ayurvedic Ritucharya is a systematic method that balances the doshas through eating habits. These eating habits are designed to help you become aligned with the rhythms of nature, which are also your own natural rhythms. In Ritucharya, each season coincides with to the Dakshinayana, or the gradual movement of the earth around the sun. Meanwhile, seasonal changes are related to particular tastes and changes in the doshas. To illustrate, the summer months are associated with an “accumulation” and an “aggravation” of Pitta. This can cause common summertime aggravations like fevers, inflammation, and skin rashes. Ayurvedic Ritucharya recommends the consumption of Pitta-calming foods during the hot summer months, like fruits and vegetables, ghee (considered “tridoshic” in Ayurveda), sweet foods, and astringent and bitter tastes (e.g., lemon and coconut water). However, even the birthplace of Ayurveda isn’t immune to the negative side effects of the SAD diet. In 2011, a report published in AYU, the international quarterly journal for research in Ayurveda, revealed that the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified India as a country at risk of having “most of the lifestyle disorders in the near future.” To improve unhealthy eating habits, you can follow Ayurvedic Ritucharya or consume more organic and in-season produce. Below are four reasons why eating fresh and organic produce from your region is good for your overall well-being. The only downside of buying local organic produce is its shorter shelf-life. However, this is a small price to pay since you are consuming nutritious food that is also free from pesticides and GMOs. If you want to lower your cancer risk, try following the Ayurvedic diet and consume more in season, organic produce.

https://food.news/2019-01-23-does-green-tea-really-deserve-its-health-halo.html,Does green tea really deserve its health halo? Experts say yes,0,"Advertisement Whether you’re a green tea enthusiast or you drink tea occasionally to cut back on your caffeine intake, you’ve probably heard that this kind of tea is one of the most beneficial drinks out there. While not all of the claims listed below are accurate, health experts confirm that green tea is a healthy drink that can boost your overall well-being. In an article on Good Housekeeping (GH), Nutrition Director Jacklyn London helps debunk 10 claims about green tea. London also confirms some of the health benefits of the popular superfood. Green tea and matcha are two different things. Matcha is still part of the green tea “family,” but it undergoes a slightly different farming process. Matcha is consumed in powder form instead of whole leaf form, which means matcha is a more concentrated version of green tea. Choose matcha if you want to consume the higher caffeine and theanine version of green tea. Green tea can boost your metabolism. Some small-scale studies have determined a connection between an increased metabolic rate and the consumption of at least four cups of green tea daily. London noted that “the only truly variable factor in your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is increasing your lean body mass, a.k.a. building muscle.” To boost your metabolism for the long-term, start strength training. This kind of training is essential for bone, immune, and muscle function, and these three factors can help support metabolism over time. Green tea can burn belly fat. This claim is false, especially since there is no food or drink that can “spot train” specific body parts. Once you make changes to your diet for a new plan where you burn more energy than you consume, chances are you’ll be burning off some additional fat mass, especially around your stomach. Beware of green tea beverages, such as green tea “flavored” drinks, sparkling green teas with added sugar, and sugary lattes. These sugary beverages are often associated with weight gain over time, particularly near your abdomen. Green tea can lower cancer risk. Research data has confirmed that green tea does contain antioxidant compounds that can help fight cancer. But other plant-based diets are always associated with a minimized cancer risk, along with other chronic diseases, like diabetes and heart disease. Eating lots of vegetables and drinking unsweetened green tea ensures that your diet contains polyphenolic compounds, a type of antioxidant that can help lower your risk of developing chronic diseases by boosting the cellular function of tissues, which helps prevent the growth of cancer cells. Green tea can promote weight loss. A person who often drinks sugary beverages like energy drinks, soda, or sweetened coffee and tea regularly will lose weight once they switch to unsweetened green tea. The number one source of added sugar and added calories in the American diet is sugar-sweetened beverages, so always choose a calorie-free alternative. To lose weight for the long-term, make healthier choices and stay hydrated with sugar-free drinks. Green tea can prevent heart disease. In population studies, individuals who often consume unsweetened green tea “are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease later in life.” However, a lot of these population studies are specific to region and genetics. To illustrate, studies conducted in Japan and Taiwan, where green tea is “consumed regularly and consistently,” often involve people who could have a genetic predisposition to the benefits of green tea. Meanwhile, population studies conducted in the U.S. and in other countries suggest that there is a connection between the consumption of unsweetened versions of any kind of tea with better cardiovascular health and minimized chances of developing other types of chronic diseases, particularly those linked with obesity. (Related: Daily green tea consumption found to slash dementia risk by up to 86%.) Green tea has anti-aging properties. Green tea has antioxidants that scavenge for free-radicals in the cells of the body. These antioxidants can help protect and prevent damage to tissues, such as skin. However, no single food or beverage can cure cancer. Health experts from the GH Health, Beauty and Environmental Labs noted that green tea catechins called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) can help protect skin from UV damage. EGCG is a natural polyphenol antioxidant that can also help prevent cell damage. Green tea helps lower blood sugar. Drinking unsweetened green tea can help lower blood sugar. Just make sure you’re not drinking green tea-flavored drinks that are full of sweeteners. Green tea is caffeine-free. While this claim isn’t always true, some types of green tea are caffeine-free. If you’re trying to cut down on coffee, green tea is a great alternative because it has a lower caffeine content. A cup of home-brewed coffee contains at least 100 milligrams (mg) of caffeine. On the other hand, tea only contains about 25 to 50 mg, depending on the type of tea and brew strength. Green tea has calming properties. Green tea’s calming effect may vary. It contains L-theanine, an amino acid that is associated with alertness and mood-enhancement. Study findings show that l-theanine consumption is linked to “reduced anxiety and improved focus.” This benefit is highly based on personal tolerance, so skip the green tea if you’re sensitive to caffeine. Drink green tea regularly to enjoy the benefits above and to boost your overall health. Read more articles about healthier food options at SuperFoods.news."
https://food.news/2019-01-23-veggies-and-fruits-for-psychology-wellbeing.html,Incorporating more vegetables and fruits in your diet causes IMMEDIATE improvements to your psychological well-being,0,"Advertisement Following a healthy diet offers many benefits for your overall well-being. According to a study, eating more fruits and vegetables can also be good for your mental health. The study, which was published in the journal American Journal of Public Health (AJPH), was a collaborative effort by researchers from the University of Queensland in Australia and the University of Warwick in England. The results of the study suggest that eating at least eight servings of fruits and vegetables per day is linked to “immediate improvements to psychological well-being.” According to the researchers, incorporating more vegetables and fruits in your diet can help lower your risk of depression and increase happiness levels. For the study, the researchers analyzed data from a survey completed by more than 12,000 participants. The volunteers were selected at random and assessed in terms of their psychological well-being. They were also told to keep a food journal. The volunteers who consumed little to no fruits or vegetables on a regular basis were instructed to follow a plan that included at least eight servings of fresh produce daily. The researchers observed significant increases in the well-being of the patients who followed the new diet. The improvement in the mental health of these patients happened almost immediately in some cases and continued for more than two years. The researchers noted that the healthy diet for managing depression offered more benefits when the participants consumed more servings of fruits and vegetables on average. The overall happiness and well-being of the patients increased when they were given an additional portion of vegetables or fruits per day, and the effect was observed when they were given about eight servings of fresh food. Data from the study showed that while consuming more fruits and vegetables can improve a person’s heart health or prevent cancer and heart disease in the long-term, it can boost their happiness levels more quickly. (Related: Have you heard of the MIND diet? Learn how to boost your mental health with this new healthy eating plan.) The study results were adjusted if the participants’ personal circumstances or incomes changed to influence study results. However, the findings suggest that managing depression with a healthy diet is a more effective and safer choice compared to the use of prescription drugs, which are often associated with negative side effects. These findings are relevant, especially since some studies have determined that the typical Western diet doesn’t include enough fruits and vegetables. Additionally, a Western diet is often full of carbohydrates, processed foods, and sugar. A diet full of foods associated with increasing the risk of depression can only spell trouble for your mental health. This is the first study of its kind to show that eating fresh fruits and vegetables regularly can effectively fight depression. The researchers added that there is a connection antioxidant-rich foods and optimism, which could be the result of higher levels of carotenoids in the blood.

https://food.news/2019-01-22-bipolar-patients-who-eat-a-lot-of-processed-meats-are-more-prone-to-mania.html,Bipolar patients who eat a lot of processed meats are more prone to mania,0,"Advertisement An improper diet has consequences for your physical health. However, a study has confirmed that the consumption of processed meats can also negatively affect your mental health. The study was published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry. Earlier research has determined that psychiatric disorders are usually aggravated by a poor diet. The study, which was conducted by researchers from Johns Hopkins Medicine, has revealed that the consumption of cured and processed meats may cause mania, especially in individuals who have already been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The researchers examined more than 1,000 participants, and the group included persons both with and without psychiatric disorders. The researchers studied the diets of the volunteers, and the findings showed that people who often consume foods such as hot dogs, jerky, salami, and other processed meats with nitrates had a tendency to be in an abnormally elevated mood state. This “manic state” is characterized by symptoms such as hyperactivity, persistent insomnia, and unfounded euphoria. Other cured and processed foods that contain nitrates include: The study results determined that individuals hospitalized for manic episodes were more than thrice as likely to have consumed nitrate-cured meats compared to those who have never been diagnosed with a serious psychiatric disorder. The researchers have also confirmed that eating certain kinds of food can impact gut bacteria composition and could have a major role in several psychiatric conditions. In a separate study, scientists analyzed the correlation between nitrates and mania using rat models. The rats in the study were fed a similar ratio of food with nitrates as a human might consume. The test results revealed that the gut bacteria of the rats that ingested food with nitrates had different patterns than the subjects that didn’t consume the same kind of food. The researchers also reported differences in their brains that resembled bipolar disorder in humans. This highlights the need for the psychiatric community of healthcare providers to acknowledge the importance of improving one’s diet. While the cause of many psychiatric disorders remains unknown, genes and family history are often considered factors for these conditions. Researchers are still exploring environmental factors, such as diet, to determine if what a person eats can affect their mental health. (Related: Effects of the Mediterranean-style diet on depression, mental health.) Research on nitrates and mental health confirms that certain diets, and possibly the amounts and types of bacteria in the gut, can trigger mania and other disorders that affect the brain. Manic states can endanger individuals because they can make people prone to delusional thinking and risky behavior. Manic states can last weeks or months, and in a lot of cases, manic individuals may need hospitalization. This is alarming since bipolar disorder affects at least one to three percent of the population. For decades, nitrates have been used to cure and preserve meat. Recent studies have confirmed that the regular consumption of cured meats is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and some types of cancer. To avoid nitrates in food, make lifestyle changes and follow a healthy diet that includes organic meat, fruits, and vegetables. Proper nutrition can promote brain and cellular health, hormonal balance, and an ideal body chemistry. These factors can help improve your mental health and significantly minimize your risk of developing psychiatric disorders.

https://food.news/2019-01-22-fennel-reduces-postmenopausal-symptoms.html,Study confirms the effectiveness of fennel for reducing postmenopausal symptoms,0,"Advertisement Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is a herb that is used to infuse dishes with a delicate flavor similar to anise. The herb possesses medicinal properties, and a study has revealed that fennel can be used to help reduce the symptoms of postmenopause. The study was published in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS). Fennel is traditionally used to treat different health issues like digestion and premenstrual symptoms. According to the press release of the NAMS study, fennel is also an effective remedy that can also be used to manage postmenopause symptoms that include anxiety, hot flashes, sleeplessness, and vaginal dryness without any serious side effects. For the study, researchers conducted a small trial that involved 79 Iranian women. The researchers completed the study in Tehran, Iran, since the average age of women at menopause in the country is younger (48.2 years) compared to the U.S. (51 years). The female participants, who were aged 45 to 60 years old , were given soft capsules containing 100 milligrams (mg) of fennel twice a day for a period of for eight weeks. The researchers compared improvements between the women from the intervention and placebo groups at four, eight, and 10 weeks. The results of the trial revealed a significant statistical difference between the two groups. The study findings suggest that fennel is a natural and safe treatment that can effectively minimize menopausal symptoms without severe side effects. This study is one of the first clinical studies that analyzed the benefits of fennel for managing menopause symptoms. Some of the most common symptoms of menopause include: An earlier study has already confirmed that the beneficial herb can be used to manage premenopause symptoms. The findings from these studies have helped identify safer complementary and alternative medicines that can be used to manage menopause symptoms, and these remedies have caught the attention of women who are interested in risk-free alternatives to hormone therapy (HT). HT, which is one of the most effective treatments for managing most menopausal symptoms, is often associated with negative side effects that deter women from resorting to this kind of treatment. Other women prefer herbal medicine because they aren’t suitable candidates for HT, or they want to avoid the side effects of the treatment. The herb fennel has essential oils with phytoestrogenic properties. Phytoestrogens are chemicals in plants that have similar properties to estrogen and they can be used to cure many menopausal symptoms. (Related: The amazing benefits of fennel seeds.) The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Nutrient Database, reports that a raw fennel bulb that weighs 234 grams (g) has: Fennel also contains: Additionally, fennel is rich in dietary nitrates.

https://food.news/2019-01-19-reishi-strengthens-immune-system.html,Reishi mushroom show tremendous promise in strengthening the immune system,0,"Advertisement Reishi mushrooms (Ganoderma lucidum), also known as lingzhi mushrooms, are commonly used in traditional medicine to address various health conditions. According to research data, the potent mushrooms can also be used to boost the immune system. Researchers believe that reishi mushrooms have powerful antiviral properties that can help strengthen the immune system. Consuming the mushrooms may also help “optimize immune function and lower the risk of many diseases.” As people get older, they become more susceptible to immunosenescence. This condition is associated with the gradual decline of the immune system due to aging. The immune system helps fight bacteria, destroy emerging cancer cells, and turn off the inflammatory response in the body once threats have been eliminated. However, because of immunosenescence, the elderly are at greater risk of developing health problems caused by inflammation and infections, which may cause conditions such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. In response to the growing concern about the health implications of immunosenescence, researchers are turning to recently discovered complex compounds in reishi mushrooms that can “help regulate and support an aging immune system, reduce inflammation, and prevent heart disease and cancer.” Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine use reishi mushrooms to treat different conditions because the ancient remedy allegedly has healing and antiviral properties. Due to these qualities, the mushroom is even called “mushroom of immortality.” Through modern technology, scientists have been able to learn how and the reishi mushroom can boost the immune system and supporting better health as people age. They noted that the potent mushroom has different “‘pharmacologically active compounds” that can safely and effectively slow down the aging process and boost overall health. Continual inflammation is one of the markers of different conditions associated with aging, such as bone and joint disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration. According to studies, reishi mushrooms, which have anticancer properties, can be used to prevent cancers of the breast, cervix, colon, lungs, ovaries, and prostate. (Related: Reishi mushroom powder is an effective treatment for mouth ulcers.) The anticancer properties of the mushroom help strengthen immune system cells so the body can effectively expel invaders. The mushroom supports B and T lymphocyte and “natural killer” cell development, allowing the immune system to more effectively target and destroy cancer cells and viral invaders. Additionally, reishi mushroom extract can deactivate carcinogens, inhibit cancer cell proliferation, and promote apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells. Some studies suggest that reishi mushrooms can also help fight depression and fatigue, boost heart health, and control blood sugar. Researchers are currently trying to determine the potential medical applications of the antiviral and healing compounds in these mushrooms. A strong immune system is crucial to your overall health, and emerging scientific data suggest that reishi mushroom compounds may help boost immune function. With continued research, health experts may one day determine how reishi mushrooms can address the side effects of immunosenescence so people can remain in the peak of health even as they grow older. Unlike other foods or supplements, reishi mushroom dosages can vary based on which type of mushroom is consumed. Reishi mushroom extract can also be made into a tea and consumed daily. Always consult an herbal medicinal expert before you start taking reishi mushrooms to determine the proper dosage for your condition.

https://food.news/2019-01-19-fruits-that-raise-blood-platelet-levels.html,These fruits found to raise blood platelet levels in patients with dengue fever,0,"Advertisement When a person has dengue fever, they can experience symptoms like thrombocytopenia, or low platelet levels. This condition can range from mild to severe, depending on its underlying cause. To raise your platelet levels, you can consume healing fruits like kiwi or papaya. Thrombocytopenia is a common symptom of dengue, and it is characterized by the drastic decrease of platelets in the blood. If a patient experiences low platelet levels because of dengue virus, they may feel dizzy and weak. A dengue patient with thrombocytopenia may also feel pain in their joints. You can naturally increase the platelet levels of a person with dengue fever by feeding them the healing fruits listed below. These four fruits can be processed into juice drinks if the patient is too weak to consume them as is. Juicing the fruits also makes it easier to absorb their nutritional content. Blood is made up of different types of cells that float in a liquid called plasma. The three types of blood cells include red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (or thrombocytes). When skin is injured or broken, platelets clump together and form clots to stop the bleeding. However, if you don’t have enough platelets in your blood, your body is unable to form clots. If you have a low platelet count, you are suffering from a condition called thrombocytopenia. Some people with the condition experience severe bleeding, and they can die if they don’t receive medical treatment immediately. However, other individuals with thrombocytopenia may not experience any symptoms. In some cases, a low platelet count is caused by a medical condition like leukemia or certain medications. Treatment will often address the condition causing the thrombocytopenia. The common symptoms of a low platelet count include: Severe cases of thrombocytopenia may involve internal bleeding that includes symptoms such as: Consult a healthcare professional immediately if you experience any signs of internal bleeding. In very rare cases, thrombocytopenia may cause bleeding in the brain. If you have a low platelet count and experience headaches or any neurological problems, seek medical attention right away.

https://food.news/2019-01-17-5-health-benefits-of-eating-pineapples.html,"From preventing bloating to reduced cancer risk, here are 5 health benefits of eating pineapples",0,"Advertisement The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a nutritious tropical fruit, and you should consume fresh pineapples if you want to keep your bones healthy and lower your risk of developing cancer. The best way to reap the benefits of this fruit is to drink fresh pineapple juice and eat organic fruits. Listed below are the five health benefits of eating pineapples. Pineapples are full of nutrients and healthy antioxidants. These molecules can help the body fight oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when there are too many free radicals in the body. Free radicals interact with the body’s cells, and they cause damage linked to chronic inflammation, a weakened immune system, and various diseases. The fruit is also full of antioxidants called flavonoids and phenolic acids. (Related: 8 natural remedies that can cure preventable diseases in the U.S.) Pineapple contains bromelain, a group of digestive enzymes that can help reduce bloating in the stomach. Bromelain acts as proteases that can break down protein molecules into their building blocks, like amino acids and small peptides. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports that the bromelain in pineapples can also help minimize the inflammation and swelling that occurs in some conditions like arthritis flare-ups, sinusitis, and sore throat. Consume pineapples if you’re recovering from an infection or injury. Bromelain can also hasten healing time and minimize bruising, pain, and swelling after injuries and surgery. The bromelain in pineapples can prevent blood clots. These enzymes can help reduce excessive coagulation of the blood, making the fruit the perfect snack for frequent fliers and other individuals who are at risk for blood clots. Cancer is a chronic disease that is linked to uncontrolled cell growth, and the progression of the disease is often associated with oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. The results of some studies suggest that pineapple and its compounds can help lower cancer risk since they can minimize oxidative stress and reduce inflammation. These compounds include bromelain, and test-tube studies have revealed that bromelain can suppress the growth of breast cancer cells and stimulate cell death. Other findings have determined that bromelain can “stimulate the immune system to produce molecules that make white blood cells more effective at suppressing cancer cell growth and eliminating cancer cells.” Pineapple contains essential minerals like calcium and manganese that promotes bone health and strengthens connective tissue. Researchers from the University of Maryland Medical Center suggest that manganese helps prevent osteoporosis and ease symptoms of the bone disease by boosting improve overall bone and mineral density. A 5.8-ounce cup (165 grams [g]) of pineapple chunks only has 82.5 calories. The serving also has the following nutrients: Vitamin C is necessary for proper growth and development and a strong immune system. The vitamin can also promote the proper absorption of iron from the diet. Pineapples also have vitamins A and K, along with calcium, phosphorus, and zinc. Always consult a healthcare professional before you increase your intake of pineapples, especially if you have allergies or diabetes.

https://food.news/2019-01-17-cravings-and-lack-of-protein.html,Are you constantly craving salty or sweet foods? You may be lacking protein,0,"Advertisement If you’re not getting enough protein in your diet, you can experience symptoms such as hair loss or a craving for salty and sweet foods. But what can you do to ensure that you get enough protein in your diet? If you’re experiencing some of the symptoms below, you may be suffering from a protein deficiency. You need to include enough protein in your diet because it is a major component of every cell in your body. This crucial building block also makes up your hair, skin, nails, muscle, and cartilage. The body also needs protein so it can produce enzymes, hormones, and neurotransmitters, which are all required so your body can function normally. Per government guidelines, an average person’s protein consumption should be 0.8 grams (g) per kilogram (kg) of body weight. For the average sedentary woman, this is equivalent to 46 g of protein per day, or 56 g for men. If you eat meat, you can get protein from the following sources: These sources contain all the essential amino acids that the body needs to function properly. (Related: 21 Foods Richer in Protein Than an Egg.) If you’re a vegetarian, you can get protein from eggs, dairy, and whole grains. Pescatarians can also get protein from fish. Protein sources for vegans include beans or pulses (e.g., chickpeas, lentils, and soybeans), grains, soy foods, and whole grains (e.g., brown rice and quinoa). Add nuts and seeds with amino acids and essential fatty acids that are necessary for optimal health. Consume protein-rich foods daily and spread them out throughout a day to effectively build muscle. Since protein is a complex nutrient, it requires more energy to break down, unlike carbohydrates. Eating protein boosts your metabolic, which can promote weight loss. If you’re trying to lose weight, consuming healthy foods that contain protein can also curb cravings, make you feel fuller for longer, and reduce your appetite.

https://food.news/2019-01-16-vr-shows-how-perception-of-real-food-is-altered-by-surroundings.html,Food scientists use VR to show how our perception of real food is altered by our surroundings,0,"Advertisement When you’re eating, your meal doesn’t just involve the taste of the food that fills your belly. Eating also involves other senses like sight and smell. According to the results of a study on virtual reality (VR), people are also “influenced by the environment in which they eat.” For the study, which was published in the Journal of Food Science, food scientists from Cornell University used VR technology to demonstrate how an individual’s perception of real food can change because of their surroundings. Robin Dando, associate professor of food science and senior author of the study, explained that when a person eats, they perceive the taste and aroma of food along with sensory input from their surroundings, such as visual and auditory stimuli. It may even include certain memories evoked by their surroundings. For the study, researchers observed at least 50 panelists who used virtual reality headsets as they were fed three identical samples of blue cheese. The volunteers were then virtually placed in one of three VR environments: The panelists were then shown custom-recorded 360-degree videos. The study participants, who were unaware that they were given identical cheese samples, rated the pungency of the blue cheese considerably higher in the cow barn setting compared to when they were in the sensory booth or the virtual park bench. To control for the pungency results, the panelists also rated the saltiness of the three samples. The results showed that there was no statistical difference between them. Dando said that the project aims to develop an affordable and easy-to-implement method for adapting VR technology that can be utilized in food sensory evaluation. (Related: Virtual escape: Hospital in-patients using VR to alleviate boredom, stress, pain.) Your environment is also crucial to your eating experience. Dando noted that you eat in surroundings that can influence your perceptions of the food. He added that VR food sensory evaluation offers advantages such as convenience and flexibility, especially since it can reduce the cost and effort required to manually build physical environments. The findings suggest that VR can be used for this kind of testing since it allows participants to experience an immersive environment during testing. Dando concluded, “Visually, virtual reality imparts qualities of the environment itself to the food being consumed — making this kind of testing cost-efficient.” Sensory evaluation, also called sensory analysis, refers to “the process of evaluating consumer products using the five senses.” Through sensory analysis, consumer panels are organized to test various products before they are sold in stores. Using the results of these tests, manufacturers can determine whether or not a product will become popular among consumers. Food and drink companies often use sensory evaluation to test their products, and these companies ask consumer panels to test products while analysts record their responses. Panels may be chosen based on certain criteria, while others can be picked at random. However, a random sampling usually provides a better gauge of the general public. Using the data from panel responses, analysts make predictions that can help manufacturers improve their products. Consumer evaluation is crucial to determining how successful, or unsuccessful, a product can be. Through consumer evaluation, companies get feedback on a product before it is released to the public. There are three types of sensory evaluation: Browse other articles about the possible applications of virtual reality at VirtualReality.news."
https://food.news/2019-01-15-what-you-should-know-before-you-decide-to-eat-raw-garlic.html,What you should know before you decide to eat raw garlic,0,"Advertisement Garlic has a distinctive pungent odor. This can be off-putting for some people, while others are drawn to garlic’s aroma, especially when it’s used to make savory dishes. But did you know that eating garlic raw offers certain health benefits? Practitioners of folk medicine believe that chewing raw garlic helps release some active substances that can cure conditions such as: Some of these benefits have been confirmed by scientific research, and data has proven that garlic contains a beneficial compound called allicin. When fresh garlic is chopped, it releases the enzyme alliinase, which then results in the formation of allicin. Allicin breaks down to form healthy organosulfur compounds. It also possesses anti-fungal, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties, and chewing raw garlic regularly can help fight off harmful organisms that can cause various diseases. However, once garlic is cooked, heat may inactivate alliinase. Experts suggest crushing garlic and letting it stand for at least 10 minutes before cooking to let the alliinase work before heat inactivates it. Research has also determined that garlic contains amino acids, vitamins, and minerals that can boost your overall well-being. Data from a study, which was published in the journal Advances in Therapy, showed that consuming garlic regularly can help strengthen your immune system. (Related: Garlic is a safe, delicious, and inexpensive way to improve your health.) As a preventive measure, chew two cloves of garlic daily. This can also help boost your cardiovascular health. If you already have a cold and you want to avoid the negative side effects of prescription drugs, chew more than two garlic cloves daily until you feel better. Aside from strengthening your immune system, garlic also has other health benefits. Before you eat raw garlic or take garlic supplements, take note that it may cause some minor side effects such as: Consult a healthcare professional before you increase your garlic intake, especially since it can thin the blood. This can be risky for people with a bleeding disorder or those scheduled to undergo surgery. If you’re interested in reaping the benefits of eating raw garlic but are also wary of having bad breath, eat it with an apple. You can also drink a mix of apple vinegar, honey, and water after you chew on some garlic cloves. You can read more articles about the health benefits of eating garlic at FoodCures.news."
https://food.news/2019-01-15-not-all-fats-are-bad-for-you.html,Not all fats are bad for you – learn which ones you should include in your diet,0,"Advertisement If you’re trying to lose weight or make healthier dietary choices, you may be under the impression that all kinds of fats are bad for you. But this isn’t exactly true. There are four kinds of fats, and you actually need some of them to maintain your overall wellness. All fats share a similar chemical structure, which is a chain of carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms. However, the four kinds of fat differ from each other because of the length and shape of the carbon chain and the number of hydrogen atoms connected to the carbon atoms. Trans fats, the worst type of dietary fat, are produced due to hydrogenation. This turns healthy oils into solids, which keeps them from going rancid. Trans fats don’t have health benefits and there is no safe level of consumption for this kind of fat. It’s officially banned in the U.S. During the early part of the 20th century, trans fats were usually found in solid margarine and vegetable shortening. Food makers eventually discovered new ways to use partially hydrogenated vegetable oils to cook foods like commercial cookies and fast-food French fries. Eating food that contains a lot of trans fats increases the amount of “bad” low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in your bloodstream, and reduces the amount of “good” high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Trans fats cause inflammation, a condition associated with health problems like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and other chronic conditions. This kind of fat aggravates insulin resistance, and this raises your chance of developing Type 2 diabetes. Small amounts of trans fats are also bad for you. For every two percent of calories from trans fats that you eat daily, your heart disease risk goes up by a whopping 23 percent. The American diet contains a lot of saturated fats, especially if you love cheese, coconut oil, red meat, whole milk (along with other whole-milk dairy foods), commercially prepared baked goods and other food products. This kind of fat is solid at room temperature. “Saturated” refers to the number of hydrogen atoms surrounding each carbon atom. The chain of carbon atoms contains a lot of hydrogen atoms. In other words, it’s saturated with hydrogen. Even if they aren’t as bad as trans fats, consuming a lot of food full of saturated fats may increase total cholesterol. This is linked to the increase of LDL cholesterol that may cause blockages to form in arteries in the heart and other parts of the body. To prevent this, keep your consumption of saturated fats to below 10 percent of calories daily. Unlike saturated fats, the “good” fats in fish, nuts, seeds, and vegetables have fewer hydrogen atoms bonded to their carbon chains. Healthy fats remain liquid at room temperature. Beneficial fats are grouped into two broad categories: monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. (Related: Nuts may be tiny but they are powerhouses when it comes to improving your health.) Monounsaturated fat (oleic acid) has a single carbon-to-carbon double bond, which means it has two fewer hydrogen atoms compared to saturated fat. It has a bend at the double bond, which keeps the fat liquid at room temperature. Foods that are rich in monounsaturated fats include: In the 1960s, the results of the Seven Countries Study revealed that monounsaturated fat can be healthy. Data from the study showed that individuals who lived in Greece and other parts of the Mediterranean had a low rate of heart disease even if they followed a high-fat diet. Researchers discovered that this was because the main fat in their diet was olive oil, compared to countries that consumed a lot of saturated animal fat. The latter is linked to higher rates of heart disease. Olive oil is mostly made up of monounsaturated fat, which highlighted the benefits of the Mediterranean diet. There’s no recommended daily intake of monounsaturated fats, but the Institute of Medicine suggests using them whenever you can together with polyunsaturated fats instead of consuming foods that contain saturated and trans fats. Polyunsaturated fats are essentials fats, and this means they’re required for normal body function. However, the human body can’t produce this kind of fat. You need to consume food that contains polyunsaturated fats since they are required to build cell membranes and the covering of nerves. Additionally, they are crucial for blood clotting, inflammation, and muscle movement. Polyunsaturated fats have two or more double bonds in their carbon chain, and there are two main types: omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. The numbers indicate the distance between the beginning of the carbon chain and the first double bond. Both types have different health benefits. When you consume food that contains polyunsaturated fats instead of saturated fats or highly refined carbohydrates, you help lower harmful LDL cholesterol. This also improves your cholesterol profile and lowers blood pressure and triglyceride levels. Foods rich in omega-3s include canola oil, fatty fish (like salmon and sardines), flaxseeds, unhydrogenated soybean oil, and walnuts. Omega-3 fatty acids can help prevent and cure heart disease and stroke. Omega-6 fatty acids can also help prevent heart disease. Sources include linoleic acid and vegetable oils such as corn, safflower, soybean, sunflower, and walnut oils.

https://food.news/2019-01-14-eating-bright-yellow-foods-can-make-you-happy.html,Study reveals that eating bright yellow foods can make you happy,0,"Advertisement When you’re feeling sad, seeing a pop of color can help brighten your day. According to a U.K. study, eating yellow foods can also help improve your mood. The study, which was conducted by The Happy Egg Company, one of the largest free-range egg brands in the U.K.., gathered responses from about 1,000 survey participants. The researchers reported that the consumption of yellow foods releases significant levels of happy hormones since people often associate bright colors – like yellow – with joy. The findings showed that 70 percent of the participants associated yellow foods with the feeling of happiness. The top-ranking yellow food was a plate of omelettes, with 61 percent of the respondents reporting that it “made them the most cheerful.” Macaroni and cheese (56 percent) came in second, followed by pancakes (54 percent) and poached eggs (53 percent). Lemon cake (52 percent) also made it to the list. More than two-thirds of the participants want to see more yellow in their fridges, and 30 percent of the respondents associate yellow with happiness compared to other colors. (Related: How to increase your serotonin levels with strategic eating.) Psychologists posit that this is because people react positively to the color yellow from a young age, especially since it evokes “the warmth of sunshine and brightly [colored] children’s toys.” Experts also suggest that yellow resonates with the left side of the brain, which is associated with logic. The left side of the brain makes people think of yellow as a “fun and happy” color. Red foods came in second in the list, while brown foods ranked third. However, blueberries were the least popular food item because people associate blue with sadness. In the study, researchers also measured the response time of individuals who were answering questions about food colors and happiness. The findings revealed that when choosing yellow, the overall response time was at least 31 percent faster than any other color. Dr. David Lewis, a neuropsychologist, explained that while earlier findings have determined that color can affect emotions, the results of this study were surprising. The researchers didn’t expect that many yellow food groups “evoked such strong positive feelings as well as stimulating taste buds.” Yellow vegetables can do more than evoke happiness. Yellow veggies are full of antioxidants, vitamins, and other health-boosting components. Eat more of the yellow vegetables below to stay strong and healthy.

https://food.news/2019-01-14-boswellia-extract-has-healing-and-anti-inflammatory-properties.html,Boswellia extract exhibits profound healing and anti-inflammatory properties,0,"Advertisement Arthritis is the term for a debilitating condition that affects a person’s musculoskeletal system, and it is characterized by knots, painful and swollen joints, and stiffness in the affected parts of the body. It can severely affect a person’s ability to accomplish daily tasks, especially when their arthritis is flaring up. Thankfully, several studies have determined that a powerful herb with anti-inflammatory effects can help relieve arthritis. Boswellia extract comes from trees that grow in dry, mountainous areas in India, the Middle East, and Northern Africa. The tree that produces the extract is often used in traditional medicine because it has potent anti-inflammatory and healing qualities. There are 25 species of boswellia, but a certain plant called Boswellia serrata (Indian frankincense) has the most potent medicinal effects. Boswellia’s most powerful medicinal properties can be found in the tree resin, which has acids and compounds that can promote positive body chemistry and reactions, such as free radical-scavenging properties. This helps trigger the anti-inflammatory response in the body that’s associated with various healing effects. A person with arthritis can benefit from boswellia extract since it can help reduce pain, swelling, and other symptoms associated with various forms of the condition. Due to boswellia extract’s anti-inflammatory properties, medical professionals have started studying the plant’s potential to treat inflammatory conditions. To date, research suggests that the extract can be used to ease inflammatory diseases such as bursitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and tendonitis. Boswellia extract can also be used to help prevent autoimmune disease, certain types of cancer, and headaches. Additionally, the extract can improve muscle strength, hasten wound healing, and support skin health. Some of the factors that can affect the onset and progression of arthritis, a common inflammatory disease, include: Making certain lifestyle changes can help a person manage the side effects of arthritis, such as eating healthily, exercising regularly, losing weight (if needed), or taking medication for pain and inflammation. However, unlike prescription painkillers, boswellia can fight inflammation and the other symptoms of arthritis minus the adverse side effects of the former. Aside from addressing arthritis, boswellia extract can also treat conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and inflammation of the colon. The extract also has compounds that help protect the liver, regulate blood lipids, release blocks in the arteries, and relieve pain. (Related: Boswellia is a powerful anti-inflammatory herbal extract that can prevent cancer.) Data from a 2003 study determined that Boswellia serrata can help individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee. The study observed two groups: one that was given the extract and another that was given a placebo for eight weeks. The two groups were then reversed. The findings revealed that the participants who took the boswellia extract reported a considerable reduction in pain and swelling while comfort and flexibility improved. Volunteers who took the extract were also able to walk long distances. The studies that involved individuals with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis also reported that they experienced health benefits because of the extract. These findings are proof that boswellia extract can be the key to curing arthritis or developing a treatment that addresses its symptoms. There is currently no established ideal dosage for boswellia extract. However, studies have confirmed that it does possess analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Reports indicate that 150 milligrams (mg) to 400 mg per day can help relieve inflammation depending on an individual’s current health status. If you have arthritis and you’re currently taking other medications, consult a healthcare professional about possible drug interactions before taking boswellia extract.

https://food.news/2019-01-14-seed-oils-are-the-best-choice-for-people-looking-to-improve-their-cholesterol.html,Seed oils are the best choice for people looking to improve their cholesterol,0,"Advertisement According to a study, if you want to effectively lower your low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL or “bad” cholesterol) you must replace saturated fats with unsaturated fat. You can do this by switching from other kinds of cooking oil to healthier options such as seed oils. The study was published in the Journal of Lipid Research. Since there are many kinds of cooking oil to choose from, it can be hard to decide on a healthy option. A lot of studies which suggest both mono- and polyunsaturated fats are better for blood lipids than saturated fats replaced one food source at a time, and this can make it harder to identify which vegetable oils are good for heart health. Blood lipids refer to all the fatty substances found in your blood, like cholesterol and triglycerides. If you have too much cholesterol (fat) in your blood, you have a greater risk of having a heart attack. To address this dilemma, Lukas Schwingshackl, a researcher at the German Institute of Human Nutrition, has turned to sophisticated statistical tools to verify the findings of research concerning cooking oils. For the study, the researcher team used network meta-analysis. This emerging technique helped “extract insight from published studies on the effect of various dietary oils on blood lipids.” The study findings imply that seed oils are the best choice for individuals who want to improve their cholesterol. Because of the lack of a large study comparing all available oils, Schwingshackl et al. constructed a network meta-analysis to illustrate how different oils and solid fats have been matched up. To do this, they collated 55 studies from the 1980s that analyzed the effects of consuming the same amount of calories from two or more different oils on the blood lipids of volunteers. The studies included in the analysis must compare the effect of two or more oils or fats (from a list of 13 options) on participants’ LDL, or other blood lipids (e.g., total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins [HDL-cholesterol], or triglycerides) for at least three weeks or longer. Schwingshackl said that using this method, the researchers were able to compare various interventions simultaneously. The results produced a ranking that made it easier to say which was the best oil for a specific outcome. The final ranking in the study confirmed that solid fats (e.g., butter and lard) are the worst choice for LDL. It also revealed that the best oils are made from seeds such as flaxseed, rapeseed, and sunflower seeds. (Related: Black Cumin Seed Oil – The Most Powerful Oil for Your Health.) Schwingshackl said that there were some things to consider for the results of the study. Since it only measured blood lipids, the study doesn’t present “a hard clinical outcome.” He added, “LDL is a causal risk factor for coronary heart disease, but it’s not coronary heart disease.” He also explained that meta-analyses may be misleading, especially since they tend to combine “low-confidence data into a falsely confident-sounding ranking.” To illustrate, for this study there was a lack of evidence to determine a clear “winner” out of all the seed oils. While seed oils can help lower LDL, they may have adverse effects on triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. Despite these factors, Schwingshackl believes that researchers can use network meta-analysis to successfully synthesize disparate clinical studies for future research.

https://food.news/2019-01-13-study-shows-people-who-live-near-fast-food-restaurants-type-2-diabetes.html,Study: Those who live near fast food restaurants are more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes,0,"Advertisement Junk food is bad for your health, and the regular consumption of fast food is often linked to problems like obesity. According to a U.K. study, simply living near a fast food restaurant can even increase your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The study, which involved a collaboration between researchers from the Healthy High-Density Cities Lab at the University of Hong Kong and Oxford University, was published in the journal Lancet Planetary Health. It is also the largest study concerning Type 2 diabetes and exposure to fast food chains. The researchers who conducted the study are lobbying for a better public health model so individuals who live in cities full of fast food chains can become healthier. The researchers also believe that the implementation of health interventions can help address the nutritional imbalances caused by an individual’s proximity to fast food restaurants. The team of scientists acknowledged that while the study only identified a link between fast food proximity and Type 2 diabetes risk, the findings verify earlier studies which indicate that residing near fast food chains is a risk factor for both obesity and Type 2 diabetes. For the study, researchers evaluated 350,000 men and women from all over the U.K. and their proximities to fast food restaurants. (Related: Fast food prior to pregnancy found to increase risk of gestational diabetes.) The research team discovered that in certain streets throughout the U.K., individuals had limited access to healthier food options. Study findings showed that people who resided in the densest cluster of fast food restaurants had an 11 percent higher risk of Type 2 diabetes compared to individuals who lived in a street that is at least one kilometer (km) away from fast food chains. The authors said that the results of the study “have important public health implications.” To resolve this alarming concern, cities in the U.K. must make the switch from an “exclusively corporate-driven economic model to a public health-driven health economic model of urban food access and consumption.” In 2018, the U.K. government urged all restaurants to label the calorie content in their menus so customers can make healthier decisions. The researchers believe that national-level policies can encourage and give the food industry the incentive to make healthier changes to their menus. Dr. Chinmoy Sarkar, the lead author of the study, concluded, “We have to move away from the economic model to a more public health model.” If you have Type 2 diabetes, it doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy the occasional snack. You just need to make sure that you eat foods from the healthy snacks listed below. These foods are full of fiber, healthy fats, and protein and you can eat them without any guilt. These snacks also contain nutrients that can help keep your blood sugar levels under control.

https://food.news/2019-01-12-wasabi-can-help-prevent-cancer.html,"Sushi lovers, rejoice: Wasabi can help prevent cancer",0,"Advertisement If you’ve eaten sushi, you might have noticed that your meal usually comes with a green paste called wasabi (Japanese horseradish). Not everyone likes this pungent Japanese condiment, but according to a study, it could be the key to curing cancer. The study was published in the Oxford Journal. Data from the study showed that wasabi may prevent and inhibit cancer cell growth. In the study, researchers assessed the effectiveness of isothiocyanates (ITCs) in wasabi when used to treat bladder cancer. Wasabi is full of isothiocyanates, and the study suggests that the organic compounds can be used to develop a natural cure for cancer. Studies have shown that ITCs can “strongly inhibit” the development and progression of cancer. Once ITCs are inside cancer cells, the compounds can bind to proteins and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death). This means that once cancer cells are exposed to isothiocyanates, they commit suicide. Isothiocyanates can also be found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower. Other vegetables that contain isothiocyanates include: The study originally set out to test the compound more generally to verify its efficacy. The researchers also wanted to determine if cruciferous vegetables can inhibit the development of bladder cancer cells. (Related: Natural matcha green tea extract found to effectively kill breast cancer cells.) When the study began, the researchers initially tested an ITC-rich form of mustard seed powder. The results of the study have gone beyond the initial goals of the researchers involved in the project. Additionally, the study findings confirmed a known fact: that cruciferous vegetables are very effective when it comes to inhibiting cancer growth. When an individual has untreated bladder cancer, tumors can invade surrounding muscle tissue. This occurs in more than 70 percent of cases. During the course of the study, participants who received ITC lowered the spread of the tumor down to almost 35 percent. The researchers added that the spread of cancer to nearby muscles went down by an incredible 100 percent. This isn’t the first study of its kind to confirm the cancer-fighting properties of ITCs. A separate study on isothiocyanates, which involved a collaboration between Dr. Fung-Lung Chung of Georgetown University and Dr. Anthony Di Pasqua, a bioinorganic chemist from the University of North Carolina, had similar findings. Unless they’re treated immediately, bladder tumors can grow and spread rapidly. In most cases, bladder tumors are treated aggressively with chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical interventions. However, these forms of treatment are associated with major risks and negative side effects. There are even cases where the entire bladder of a patient must be removed. If you want to boost your bladder health and lower your risk of this type of cancer, consume more foods with ITC. Consuming ITC-rich foods allows the beneficial compounds to enter the urine. If the urine is still in the bladder, any cancer cells that are also present are exposed to ITCs and the cancer cells will then destroy themselves. Natural health communities, and even people who simply enjoy eating sushi, are happy to learn about the findings of this study on wasabi and ITCs, which revealed that wasabi has at least 40 times the ITC of broccoli. In Japanese cuisine, the root vegetable wasabi is grated into a paste or sauce and used as a condiment. Japanese culture prizes wasabi since it can help prevent various illnesses and improve a person’s overall well-being. Visit Cancer.news to learn more about wasabi and other natural cures."

https://food.news/2019-01-11-the-dangers-of-aspartame-explained.html,The dangers of aspartame explained,0,"Advertisement Whether you have diabetes or you’re trying to lessen your sugar intake, chances are you’ve already replaced table sugar (sucrose) with an artificial sweetener called aspartame. This sugar substitute has fewer calories, but studies have shown that the use of aspartame also comes with various health risks. A popular type of artificial sweetener, aspartame is often used as an alternative to table sugar. Since it is at least 160 to 220 times sweeter than sucrose, you’ll use less aspartame when preparing food. Some people mistakenly believe that this means they can use as much aspartame as they want, especially if they have a sweet tooth. However, manufacturers use aspartame to create different kinds of “low sugar” or “zero calorie” beverages, candies, dairy products, and jellies. In the 1970s, a study revealed that an artificial sweetener called saccharin caused cancer of the bladder (urinary) in laboratory rats. But the studies that followed suggest that the use of saccharin did not have the same results in humans. Because of this, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) changed the safety label of saccarin from “hazardous” to “generally recognized as safe.” While this seems like good news, take a moment to reconsider the use of any artificial sweetener. In a separate study, Dr. Robert Walton reviewed various research studies conducted on aspartame. The findings showed that out of the 166 studies analyzed, 74 were funded by companies that produced aspartame. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the results of all 74 studies say that aspartame is safe for human consumption. Meanwhile, 92 percent of the 92 independently funded studies revealed that there were health risks linked to the consumption of aspartame. These contradicting results highlight the fact that the authenticity and conflict of interest in numerous studies should be reconsidered. Aside from an increased cancer risk, studies are still trying to confirm some of the side effects of aspartame, which may include: People who use aspartame also report digestive problems such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A lot of individuals who consumed products made with the artificial sweetener also reported symptoms such as generalized cramps, joint pain, and numbness in the legs. The results of another study that involved 200 people with migraines determined that participants who consumed aspartame suffered from more headaches compared to the rest of the volunteers. Aspartame is also bad for individuals who have been diagnosed with phenylketonuria, a genetic disease. If you have phenylketonuria, your body is unable to break down phenylalanine. This substance can be found in aspartame. If a child with phenylketonuria doesn’t limit their intake of aspartame, they may suffer from abnormal brain development. (Related: Bombshell study shows aspartame depletes neurotransmitters in the brain, makes brains vulnerable to chemical damage from food and vaccines.) Even if the FDA has deemed aspartame as “generally recognized as safe,” individuals who have depression, mood disorders, or phenylketonuria should avoid using the harmful sugar substitute. Instead of jeopardizing your health by consuming aspartame, follow a healthy diet and use safe and natural sugar substitutes instead. Research is ongoing to determine the negative side effects of aspartame. If you want to follow a healthier diet even if you have a sweet tooth, consider using these natural sugar substitutes instead of aspartame. Like other beverages and foods, you still need to limit your consumption of these “natural” sugar substitutes since they have a lot of calories and little to no nutritional value.

https://food.news/2019-01-11-chewing-areca-nut-can-prevent-cancer.html,Chewing areca nut can prevent cancer,0,"Advertisement Since ancient times, people from certain locations such as Africa and Asia have customarily chewed areca (betel) nuts to strengthen community ties. According to a study, the areca nut, which comes from the areca palm (Areca catechu), may also possess anti-cancer properties. The study, which used mice models to test the anti-cancer properties of the nuts, was published in the journal Molecular Cell. The habit of chewing areca nuts can help clean and strengthen teeth, but the study has proven that green and yellow areca nuts also contain an active substance called arecoline. Study findings also suggest that the nuts may help protect against the Warburg effect, which refers to a condition where cancer cells grow rapidly. (Related: Emerging research shows that a natural citrus fruit extract can prevent cancer growth.) The researchers explained that arecoline substances in areca nuts can help inhibit the growth of cancer cells, especially in conditions such as leukemia and lung cancer. Based on study findings, after the mice that were previously given cancer cell leukemia and lung cancer were administered an injection of arecoline substances, cancer growth significantly slowed down. The team of researchers said, “Uniquely, these arecoline substances do not affect the growth of normal blood cells.” They added that the areca nuts must be studied further to verify the current findings. The researchers concluded that arecoline is a “powerful and selective anti-cancer substance” and that it can potentially be used to develop a natural and effective cure for cancer. Aside from its anti-cancer properties, studies have shown that areca nuts offer other benefits. Areca nuts, which are also known as betel nuts, comes from the areca tree.

https://food.news/2019-01-10-should-pregnant-women-be-eating-mayonnaise.html,Should pregnant women be eating mayonnaise?,0,"Advertisement Do you like sushi or egg salad? If you’re pregnant, you may need to avoid these foods, especially since you have to be twice as careful about your diet if you’re with child. Don’t risk your health by eating something that might make you sick, such as mayonnaise. Mayonnaise ranks high in the list of foods that pregnant women need to avoid because the condiment, especially homemade mayo, includes raw egg whites. Even if you’re not pregnant, you could get sick by eating anything made with raw eggs that may be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria. In most cases, only the mother will experience the symptoms of a Salmonella infection. These may include: Sometimes, a Salmonella infection can cause cramps in the uterus. In rare cases, these cramps may result in premature birth or stillbirth. Other foods that are often made with raw eggs include: When you’re pregnant, you need to cook egg-based dishes thoroughly to avoid Salmonella. This bacteria can also harm the fetus if you get infected. A pregnant woman with Salmonella can also experience dehydration and other infections. (Related: Foods and Herbs That Must Not be Taken During Pregnancy.) Pregnant women should also avoid mayonnaise because it is high in saturated fat and calories. Eating calorie-rich foods like mayo when pregnant can make you gain excess weight, and this can cause complications during childbirth. According to the American Heart Association, you should limit your intake of foods with saturated fats that can also be found in butter, cheese, red meat, and other animal-based foods. Science-backed data has confirmed that saturated fat can raise “bad” cholesterol and increase your risk of heart disease. Eating mayonnaise when pregnant can also increase your risk of listeriosis, an infection caused by the Listeria bacteria. This condition is also linked to the consumption of raw eggs during pregnancy. Most mayonnaise products also contain preservatives that are bad for your health while other types of mayonnaise have a high salt and sugar content. If you’re pregnant, exercise discipline when it comes to your diet. Ask yourself if it’s worth risking your baby’s health whenever you feel the urge to eat an egg salad or a sandwich with some mayo in it. Being pregnant means you become responsible not just for yourself but also for your baby’s life. You can ensure their health by avoiding the other dangerous foods included in the list below.

https://food.news/2019-01-10-cocoa-cough-medicine-study.html,Cure for coughs found in chocolate? Study finds that cocoa is effective cough medicine,0,"Advertisement Chocolate is often considered a guilty pleasure because the delicious treat is rich in calories, fat, and sugar. However, study findings have revealed that chocolate can help treat a cough. In an interview with The Daily Mail, Professor Alyn Morice, who is the head of cardiovascular and respiratory studies at the University of Hull, said that chocolate “can calm coughs.” This may sound too good to be true, especially for chocolate lovers. Professor Morice, who is also a founding member of the International Society for the Study of Cough, is an independent clinician and she has spent several years studying the mechanism of cough. Professor Morice explained that while this sounds unbelievable, it is a fact that is backed by verified scientific data. The professor referenced a European study on over-the-counter (OTC) cough remedies. In the study, researchers found that patients who took a new medicine with cocoa had “a significant improvement in their cough and sleeplessness” after only two days, unlike the participants who took standard cough syrup. Professor Morice added that there are other studies which prove that chocolate can help calm coughs. Prior to the European study, scientists from Imperial College London discovered that theobromine, an alkaloid in cocoa, can suppress coughs more effectively than codeine. (Related: Dark chocolate is good for your heart.) Codeine, an ingredient often used in cough medicine, is linked to many negative side effects. The common side effects of codeine include constipation, dry mouth, and nausea or vomiting. The ingredient can also cause serious side effects like difficulty breathing, muscle stiffness, seizures, or symptoms of low blood pressure (e.g., feeling dizzy and tired). Scientists believe that chocolate can effectively calm coughs since cocoa has demulcent properties. A demulcent is any substance that can help relieve inflammation or irritation. Chocolate is stickier than typical cough syrup, and it can form a more effective coating that helps protect the nerve endings in the throat that trigger your urge to cough. Honey and lemon have the same effect, but the remedy isn’t as effective as chocolate. Professor Morice advised that drinking hot chocolate won’t have the same effect since the cocoa in the beverage “isn’t in contact with the throat long enough to form a protective coating.” She concluded, “Slowly sucking on a piece of chocolate may provide some relief, but I think it is the way the chocolate compounds work with other ingredients in the [cough syrup] which make it so effective.” Unlike the sugary variations of chocolate, dark chocolate is full of nutrients that can boost your health. To make sure that the chocolate you eat is actually nutritious, buy high-quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content. Dark chocolate with a lot of cocoa contains soluble fiber and various minerals. A 100-gram (3.5-ounce) bar of dark chocolate with 70 to 85 percent cocoa has: Dark chocolate is also rich in phosphorus, potassium, selenium, and zinc. Take note that even dark chocolate, which has health benefits, should still be consumed in moderation. A 100-gram bar of chocolate is too much to eat in one sitting, and it also contains 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar.

Now, according to a study by researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine, it may be possible to manipulate gut bacteria and prevent disease. In theory, learning how and why certain bacterial strains humans ingest can thrive in the large intestine while others are rejected may help scientists find out how to manipulate the makeup of thousands of bacterial species to boost overall health or help prevent diseases. However, gut ecology is complex, making this task seem impossible. For the study, researchers tested laboratory mice to find out they can manipulate the mice’s diet to influence the engraftment of a particular bacterial strain. The team of researchers shared that they have discovered how to control how much a bacterium grows in the intestine by adjusting the amount of a specific carbohydrate in each mouse’s food or water. Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, associate professor of microbiology and immunology, explained that everyone has a microbial community in their gut that formed in an uncontrolled manner during the first few years of life. As you grow older, you continue to acquire new strains. However, this acquisition is “a poorly orchestrated and not-well-understood process.” Dr. Sonnenburg posited that the study results imply that it is possible to reshape the microbiome to boost health and fight off disease. (Related: Gut bacteria “signatures” predict how the body will respond to poor food choices, predicting risk for diabetes, heart disease.) The growing field of probiotics, which involves beneficial live bacterial cultures naturally found in food like yogurt or supplements, illustrates the need for the public to be educated on the importance of gut bacteria. Not everyone takes probiotics or consumes yogurt, but everyone “unknowingly consumes low levels of gut-adapted microbes” throughout their life. Regardless of the source, experts still don’t know why one bacterial strain is more successful over another. Dr. Sonnenburg et al. wanted to find out if a dietary boost could help certain bacterial strains survive in the human gut microbiome. The team started the study by visiting the San Jose Wastewater Treatment Facility to acquire members of the genus Bacteroides. This is the most prominent genus in the human gut microbiota. The researchers searched for strains that can digest nori, an ingredient relatively rare in American diets. Nori is nutritious, and the seaweed is often used in sushi rolls and other Japanese foods. A separate study has determined that four grams of nori contain 2.4 micrograms (mcg), or 100 percent of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) of vitamin B12. Researchers screened the bacteria collected in the primary effluent to find a strain that can use porphyran, a carbohydrate found in nori. Dr. Sonnenburg said that in humans, the genes that allow a bacterium to digest porphyran are very rare in people who don’t usually consume seaweed. He added that this let the researchers test how they can bypass the rules of complex ecosystems. To do so, the researchers created “a privileged niche that could favor a single microbe by allowing it to exist in the absence of competition from the 30 trillion other microbes in the gut.” After the researchers identified a strain of Bacteroides that could consume nori, the team tried to introduce the seaweed into three groups of laboratory mice. Two mice groups had their own gut bacteria eliminated and replaced with the naturally occurring gut bacteria taken from two healthy human donors. Both individuals donated exclusively to each mice group. The third group of mice retained a conventional mouse-specific community of gut microbiota. The test results showed that when the mice were fed a typical diet, the strain that could digest porphyran engrafted in two groups of mice to varying and limited degrees. One mice group with human gut bacteria completely rejected the new strain. Meanwhile, the mice group that followed a diet enriched with porphyran-rich diet produced significantly different results: the bacteria steadily engrafted at similar levels in all the mice. Dr. Sonnenburg also said that she was able to “precisely calibrate” the population size of the engrafted bacteria by changing the amount of nori that the animals consumed. She noted that the results of the dilution experiment were extraordinary and that it clearly showed the direct effect of diet on the bacterial population. After the researchers confirmed that they could manipulate the engraftment and growth of the bacterial strain, they also managed to prove that the genes required for the digestion of porphyran exist as a unit. These genes could be engineered into other Bacteroides strains to give them the same engraftment advantage. The researchers are now trying to identify other genes that may give similar dietary abilities. Dr. Sonnenburg stated that for the past decade, gut microbes had been proven to be connected to various aspects of human biology. Thanks to the study, the research team was also able to show that these bacteria are “very malleable.” The research team is hopeful that their discovery can be used to revolutionize how precision health is practiced. The study was published in the journal Nature. You can browse more articles about nori and other foods with various health benefits at Healing.news."
https://food.news/2019-01-09-research-finds-that-eating-breakfast-helps-obese-people-become-more-active.html,Research finds that eating breakfast helps obese people become more active,0,"Advertisement According to the results of a study, if you want to lose weight effectively and become more physically active, you shouldn’t skip breakfast. The study, which was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, a leading diet and nutrition journal, examined connections between breakfast and health for obese people. The study involved health scientists working at the Department for Health who compared the test results of two sets of participants: a fasting group and a breakfasting group. For the study, both groups ate similar amounts of food overall. Based on the results of the study, eating breakfast didn’t make obese individuals lose weight but it did help them become more physically active in the morning. Breakfast consumption also helped reduced food intake later in the day. The researchers noted that since “[increasing] activity is one of the most important ways to improve health” in an increasingly sedentary population, educating the public about the benefits of consuming a healthy breakfast regularly may help promote proper nutrition and regular exercise. (Related: Eating breakfast before exercise may “prime” your body to burn more carbohydrates.) The results of this study on an obese group of volunteers referenced data from earlier studies by researchers at the University of Bath regarding the effects of eating breakfast in a “lean” population. The two studies are part of the three-year Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)-funded “Bath Breakfast Project” (BBP). The combined results of these studies resulted in insights that are currently considered as “some of the most comprehensive to date into the effects of eating breakfast.” The study results also helped Dr. James Betts, the lead researcher of the BBP, win the prestigious Cuthbertson Medal from the Nutrition Society. Researchers wanted to test for the potential connections among three factors: breakfast, body weight, and health. Dr. Betts said that even though many people have different opinions about “whether or not you should eat breakfast,” there is currently a lack of “rigorous scientific evidence” that proves how or even if eating breakfast could improve one’s health. He noted that the study helped emphasize some of these impacts, but the importance of breakfast still “depends on the individual and their own personal goals.” To illustrate, if a person wants to lose weight, there isn’t enough data to support the assumption that only eating breakfast or skipping it will significantly affect your weight. But Dr. Betts added that based on other markers of a healthy lifestyle, such as being more physically active or strictly controlling and monitoring blood sugar levels, there is sufficient proof that eating breakfast can help. For the study, researchers conducted the obese trial by grouping participants, who were aged from 21 to 60, into two groups: “fasting” and “breakfasting.” The scientists measured the outcomes of the study during a six-week period. The majority of existing research is limited to surveys of a large number of people. However, for this study researchers intensively tested a focus group in tightly-controlled conditions. This means the relevant effects of breakfast or fasting on the body can be studied without requiring data from thousands of people. The breakfasting group was instructed to consume at least 700 kilocalories (kcal) by 11:00 a.m. The first half of the food for this group was consumed within about two hours of waking. The fasting group only consumed water until noon. The participants were allowed to choose what they wanted to eat for breakfast, and the scientists wish to continue their research to determine if results will differ based on different breakfast types. Further study can help the researchers determine effective recommendations regarding the kind of food sources and nutrients that could best improve an individual’s overall well-being.

https://food.news/2019-01-09-adolescents-who-eat-fast-food-are-more-likely-to-have-asthma.html,Shocking international study reveals that adolescents who eat fast food are 40% more likely to have severe asthma,0,"Advertisement A study has revealed one more reason to stop eating fast food: it is linked to the “the rising prevalence of asthma and allergies, especially among children.” Published data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey has revealed that over one in three Americans consume fast food every day. Aside from being a major factor in the obesity epidemic, fast food is also significantly affecting children’s health. In 2013, an international study that involved a team of researchers from Australia, Germany, New Zealand, Spain, and the U.K. published their findings from a Phase III study called the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). ISAAC, which was first published in the peer-reviewed journal Epidemiology, highlighted alarming facts about fast food consumption: The research team posited that “a causal link between fast food, asthma, and allergies is plausible,” especially since fast foods are full of “trans fatty acids, sodium, carbohydrates, and sugar… and possibly preservatives.” These ingredients are confirmed to have immune-mediated inflammatory effects on the body. Obesity is a known risk factor for asthma and the various ingredients often found in fast food can significantly increase a child’s risk of becoming obese or overweight. The ISAAC study references self-reported questionnaire data, and survey-taking is usually regarded as a weaker type of evidence, especially when compared to other more rigorous scientific methods like randomized controlled trials. Questionnaires may ask study participants to remember their dietary habits over the past 12 months, and this kind of information can easily be forgotten or at least fabricated. Despite these considerations, sample sizes were “impressively large.” The ISAAC study involved data from 319,196 children aged 13 to 14 years old and 181,631 kids aged six to seven from about 100 different countries. The scientists reported that there is a reason why a healthy diet is the best prevention for respiratory conditions like asthma. Consuming fruit regularly is linked to various protective health benefits. Study data also showed that adolescents and children who consumed fruit three or more times a week were 11 and 14 percent less likely, respectively, to develop severe asthma.

https://food.news/2019-01-08-citrus-fruits-can-counteract-some-of-the-health-risks-of-obesity.html,Citrus fruits can counteract some of the health risks of obesity,0,"Advertisement Citrus fruits can boost your immunity and even help fight cancer. According to a study, citrus fruits can also be crucial to the prevention of weight-related health problems. The study findings showed that citrus fruits like grapefruits, lemons, limes, and oranges have a type of antioxidant that can help neutralize serious health risks of obesity. The researchers advised that consuming more citrus fruits can help an overweight individual minimize their risk conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or liver disease. When you consume a high-fat diet, your body will store the fat it can’t immediately use in cells all over your body. These fat cells will then produce a substance that harms other healthy cells. This occurrence is called oxidative stress. The immune system and its antioxidants usually address oxidative stress. But in overweight people, especially those who regularly consume high-fat foods, oxidative stress may overwhelm the immune system’s ability to respond and prevent disease. (Related: Prevent obesity-related diseases with hooker chive.) Citrus fruits are full of vitamin C, which can boost the immune system and improve skin health. Low in calories, citrus fruits also contain other vitamins and minerals that the body needs to function properly, such as: Additionally, citrus fruits are full of plant compounds with many health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These nutritious fruits have at least 60 varieties of carotenoids, essential oils, and flavonoids that are behind many of the benefits of citrus fruits. Citrus fruits are a good source of flavonoids that can help prevent neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Citrus fruit also contains flavanones, a type of flavonoid with antioxidant properties. Flavanones can help minimize the risk of oxidative stress and damage to healthy cells, which can reduce pressure on your overworked immune system. Researchers conducted the study on several mice groups with different diets. Some mice groups were fed a normal diet, while the rest were placed on a high-fat diet. The researchers gave the mice on the high-fat diet a dose of the flavanones found in citrus fruits. One month after the study began, these mice were tested for specific indicators in the blood and liver that indicate the presence of cell-damaging substances. The test results revealed that the mice fed a high-fat diet had a high level of these indicators. Subjects on the high-fat diet that also ingested flavanones had a decreased level of indicators in their blood and liver. Some mice even had a reported 50 percent decreased, reported the researchers. Other mice that ingested flavanones experienced less damage and fat build-up in the liver. The scientists explained that while introducing flavanones to the mice on the high-fat diet helped minimize damage; it did not make the subjects lose weight. Adding citrus fruits with flavanones to your diet can improve your overall well-being by negating the effects of fat cells on your body. Consuming these beneficial fruits can also help minimize liver damage and lower the amount of fat and glucose in your blood. Regardless of your weight, a diet that contains citrus fruits can help lower your risk of developing conditions like heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. In general, you must follow a diet full of fruits and various vegetables to keep your body strong and healthy.

One way to naturally address this symptom is by making lifestyle changes like exercising regularly or following an anti-inflammatory diet. Anti-inflammatory foods can help reduce the inflammation caused by various types of arthritis like ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Following an anti-inflammatory diet means you need to include “a family of vegetables that offer a powerhouse dose of inflammation-fighting elements,” cruciferous vegetables. Studies have shown that cruciferous vegetables have positive effects on the biological factors that cause inflammation in the body. (Related: Mediterranean diet reduces inflammation and degradation of cartilage in osteoarthritis patients.) Below are some examples of cruciferous vegetables: Other healthy anti-inflammatory food options include certain oils, fish, fruits and vegetables, nuts, spices, tea, and whole grains. Follow a healthy diet with a lot of anti-inflammatory foods to relieve the symptoms caused by arthritis. There are different types of arthritis, but most of them start with similar symptoms. These symptoms tend to worsen over time, but there are measures you can take to slow down the progression of arthritis.

https://food.news/2019-01-07-study-confirms-tv-ads-are-misleading-kids.html,Study confirms “health halo” effects of TV ads are misleading kids,0,"Advertisement Children are impressionable, and adults are often wary of what they say and do around kids to make sure that they don’t imitate any of their bad habits. But are adults being careless when it comes to the food choices of their children? According to a study, children who viewed junk food TV commercials accompanied by healthy lifestyle messages rated the products as more healthful, unlike children who watched other ads for similar products but with a different message. The study, which was conducted by the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity (UCONN Rudd Center) at the University of Connecticut, was published in the journal Pediatric Obesity. Jennifer Harris, the lead author of the study, said that the findings, which confirm the “health halo” effect of healthy messages in child-directed advertising for junk food, are a cause for public health concern. The health halo effect misleads individuals into overestimating the health benefits of a food product based on claims on its label. In advertising marketed to children, food and beverage companies claim that healthy lifestyle messages, like those promoting regular exercise and good eating habits, teach children about health and nutrition. However, Harris, who is also Associate Professor in Allied Health Sciences and Director of Marketing Initiatives for the UConn Rudd Center, explained that the study did not find any proof that these advertisements educate children about fitness or nutrition. She warned that food companies may be using the practice because it is beneficial and makes children think that unhealthy food is good for them. In the randomized controlled study, which was conducted from August 2015 to March 2016, researchers worked with 138 children who were seven to 11 years old. The volunteers were made to watch three child-friendly TV commercials in one of three conditions: After watching the ads, the children were instructed to rate the commercials and advertised products. The participants were also asked to provide attitudes about exercise and nutrition, and they consumed and rated both healthy and unhealthy snack foods. (Related: Junk food ads on TV strongly influence children’s eating habits.) Findings from the study revealed that children who watched the health halo commercials rated the products advertised as “significantly healthier overall” compared to the other participants who viewed the other commercials. The children also thought that their parents would buy 1.1 of the advertised products with the health halo messages compared to 0.4 products in the junk food ads with a different message category. There was no proof that health halo messages positively influenced the children’s health-related attitudes, and almost all of the children agreed that it is important to consume fruits and vegetables and to exercise daily. The TV ads did not affect the children’s ratings of how much they liked the healthy or unhealthy snacks offered to them. Harris said that the study results corroborate existing research data that was unable to provide proof that health-promoting messages positively affect the health-related attitudes or eating behaviors of children. Instead, these messages mislead children about the healthfulness of TV commercials for certain food products. Harris concluded, “Such practices should be discouraged, including through industry self-regulatory programs.” Visit JunkFood.news to browse more articles about the many reasons why sugary foods and drinks are bad for you."
https://food.news/2019-01-06-why-coconut-oil-should-be-a-part-of-your-survival-stockpile.html,Why coconut oil should be a part of your survival stockpile,0,"Advertisement Coconut oil is a staple in any prepper’s pantry. Aside from being a shelf stable product, coconut oil is a nutritious substitute for cooking oil. Additionally, coconut oil has various survival uses. (h/t to TheOrganicPrepper.com.) There are many different types of coconut oil, and two of them include refined or unrefined coconut oil. Refined coconut oil is separated by heat. This type of oil, which is more heat-stable, can be used for cooking methods like frying. Refined coconut is flavorless and odorless. Refined coconut oil’s shelf life may vary from 18 months to 2 years. Refined coconut oil may lose some of its nutritional benefits, depending on the refining process used. Unrefined coconut oil is also called virgin or extra-virgin coconut oil. This type of oil has the light scent and flavor of coconut, but these can diminish when used in cooking. This type of coconut oil contains the most nutritional benefits, and its shelf life can range from two to five years to “indefinite.” Coconut oil contains “healthy” saturated fats that you need in your diet. Saturated fats can promote fat burning, and they can also provide both the brain and body with “quick energy.” These kinds of fat can help increase the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in your blood, and this can lower heart disease risk. (Related: Basic nutrition for survival: 10 food items to keep in your emergency cache.) Coconut oil is made up of 50 percent lauric acid, an essential fatty acid. The only other natural and rich source of lauric acid is human breast milk. Once consumed, the human body turns lauric acid into monolaurin that has antifungal, antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, and antiviral properties. In short, lauric acid can significantly boost your immunity. Below are some of the many science-backed health benefits of coconut oil, as compiled by the Coconut Research Center: Coconut oil is non-toxic to humans, compared to other Big Pharma products. Coconut oil has a melting point of 76 degrees Fahrenheit (24 Celcius). When stored above that temperature it will turn into a liquid, and below it will turn the oil into a solid. Turning into a liquid won’t damage coconut oil in any way. You can extend the shelf life of coconut oil by storing it in a cool, dark place, but if you store it in the refrigerator it will turn hard. Soften solidified coconut by placing the sealed jar in a pan of hot water. If you buy a large quantity of coconut oil, such as a one- to five-gallon bucket, use a dry and sterilized spoon or scoop to get enough oil for regular use. To get the best results, raise or lower the temperature of coconut oil to reach the consistency of the item you are replacing. If you’re baking and the recipe needs shortening, briefly chill the coconut oil until it turns firm. When replacing cooking oil, melt the coconut oil until it liquefies. You can replace the following with coconut oil: Coconut oil is also a safe alternative to cosmetic products with harmful ingredients like parabens and petroleum products. The oil is also safe enough to use with children, who have extremely sensitive skin. Aside from cooking, coconut oil can be used as: With coconut oil, you can utilize the limited storage space in your survival stockpile to make room for other items that you may need to stock up on before SHTF.

https://food.news/2019-01-04-probiotics-reduce-the-need-for-antibiotics.html,"Probiotics reduce the need for antibiotics, new review concludes",0,"Advertisement Probiotics are a certain type of “good” bacteria that offers various health benefits when consumed, and some people take probiotics as supplements with the goal of populating their gut with beneficial microorganisms. However, data from a review has determined that probiotics can also be used to reduce the need for antibiotics among infants and children. The review, which was published in the European Journal of Public Health, involved researchers from England, the Netherlands, and the U.S. who examined data from several studies about the health benefits of probiotics. The researchers said that once the results from twelve studies were collated, the data showed that “infants and children were 29 percent less likely to have been prescribed antibiotics if they received probiotics as a daily health supplement.” When the analysis was repeated using only the highest quality studies, the results revealed that the percentage increased to a whopping 53 percent. Dr. Daniel Merenstein, the study’s senior investigator and a professor in the Department of Family Medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine, explained that the finding implies that the regular consumption of probiotics may help reduce antibiotic use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that there are at least two million cases of antibiotic-resistant infections in the U.S. annually, which also results in 23,000 deaths. Experts believe that resistance to the drug can be prevented by curbing the use of antibiotics. (Related: Probiotics reduce allergic response in infants.) Dr. Merenstein, who is also the director of research programs in the Department of Family Medicine, commented that existing data already proves how the consumption of probiotics can minimize the incidence, duration, and severity of specific types of common acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. He added, “the question is whether that reduction is solidly linked to declining use of antibiotics, and we see that there is an association.” Dr. Sarah King, the study’s lead author from Cambridge, England, noted that further studies in people of all ages are required, especially among the elderly. Continued research can help determine if the regular use of probiotics is associated with an overall reduction in antibiotic prescriptions. Proving this crucial link can significantly affect the use of probiotics in general medicine and consumers in general. It remains to be seen how exactly probiotics help fight infections, particularly those in the respiratory and lower digestive tract. But Dr. Merenstein believes that there are several potential mechanisms, like probiotic production of pathogen inhibitors and immune regulation. Experts still haven’t identified all the mechanisms that probiotic strains can leverage, but the majority of the human immune system can be found in the gastrointestinal tract. According to Dr. Merenstein, this means that “ingesting healthy bacteria may competitively exclude bacterial pathogens linked to gut infections and may prime the immune system to fight others.” The study was supported in part by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics. Probiotics refer to living microorganisms that, once ingested, offer different health benefits.

https://food.news/2019-01-03-following-a-mediterranean-diet-may-blunt-the-effects-of-air-pollution.html,Following a Mediterranean diet may blunt the effects of air pollution,0,"Advertisement The Mediterranean diet is popular among dieters because it has many health benefits, such as promoting weight loss and preventing heart attacks. According to a study, the diet can also “influence the association between long-term air pollution exposure and health effects.” The study involved researchers from the New York University School of Medicine. Chris Lim, a doctoral student at the university, noted that earlier studies have determined that dietary changes, such as the addition of antioxidants, can help blunt the negative effects of short-term exposure to high levels of air pollution. For the study, the researchers set out to confirm the long-term effects of the diet. (Related: The Mediterranean Diet Reduces Mortality From All Causes.) The Mediterranean diet includes foods that are rich in molecules called antioxidants. These molecules can disarm free radicals, which are oxidized and highly reactive molecules that have been confirmed to cause cell and tissue damage. The Mediterranean diet favors whole and single-ingredients and foods such as: Researchers examined data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Diet and Health Study. The study covered a 17-year period which followed 548,699 individuals. The participants, who had an average age of 62 at enrollment, came from these six states: California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Participants also came from two cities, Atlanta and Detroit. During the 17-year study period, 126,835 participants from the study group died. The researchers categorized the volunteers into five groups depending on their level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet. They also linked participants to estimates of long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrous oxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) based on census tract information. The researchers compared the participants who were least and most adherent to a Mediterranean diet. The results showed that: The scientists also noted that following a Mediterranean diet didn’t seem to prevent the negative effects of long-term O3 exposure. They added that the diet didn’t reduce deaths from all causes, heart attack, or other heart problems linked to O3 exposure. George Thurston, the senior study author, said that based on the confirmed benefits of a diet full of antioxidants, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that particle air pollution due to fossil fuel combustion negatively affects health by causing oxidative stress and inflammation. Thurston, who is also the director of the Program in Exposure Assessment and Human Health Effects at the Department of Environmental Medicine at NYU School of Medicine, added that since one-fourth of the study population lived in areas that had air pollution levels of 10 mcg/m3 or more above the lowest exposure, following the Mediterranean diet can help minimize the negative effects of air pollution in “a substantial population in the United States.” Visit Health.news to read more articles about the many health benefits of the Mediterranean diet."

https://food.news/2018-12-27-link-between-alzheimers-and-sugar.html,Are Alzheimer’s and sugar consumption linked? Studies detail the deadly connection,0,"Advertisement Most people think that sugar consumption and Alzheimer’s disease are two unrelated health issues. However, according to various studies, consuming too much sugar can increase your risk of Alzheimer’s disease. You need to be extremely careful when it comes to limiting your sugar intake, especially since most food companies try to add sugar to almost all kinds of food products. On the other hand, Alzheimer’s rates are also on the rise, along with obesity and the underlying metabolic syndrome. While this could be nothing more than a coincidence, research implies that there might be a link between a diet high in sugar and Alzheimer’s. Since the condition is the third leading cause of death in the U.S., this matter should be thoroughly investigated. Dr. Perlmutter, the author of the best-selling book “Grain Brain,” warned that the standard Western diet is linked to various neurological issues. Meanwhile, Dr. Emily Deans from Harvard University advised that new data suggests to a link between the standard Western diet and smaller brain size. To date, there is no cure for Alzheimer’s. However, a small study by the University of California, Los Angeles, has determined that partial memory loss may be reversed. The researchers did this by following a template similar to the Paleo diet. The findings of the landmark study imply that a diet high in carbs and sugar may negatively affect an individual’s mental health. At least one in 10 people older than 65 have Alzheimer’s, but those numbers are steadily increasing. Alzheimer’s is associated with symptoms that cause problems with judgment, memory, and thinking. The condition can aggravate dementia and memory loss since it occurs when the human brain starts malfunctioning. People with Alzheimer’s can take medications to ease their symptoms, but the condition itself remains incurable. Experts note that while genetics is a crucial factor for Alzheimer’s, epigenetics (meaning your diet and lifestyle) can also greatly affect the development of the condition. When a person has Alzheimer’s, plaques and tangles appear in their brain, causing problematic buildups. The accumulation of amyloid plaques between the nerve cells or neurons in the brain is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s. Meanwhile, neurofibrillary tangles are the insoluble twisted fibers found inside the brain’s cells. Experts are still undecided when it comes to what causes Alzheimer’s, but there are a handful of hypotheses. Sugar consumption is linked to Alzheimer’s because the pathways of diabetes development seem to influence Alzheimer’s. Data also implies that a diet high in sugar causes diabetes, which is bad for brain health. Some researchers believe that burning too much glucose can interrupt proper brain function. This could be one reason why the UCLA Alzheimer’s study, where a lower-sugar diet was followed, is effective. Alzheimer’s is even identified as “Type 3 diabetes” since the brain produces insulin. It’s worth noting that the brain cells need this insulin to survive and if insulin production is disrupted, the brain may be at risk. People with diabetes lose more gray matter compared to people who don’t have the condition. This is an important fact because the loss of gray matter is a factor that causes Alzheimer’s. This highlights the fact that following a diet high in sugar is bad for your brain health. (Related: Eating too much processed sugar increases your risk of Alzheimer’s.) Several studies have identified a link between sugar consumption and Alzheimer’s: These studies suggest that a high-sugar diet increases your risk of Alzheimer’s, even if you don’t have diabetes. Thankfully, you can prevent Alzheimer’s by following a low-sugar Paleo diet. Aside from obvious health reasons, you should limit your sugar intake to keep your brain healthy. Even if experts still don’t fully understand Alzheimer’s, you can start taking the necessary precautions to reduce your risk of developing the condition.

https://food.news/2018-12-21-common-food-processing-techniques-linked-to-higher-risk-of-type-2-diabetes.html,Common food processing techniques linked to higher risk of Type 2 diabetes,0,"Advertisement Preparing foods a certain way can affect their nutrient content, especially vegetables. But did you know that there are cooking methods that can also increase your diabetes risk? According to several Australian studies, which involved researchers from Monash University and the University of Queensland, common food processing techniques are linked to a risk of Type 2 diabetes. These include methods that involve the use of direct heat as a primary treatment source. The results of the studies have determined that the most common heat-based methods of food processing are associated with reduced insulin sensitivity and Type 2 diabetes. Researchers explained that this occurs because of the high levels of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in foods processed using these methods. The research was focused within the country of Australia, but the findings can be applied to other regions that also use the same food processing techniques. Several countries worldwide are facing epidemic levels of Type 2 diabetes, and at least 25 percent of Australians older than 25 now have diabetes or prediabetes symptoms. Most of the time, cases like this are associated with the unhealthy American diet. In fact, more than 50 percent of Americans have diabetes or prediabetes symptoms. The study findings reveal that despite being more health-oriented, societies such as Australia are also influenced by unhealthy trends in processed food. The researchers explained that the heat processing of food helps increase its flavor, shelf-life, and sterility. However, it also increases the production of AGEs. The team warned that certain food processing and preparation methods, such as baking, frying, grilling, and roasting produce more AGEs compared to other methods like boiling and steaming, which use water and steam and not direct flames and high heat. (Related: Well done and overcooked meats greatly raise the risk of developing dementia and diabetes.) For the study, scientists measured AGE levels in the volunteers’ urine. The test results determined a consistent link between high levels of AGEs and an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. Over the last few years, Type 2 diabetes has turned into a major public health issue in several Western countries. The condition has reduced quality of life among different societies, and it has also caused heavy economic burdens. In Australia, the estimated costs for healthcare related to Type 2 diabetes amounted to more than billion per year as of 2016. But experts fear that the figure could still double by 2025. To address this alarming concern, scientists will continue their research to validate their findings via larger and longer-term studies. They hope that further study can help determine if the reduced consumption of advanced glycation end-products can help lower a person’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and improve their general well-being. However, companies that profit off of these dangerous cooking methods are unlikely to change their ways. The best thing you can do to lower your diabetes risk is to make healthier and responsible dietary choices. Avoid heating food when cooking, and keep in mind that you can obtain more nutrients from fruits and vegetables if you consume them raw or lightly cooked. Choose natural and organic foods instead of processed products to minimize your consumption of unhealthy AGEs. Various studies have confirmed that regardless of your weight, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are major factors that affect metabolic health.

Based on the researchers’ observations of the diets of lab mice with disrupted circadian clocks, timing is crucial to metabolism. They also explained that controlling the times when the subjects eat can help correct obesity and other metabolic problems often observed in these mice. Surprisingly, the calorie intake of the different mice groups was the same even if some of them were fed an unhealthy diet. The study findings point to a newly discovered connection “between [the] disruption of the clock and eating behavior.” Dr. Satchidananda Panda, the senior author of the study and a professor in the Regulatory Biology Laboratory at the Salk Institute, explained that the finding is an unexpected one. He explained that while experts previously believed that “the circadian clock had a direct impact on maintaining a healthy metabolism,” the research findings could prove otherwise. Dr. Panda noted that based on their research, the circadian clock’s main role is to produce daily eating-fasting rhythms while metabolic disease could be the result of disrupted eating behavior. Certain bodily functions are affected by the daily cycle of light and dark that is governed by the sun. In fact, combined with this cycle of day and night, other environmental factors such as humidity and temperature stimulate various processes in the human body such as: Dr. Panda’s earlier studies have determined that having an intact circadian clock tells mice when to eat, such as when the mice have access to healthy food. Data from these studies revealed that subjects with defective clocks tend to have disrupted eating patterns if they could eat whenever they want. In time, most of these mutant mice developed signs of metabolic diseases, even when they were only given healthy food. Separate studies had confirmed that when normal mice had free access to food full of fat and sugar, the bad diet nullifies their circadian clock. In turn, the mice ate randomly and developed metabolic diseases. Meanwhile, restricting the timing of when the mice are allowed to eat allowed the researchers to prevent and reverse the negative impacts of the unhealthy diet. After an eight- to 12-hour time window, factors such as glucose levels, high cholesterol, and stamina on a treadmill were measured. The time-restricted feeding helped promote “robust rhythm in circadian clock components.” (Related: Midnight snacking makes you fatter.) Dr. Panda shared that data from the previous studies helped them formulate the theory that “a robustly cycling circadian clock function” is crucial to preventing metabolic diseases. In the recent study, the researchers set out to answer one question: “If the mice don’t have an internal clock telling when to eat, can we externally instruct mice when to eat, and will it prevent metabolic diseases?” The researchers noted that for the metabolic parameters that they examined, restricting the timing of feeding helped prevent health deterioration despite the absence of a normal circadian clock. For the study, the scientists observed three different strains of mice with disrupted circadian clocks. The clocks were disrupted by “knocking out” specific genes that help regulate internal timing. Some of the mice could eat food whenever they wanted, while others could only eat for a restricted nine- to 10-hour time window. Test results showed that the total calorie intake was the same whether the mice had normal or disrupted clocks. This data can be used on future studies concerning how the clock influences the central nervous system and how it controls the urge to eat. The researchers will also determine how the findings can be applied to human studies. Dr. Panda concluded that as individuals age, they may “start to lose their clocks.” Based on the study results, experts can determine new ways to manage compulsive eating in people with disrupted circadian clocks. The study was published in the journal Cell Metabolism. Read more articles about the circadian rhythm and how it’s linked to weight loss at Slender.news."
https://goop.com/wellness/health/othership-bathhouse-review/,"I Cried and Screamed at Othership, the Buzziest New Bathhouse",0,"Like the Mona Lisa, Stonehenge, and Tom Cruise, Othership is smaller in stature than I expected. Its reputation—so bloated and widespread (more on that later)—makes me nervous on arrival, like I’m walking into a first date. There’s a gentle unze-unze in the reception area and obligatory bathhouse paraphernalia: illuminated glass bottles (curiously empty), an installation of banya bonnets ($60), and limp linen robes that a man beside me runs his hands along, affectionately. The changing rooms are also smaller than expected; somewhere between an Equinox locker room and a club’s coat check. Thayer’s facial toner and a jar of Q-Tips sit next to a cup of orange earplugs. So, what exactly is Othership? Judging purely by architecture, Othership is a bathhouse—one amongst many that have opened recently in New York City—equipped with a 90-person sauna and eight cold plunges. However, they squirm out of this categorization (and nowhere on the website do they say ‘bathhouse’) by blending performance, sober clubbing, treatments, and group therapy. With two locations in Toronto, one in NYC’s Flatiron District, and a soon-to-come Williamsburg spot, their mission is to combat the loneliness epidemic and foster community in a sober, device-free space. To understand the cast of characters behind Othership requires a corkboard and red string. During COVID, the couple Robbie Bent and Emily Hunter (now Bent) began hosting sauna parties in their backyard. Robbie was a crypto entrepreneur, recently sober, and edging that tech-meets-spirituality line (from a stalk on Instagram, I see skydiving, saltflats, and a ten-day meditation retreat in Israel). They brought in their friends, Harrison Taylor, a sauna master and certified breathwork coach, Amanda Laine, a former model turned sauna master and cold exposure therapist, and Taylor’s partner, and Myles Farmer, who’d opened restaurants and nightclubs in Toronto and, notably, was a Tim Horton’s franchisee. As the world came out of lockdown, their sauna parties took off and in 2022, they opened the first Othership in Toronto. It’s worshiped by techies who’ve swapped bars for a banya and is funded by companies like Headspace, SoulCycle, and Canadian singer Shawn Mendes (who’s supposedly visited over 100 times?). It’s been dubbed “the SoulCycle of spas” by The New Yorker, the best place to find love by PopSugar, described as a blend of Cirque du Soleil and group therapy in Toronto Life, and, as New York Magazine puts it, I’ll leave with a “sober hangover.” All said, Othership’s most ubiquitous rumor? It’s a cult. On a rainy Saturday night, I bring a friend who’s going through a breakup. We’re attending a 75-minute guided class called Rose, Thorn, Bud, three words that, together, prompt a minor trauma response. While they offer ‘free-flows’ and ‘socials,’ for independent bathers, the classes—which cost $65 for a drop-in or $333 for a membership—and the Guides themselves, are Othership’s magnum opus. I’ve heard they’re a mix between an Aufguss—a German tradition of pouring aromatic water on the sauna rocks and fanning the hot air with a towel—a dance performance, and group therapy. The locker room leads us into the ‘tea room,’ an amber-lit and amphitheater-style lounge. We climb over our fellow ‘Journeyers’ to perch at the top like the jury in a courtroom. Sixty half-naked people, many semi-recumbent couples, a few huddles of women and the stray single man, rubbing his palms together, waiting for our Guide, Dev Richey to begin. Richey is a dancer and choreographer on Broadway, clearly, as he pirouettes around, outlining what’s to come. After a light preamble, we’re ushered into the palatial sauna with a faint herbal smell, and we sit facing the stove and a giant gong. Uplifting, Rüfüs Du Sol-type house music starts, the neon lights bump with the beat, and Richey begins by throwing herbal snowballs on the stove. We’re visualizing our Rose. Once my body is covered in sweat, time begins to warp. It’s a lot of sensory action; the music gets louder, Richey is dancing and fanning us with hot, aromatic air. Soon, we’re moving on to our ‘thorns.’ The music fades, the lights dim, then, poof, we’re in pitch black. Dev seems genuinely sad. I feel sad. We visualize our thorns, what we messed up this month. Someone starts banging the gong and, on the count of three, Richey lets out a primal scream that erupts around me. I’m screaming too, at full volume, I think, but it’s drowned by one collective, barbaric roar. Then, silence. I nudge my friend. I feel like I might cry, maybe I do, I wouldn’t know, my face is covered in sweat. On to the ice bath. Eight small ice baths dot the floor. We file in, stand above our plunge (more like a puddle as they’re only 22 inches deep), and we sit in unison, the cold zinging my body, as Richey lulls us away from panic, for two submerged minutes. “People give me a laundry list like, ‘I’m a sound healer and I’ve taught yoga in this and that place,’ and I don’t really care,” says Laine, who’s the director of Guides and handles hiring people like Richey. In their video job submission, applicants are asked things like ‘tell the craziest story’ or to show a full range of emotion on their face in 30 seconds. From these, she says, they’re looking for an “X-factor.” There is a meticulous curation to what they don’t say. They avoid spiritual or religious concepts, basing their classes on psychotherapy techniques, “not chakras or energy,” says Bent. Nothing is “woo-woo,” Laine reiterates. This comes as a surprise, and reads as slightly incongruent to their marketing. (Someone on their team signed off an email with “happy to be in orbit with you.”) Despite Andrew Huberman coming up in both my interviews, they also avoid “talking about things like ‘inflammation’ or ‘longevity,’” or any other lingo used in the bio-hacking world, Bent says. The yolk of Othership is to simply feel your emotions for 75 minutes, not to intellectualize them. There is science behind it all, of course. For their Graditude class, they wanted to introduce a more potent, studied practice, Laine says. “We’ve been taught to practice gratitude by listing three things we’re grateful for, but that’s not actually the best way, it’s really through storytelling,” she says. This is shown in a study from 2015 that found repeating a story of gratitude (or better yet, a story in which someone is grateful to you) is far more effective than simply listing. They weave positive visualization into their classes, which we do a lot of in Rose Thorn Bud, which is shown to boost mood and achievement. Their classes can take months or even years to write. “It’s tons of research, we work with different therapists to review scripts. It’s really a craft of language.” Similarly, saunas have sweeping benefits like improving blood flow, activating metabolism with heat-shock proteins, and improving cardiovascular function. The higher heart rate you have in a sauna can even mimic the effects of moderate exercise, and like exercise, saunas can boost mood and make you more relaxed (through release of beta-endorphins). And on a rudimentary level, inside a sauna like Othership, you’re forced to be away from a screen for more than an hour. Cold plunges are slightly more contentious when it comes to sex. Studies show that short-term cold exposure is beneficial for everyone because it’s shown to increase endorphin and norepinephrine levels, but some experts, like exercise physiologist Stacy Sims, PhD, say extreme cold below 55 degrees puts too much stress on women’s systems. Laine says it’s about the individual, or phase in their cycle, but the truth is there’s not enough research on the effects of plunges on female bodies. The cold plunges at Othership are 32 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit. I couldn’t help but notice that those who hopped out first were men. (This could be due to research showing women, generally, have more brown fat, which helps us withstand cold—or maybe it’s just grit.) Back in the sauna, all we have left is our Bud. Richey asks us to visualize walking along a path of rose petals where we meet the former version of ourselves. We hug ourselves, and suddenly, our former self explodes into a shower of flower petals, and we continue on the petal path. For the second time, inexplicably, I feel like crying. “The word cult used to rattle me, I was like ‘oh my God, like what is happening,’” Laine says when I ask about their reputation. The word spread gradually at first. Then, when their Flatiron location opened, people began whizzing by their hundredth visit and raving about it online, the label stuck. In response to the same question, without missing a beat, “I love it,” Bent says, naming companies with devoted communities, like SoulCycle, Apple, and Tesla. “That’s what we’re trying to create.” After one last barbaric yap, Richey opens the floor to us Journeyers, offering space for optional sharing. After a long silence, a man in the corner—a solo Journeyer, previously rubbing his palms together—describes choosing to laugh in the cold plunge instead of gritting his teeth. We all erupt in cheers, naturally. We emerge from the sauna pink-faced and chatty. My friend turns to me and says she’s going to find a way to come here every month. The solo man is talking with a group of women at the tea station. People are setting up a DJ table in the amphitheater room. At Othership, the night’s just getting started."
https://goop.com/wellness/health/osteopathy-benefits/,"What to Know About Osteopathy, the Holistic Modality Beloved by European Women",0,"In France, where I grew up, nobody would bat an eyelid if they heard you say you were on your way to the “osteo”—unsurprising, given that a 2021 survey estimates the number of osteopaths in France at a whopping 49 per every 100,000 people. So, when my therapist in the UK referred me to an osteopath to help get my nervous system down to a more manageable baseline, I was more than willing. Osteopathy is an alternative, hands-on approach to healthcare (pun intended) that involves the physical manipulation of bodily tissues and bones to facilitate holistic healing. Though it is still wholly under-studied, a recent analysis of all the research that has been published so far found evidence it can help improve a variety of physical and psychological ailments. While it’s more commonly known to be effective for conditions like arthritis and osteoporosis, osteopathy is also often recommended—at least in France—for a host of other health issues as well, including tension headaches and even endometriosis. But, if osteopathy is so wide-ranging in its proven and potential benefits, why don’t more Americans consult osteopaths—or even know of it as an option? Below, we take a closer look at the proven and purported health benefits of osteopathy that are surely behind its continued popularity among French and European women—and explore why this practice hasn’t yet made its way fully across the pond. Osteopathy exists in the U.S., but the terminology is different, so here we’ll start by defining it as it’s practiced in Europe. In countries like France and the UK, patients will routinely consult an osteopath as part of their healthcare arsenal, alongside physicians and other practitioners. Europeans will typically consult osteopaths for aches and pains in their muscles and joints, or to help improve their posture, but those aren’t the only ailments the practice can treat. “Osteopathy is a manual approach whose aim is to restore mobility to the body’s tissues, which in turn helps to promote the body’s healthy function and self-healing,” says Arnaud Marguin, a registered osteopath who practices in Paris, France. He explains that osteopaths work on parts of the body that have restrictions in movement, “helping the body to return to its natural balance.” Marguin cites musculoskeletal pain (lower back pain, neck pain, sprains), digestive issues (acid reflux, bloating), and headaches as some of the conditions for which osteopathy is most helpful. Osteopathy has many things in common with chiropractic, but employs a more holistic approach to body work (while chiropractic care is more focused on the spine, according to the UK health service Patient). A typical osteopathy session lasts between 20 minutes and an hour and begins with a detailed review of the patient’s medical history, followed by questions about their lifestyle and current symptoms, Marguin says. The osteopath then performs a series of neurological, postural, and mechanical tests to identify any mobility restrictions. Based on these findings, they deliver a personalized treatment that may include gentle manipulation, mobilization, and other hands-on techniques, he says. Amberin Fur, an osteopath and clinical director of The Vital Practice in London, UK, goes further, explaining that osteopathy is a kind of “lifestyle medicine” that can’t be reduced to just the hands-on treatment. “The advice, exercise and communication is an essential part of the process,” she says. “There is great care in understanding the person as a whole, to gain a view on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the symptom picture.” Marguin notes that osteopathy is becoming increasingly popular across Europe, a trend he attributes in part to a growing public interest in preventative healthcare and holistic well-being. He highlights osteopathy’s comprehensive approach and the typically longer duration of sessions compared to traditional doctors’ appointments as important factors. “In the context of an aging population and a crisis in healthcare systems around the world, osteopathy represents an effective and non-invasive alternative which can improve people’s quality of life,” he adds. It’s hard to say why osteopathic manipulation has remained so popular in Europe since it first arrived there, as opposed to its relegation into obscurity in the U.S., but one explanation might be that—speaking very generally from my own personal experience—people there tend to be more open-minded about alternative medicine and holistic therapies. Also, proximity: You can be in the middle of nowhere in France and still have easy access to an organic food shop and an acupuncturist. Even now that I live in London, my naturopath happens to be a French transplant, which I don’t think is all that coincidental. But, while osteopathy is technically categorized as an alternative therapy, there’s also a fair amount of scientific evidence for its effectiveness. Various professional bodies in France recommend osteopathy for treating musculoskeletal, neurosensory, pulmonary, pediatric, gynecological, and digestive disorders (including IBS). Still, as one systemic review of the literature found, the strongest evidence available mostly points to osteopathy’s effectiveness in treating issues like low back pain and sciatica, while some evidence shows it could be helpful for dealing with tension headaches, endometriosis, and low back and pelvic pain in pregnant women. Some researchers also believe, as a growing body of evidence continues to show, that osteopathy may be helpful in alleviating mental health symptoms (including lessening anxiety, managing stress and even improving depressive symptoms). While more research is needed on this front, my own visit to the osteo for help dealing with anxiety and regulating my nervous system proved fruitful. I’ve found each session incredibly helpful in bringing me back to a manageable baseline of calm—something I often struggle to achieve on my own. Overall, though, as pointed out by a 2022 article published in the McGill Office for Science and Society, there is still a lack of solid scientific evidence supporting osteopathy. Fur believes that’s largely due to the matter of funding: “These trials are extremely expensive and need to be backed by big organizations who often have the resources to continually pursue the outcomes.” Perhaps even more importantly, randomized controlled trials—widely considered the gold standard for scientific validation—aren’t well-suited to studying osteopathy, Fur explains. Manual therapies involve numerous variables that are difficult to control or replicate within such a rigid framework, she says, making it hard to accurately reflect real-world clinical practice. In areas where there isn’t enough research, it’s still worth looking at experienced practitioners’ own history of treatment outcomes. Because of constraints from a UK advertising body, Fur and her fellow practitioners can only claim to treat a list of ailments which she finds a bit vague and limiting, including lumbago (or lower back pain), digestion problems, and generalized aches and pains. But, “through 30 years of clinical work, I have seen all sorts of tangible and remarkable health gains, and patients’ lives that have been affected from it,” Fur says. “These can range from more typical things like improvement with joint pain and spinal injuries to long Covid and stress management.” Put simply, osteopathy can be a helpful addition to a well-rounded healthcare toolbox for supporting overall vitality—if you can access it, that is. You wouldn’t guess it, but osteopathy was actually born in the U.S. by a physician named Dr. Andrew Taylor in the latter half of the 19th century. That said, the practice evolved differently in the U.S. than elsewhere around the world. “In Europe, osteopathy has remained a separate manual practice, which focuses on treating restrictions in mobility,” explains Marguin. While European-style osteopathy doesn’t exist as a separate practice in the U.S., that’s not to say it doesn’t exist at all. Stateside, it’s actually referred to as osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), and it’s just one component of osteopathic medicine. To get more granular, OMT is a system of hands-on techniques used by Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (DOs). “An osteopathic physician is fully qualified to practice medicine in the United States, just like MDs,” explains Nicholas Generales, DO and board-certified family medicine physician in Los Angeles. That means they can also prescribe medication in the same way MDs can. “The key difference is that DOs have the qualification to perform (OMT),” Generales adds. Generales describes OMT as useful for treating a somewhat wider range of conditions than European-style osteopathy claims to. “OMT can be used to help treat many diseases of every organ system in the body,” he says. “For example, OMT can be used to help patients with anxiety, gastrointestinal diseases, and respiratory diseases.” So, if OMT is so beneficial and if all DOs are trained in it, why don’t they practice it? You can probably guess. “OMT takes time, and with the reality of poor insurance reimbursement in the United States, many DOs may choose to not practice OMT,” says Generales. If you’re looking to improve some of your symptoms in a more holistic way, you can seek out U.S.-based DOs who actively practice OMT. For now, at least, doing so just might involve a bit more research than if, say, you happened to find yourself in France and could just google “osteopath near me.”"
https://goop.com/wellness/health/westin-heavenly-bed-review/,The Bed That Changed the Way We Sleep,0,"It’s 1998 and you’re on a business trip. You arrive at your hotel late at night and get into bed. The duvet is itchy, and the floral pattern printed on it is an affront to your design aesthetic. The mattress is somehow both hard and unsupportive. You wake up tired, and a little sore. You don’t think about it. This is normal. You’ll sleep better when you get home. The major hotel groups haven’t tried to outdo your bed at home, or, really, even match it. This would change, of course. And it began, largely, with one bed, the following year. In 1999, Westin Hotels introduced the Heavenly Bed. Instead of a basic mattress made of innerspring coils, this was a custom-designed pillow-top mattress. Instead of two even more basic pillows, you now got five pretty good pillows. Instead of scratchy polyester-cotton linens, you had three crisp sheets ranging in thread count from 180 to 250. To promote the rollout that year, Westin lined up beds outside the New York Stock Exchange, and a skydiver in Savannah parachuted over the Savannah River, and landed on a Heavenly Bed. This was a Big Bet. And it worked. Guest satisfaction and guest occupancy went up at Westin hotels when the Heavenly Bed was installed in rooms. And in the coming years, publications like The Wall Street Journal would cover the “full-scale hotel bed war” that broke out after the Heavenly Bed’s debut, wherein the other major hotel groups invested in upgrading their beds. And since then, we’ve been sleeping all the better for it. In 1999, it was unusual for a hotel to sell their mattress directly to consumers, which Westin started doing over a hotline. By the beginning of 2024, they had sold more than half a million Heavenly Beds (sadly not all via hotline). And in 2025, it makes sense that here on goop, where we’re a little (a lot) sleep-obsessed, we’re carrying Westin’s new, modernized, and perfected version of that legacy bed. It took Westin about eight years to get it right, and when you sleep on it, you feel like they really did. The next-generation Heavenly Bed has a plush top mattress. And that has a soft, yet supportive top layer. An innovative silver weave was added with the intention of keeping us cool and comfortable. Tweaks were made throughout the layers of the mattress to better absorb and diffuse motion. (And yes, Westin reported that the mattress components meet OEKO-TEX standards and are free of PBDE flame retardants.) Now, the duvet is slightly oversize—it feels fuller, cozier. The linens are a blend of cotton and lyocell (made from eucalyptus and other botanicals). They’re a bit more resistant to wrinkling and pilling, and soft and cool to the touch. And instead of a reflective sheen, the linens have a matte finish now. The previous all-white aesthetic has been updated with a grey blanket and full-frame piping on the pillows. The middle sheet, bed skirt, and bolster pillow: gone. Overall, it looks more modern. It’s the kind of bed we’d be happy to sleep in occasionally while traveling (Westin started rolling out this newest version to their properties last year), but preferably, we’d have the pleasure of sinking into it every night—and luckily, we now can. The Westin Bora Bora When Westin launched the original Heavenly Bed in 1999, neither the sleep industry, nor the wellness industry, as we think of those things today, existed. People at the company, though, appreciated a good night’s rest. And they had some consumer research that suggested travelers did, too. (In a survey of 600 business travelers, 82 percent disliked something about the hotel bed at the time. Ouch.) It makes sense that Westin started to prioritize sleep by changing something so basic, so foundational as the bed. And it also feels right that the basics of well-being are what they continue to focus on. Today, sleep (or rather “sleep well”) remains one of Westin’s key pillars, alongside eating well and moving well—which often brings them back to sleeping well. For example, Westin has a food menu designed around supporting sleep. One of their gear-lending kits includes things like Bala weights for working out, but another includes things like compression boots and percussive massage devices for recovery and rest. Because we know a lot of well-being comes back to sleep. And because when you’re traveling, a lot of maintaining—and when possible, enhancing—your well-being comes back to how much, and how well, you’re able to sleep. This is what we set out to explore more with the team at Westin in our new video series, Sleep Training for Grown-Ups. In it, our own long-time sleep enthusiast Gwyneth is joined by sleep physician and research scientist Cheri Mah, MD. You can watch the first installment here."
https://goop.com/wellness/health/aescape-robot-massage-review/,I Got a Robot Massage and Things Got Metaphysical,0,"Let’s play Imagine for a moment. Imagine the pressure is perfect. The brook is babbling. Your muscles are syrupy. Maybe a pearl of drool slides down your lips. Imagine, from your scapula to your hamstrings, as if by X-ray vision, this massage is delivering you somatic bliss. There’s just one thing: your masseuse is a robot. Dealbreaker? Aescape, pronounced ‘escape,’ is the New York based start-up behind the first fully automated, AI massage, which they unveiled across ten Equinox locations in August. As a denizen of Chinatown spas, an interloper at places like The Well, and an owner of a feeble electric back massager—a robot massage falls smack within my area of interest. They invite me to their headquarters in Chelsea where I’m greeted by two women with blindingly white smiles, holding a stack of athletic clothing. It’s a typical techy office: fluorescent light so bright I forget what time of day it is, glass conference rooms, and a fridge stacked with little cups of Greek yogurt and Spindrifts, probably. I’m ushered inside the massage room where the set-up is somehow biblical: a table waits for me in the center, lit from its underbelly, with giant robot arms recoiled politely. Just like scripture. I shed my clothes and don the compression spandex that substitutes the massage oil. Rule one of Aescape: Thy robot doth not touch thy skin. “Our research said one in five [people] would get massages regularly if they weren’t from a person,” Eric Litman, the founder and CEO tells me over Zoom a couple months after my massage. He’s perched at a conference table, his high-tech video camera autofocuses and zooms in on whatever makes noise, like a robot’s eye, whipping me from his face to his typing assistant. Litman emphasizes that Aescape is not meant to replace human massages, but is simply a different product. It’s for someone in a time crunch, someone who doesn’t want to be naked with a stranger, or someone who wants more control within a massage… and would prefer a robot, would be the end of that sentence. Litman doesn’t say that, though. Of course, the robots are also intended to maximize efficiency, promising to deliver the value of a full 60-minute massage in just 30 minutes, for $60 bucks. (“Because, as we all know, the sign of a truly great massage is hoping it’ll be over soon,” Stephen Colbert says.) Whatever ideas they were banking on are paying off. Upon release, Aescape sparked a media frenzy, and they’ve since expanded to the Palace Hotel in New York, Privai Spa in Miami, and, as of December, Pause Studio in Los Angeles. They raised $85 million in funding, and were featured in the Time 200 Best Inventions of 2024, alongside a “blue collar robot,” a “steady surgeon,” and a “hard-working humanoid bot.” Industrious! If Aescape’s success is a sign of the times, no time like the present, eh? Once I’m on the table with my head in the hole, I’m face-to-face with a screen that tells me to hold still. Using infrared sensors, it clocks 1.2 million data points in a 3D scan and presents a mini avatar of my musculature. I hear the robot’s arms extend in a whirring noise like a vending machine, and there’s an awkward pause, just before it lays its hands on me, where I half expect a whispered “just relax.” Up until that point, I was all in. But as it places its heated metal knubs (“Aerpoints” to use their nomenclature) on my skin, I have a flash of the first lines of a book I read in college, Elia Canetti’s Crowds in Power that goes, “There is nothing that man fears more than the touch of the unknown.” I have an acute awareness of my flesh, my frailty, the flimsy spandex, my atrophied muscles. I’m no match for this beast! “We hear from quite a few people that they fall asleep on the table just enjoying it,” says Litman, to my bewilderment. Calling their lodestar Brookstones—you know, those wimpy foot massagers that bulge through faux leather—would be, categorically, an insult to Aescape. “We have a team of massage therapists here that teach the robots with sensors on their hands,” says Litman. While Aescape isn’t aiming to replace all touch with robot knubs, they say they’re helping to address a shortage of massage therapists in the U.S. This checks out: While there’s been roughly a 5 percent increase in massage therapists in the last decade, demand has skyrocketed. (Between 2022 and 2023 alone there was a 16 percent increase in demand and the massage therapy market is projected to more than double in size in the next decade, from $65.23 billion in 2024 to $146.13 billion by 2034.) The next thirty minutes are marked by an ambivalence that’s unusual for me. The panicky feeling stays while the robot kneads along my spine, too close to my vital organs. Can I escape from Aescape if the robot malfunctions and bludgeons me? What if its cool strokes turn malevolent? No, it’s been tested endlessly, I’m sure. The robot’s arms slide my shirt up a few times (unsportsmanlike!) and when I turn around, the arms recoil, as if in offense. But I begin to fiddle with the different controls on the screen, changing the pressure, display and music which quell some anxieties. “It doesn’t sound very healing to me,” Emily Dunuwila, a health initiatives coordinator at Cornell University and a licensed massage therapist, says. “Touch has the capacity to be incredibly healing, but it matters how we touch. Human touch generally is known to reduce cortisol and increase things like serotonin and dopamine which can help our body to get into that rest and digest mode.” As for the touch of a robot? She’s skeptical that it wouldn’t increase cortisol, the stress hormone, and therefore cause muscles to contract (the opposite of the intended goal). But she says what makes for a good massage is trust. And there are elements of trust in Aescape. The screen displays a breakdown of each section of the massage and how long it will spend on each movement. If I don’t like something, I press a button and it’ll move on, obediently. Once we move to the glutes and quads portion my panic begins to fade. I increase the pressure and marvel that I don’t have to muster the courage to tell a human masseuse. In the taxonomy of people that would enjoy Aescape, the spectrum is: doesn’t want to be naked and touched by a stranger, to, got their pump on, pressed for time, and wants to blitz their glutes for fifteen minutes. As a closeted gym bro, I might really like this! The robot uses machine learning to understand how to tailor the massage specifically to you, but there are still kinks. Twice throughout the massage the robot shutters, pulls back and says it needs to readjust the stroke placement. By the end, there was something endearing about its flaws. It’s learning, too. I tell Litman about my fear of being pummeled, and he tells me, “The reality is, the arms aren’t strong enough to push harder than the limits, and we have the limit set in software anyway. You’re in control.” And there is something to be said about a therapy of maximum control. Our world is curated to our liking—tell the algorithm you don’t like something and poof!—but, especially recently, it feels like it’s blooming out of our control. Perhaps outside the bulking robo-arms and somatic release, the real therapy that Aescape offers is an exercise of maximum control. And for many, this is exactly what needs massaging. Paradoxically, for me, it was a ferocious exercise in letting go. The thirty minutes is up. I put on my clothes, give the robot a pat, and am handed a Spindrift that I sip on my way out. On the street, the air is sharp. My body feels fresh—from my escape or the massage, it’s hard to tell."
https://goop.com/wellness/health/ozempic-microdosing/,The Rise of Ozempic Microdosing,0,"Much like those who opt for “baby Botox” or “MicroTox” to smooth wrinkles subtly without a totally frozen face, many people are now microdosing Ozempic to shed a few pounds, while minimizing unpleasant side effects. And now, with new research pointing to broader health benefits—including potential Alzheimer’s protection—losing weight isn’t the only reason people are lining up to ask their doctors about these ‘miracle’ drugs called GLP-1s (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists). So is microdosing—or taking less than the standard dose—of GLP-1 weight loss drugs (which include Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound) a legit practice? Beverly Tchang, MD, an endocrinologist and obesity specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, has been instructing her patients to microdose long before the current GLP-1 revolution. When Ozempic (generically known as semaglutide) was approved by the FDA for adults with type 2 diabetes in 2017, it became clear that even the lowest doses were effective for weight loss, she says. Yes, microdosing is considered off-label—it’s not in the package instructions—but it’s still evidence-based, Tchang says. For example, while the standard starting dose of Ozempic is 0.25 milligrams, studies have shown that a dose of 0.05 milligrams per day is both safe and effective in people with obesity. Lowering the dose can also help people who are struggling with certain side-effects find relief: “Microdosing really helps with GI side effects, like nausea and constipation and reflux,” Tchang says. Anecdotally, people have shared that smaller doses have also helped them avoid other less common symptoms like brain fog. Tchang believes that tailoring doses to the individual just makes sense. “It’s the same concept as personalized nutrition.” The mission of the doctor is to treat the patient with the lowest therapeutic dose, she says. “Why go beyond that? Use the lowest dose that works for you. That’s the crux of microdosing.” Before “microdosing” entered the lexicon, it was called “click counting” and could be done only with the GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, which come in multidose injectable pens, Tchang explains. But now, the rise of GLP-1 compounded medications—custom-made and available through online pharmacies at a fraction of the cost—has broadened access to these drugs and also sparked controversy. Unlike their brand-name counterparts, compounded medications aren’t FDA-approved. “The landscape is riskier than if you were to get that prescription from your doctor who writes an FDA-approved medication that is evidence-based, that has had clinical trials, and it comes directly from the manufacturer,” says Tchang, who consults with both Ro, a telehealth pharmacy that offers compounded semaglutide, and Ozempic’s maker, Novo Nordisk. Nevertheless, many people are seeking out microdoses of compounded GLP-1 drugs through med-spas or plastic surgeon’s offices to lose weight without going to more drastic measures. And while not recommended by doctors, some are even buying online courses from influencers and injecting themselves at home. But as convincing as the marketing can be, when it comes to people who don’t have obesity, we simply don’t have the data to support microdosing, says Elizabeth Sharp, MD, a board-certified internal medicine physician, an assistant professor at Mount Sinai Hospital, and the founder of Health Meets Wellness, a concierge medical practice in New York City. With less information about how those at a lower weight will respond, there’s intrinsically a higher risk, Tchang says. For example, it’s possible that taking weight loss medications at a low dose long-term could lead to loss of bone density and skeletal muscle mass, Sharp says—changes that are hard to reverse, especially as you get older. Despite the lack of data, the buzz is hard to ignore. “A lot of my patients are asking about it,” says Sharp, who is hopeful about the idea of prescribing microdoses of GLP-1 medications for her nonobese patients in the not-so-distant future. “I just think we don’t know right now what that right dose is. And so it is a gray area where people are really experimenting. There isn’t an exact science to it.” The medical community is also grappling with the idea that current definitions of obesity might be wrong—and leaving out people who can benefit from these drugs, Tchang says. “We’re recognizing that the disease of obesity is far more complex than just a number on the scale,” she says. “Obesity really is a problem with energy metabolism. It has to do with how your body handles those calories, whether the body chooses to store them or to burn them. And if it chooses to store them, how does it decide whether to store it in fat or muscle, for example?” In other words, factors like your family history, cholesterol profile, body composition, and how you carry weight should be considered in addition to your weight. Even your ethnicity can play a role, Tchang says: Data shows that some ethnicities start to have metabolic problems like heart disease and diabetes at a relatively lower weight. As Tchang points out, some people may not fit this evolved view of obesity but still want to lose a few pounds to feel their best—or to prevent future health problems. For example, beyond weight management, emerging research suggests that GLP-1 drugs have the potential to prevent heart attacks and strokes and even support people with addiction to quit smoking or drinking. A newly published study found that people prescribed the drugs had a reduced risk of not just substance-abuse disorders, but also suicidal ideations, schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders—as well as clotting problems, infections, liver failure, fatty liver disease, and liver cancer, says Ziyad Al-Aly, M.D., a physician-scientist at Washington University in St. Louis and an author on the study. “Very importantly, we also saw a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia,” Al-Aly says. “And that’s really a significant breakthrough because currently there are no good treatments for [them].” Still, the study was observational and conducted in people with type 2 diabetes, so the findings may not apply to people without diabetes who are taking GLP-1s, Tchang says. It’s tempting to assume a cause-and-effect relationship, but the truth is, these types of studies are really meant to generate more questions than answers, she adds. Another question that remains is whether microdosing would offer similar benefits. “We don’t know because what we studied is the therapeutic, FDA-approved doses,” Al-Aly says. Still, it’s possible that someone looking to lose a little bit of weight and also kick a smoking habit could kill two birds with one stone by talking to their doctor about off-label microdosing, Al-Aly says. Until we get prevention trials—which our healthcare system isn’t incentivized to invest in—we just don’t know whether people who are fairly healthy and don’t have a lot of weight to lose can benefit from taking these medications, Tchang adds. For now, the debate around microdosing Ozempic mirrors that of microdosing psychedelic substances like LSD or psilocybin—some believe it’s a way to tap into mental health perks without a full-blown trip, while others say it’s under-researched or placebo. For the Ozempic-curious, navigating the world of GLP-1 medications can feel like the Wild West. If you’re considering exploring microdosing, your first best step is to consult with your doctor to discuss the benefits and risks.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/supplements-to-support-brain-health/,5 Supplements to Support Brain Health as You Age,0,"Kristine Profeta, MD, wants people to understand that we can have healthy cognition well into old age. “The aged brain is not inevitable. The aged brain is a disease,” she says. In her precision medicine practice, where she mostly works with complex chronic illness, she sees patients with brain health concerns across the board: Many of them would like to be a little quicker; others come in with severe brain fog that could indicate early-onset dementia. “And then there are 80-year-olds who have taken care of their brains and bodies and are as sharp as any 30 or 40-year-olds that I talk to,” she says. With the right care, Profeta says, we can all maintain healthy cognition well into old age. The first thing to understand is that the body is a single system that can’t be segmented; how you care for your body in its entirety will show up in the health of your brain. The second is that the root of most dysfunction is missing nutrients and chronic, systemic inflammation. Her brain health strategy starts right there: Provide nutrients for structural support and activate the body’s innate anti-inflammatory abilities, with benefits for the entire system. Here, her recommendations to support brain health (and overall wellness): Phospolipids make up the double-layered membranes of nearly every single cell in your body, including your brain. Ideally, your body would get all the building blocks it needs to build and maintain these membranes through the food you eat. Profeta says that because our food systems often don’t provide all the nutrients we need to support optimal health—you can point a finger at industrial agriculture for that one—she recommends her patients test for what nutrients they’re missing and make up the gaps with well-formulated supplements. For healthy cell membranes, Profeta likes BodyBio’s liquid phosphaditylcholine, which they call BodyBio PC (Phospholipid Complex). It’s manufactured so that the phosphaditylcholine molecules inside are organized into liposomes: bubbles of phospholipids with the same double-layered structure as the membranes in your body. “Liposomes can cross cell membranes and get absorbed more readily,” she says. Studies show that the optimal ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3s in our diets is four to one, Profeta says. That’s been established since the ‘90s. But today, you usually hear people pushing for omega-3s and condemning omega-6s—especially those that come from seed oils. (On seed oils, Profeta says: Unadulterated oils extracted from raw seeds are typically good for us.) Overdoing omega-3s eventually does more harm than good. She suggests making a trail mix with a blend of natural nuts and seeds, including walnuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and hemp seeds to get closer to the ideal ratio to fight inflammation in the body. Typically, Profeta says, people think of inflammation as something that gets turned on in the body when we’re unhealthy. Really though, she explains, our bodies are set up for inflammation, and an unhealthy system simply fails to turn inflammation off. Specialized pro-resolving mediators, or SPMs, are omega-3 derivatives that help the body manage inflammation, including the low-grade inflammation that can damage brain health long-term. She chooses to supplement with SPMs. Methylation is a complex pathway that impacts thousands of reactions in the body. It is one of the core detoxification pathways, and among hundreds of other things, it is necessary to make optimal neurotransmitters. That’s why it’s essential to support methylation in today’s world: If we don’t get enough B vitamins and methyl groups (methylated B vitamins are a way to get both) then we will not be able to optimally detoxify or support brain health, Profeta says. “It’s super, super important to be drinking a mineralized form of water or taking a mineral supplement as an active supplement every day,” Profeta says. Minerals play fundamental and vital roles in the body’s communication systems as ions and enzyme mediators. Profeta is concerned that, like other nutrient building blocks in our bodies, we don’t get enough minerals from our food—and that the presence of potentially-toxic heavy metals outcompete the healthy ones for the same enzymes. Lastly, Profeta emphasizes the importance of good sleep, which allows the brain to clear out cellular debris. She advocates for good sleep hygiene and a wind-down routine, which trains the brain’s limbic system—putting away screens, turning the lights down low, and reading something light.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/avoid-digestive-issues-while-traveling/,How to Avoid—and Fix—Digestive Issues While You’re Traveling,0,"When your routines, diet, and physical activity levels—which all impact gut health—are disrupted, your digestive system can become imbalanced. That’s why any kind of travel—whether it’s for a night or a week—can feel like a big disruption. “Then you get a little bloated, abdominal distension, cramping, constipation, or diarrhea,” says Elizabeth Sharp, MD, IFMCP, a functional and board-certified internal medicine physician. “None of that is fun—not at any time, but especially when you’re on the move.” Sharp recommends doing six things to help maintain a healthy gut while you’re traveling. As always, talk with your doctor about any gut health concerns and seek emergency care when needed. “One of the biggest issues that people experience as they travel is that they’re eating different foods than they do in their day-to-day lives,” says Sharp. Of course, trying new foods is a key part of the travel experience. To help stabilize your gut, Sharp suggests incorporating fruits and vegetables as much as possible—the fiber helps regulate the gut. As an extra precaution, she recommends eating fruits that you must peel to eat (e.g., bananas, oranges, and avocados) and cooked vegetables. This helps reduce exposure, as much as possible, to microbes that could cause traveler’s diarrhea. Prebiotics balance out gut microbiota by providing food sources for healthy gut bacteria and inhibit the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria. When you’re on the go, Sharp says that unripe bananas (they contain the prebiotic inulin and prebiotic-like starches that aren’t found in ripe bananas), flaxseed, and oatmeal (the less processed, the better) are some convenient ways to get them. Generally, research shows that prebiotics like inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) can help prevent and improve gut imbalances like constipation and diarrhea. For probiotic foods, Sharp says that kimchi and yogurt are great sources to incorporate into your meals whenever you can. When you’re supplementing with probiotics, research shows that Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus fermentum may be effective in preventing and treating traveler’s diarrhea, with Saccharomyces boulardii playing a key role. For constipation, studies suggest that an array of probiotics can help, including Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium animalis. And for abdominal bloating and distension (and other symptoms of IBS), the research is less clear, but Escherichia, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium strains may help. Choosing a probiotic with as many of these strains as possible can increase your chances of the supplement addressing various gut imbalances. Giving yourself time between meals helps your body move food through the digestive tract and regulates your gut, Sharp says. It allows the migrating motor complex (MMC)—a pattern of gut movement that’s designed to propel food down the small and large intestines—to activate. About two hours after a meal, the MMC is triggered, and it reengages every 90 to 120 minutes until you eat again. But it activates only between meals—when you’re not eating or drinking (except for noncaloric beverages like water, plain coffee, or tea). That means if your meals aren’t spaced at least three to four hours apart, you can increase your chances of constipation. Staying hydrated helps keep all your bodily functions flowing, including your digestive system. Sharp says that in addition to getting plenty of water, adding electrolytes like magnesium, potassium, and calcium can help you rehydrate. “Exercise is one of the best ways to help in terms of keeping some regularity with digestion,” says Sharp. Research shows that it increases metabolism and acutely modifies gut microbiota activity to optimize digestive health. And it can improve mood by regulating the gut-brain axis. Sharp says that it doesn’t have to be an intense gym workout: “If you walk, especially while you’re exploring a new city, you could get up to anywhere from four to six miles a day without even realizing it.” Sharp says that having a routine can indirectly help with digestive health—it sends a message to our brain that we’re winding down for the night, which triggers our mind and body to relax. This improves digestion and sets us up for a better night’s sleep, which is when our MMC is activated and digestive repair occurs. To start, she recommends avoiding food a few hours before bedtime—it allows your blood sugar levels to return to baseline, which helps your body relax. When you get closer to bedtime, she says to take at least five minutes to wind down before bed by doing a short meditation, listening to calming music, or putting away your phone and other electronics. “Whatever works best for you,” says Sharp. The goal is to take a relaxing moment before going to bed to prepare for a more restorative sleep.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/lymphatic-massages-services/,What Can—and Can’t—Lymphatic Drainage Massages Do?,0,"Our lymphatic vessels are designed to regularly move fluid that’s filled with various substances like proteins, minerals, and white blood cells throughout the body. When we contract our muscles as we move, it creates pressure that allows the fluid to flow. But if the lymphatic system is impaired—due to lymphedema (a chronic disease that leads to accumulation of fluids in the body), surgeries, chronic inflammation, or lack of movement for long periods of time—excess fluids can accumulate in the body, which in turn impairs the immune and circulatory systems. Lymphatic drainage massages are designed to increase the flow of fluids in the body so that there’s less buildup. They can help increase blood circulation and immune function, too. Tina Tsan, DAOM, CLT, a certified lymphatic drainage massage therapist, has performed this type of massage for 18 years, primarily for clients with lymphedema. But within the last five years, her clientele has expanded to include postoperative patients: Doctors now refer individuals who’ve had orthopedic surgery—and, at increasing rates, cosmetic surgery, including liposuction, breast implants, tummy tucks, Brazilian butt lifts, and facelifts. “All of these surgical procedures result in postsurgical swelling,” Tsan says. That’s because most surgeries inevitably disrupt the lymphatic vessels, which allow fluid to circulate throughout the body. Most recently, Tsan has seen more people request drainage massages for nonsurgical reasons, like to reduce inflammation caused by lupus, Lyme disease, rheumatoid arthritis, digestive issues, and other inflammatory conditions. And she sees clients who want the massages for preventive care—to help their bodies detox, to improve circulation, and to support immunity. But when it comes to using lymphatic drainage massages for weight management—an application for which Tsan has also seen an uptick in requests—she says there’s no scientific evidence to support its effectiveness. It can help with bloating, she says, because it can move fluid buildup in the abdomen area and decrease inflammation. “But specifically emulsifying fats to give you a flat stomach—I don’t think it does that,” she says. You might wonder where the fluid drains to after the massage. “You’re going to eliminate it from your body via urination,” Tsan says. Most people usually urinate soon, sometimes immediately, after the lymphatic massage. Credentials are key when looking for a lymphatic massage therapist: A CLT (certified lymphedema therapist) or an MLD (manual lymphatic drainage) therapist is the most reputable. A massage therapist without a lymphatic drainage massage certification, Tsan says, is not qualified to do a lymphatic massage—there’s an additional 135 hours of training required to learn the proper technique. You can find a qualified professional in your area through the Academy of Lymphatic Studies or Norton School of Lymphatic Therapy. Tsan’s tip: Ask your therapist whether they’re trained in the Vodder Method—it’s the original manual lymphatic drainage massage technique, named after the person credited with developing it. She says that if they are, it’s a good sign that they’re properly trained. Location: Los Angeles Find her at: Harmony Lymphatics Tina Tsan, DAOM, CLT, offers manual lymphatic drainage massages in the comfort of your home.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/sweat-and-your-health/,What Could Sweat-Sensing Devices Tell You about Your Health?,0,"We all sweat. It can be inconvenient (and annoying), but it has a purpose: to help us maintain a steady body temperature so we don’t overheat. Sweat is mostly water. But it also contains electrolytes (e.g., sodium, potassium, chloride), metabolites (e.g., glucose, lactate), proteins (e.g., cytokines, interleukins), vitamins and minerals (vitamins C and D, calcium, zinc), and even hormones (e.g., estrogen, progesterone, cortisol). Which means that measuring what exactly is in our sweat, using an arm or finger patch, has alluring potential to lend insight into our overall health without drawing blood. There are some sweat-sensing devices currently on the market, like the Gx Sweat Patch, but they can measure electrolytes and metabolites only. These devices are primarily marketed to athletes, who can use them to analyze sweat during workouts and optimize their rehydration strategies. “Sweat is this noninvasive window into the body,” says Tyler Ray, PhD, a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Hawaii and a scientific advisor for Epicore Biosystems, the creator of the Gx Sweat Patch. His lab has created a sweat-sensing device generated by a 3D printer to stick to your forearm. “It allows us to collect sweat very precisely—as it’s coming out from the body over a continuous phase—so we can look at what’s happening in sweat in real time,” Ray says. (For now, it’s used only in research contexts.) Wei Gao, PhD, a medical engineering professor at the California Institute of Technology, has published data showing the potential for the stress hormone cortisol to be measured with a sweat-sensing patch. His study suggests that cortisol levels in sweat correlate with cortisol levels in blood, validating the potential for this hormone (and others) to be accurately measured by sweat-sensing devices. Earlier this year, Gao’s lab was the first to publish data measuring estradiol—a form of estrogen—using a sweat-sensing device. Gao says that this finding shows a potential to change women’s health: Frequently monitoring hormone fluctuations throughout the menstrual cycle or during perimenopause and menopause, for example, could provide data that would expand our current knowledge and view of these physiological phases. There’s also potential for sweat-sensing devices to help diagnose and treat infectious diseases, brain and mental health conditions, hormone imbalances, and other health concerns. But developing this technology doesn’t come without challenges. “Sweat, of course, has its own limitation,” Gao says. The size of proteins and hormones must be considered—it’s easier to measure small molecules from sweat than larger ones because smaller ones diffuse through the skin’s pores more freely. Scientists also need enough sweat to measure these biomarkers effectively. “The challenge is that there is typically a hundredfold dilution in what is measured in sweat versus what you could measure in blood,” Ray says. That means it’s much harder to detect the same biomarkers that would be present in blood, and a certain volume of sweat is needed to do that. Creating sweat sensors to measure various biomarkers poses additional challenges, but the researchers I talked to are focused on their vision. “Being able to fully monitor and understand what’s happening with your body in real time—when you want it and when you need it—is going to be really transformative,” Ray says."
https://goop.com/wellness/health/ahiflower-omega-3-oil-for-dogs/,A Dog Wellness Brand’s Innovative Approach to Supplements—and Treats,0,"Omega-3s, the healthy fats that are beneficial for our overall health, are also great for dogs. They are anti-inflammatory fatty acids: They activate parts of the immune system that help to reduce inflammation. Research shows that omega-3s can improve a dog’s brain development, cognition, gut health, kidney function, and heart and joint health. And some studies suggest that omega-3s (together with amino acids and prebiotics) can help shorten a dog’s recovery time after surgery. “Omega-3s can also help improve coat quality in conditions that may cause diminished coat or skin health, such as allergies, hypothyroidism, or other metabolic disorders,” says Stephanie Liff, DVM, the medical director at Pure Paws Veterinary Care. Research shows that it’s important that omega-3s are paired with omega-6s—a fatty acid that, when in balance with omega-3s, works to heal and repair cells throughout the body. Liff says to look for supplement formulas that have a ratio of five omega-6s (or fewer) to every one omega-3. Too many omega-6s, when not balanced with omega-3s, can lead to chronic inflammation. We like the omega oil supplement from WagWell—a dog wellness brand that works with food scientists, board-certified veterinary nutritionists, and top pet product formulators to create some of the best treats and supplements to support a dog’s overall health. (You can find some of its products at select goop stores.) WagWell’s omega supplement uses Ahiflower oil instead of fish: It’s a trademarked vegan oil that comes from the Buglossoides arvensis plant, which is naturally rich in omega-3s. The oil is designed to meet a four-to-one ratio, which means it has four omega-6s to every one omega-3—a healthy balance. It has a variety of omega-3s—including SDA (stearidonic acid), ALA, and GLA—which increases the bioavailability of these healthy fats. (And, of course, it saves many fish from an untimely demise.) Liff blends the oil directly into her dog’s food—WagWell recommends one pump per day for dogs under 60 pounds and two pumps for dogs over 60 pounds—and finds an empty bowl shortly after, a sign of her dog’s approval. When it comes to treats, Liff says that lean meats and fish and many fruits and veggies work well—just steer clear of garlic, onions, raisins, grapes, avocado, and nuts. She says most pets can tolerate peanuts, but they usually don’t need the added fat. Liff gives her dog WagWell’s cheese and beef treats, too—they’re freeze-dried to preserve nutrients and flavor and don’t contain fillers, corn, wheat, or soy. (You can use them as a food topper or as a high-protein snack.) Her dog also likes having Omega Chews and Mobility Chews added to her food. “They entice her to eat, whereas otherwise she would wait all day.” Liff recommends that you consult your vet prior to supplementing or adding treats to your dog’s diet.

A community of seekers who come to connect more deeply with themselves, others, and the world around them. And, of course, a gift bag filled with some of the best beauty and wellness products from the goop shop. The latest installment delivered on all fronts. Thanks to our partners at Hyatt—who graciously hosted us at the Park Hyatt Aviara, one of the hotels in their Wellbeing Collective—the whole weekend had the backdrop of sprawling, lush grounds and gorgeous views. (More on that later.) The day’s highlights included a morning talk between psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb and grief therapist Claire Bidwell Smith, an aromatherapy meditation class led by Miraval Life in Balance Spa specialist Claudia Yates, and a workshop on the science of attachment led by the renowned couples therapist and researcher Stan Tatkin. A meaningful chat between Gwyneth, Emma Grede, and Justina Blakeney brought the day to a close. Without further ado, here’s everything that was in this year’s (very heavy) gift bags. Between classes and workshops, guests had time to explore our wellness playground. Experiences included astrology readings by KJ Atlas; B12 shots by the Hydration Room; ear seeds by Dr. Natazia Stolberg, LAc, DACM; gua sha scalp messages by YINA; red-light therapy by HigherDOSE; a salt electrolyte station by Redmond Real Salt; and wellness cocktails by MyWellCo. The guests who spent the weekend with us (we call them our Weekenders) stayed at the Park Hyatt Aviara for two nights. Their curated itinerary reflected so much of what the Hyatt Wellbeing Collective properties have to offer: connection and community through a stunning dinner alfresco, true restoration via treatments at the Miraval Life in Balance Spa Aviara, and immersion in nature thanks to a hike along the Batiquitos Lagoon. The rooms themselves were so tranquil—luxurious and spacious, all with balconies, beautiful views, and blissful soaking tubs."
https://goop.com/wellness/health/do-your-workout-clothes-contain-endocrine-disrupting-microplastics/,Do Your Workout Clothes Contain Endocrine-Disrupting Microplastics?,0,"We’ve come across some alarming headlines in the last year suggesting that workout clothes potentially expose us to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Before throwing out all our workout gear, we paused—and decided to investigate. Here’s what we found after digging into the research and talking to five experts in environmental health, plastic toxicity, and bioengineering. As the name suggests, microplastics are tiny particles of plastic, less than five millimeters long. They fall into two categories: Primary microplastics, which are microplastics directly released into the environment as small particles. And secondary microplastics, which come from larger plastics (like bags, bottles, or fishing nets) that break off into tiny pieces over time. The world’s largest source of primary microplastics is clothing—accounting for an estimated 35 percent. (Car tires are the second largest primary microplastic source.) About 70 percent of clothes produced around the world are made from plastic (synthetic) materials: polyester, nylon, acrylic, and elastane (a polyurethane-polyurea copolymer that’s also known by its brand names, Lycra and spandex). Tiny pieces of synthetic fabric break off from clothing—due to friction caused by washing and wearing—creating microplastics. Because of their chemical structure, microplastics attach easily to known endocrine-disrupting chemicals—including dioxins, pesticides (like DDT), brominated flame retardants, phthalates, and bisphenol A (BPA)—in the environment. That means that the endocrine disruptors go everywhere that microplastics do: domestic water systems, rivers, lakes, oceans, and the air. Eventually they make their way into our bodies—scientists have found evidence of microplastics and nanoplastics (smaller pieces of microplastics) in human blood, intestines, lungs, kidneys, livers, hearts, reproductive organs, and even placentas. They can disrupt critical reproductive and metabolic hormone-regulating connections, like the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, as well as the HP-testicular, HP-thyroid, and HP-adrenal axes, for example. Some studies suggest that microplastics disturb the immune system’s normal response and damage immune cells. Some of the same harmful chemicals that attach to microplastics from the environment, like BPA, are also found in clothes that are made from synthetic materials, according to Kizzy Charles-Guzman, the chief executive officer at the Center for Environmental Health, a nonprofit organization that works to reduce people’s exposure to toxic chemicals. These synthetic materials are not unique to workout clothing, but how we wear workout garments may mean that they pose a greater health risk than other clothing does, at least hypothetically. For example, workout clothes, like sport bras and leggings, are designed to fit tightly—directly against our skin. Research shows that microplastics can enter the body through sweat glands, hair follicles, and skin wounds; the close contact could increase the chances of harmful chemicals getting into our bodies. Plus, we probably sweat in workout gear more than we do in any other kind of clothing—preliminary data suggest that sweat may increase the chances of microplastics and toxic chemicals moving through the skin into the body. If and how our workout clothes are leaching microplastics and endocrine disruptors directly into our bodies is theoretical, though. “Our understanding of the full impact of microplastics as carriers of endocrine disruptors—that’s still evolving,” says Jeff Karp, PhD, a Harvard Medical School professor and MIT bioengineer. We need more investigation to elucidate the exact impact on our health—and true solutions will follow. “Any time there’s a problem that gets to be well understood in society, it then creates this crucible moment to focus innovation on it,” Karp says. What we do know for certain is that microplastics are getting into our bodies—in different ways and from various sources. And reducing the chances for them to do so can benefit our health. There are a few ways you can limit your microplastic exposure from clothing, along with the amount of microplastics you release into the world. For more information about what you can do to reduce the number of microfibers that enter the environment and to minimize your plastic footprint, the Plastic Soup guide and app are great places to start. And if you’d like to learn more ways to limit your exposure to microplastics and harmful chemicals in your workout clothes (and other products), the Center for Environmental Health and Toxic-Free Future are excellent resources.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/which-milk-is-best-for-your-body-and-the-planet/,Which Milk Is Best for Your Body—and the Planet?,0,"Whether you’re navigating the dairy aisle or ordering a latte, choosing the best milk can be more complicated than we’d like. There’s taste to consider, of course, but many of us are also concerned about how our milk choices affect our health and impact the environment. “This conversation is never straightforward,” says nutritionist Maya Feller, MS, RD, CDN. “What’s good for one person may not be suitable for another.” There are many factors to consider—like food allergies and sensitivities, nutrition, environmental impact, animal welfare, taste, and texture. Even if one milk has a compelling nutritional profile, your overall health is the priority—avoid milks that include ingredients that you may be allergic or sensitive to, no matter how good they seem on paper. And for all your health concerns, like your nutritional needs or food allergies or sensitivities, consult your doctor and nutritionist. If you’re considering the environmental impact of your milk choice, Dora Marinova, PhD, a professor of sustainability at the Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute, says that there’s more to consider than the milk itself. “How we package milk has a huge environmental footprint,” says Marinova. “If you use packaging that cannot be recycled or decomposed, you are solving one problem but creating others—in some cases, the environmental footprint of the packaging is 10 times higher than the content of the milk.” For example, Marinova says many plant-based milks come in boxes that are lined with plastics. It’s difficult—and, in some locations, impossible—to recycle them. She recommends that you check with your local recycling facility or purchase milks that come in standard recyclable containers. (We also like the company TerraCycle, which works to recycle single-use plastics and other hard-to-recycle materials.) Here’s a nutritional and environmental breakdown of the most popular milks in the US. Note: Values may vary depending on the brand you purchase, whether it’s fortified with vitamins and minerals, and whether it comes with added flavors. Look for brands with fewer binding ingredients and added sugars. Nutrition: Compared to plant-based milks, Feller says that cow’s milk is more nutrient-dense: It has about 8.2 grams of protein per serving (or eight ounces); at least 20 percent of the daily value of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin B2 (riboflavin); about 10 percent of the daily value of vitamin D; and about 11.5 grams of sugar. It also has some heart-healthy fat in it, she says, and the lowest percentage of water—88 percent—compared to plant-based milks. Environmental: Cow’s milk is well-known for its high environmental footprint—including land use, greenhouse gas emissions, fresh water use, and eutrophication (the rapid growth of microorganisms in a body of water, caused by runoff, that leads to oxygen depletion). Its environmental impact is higher than that of all plant-based milk options by at least two times. Nutrition: Of all the plant-based milks, Feller says that soy stands out as being the most nutritionally robust. An eight-ounce cup has about 92 percent water, 6 grams of protein, at least 20 percent of the daily value of calcium and vitamin B2, 10 percent of the daily value of phosphorus and vitamin D, and 9.7 grams of sugar. “The other thing about soy is it’s a complete protein because it has all the essential amino acids that we require as humans,” says Marinova. Environment: There are also environmental benefits to soy milk. “Soy is a legume, which means that it is very good for the soil,” says Marinova. It fixes nitrogen, meaning it converts nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form that can be used by plants—which helps fertilize the soil, so fertilizers aren’t needed during crop rotations. Nutrition: Almond milk is the top-selling alternative milk in the US, yet it’s the least nutritionally robust. “Almond milk has such a big percentage of water in it,” says Marinova. That is, 97 percent water—the largest percentage among plant-based milks. One serving of almond milk has 1 gram of protein, which is one of the lowest of all the alternative milks (except rice and coconut), and about 6 grams of sugar. Its calcium levels, however, are the highest compared to many alternative milks—exceeding 20 percent of the daily value—and it has 10 percent of the daily value of vitamin D. Environment: The environmental impact of almond milk is one of the greatest of plant-based milks. Compared to other plant-based milks, almond milk uses the most fresh water: 372 liters per liter of milk. Rice milk requires 270, oat milk requires 48, and soy requires 28. Nutrition: An eight-ounce glass of oat milk contains about 91 percent water. And it has about 2.7 grams of protein; at least 10 percent of the daily value of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D; 20 percent of the daily value of vitamin B2; and 10 grams of sugar. “I know that there’s a bunch of discussion around oat milk spiking blood sugar levels,” says Feller. “I have to say, I’ve looked at the research and I haven’t come to my own conclusion yet.” When it comes to managing your blood sugar, she says it’s all about the quantity of sugar being consumed (whether you’re drinking a latte with alt-milk or eating dessert) and what you pair it with—preferably protein to help manage your blood sugar levels. If you prefer oat milk but you’re concerned about it spiking your blood sugar levels, Feller suggests that you pair it with a meal. Environment: “Oat milk is really good in terms of its environmental footprint—very, very low,” says Marinova. “Yet it’s grown as a monoculture, which makes it vulnerable to all kinds of bugs and pests. Therefore, we see increased use of pesticides, including glyphosate, which essentially have potentially toxic implications.” Nutrition: Coconut milk—the one in the cartons, not the canned coconut milk for baking—is another popular alternative. Per serving, it has about 0.5 grams of protein, more than 20 percent of the daily value of calcium, 10 percent of the daily value of vitamin D, and about 3 grams of sugar. Environment: Coconut milk also has a very low environmental footprint—one of the lowest of all plant-based milks. And it requires very little water to grow: 3 liters per liter of milk. Yet the increased demand for it has had a big impact: “We’ve seen a lot of devastation of rainforests so that we can grow coconut trees—that’s destruction of native habitat,” says Marinova. Nutrition: A glass of rice milk contains about 89 percent water, 0.7 grams of protein, and 12 grams of sugar. It also has 20 of the percent daily value of calcium and vitamin B2 and 10 percent of the daily value of phosphorus and vitamin D. Environment: “Rice has a higher water footprint,” says Marinova. “It’s about half of that of cow’s.” And its carbon footprint is highest compared to soy, oat, and almond milks. “Rice paddocks naturally develop methane, so when you grow rice, you also add methane in the atmosphere; methane is a stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.” But rice doesn’t require a lot of land to grow. “Rice milk is probably the most efficient, from a land-use aspect,” says Marinova. “In the case of cow’s milk, it requires about 9 square meters per year for one liter of milk, and for rice, it’s 0.3.” It has one of the lowest land-use of plant-based milks (oat uses 0.76 square meters per year; soy, 0.66; and almond, 0.5). Some alternative milks, like hemp, hazelnut, and macadamia, are not as abundant as the others but are still great options if you can find them. “Hemp is a very versatile plant,” says Marinova. “You can use all parts of the plant—you don’t just use the seeds [for milk]. You can use the stalks to make ropes, bags, and clothes and to create building materials. Many people describe it as a game changer for the future.” According to Marinova, because hemp requires a continental climate to grow—cold, long winters and hot summers—it will take some time to commercialize hemp milk (although you can make it at home). Another thing to consider when it comes to the environmental impact of your milk is how far it has traveled. “If you are in southern Europe, hazelnut milk may be a good option because hazelnuts grow there,” says Marinova. “The other nut milk that is quite popular in Australia and South Africa is the Australian macadamia nut. It’s very suited to the climate, and that means that it does not require as much water and it’s adaptable.” Ultimately, the best way to choose your milk—for the environment and your body (and maybe even its taste)—is to diversify your milk choices. Mixing things up is beneficial for the environment because it minimizes the demand on one type of milk, which can have major environmental impact (e.g., devastation of rainforests or other natural habitats to keep up with the demand). Feller says that variety is best for your body, too. “We know that when people eat varied patterns and there’s diversity [in the foods they’re eating], they tend to have a more diverse microbiome,” she says. This is very important for the gut and overall health. “That’s really what we want at the end of the day.” This article is for informational purposes only, even if and regardless of whether it features the advice of physicians and medical practitioners.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/cycle-syncing-nutrition/,"What to Eat (and Avoid) during Each Phase of Your Cycle, according to a Dietitian",0,"Shira Barlow, MS, RD, is a registered dietitian, an author, and a nutrition expert. In her book, The Food Therapist, she shares her disarming and realistic approach to uncomplicating your relationship with food. She’s currently accepting one-on-one clients. Each phase of the menstrual cycle impacts how we feel, what we crave and what we need. In my private nutrition practice, I help clients understand what’s happening during each phase, which gives them insights into what works well for them throughout the month as their hormones shift and where things tend to get challenging. Some of my clients choose to cycle-sync, or align their lifestyle and nutrition habits to their menstrual cycles. In my intake sessions, I ask my clients if they cycle, including how regularly they menstruate, and if they track their cycles closely. Based on their responses, we decide whether it’s appropriate to build cycle syncing into our work together. If yes, they learn what’s happening during each phase of their cycle—each is marked by the rise and fall of hormones—and how to support their bodies during that phase. I have seen noticeable differences for those who choose to cycle sync, including more regular and predictable periods and more comfort throughout their cycles (particularly with PMS symptoms and PCOS clients). I regularly see pregnancy wins with fertility clients. (And I recently had a 40-year-old client with endometriosis have an unplanned pregnancy; she’s thrilled.) I believe cycle syncing has been valuable in those outcomes. Before we get into it, one disclaimer: Menstrual cycles aren’t one-size-fits-all. The length of each cycle, the levels of each hormone, and the timing of ovulation can all vary from person to person. I do recommend tracking cycles on an app to make cycle-syncing more user-friendly. If fertility is something you’re interested in tracking, a couple of my clients really like Ovia Health. For anyone who wants to track their cycle without a fertility lens, my current favorite is Aavia; I recommend this one to anyone for whom fertility is either nonapplicable or triggering and to all my tween and teen clients. The menstrual phase, which begins the day bleeding starts and ends the day bleeding ends, typically lasts three to seven days. During this phase, estrogen and progesterone are low, the lining of the uterus is shedding, and it is common to feel dips in energy and mood. The body craves hibernation, warmth, comfort, and rest. Nutritionally, the menstrual phase is time to focus on warming, mineral-rich, easily digestible, and deeply nourishing foods, with an emphasis on warming foods and spices like ginger (a natural antispasmodic agent helpful for those with painful cramps). Because we often experience bloating and GI motility changes in the menstrual phase, it’s not the best time for cold foods, raw veggies, or giant salads. It is, however, a great time to do stir-fry, fajita vegetables, and big sheet pans of roasted veggies. Comfort and warmth are key during this time: My favorites recipes for this phase are braised meats and chicken, soups, curries, stews, and my anchovy chicken. The follicular phase technically lasts from menstruation to ovulation, but for cycle-syncing purposes, it starts as soon as bleeding ends and lasts until ovulation, around 7 to 10 days. During this phase, estrogen starts to rise steadily, which tends to usher in a boost in mood and energy. The rise of luteinizing hormone (LH) ramps up libido. Much like the melting of the frost in springtime, we tend to feel more like ourselves than we did in the menstrual phase. The ovulatory phase typically takes place roughly 14 days (give or take) after the first day of your period and around 14 days before your next period. It is the shortest phase of the cycle, often only lasting about two or three days. Estrogen and LH are at their highest, and many women tend to feel their absolute best in terms of mood, energy, sex drive, and digestion. However some women can also experience side effects of rapid surges in estrogen—particularly some cramping in the lower abdomen. My favorite recipe during this time is my purple cabbage salad with shredded chicken or broiled salmon. The luteal phase occurs right after ovulation ends and is typically around two weeks long, lasting right up until the next period. After ovulation, LH and estrogen drop (although estrogen does normalize again mid-luteal), while progesterone, the dominant hormone in luteal, starts to rise. The rise in progesterone, which remains high until right before menstruation starts, is responsible for an increase in both appetite and resting metabolic rate. So it’s not just that we crave more food during this time but that we actually need more food; we’re burning through more energy at rest. For this reason, I like to focus on especially hearty, delicious meals that keep blood sugar levels from dipping too low. I recommend that my clients make sure to build in conscious indulgences during this time. My favorites are anything with dark chocolate and peanut butter, and caramelized sweet potato drenched in olive oil or ghee. My top pick for luteal recipes would be my paleo shepherd’s pie. ••• There’s a lot to digest here, and I hope you find it helpful and instructive. But the truth is everyone has their own unique experience with the ebb and flow of hormones during a cycle. These hormone fluctuations translate to changes in comfortability, mood, hunger, sex drive, and energy levels—and a lot more—that can vary from cycle to cycle and over time as well. Hormonal birth control, conditions like PCOS, and life stages like perimenopause can make our cycles less predictable, too. My recommendations for anyone who cycles: Get to know yourself better in this way. Plan ahead when you can. (For instance, make an extra shepherd’s pie to freeze in early luteal; energy levels drop in late luteal, when you’ll be craving comfort food the most.) Let your personal experiences with your cycle guide you and give you ideas for how to best nourish yourself. And most of all, be gentle with yourself.

Duprie has a lot on her plate; wellness keeps the boat afloat. She’s a regular meditator, a habit that kicked off years ago with a powerful experience with hypnotherapy and a life-changing retreat at Esalen. She journals. And she turns toward the beauty in ordinary moments—a cup of tea, her favorite Pilates class, a hike, some time in her garden—to power her through the rest. “It’s about carving out little moments to take care of myself,” she says. Her big project for the year? Launching the first IRL store for her brand Wyeth, now open in Culver City’s Platform. From her home in Studio City, the drive over takes up a solid chunk of her morning. She makes the time count: She catches up on news podcasts and whatever audiobook she’s into lately. But perhaps the best way to pass the time is with great company. Today, she brought along her best friend Ashley Fultz for the drive and a wellness-y morning in Culver. (We tagged along, too.) Duprie’s ride for the day is a rolling sanctuary, the Porsche Cayenne. It’s the ultimate luxury for people on the move: comfortable, spacious, and not only fun to drive but a pleasure to spend time in. Which is especially vital for people who log a lot of time on the road—in commutes like Duprie’s, on school pickup duty, or peacing out of town for the weekend with their most cherished people. The effect is incredible: You’ll find the Cayenne is a reprieve from a busy day, and just as valuable for you-and-me time as your destination is."

https://goop.com/wellness/health/mold-testing-kit/,Do At-Home Mold Testing Kits Really Work?,0,"“Home environments are a big part of health care,” says Michael Rubino, mold and air quality expert and president of Change the Air Foundation, a nonprofit organization that works to improve indoor air quality for people nationwide. “The dust floating around in the air that we breathe can harbor mold and toxins that place extra stress on our bodies, especially our immune system,” he says. Rubino says that about 75 percent of the homes he inspects have significant mold or bacteria contamination, often due to a water leak. If your health is suffering from unknown causes and you suspect it’s due to mold growth, working with a physician and testing your home can help determine whether this is the case. If you have an energy-efficient home, HVAC filtration system, or water damage, you are more likely to have mold contamination, Rubino says. Here’s why: Rubino recently created an innovative way to test for mold called The Dust Test, which checks off three important boxes. Surprisingly, The Dust Test is also simple and fast—it took me less than 10 minutes to collect my samples when I tried it out. And the video and written instructions made it seamless. A 20-minute consultation call with an expert is included with the kit; a mold expert explains and clarifies any questions about your results. Depending on what’s found, they’ll also guide you toward the best next step. In my case, I was guided to change a HEPA filter or two. But they let you know if they think professional remediation is required—Rubino says if that’s the case, it’s imperative that you work with research-based experts in the field who will properly remove it.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/functional-psychiatrist/,Finding a Functional Psychiatrist Near You,0,"“Mental health is not isolated to the brain,” says Ellen Vora, MD, a board-certified psychiatrist, acupuncturist, and yoga teacher. Vora is what’s called a functional psychiatrist: She treats mental imbalances with the entire body in mind. There’s no specific credential that is required in order to call oneself a functional psychiatrist, Vora says. (Psychiatrists, of course, go through medical training to earn that title.) Many functional medicine practitioners have medical degrees plus some level of training at places like The Institute for Functional Medicine, Kresser Institute, Institute for Integrative Nutrition, or Empowered Education. Vora says that it really comes down to their treatment philosophy: “If a practitioner approaches care with the goal of addressing the problem at the root rather than suppressing the symptoms without regard for whether the treatment addresses the root cause, I consider that to be a functionally oriented practitioner.” That means they’re aware of the connection between a patient’s mind, body, and spirit and how it impacts their health. And it implies that a practitioner considers a person’s lifestyle—what they eat, how they sleep, their exercise habits, their relationships, etc.—when treating mental health conditions. We asked Vora to share the functional psychiatrists who are at the top of her recommendation list—they’re below. To find a functional psychiatrist near you, The Institute for Functional Medicine, Integrative Medicine for Mental Health, and Integrative Psychiatry Institute are great resources.

https://goop.com/wellness/health/sleepcation/,One Prescription for Sleep Debt? A Sleepcation,0,"By now, you’ve likely heard about the concept of sleep debt, which is the difference between the amount of sleep our body needs to feel its best and the amount of sleep we actually get. “Say you need seven hours of sleep to feel your best the next day and you get five: The difference, two hours, would be your sleep deficit,” says sleep consultant Kelly Murray, FDN-P. Over time, sleep debt can affect your cognition, metabolism, heart health, blood sugar regulation, immune system, and more. Decreasing your sleep debt allows you to regain energy, improve cognitive function, and repair your health over time. But if we know we’ve accumulated some sleep debt—life happens!—what can we do about it? To rebalance, Murray recommends planning a sleep vacation (also known as a sleepcation): a period of time dedicated to sleeping well and determining your optimal sleep time. According to the National Sleep Foundation, most people need seven to nine hours of sleep to feel rejuvenated. Murray says one way to know if you’re getting your ideal amount of sleep is your energy levels: You’ll wake feeling refreshed and have a steady stream of energy throughout the day. (If you consistently need more than nine hours of sleep to feel energized, she suggests you talk with your doctor, because that can be an indicator of an underlying medical condition.) How long should your sleepcation be? “It typically takes between two and seven days to work off a sleep deficit. And it could be longer if you have long-term insomnia,” Murray says. She usually recommends her clients take about five days. She doesn’t prescribe strict protocols, just some general guidelines. If we were planning a sleepcation for ourselves at home, these are the steps we’d take to maximize comfort and relaxation:"
https://goop.com/wellness/health/hormones-and-eyesight/,Are Your Hormones Messing with Your Eyesight?,0,"By Carolyn Pan, MD, as told to goop | Reviewed by Denise John, PhD Our eyes are intricately connected to the rest of our body. This means that biological changes—like hormone fluctuations—affect our eyes, too. Here are a few ways hormones impact eye health. If you are experiencing shifts in your hormones and any eye symptoms along these lines, work with your general practitioner and eye doctor to try to get to the root cause of your symptoms and support bringing your hormones back into balance. For general eye health, here are some preventive practices to help care for your eyes. 1. Eat a balanced diet, exercise, and sleep. Our bodies—including our eyes—benefit from eating a balanced diet, having regular physical activity, and sleeping well. This gives our eyes the foundational care—nutrients, blood flow, and repair—that’s needed for them to function. 2. Get regular eye exams. Visual symptoms and discomfort don’t always show up in the beginning stages of an eye condition. Eye doctors recommend that healthy adults with good vision get a routine eye exam (conducted by a licensed optometrist, who examines your vision) or a comprehensive medical eye exam (conducted by an ophthalmologist, an MD who assesses the overall health of your eye) at least once in their 20s and twice in their 30s. After the age of 40, we recommend exams every one to two years. This may be covered by your vision or medical insurance depending on your age, preexisting conditions, and diagnoses. 3. Use tear drops and eye compression. Keeping your eyes lubricated helps them stay healthy. Similar to using lotion to moisturize dry skin, using over-the-counter tear drops can help lubricate dry eyes. Using warm eye compresses as part of your morning routine can also help release oil from your eyelids’ glands and improve the quality of your tears. 4. Wear sunglasses. In addition to hormone changes, exposure to UV rays over time contributes to many age-related eye conditions, such as cataract, macular degeneration, and ocular surface diseases. Just as you wear sunscreen to prevent skin damage, wearing sunglasses and wide-brim hats protects your eyes from UV damage from the sun.
