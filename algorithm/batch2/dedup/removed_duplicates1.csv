You might not fret about these cognitive hiccups if they're infrequent. But what if you're constantly forgetting little details? The stress of worrying about memory loss can be taxing and make your thinking skills even fuzzier. ""When you're stressed, your focus is pulled off of the tasks you're working on and you may begin thinking or worrying about the stressor. This can decrease mental clarity and make it harder to focus, making mild memory lapses more prominent,"" says Dr. Stephanie Buss, a cognitive neurologist and director of the Memory Disorders A2Z Clinic at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Is it warranted? It's natural to be concerned about memory loss. ""This can stem from seeing family members or friends who've received a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, or it might come from noticing cognitive changes over time,"" Dr. Buss says. That doesn't mean your thinking skills are faltering. Small memory lapses can be normal with aging. This includes things like forgetting someone's name briefly (feeling that it's on the tip of your tongue) or walking into a room and momentarily forgetting why you walked in.

""We worry more about large memory lapses, such as forgetting parts of conversations or recent or upcoming events, changes in the ability to speak or understand, or changes in focus or organization that affect your day-to-day life. Any decline in your ability to do complex tasks such as managing medications, working, driving, cooking, or managing finances would also be cause for concern and evaluation,"" Dr. Buss says. Crucial steps to cope A healthy lifestyle is essential for handling stress of any kind and for maintaining brain health as we age. What does a healthy lifestyle involve? ""Physical activity is one of the most important factors. It promotes healthy cognitive aging, reduces stress, and helps with sleep and mood,"" Dr. Buss says. ""We also strongly recommend that you stay socially engaged, connecting with friends and family regularly. Cognitive activities such as reading, puzzles, games, or listening to music are also vital for maintaining brain health, and are especially powerful when paired with social activities."" Sleep is also key to brain health. You need a full night's sleep (at least seven to nine hours a night) to help the brain cement information into memories and flush away waste associated with Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Buss advises prioritizing sleep hygiene and maintaining a consistent bedtime. You should also eat a healthy diet, stop smoking, and get underlying conditions (especially high blood pressure) under control. You may be interested in... Alzheimer's Disease Harvard Health Publishing’s Alzheimer's Disease: A guide to diagnosis, treatment, and caregiving LEARN MORE Managing stress will also help your brain. Meditation, yoga, tai chi, deep breathing exercises, and mindfulness (being present and engaged in each moment) can trigger the relaxation response — the opposite of the stress response. ""Treating any associated anxiety and depression can help, too. It can improve focus, sleep, and your motivation to engage in healthy lifestyle activities,"" Dr. Buss says. Try these memory strategies You might also feel less concerned about memory lapses by using practical strategies to retain information. ""For example, when you meet a new person, use their name in conversation right away to help you remember it,"" Dr. Buss suggests. ""Also, keep a single, central calendar and refer to it regularly; that's easier than keeping information in multiple places."" She also recommends always placing your keys or glasses in a designated spot; taking your medication at the same time each day; and using notebooks, address books, and other tools to organize and store information for fast retrieval, rather than relying entirely on your memory. When to seek help ""Feel free to bring up concerns to your doctor, who can help you figure out what's normal and what requires more investigation,"" Dr. Buss says. ""Consider involving loved ones in these discussions; perhaps they've noticed memory lapses you're unaware of. But don't wait if you're worried. It's possible that you just need a quick memory screening and a talk with your doctor about lifestyle factors to improve your memory."" You may be interested in...

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/fasting-before-lipid-test-usually-unnecessary,Fasting before lipid test usually unnecessary,1,"Q. Do I need to fast before my cholesterol test? A. For most people, the answer is no. Here's the backstory: For decades, we've told people not to eat or drink (except for water and medications) for eight to 12 hours before a cholesterol test. This was based on the thought that a measurement done after fasting would provide a more accurate assessment of all the lipids (fats) in the blood, including LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. However, studies show that the differences between fasting and non-fasting values for cholesterol are usually negligible. An analysis using data from a clinical trial of 4,100 people compared the results from lipid tests done with and without fasting. The LDL (bad) cholesterol values were only about 4 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) higher when people weren't fasting. Because the cholesterol guidelines focus on LDL, whether you are fasting won't matter for determining whether your LDL is at goal. So if people come to my clinic and they've had breakfast or lunch, we go ahead and take a blood sample. But triglycerides are another story. After you eat, your body immediately converts any excess calories from food into triglycerides, which are then stored in fat cells. In addition, any saturated fat you eat is broken down into smaller fatty particles called chylomicrons, which enter the bloodstream and further contribute to a temporary rise in triglycerides. Some people have high triglyceride levels, which is more common among those who are overweight or have diabetes or prediabetes (and some people have inherited a tendency for this problem). For these people, not fasting can often lead to very high triglyceride levels. So anyone who has ever had a high triglyceride level should always fast before a lipid test. This will provide a more accurate assessment of their triglyceride value, which is then used to inform treatment recommendations. If a person's triglycerides are higher than 150 mg/dl on a fasting lipid test, that is linked to a higher risk of heart attack or related cardiovascular issues. Treatment starts with diet and exercise but may include medications, although the latter are usually reserved for people who have heart disease or are at high risk for it, including those with diabetes. When I see a new patient, I look back at their earlier lipid test results. If most of their triglycerides are within the normal range (below 150 mg/dL), I tell them they don't need to fast before their blood test. But if some of their values are high, I ask them to fast. Because fasting can be challenging if you can't schedule a morning blood test, ask your doctor if not fasting is an option for you. Image: © StefaNikolic/Getty Images",3,0.31219485,0.09432311,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-white-noise-really-help-you-sleep-better,Can white noise really help you sleep better?,1,"Some people find that the neutral sound of white noise helps them sleep better. But is there evidence to support this? And what about other noise colors? What is white noise? White noise has been compared to the static from a radio that isn't tuned to a specific station. Technically, the term ""white noise"" refers to noise that contains all frequencies of the sounds that people can hear, in equal parts. (Frequency is the rate at which sound waves vibrate.) Can white noise help you sleep better? Studies on the benefits of white noise for sleep have yielded mixed results. Some studies have found it helped people sleep better, possibly by masking outside noises and serving as a cue to fall asleep. ""A study in infants and children showed that white noise may reduce heart rate and respiratory rate, effectively lulling an individual to sleep,"" says Dr. Sogol Javaheri, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and physician in the division of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. However, a systematic review published in Sleep Medicine Reviews found white noise had little beneficial effect on sleep. What's more, according to Dr. Javaheri, white noise may interrupt important stages of sleep, such as REM sleep or deep sleep, and affect hearing if it is too loud. If you use a white noise machine for sleep, try moving it to a corner of your bedroom and keep the noise level no louder than that of a background conversation. Turn on your white noise machine just before getting into bed. If your machine has a timer, experiment with having it play only as you fall asleep rather than all night long. Other noise colors for better sleep: Pink noise and brown noise While white noise is the best known, it's not the only ""color"" noise that's been used to enhance sleep. Pink noise has more intense, lower frequencies that make it sound deeper than white noise. Examples of pink noise are the sounds of rain or a waterfall. Some studies have found that pink noise can enhance deep sleep in older adults and improve cognitive performance. In addition, research suggests that pink noise may decrease time to fall asleep and improve sleep quality. However, these results were achieved under experimental conditions in which researchers adjusted pink noise timing during the night. Another color noise — brown noise — reduces higher sound frequencies even more than pink noise and is described as grainier or rougher. For example, brown noise can be compared to ocean waves crashing, while pink noise is more like a gentle rain. ""More data is needed to determine what role pink and brown noise may play in sleep, such as what volume and duration would be of most benefit,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""For now, I would not recommend pink or brown noise continuously, but rather use it for a set time if it helps you fall asleep more quickly.""",5,0.15622589,-0.07961408,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/foam-roller-could-you-benefit-from-this-massage-tool,Foam roller: Could you benefit from this massage tool?,1,"You've probably noticed people at the gym rolling their calves, glutes, and other body parts on small cylinders. These popular tools are called foam rollers. They can help you stay flexible and limber and reduce muscle tension and soreness. What is a foam roller? A foam roller is a cylinder made of foam. They're often about six inches in diameter and a foot or two long. Foam rollers are available in varying degrees of firmness. Used properly, a foam roller can help you reduce tension in muscles and other soft tissue so you can move with ease and less pain. Most foam rollers have a smooth surface, and you press different areas of your body against them, ""almost like you're ironing or smoothing out those tissues,"" says Dr. Marwa A. Ahmed, instructor in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School and medical director of the Spaulding Outpatient Center in Boston. How do foam rollers work? When you press muscles and fascia (fibrous connective tissue) against a foam roller, you're loosening those tissues, releasing tension and easing pain, Dr. Ahmed explains. Think of it like giving yourself a massage — without the trip to the spa. Benefits of foam rolling Foam rollers are known to help reduce muscle and tissue soreness and tension. They also help increase flexibility, especially when used as a warm-up before exercise. In addition, foam rollers improve circulation to targeted areas. Some evidence suggests foam rolling may also: help joints move more easily through their full range of motion support moving excess fluid out of tissues and into the lymphatic system enhance the ability to move while conserving as much energy as possible (an important benefit for anyone concerned with sports performance). How to use a foam roller Using a foam roller is simple: slowly roll the body part you're targeting back and forth along the foam roller. For example, you might lie down with your thighs, glutes, or calves on the roller, then roll back and forth. Or you might try standing up with your back on the roller against a wall — this exercise is especially helpful if you have trouble getting up and down from the floor, Dr. Ahmed says. Like any fitness practice, you're more likely to see the desired results if you stay consistent. For each muscle group you want to roll, start with about 30 to 60 seconds and repeat three to five times at least twice a week. To really see the benefits of foam rolling, try foam rolling every day. What to consider when choosing a foam roller If you're new to foam rolling, start simple and soft. Some foam rollers have bumps that provide deeper pressure, but if you're new to the practice, start with a relatively soft, smooth roller. ""The softer it is, the less painful it's going to be,"" Dr. Ahmed says. ""Then, as you roll out these tissues, it's going to become harder to get much benefit from a softer foam roller, and so you can 'graduate' to a harder foam."" You can also use items you may already have on hand, like a tennis ball, to roll out smaller areas of tight muscle or tissue, such as a specific tender spot in your shoulder. Common foam rolling mistakes to avoid The biggest concern is rolling over bone, Dr. Ahmed says. Avoid any bony areas like your knees, pelvis, or shoulder blades. You can't ""iron out"" bones like you can tissue, and it will likely just hurt (and could lead to injury or worsen existing symptoms). Keep the roller on soft, fleshy tissue to safely give this tension-reducing practice a try.",0,0.241611,-0.23278694,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/should-you-be-sleepmaxxing-to-boost-health-and-happiness-202503063090,Should you be sleepmaxxing to boost health and happiness?,1,"If you've been on TikTok lately, you know it's hard to avoid countless influencers touting a concept called sleepmaxxing. Their posts provide tips and tricks to get longer, better, and more restorative sleep. And why not? Sleep is considered a pillar of good health and is related to everything from brain health to cardiovascular health, and even diabetes. But what exactly is sleepmaxxing? And how likely is it to deliver on claims of amped-up energy, a boost to the immune system, reducing stress levels, and improving your mood? What is sleepmaxxing? Depending on which social media platform you happen to be looking at, the recommended strategies for maximizing sleep differ. Tips include: taping your mouth shut while sleeping not drinking anything during the two hours before bedtime a cold room temperature a dark bedroom using a white noise machine not setting a morning alarm showering one hour before bedtime eliminating caffeine eating kiwis before going to bed taking magnesium and melatonin using weighted blankets getting 30 minutes of sunlight every day meditating daily for 30 minutes. Does any research support sleepmaxxing? A thorough search through PubMed, PsycNet, and Google Scholar reveals zero results for the terms ""sleepmaxx"" and ""sleepmaxxing."" But wait — this certainly doesn't mean that some influencer-recommended strategies are not evidence-based, just that the concept of sleepmaxxing, as a defined package, has not been scientifically studied. But yes, some of the strategies — including one uncomfortable, though popular, choice — lack evidence. Can mouth-taping improve your sleep? TikTok users have claimed that taping your mouth while you sleep has benefits, such as reducing snoring and improving bad breath. A team from the department of otolaryngology at George Washington University was prompted by all of the social media buzz on the topic to review research on the impact of nocturnal mouth taping. Spoiler alert: the authors note that most TikTok mouth-taping claims aren't supported by research. If you do snore, it's important to discuss this with your medical team. Even if taping your mouth reduces your snoring, it can't effectively treat a potential underlying cause of the snoring, such as allergies, asthma, or sleep apnea. Sleepmaxxing or basic sleep hygiene? Many strategies recommended by sleepmaxxers are essentially what sleep experts prescribe as good sleep hygiene, which has plenty of research backing its value. Common components of sleep hygiene are decreasing caffeine and alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, sleep timing, reducing evening light exposure, limiting daytime naps, and having a cool bedroom. While tips like these help many people enjoy restful sleep, those who have an insomnia disorder will need more help, as described below. Melatonin, early bedtime, weighted blankets, and — kiwi fruit? Other strategies suggested by sleepmaxxers are based on limited scientific data. For example: Taking melatonin is recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to treat circadian rhythm disorders such as jet lag. But it's not recommended for insufficient sleep, poor sleep quality, or difficulty with falling asleep or staying asleep. Is it healthier to be asleep by 10 p.m.? One video that garnered more than a million views claims it is. While it is important to maximize morning sunlight exposure and minimize evening light exposure to regulate circadian rhythms, there is such variability in how much sleep someone requires and individual chronotypes (not to mention varying personal and professional responsibilities!) that it is difficult to state there is an ideal bedtime for everyone. While intriguing research has been done on weighted blankets, there is no convincing evidence that they are truly effective for the general adult population. Overall, it's important to be cautious about the impact of the placebo effect on how someone sleeps. An analysis of more than 30 studies showed that roughly 64% of the drug response for a sleep medication in insomnia patients could be due to the placebo effect. A key takeaway is that studies that are not randomized controlled trials — such as this small study on 24 people suggesting that kiwi fruit may improve sleep — should be interpreted with a grain of salt. Could you have orthosomnia? The expectation of flawless sleep, night in and night out, is an unrealistic goal. Orthosomnia is a term that describes an unhealthy pursuit of perfect sleep. The pressure to get perfect sleep is embedded in the sleepmaxxing culture. With more and more people able to access daily data about their sleep and other health metrics through consumer wearables, even a person who is objectively sleeping well can become unnecessarily concerned with optimizing their sleep. While prioritizing restful sleep is commendable, setting perfection as your goal is problematic. Even good sleepers vary from night to night, experiencing less than desirable sleep a couple of times per week. It is also noteworthy that some of the most widely viewed recommendations on TikTok are not supported by scientific evidence. Do you really need to fix your sleep? A good first step is to understand whether or not there is anything that you need to fix! Consider tracking your sleep for a few weeks using a sleep diary, and pair this data with a consumer wearable (such as a Fitbit or Apple Watch). Both imperfectly capture sleep data when compared to the gold-standard tool sleep experts use (polysomnography, or a sleep study). However, combining the information can give you a reasonable assessment of your sleep status. Regularly getting restful sleep can indeed boost health and mood. And all of us can benefit from following basic sleep hygiene tips. But if it takes you 30 minutes or more to fall asleep, or if you are up for 30 minutes or more in the middle of the night, and this happens three or more times per week, then consider reaching out to your health care team to seek further evaluation. There are effective, nonmedication treatments that are proven to help you sleep better. One example is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which can dramatically improve insomnia symptoms in a matter of weeks. Want to learn more about cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia?

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-28-israel-pauses-war-gaza-inoculate-children-provocation-poliomyelitis.html,VACCINE WEAPONS: Israel pauses war in Gaza to inoculate children with “provocation poliomyelitis” – further crippling and depopulating the region,0,"As the Israeli military righteously hunts down Hamas terrorists in the Gaza strip, they have completely disregarded the growing toll of civilian casualties – especially Palestinian children – who are either blown to pieces, buried in rubble or end up starved and sickened, lacking access to food and medical care . The Israeli military has either restricted, destroyed or militarily cut off aid to the Gaza strip. The territory's healthcare system has been devastated, with only about a third of its hospitals and 40 percent of primary healthcare facilities currently operational. Now, Israel is maniacally agreeing to pause the war in Gaza so that their forces can deliver tens of thousands of live polio vaccines to the children of Gaza. These inoculations inevitably spread vaccine-derived polio strains that will lead to ""provocation poliomyelitis"" – further crippling and depopulating the region. UN, WHO and UNICEF join Israeli military to inoculate 640,000 children across Gaza The United Nations has called for a comprehensive inoculation campaign following the confirmation of the first polio case in Gaza since the mid-1990s. In response to the crisis, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has indicated that Washington is working with Israeli officials to finalize a coordinated vaccination plan, with implementation expected in the coming weeks. Joining forces with Israel’s depopulation agenda, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF have emphasized the urgency for inoculating the children of Gaza , calling for a minimum seven-day ceasefire to facilitate the vaccination of approximately 640,000 children across the Strip. With the support of 2,700 workers, the vaccination campaign aims to reach every municipality in the region. The vaccine shipment is sufficient to inoculate approximately 1,255,000 individuals, which represents just over half of Gaza’s population. This initiative is part of a broader effort coordinated by Israel’s civilian coordination agency, COGAT, and international health organizations. COGAT has announced that international and local medical teams will oversee the distribution of the vaccines over the coming days. The plan includes conducting vaccinations at various locations within Gaza during routine humanitarian pauses. These pauses are intended to allow civilians to access remaining dilapidated medical centers where they can receive the vaccine. Junk polio vaccines become weapons of depopulation in Gaza These junk polio vaccines, which are now proven to spread vaccine-derived polio strains , will continue to spread polio in Gaza and will do nothing to improve living conditions, water quality or sanitation, nor restore health, vitality and immunity to the children who are now suffering from malnutrition and severely unsanitary conditions. The conditions for outbreaks and serious disease are much higher in childhood populations that do not have access to clean water, sanitation, nutrition and proper medical care . By intentionally spreading vaccine-derived polio strains in Gaza, the United Nations, the Israeli forces and UNICEF are basically taking a torch to a drought-stricken forest, begging for wildfires to take hold (exacerbating disease outbreaks in children). Polio vaccines cause muscular and neurological injuries that allow poliovirus to paralyze children Whether global health authorities have good intentions or not, the polio vaccine will cause further damage to the children of Gaza. Studies show that skeletal muscle injury can make individuals more susceptible to neurological complications from poliovirus infections, a phenomenon known as “provocation poliomyelitis.” This condition often results from unnecessary injections in children living in areas where poliovirus is common, leading to cases of childhood paralysis. A study from 1998 suggests that intramuscular injections may also heighten the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis among those receiving live attenuated poliovirus vaccines. The study found the precise pathogenic mechanism connecting intramuscular injections with provocation poliomyelitis. This skeletal muscle injury triggers retrograde axonal transport of the poliovirus, which aids in the virus's invasion of the central nervous system and exacerbates spinal cord damage. The Israeli military created the conditions for disease to spread in the first place, creating filthy and unsanitary conditions that cause the spread of diseases, while burdening families with survival-mode levels of stress and fatigue that precede disease. The lack of basic food and nutrition has rendered the children immunocompromised , allowing for multiple infections to take hold. In a depraved show of fake compassion, the Israeli military is bringing in mass inoculation campaigns that will only make the situation worse, while ignoring the very things these children need in order to survive the hellish conditions that has been fostered on them.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/investigating-memory-loss,Investigating memory loss,1,"It can be scary not knowing if sudden memory lapses or other cognitive changes are just a natural aspect of aging or an early sign of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI falls between the cognitive decline associated with aging and the more serious signs of dementia. With MCI, some changes are noticeable but usually do not impede the ability to carry out daily functions. ""It's not unusual to be forgetful at times as you age, but if memory issues are more noticeable, it's always best to get checked out and undergo a cognitive test,"" says Sara Weisenbach, a neuropsychologist with Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""There are ways to slow the progression of cognitive decline or treat issues that could be causing memory lapses, but the sooner you can identify a problem, the better the outcome."" See your doctor Your first step is to see your primary care physician to discuss your symptoms, review your overall health and concerns, and assess any family history of dementia. An ideal time for this may be at an annual wellness visit. (Don't rely on results of online cognitive tests, as many are unreliable and may not offer an accurate evaluation, says Weisenbach.) Before your visit, make a list of your specific cognitive concerns to share with your doctor. Also, bring a family member or friend to your appointment. Their support can help ease your nerves, and they can provide their own observations. An in-office cognitive screening test lasts from five to 15 minutes. The test might include repeating a list of words immediately and then again after a short delay recalling personal information like addresses or birthdays naming objects in a picture answering questions about recent events drawing a clock to assess spatial orientation. ""The results might indicate a potential problem, but they usually are not sufficient for a formal MCI diagnosis,"" says Weisenbach. Senior moments or red flags? It can be difficult to gauge when memory issues need medical attention. But you probably should consult your doctor if you experience any of the following: frequent episodes of forgetfulness, like not recalling a recent conversation or missing appointments frequent trouble retaining new information, like a phone number or address errors in paying bills or taking medications difficulty finding your parked car, trouble finding your way in familiar areas, or minor car accidents. Additional testing Based on your test results and your doctor's assessment, you may be advised to undergo further testing and evaluation. If the results hint at memory loss or another cognitive issue, or if your doctor needs more information, the next step might be blood tests, which can help to rule out reversible causes of cognitive impairment, such as low vitamin B12, iron deficiency, or an underactive thyroid. The doctor may also recommend one or more brain imaging studies. An MRI scan can look for structural changes in the brain, like loss of volume and changes in blood flow. A PET scan can look for amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, one of the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's disease. Your doctor also may recommend a neuropsychological evaluation with a specialist like a neurologist or neuro-psychologist. This sit-down visit can last a few hours and explores your cognitive issues in more detail, such as when they began and the circumstances around them. For example, are you having trouble finding the right words when speaking? Do you regularly misplace your keys and phone? Can you not recall a conversation from the previous day? ""All this information can help determine if the issues are a sudden phenomenon or have worsened over time,"" says Weisenbach. ""A neuropsychologist can also help determine which cognitive skills are strong and which ones are more challenging."" Other factors are also considered when evaluating the test results. For instance, lower-than-expected scores can be influenced by medication side effects or mental health issues like depression, anxiety, or grief. Even if the neuropsychological examination does not suggest MCI, your doctor or neuropsychologist can help address any issues that may be related to your mental lapses. ""This initial screening also provides a baseline for future reference in case other memory issues arise or your situation worsens over time,"" says Weisenbach. ""If the results from the tests are inconclusive, you might be monitored for 12 to 18 months and then re-evaluated."" Image: © RUNSTUDIO/Getty Images",7,0.19390701,-0.052324608,True

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/is-it-time-for-a-cpap-checkup,Is it time for a CPAP checkup?,1,"Ever since your obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis, you've tried to use your continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine faithfully each night. Hopefully, it has restored your ability to sleep without snoring, coughing, choking, or suffering dozens of pauses in breathing per hour. And perhaps it helps you feel more alert, awake, and productive, and has begun to lower the risk of dangerous consequences related to sleep apnea, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and depression. But the gentle hum of the CPAP device doesn't guarantee that the therapy is working effectively; like a sensitive medication regimen, it needs to be assessed and monitored regularly. What is CPAP therapy? CPAP therapy prevents your upper airways from being blocked by throat muscles that relax too much during sleep. The therapy involves a small bedside compressor that pumps a forceful stream of air through a tube and into your nose via a mask you wear all night. A standard CPAP machine delivers a fixed air pressure, while an auto-CPAP machine automatically adjusts pressure based on your varying needs throughout the night, such as when you change position or shift into a new sleep stage. Your health care provider must prescribe the therapy. You then obtain the system through a medical equipment supplier. A technician from the supplier will work with you to find the right mask, set the specified air pressure settings to keep your airways open without disturbing your sleep, and answer ongoing questions about using the system. You can control the temperature and humidity of the air entering the mask. Additionally, you can choose how fast the air pressure increases: ""You can set it to ramp up over five minutes or 45 minutes, or select the 'auto-ramp' setting and have the machine adjust the pace automatically based on your breathing,"" explains Dr. Karen Lee, a neurologist and sleep medicine specialist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Initial check-ups For CPAP therapy to be covered by insurance, you're required to see your health care provider 30 to 90 days after you start using the system. ""The clinician always needs to ensure that the CPAP has improved and hopefully resolved your sleep issues,"" Dr. Lee says, ""and what can be complicated is that you may not be aware of some of your sleep issues. For example, sleep apnea often increases the frequency of nighttime urinations, grinding or clenching your teeth, and night sweats. The clinician needs to ask appropriate questions to understand if your sleep is optimized while using CPAP."" At your first check-up, your provider will review data that the machine has been collecting. ""The machine tells us when you're using the device and estimates how many apnea episodes you're having per hour, when you're struggling to breathe, and whether air is leaking out your mouth or around the mask unintentionally,"" Dr. Lee says. Based on that information and your own observations, your clinician might prescribe a higher or lower air pressure. You might need to go back for additional visits and adjustments until the kinks are ironed out, which can take a few months. You may even require an overnight study in the sleep lab while using CPAP to help clarify any issues. All PAP therapies need regular evaluation Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is just one type of positive airway pressure (PAP). Other types include auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP), which provides a range of preset pressures throughout the night bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), which provides two different preset pressures — a more powerful one when you inhale and a less powerful one when you exhale adaptive servo ventilation (ASV), an advanced device that provides pressure based on breathing patterns throughout the night. All these therapies need periodic assessment to determine how well they're working and whether the settings need adjustment. Additional check-ups Once the CPAP system is working for you, you'll need to have it re-evaluated at least once a year to see if the air pressure needs to be adjusted. These continuing follow-up appointments are important for many reasons. Data updates. Dr. Lee says that CPAP machines provide only estimated information, which sometimes is inaccurate. She needs to compare it with insights from a patient visit to determine if the CPAP really is helping. Worsening sleep apnea. Everything sags as we get older, even the airway, which causes the disease to advance over time. Weight loss or gain. Gaining weight can make sleep apnea worse; losing weight can make it better or even make it disappear. Either could potentially affect the pressure settings. Treatment side effects. Dr. Lee says that the brain sometimes reacts to CPAP in a way that creates another type of apnea. In that case, the settings or the actual device would need to be changed. Other sleep issues. ""We need to make sure all of your sleep needs are being addressed,"" Dr. Lee says, ""especially if you have other sleep disorders such as insomnia, restless legs syndrome, or sleepiness, despite effective CPAP treatment."" Missed check-ups Unfortunately, many people don't get regular CPAP check-ups. If you're among them, it could be that your clinician never told you that you need periodic assessments. ""While any health care provider can prescribe the therapy, they don't all know how to adjust it optimally or that they should evaluate it regularly,"" Dr. Lee says. Or you might not be getting CPAP check-ups because you feel better and don't think you need additional assessments you don't think the therapy is effective and have given up on it your schedule is too hectic you assume (mistakenly) that the medical equipment supplier is monitoring your health. When to call the expert If you've never had your CPAP use evaluated or haven't done so in a long time, Dr. Lee advises making an appointment with a sleep specialist or with the expert who prescribed the therapy. Dr. Lee also recommends calling your clinician any time new health problems or symptoms affect sleep. ""Come see me if you start snoring again or you're tired despite using the machine,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/lipoproteina-an-update-on-testing-and-treatment,Lipoprotein(a): An update on testing and treatment,1,"A fatty particle that circulates in the bloodstream, lipoprotein(a) is similar to LDL cholesterol but more dangerous. High levels of Lp(a), as it is commonly called, can double or even triple a person's risk of a heart attack. It's considered a common culprit in heart disease that occurs at a young age. So why do so few people know about it? Until recently, most guidelines didn't recommend testing for Lp(a) — but with good reason. Your genes determine your Lp(a) value. Eating and exercise habits have virtually no effect on the levels in your bloodstream. Plus, there were no effective treatments to lower Lp(a), which also elevates the risk of stroke and aortic stenosis (a thickened, stiff aortic valve). Now, with five promising therapies to lower Lp(a) in development, the landscape is changing. Here's the latest advice and information about Lp(a). Lp(a) testing trends International consensus groups recommend one-time Lp(a) testing for everyone. In Europe, such testing is routine. But in the United States, the first official endorsement for Lp(a) testing didn't appear until 2024, from the National Lipid Association. ""Recent data show that only 0.3% of people received Lp(a) screening between 2012 and 2019,"" says Harvard Medical School associate professor Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Also, about half of those tests were ordered by a very small number of health care providers, she adds. But Lp(a) testing should soon become more widespread, for several reasons. First, the tests are now covered by most insurers in most states. Second, even though targeted therapies to lower Lp(a) are not yet on the market, people with high levels (see ""Lp(a) readings: Check the units"") may benefit from more intensive treatment to manage their overall risk of heart disease, says Dr. O'Donoghue. ""This may include taking cholesterol-lowering drugs like statins, even if your LDL cholesterol is normal,"" she says. Low-dose aspirin is also being investigated as a possible therapy for preventing heart attacks in people with high Lp(a). Lp(a) readings: Check the units Labs report lipoprotein(a) values in two different units. The preferred method is nanomoles per liter (nmol/L), but many labs still use milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Currently, there's no universal consensus on what constitutes an abnormal Lp(a) level, but the thresholds shown below are commonly used. Lp(a) nmol/L mg/dL Normal Below 75 Below 30 High 125 and above 50 and above A one-time test? Unlike LDL, which rises with age and is influenced by diet and exercise, Lp(a) remains largely constant over a person's lifetime, so a one-time test suffices for screening. However, researchers are working to better understand changes that may occur in Lp(a) in women around the time of menopause and for men and women with certain medical conditions. The following groups of people are specifically recommended for testing: people with premature cardiovascular disease, defined as those who've had a heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or aortic stenosis before age 55 (for men) or 65 (for women) people who have a father, mother, sister, or brother with premature cardiovascular disease people with very high LDL cholesterol (190 mg/dL or higher) close relatives (siblings, children, and parents) of anyone with an elevated Lp(a) level. Therapies to lower Lp(a) Most of the drugs in development for lowering Lp(a) work by interfering with RNA, the molecule that copies and transfers genetic instructions from DNA, the cell's genetic blueprint. Currently, there are four RNA-based drugs that effectively silence the gene that makes Lp(a) in liver cells: lepodisiran, olpasiran, pelacarsen, and zerlasiran. All are administered by injection every one to six months and have been shown to lower Lp(a) levels 80% and 100%. The side effects appear to be limited to mild, short-lived pain at the injection site. Larger, longer trials looking at whether these drugs will help prevent heart-related problems are currently under way, with results expected within the next one to two years, says Dr. O'Donoghue, who is a lead investigator on the clinical trials of olpasiran. Preliminary results also look promising for another experimental drug called muvalapin, which works by preventing the assembly of the Lp(a) particle. Like the RNA-based drugs, muvalapin also leads to dramatic drops in Lp(a), but it is taken as a daily pill. Side effects include headache, back pain, and fatigue. While some people prefer pills over shots, injectable drugs have the advantage of much less frequent dosing, Dr. O'Donoghue notes. Image: © Md Babul Hosen/Getty Images",7,0.3508915,0.2838704,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-simple-ways-to-improve-gut-health,5 simple ways to improve gut health,1,"Gut health is an easy thing to take for granted — or to ignore completely, if everything is generally functioning well. But poor gut health can impact your overall health in a variety of ways, from the obvious (stomach discomfort) to less obvious effects on mood and immune function. Why gut health matters People are talking about gut health and their microbiome more than they used to, but if it's not something that comes up around your dinner table, here are some basics. When people talk about their gut microbiome, they're referring to all the microorganisms (both good and bad) living in your gastrointestinal tract (primarily your large intestine). Most people have hundreds — or even thousands — of different species of bacteria, viruses, and fungi living in their gut. Gut diversity is important because different microorganisms may help support health in a variety of ways, including: improved digestion and nutrient absorption immune-system regulation protection against harmful bacteria reduced inflammation better brain health. Plus, a healthy and diverse gut microbiome may help reduce your risk of conditions including diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, some cancers, GI disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Five keys to a happy gut The good news is that you can take steps to support a healthy gut microbiome. 1. Add more fiber to your diet Fiber serves as a prebiotic, or food for the good bacteria that live in your gut. Eating plenty of fiber is associated with increased microbial diversity and a reduced risk of gastrointestinal issues like constipation and Crohn's disease. Fiber helps keep the colon healthy by reducing inflammation; it also helps keep you regular. However, most of us don't get enough fiber. Aim to get 21 to 38 grams of fiber per day. Fiber is found in a variety of foods including legumes, whole grains, avocados, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, tofu, berries, leafy greens, and nuts and seeds. 2. Stay hydrated Water is critical for healthy digestion. It helps your body absorb and transport nutrients; it helps with keeping your core body temperature steady; it aids in the production of mucus to protect your digestive tract; and it helps prevent constipation. When you become constipated, your gut microbiota changes, becoming less abundant. If you become dehydrated, your body will let you know, as not drinking enough can manifest as thirst, headache, dry mouth, less frequent urination, dizziness, and tiredness. So drink up — around four to six cups per day for most people. 3. Manage stress Increased stress often manifests itself in digestive discomfort. Stress causes hormones like adrenaline and cortisol to spike, leading to symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. This gut-brain connection is powerful; it's why we get butterflies before a big presentation, or feel nauseous when we're in a high-stakes situation. And while we can't avoid stressful situations entirely, it's possible to learn to manage stress through techniques like belly breathing, relaxation therapy, and meditation. 4. Get enough sleep Healthier gut, better sleep? Perhaps, according to research published in Frontiers in Microbiology, which found that certain bacteria in your gut may impact your sleep in a variety of ways, from your likelihood of experiencing insomnia, to how frequently you need to nap, to how long you stay asleep at night. Most people should aim to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night. If you're struggling to hit that goal, try improving your sleep hygiene, getting plenty of daytime exercise, and trying some of the stress management tips above. 5. Stay physically active It's not hard to find good reasons tostay active, but here's one more: According to a systematic review published in Nutrients, participating in 150 to 270 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity exercise per week for at least six weeks has a positive effect on your gut microbiota, particularly if you combine aerobic exercise with resistance training. We already know that people who are sedentary have different gut microbiota characteristics than active people; this research suggests that you might be able to improve your gut health through exercise even if you're not currently active.",1,0.3104229,0.13631146,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-26-hhs-bankrolls-ai-tool-combat-vaccine-misinfo.html,HHS bankrolls AI tool to combat supposed MISINFORMATION about HPV injections,0,"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is reportedly bankrolling an initiative involving the use of artificial intelligence (AI) against so-called ""misinformation"" about vaccines. The Defender reported that HHS has earmarked $4 million for the ""Inoculate for HPV Vaccine"" randomized clinical trial (RCT), citing grant documents obtained by Children's Health Defense (CHD) through a Freedom of Information Act request. The National Cancer Institute, part of the HHS, is facilitating funding for the RCT – which runs from April 2022 through March 2027. Funding for its third year was released in April, the Defender added. University of Pennsylvania associate professor of nursing Melanie Kornides leads the RCT, where she is joined by experts in digital health communication and machine learning, software and program designers and social media analysts. They will help her run the study on 2,500 parents of children aged eight to 12. Kornides' team is collecting user data from YouTube, X, Facebook and Instagram – with their focus being on spaces where people talk about the human papillomavirus (HPV). They are also using natural language processing to train an AI tool to identify ""HPV misinformation"" or posts critical of vaccination, regardless of whether the information in them is true or false. (Related: HHS deploys AI robots to “inoculate” social media users against HPV vaccine ""misinformation."" ) The AI tool will then be exposed to subjects in three study arms, making use of different types of messaging. The control group will get no particular messaging, while two experimental groups will be exposed either to messaging designed to inoculate viewers against content critical of HPV vaccines or content critical of anti-vaccine arguments. The experimental groups will get ""booster"" doses of messaging at three and six months after their first exposure. According to the researchers, this approach against so-called ""misinformation"" can be used in ""wide-scale social media campaigns"" addressing pandemics, childhood vaccination and other health issues if it ends up being successful. They also wrote that misinformation about the HPV vaccine is a major cause of ""vaccine hesitancy."" While such messages circulate widely among well-meaning people, these often come from ""anti-vaccine organizations."" ""Misinformation"" being cited as an excuse for medical censorship According to the Defender , the researchers found that the AI tool deemed several posts on X with valid points as ""misinformation."" These posts often centered on vaccine effectiveness and safety, adverse events related to these injections and their lack of safety monitoring. Posts with claims about Big Pharma profiteering and the government being in cahoots with it were also deemed as such. Moreover, two posts on X verified by mainstream media outlets as legitimate were also dismissed as false. The first post involved Dr. Diane Harper, one of the lead researchers for the Gardasil HPV injection, criticizing her creation. The second post involved a 16-year-old Chicago teen being given the HPV injection without the knowledge or consent of her parents. But for CHD President and General Counsel Mary Holland, the RCT led by Kornides appears to be ""a sign of weakness."" She continued: ""This just proves yet again that anything that deviates from the orthodoxy in public health is considered misinformation."" "" When you are censoring information , labeling it misinformation and smearing us, this is a sign that they've lost the science and are now in a verbal food right.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-products-that-claim-to-stop-snoring-actually-work,Do products that claim to stop snoring actually work?,1,"Snoring is more than an annoying nighttime quirk; it's an issue that can affect your relationships, sleep quality, and health. Fortunately, certain lifestyle changes and products can help you manage this common problem. What causes snoring? Snoring occurs when airflow through the mouth and nose is partially blocked during sleep. The blockage causes the surrounding tissues to vibrate and produce sound — snoring. Various factors can narrow the airway and cause snoring, including relaxed throat muscles or a backward-slipping tongue. Here are some common factors that make snoring more likely: being overweight, which adds extra tissue around the neck that compresses the airways nasal issues like a deviated septum nasal polyps congestion from colds or allergies structural features, such as a long soft palate or uvula (the back part of the roof of your mouth), or swollen tonsils or adenoids poor muscle tone due to aging alcohol and certain medications that allow the airway to collapse more easily. In some cases, snoring may indicate sleep apnea, a serious condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. You can read more about sleep apnea below. Anti-snoring products Anti-snoring products, such as oral appliances or positional aids, can reduce snoring when used correctly. These devices most often work by helping to keep your airway open during sleep. This reduces the vibrations that cause snoring. Anti-snoring devices are often self-administered. If a device doesn't alleviate your snoring, your doctor can help you explore other treatment options and address any underlying causes. Positional aids Research shows that sleeping on your side (rather than on your back) can significantly reduce both the intensity and duration of snoring in many individuals without sleep apnea. For some people, positional aids that encourage side sleeping are a practical and low-cost way to reduce snoring. Positional aids can range from tennis balls sewn into the back of sleepwear to specialized devices that prompt your body to change position. Specialized vests, pillows, and alarms are examples of positional aids that can help snorers who struggle to maintain a side-sleeping posture. A literature review published in Sleep & Breathing found the effectiveness of positional aids varies from product to product. For example, vests with inflatable chambers were found to reduce snoring rates by more than half in positional-dependent snorers. Wedge pillows also significantly decreased snoring. On the other hand, wearable alarm devices that alerted snorers if they were sleeping on their back did not lead to significant improvement in snoring frequency. Researchers found that some users did not use the devices long-term because of issues with discomfort. Despite mixed findings, positional aids remain a low-risk option worth trying for snorers, especially those who notice improvements when sleeping on their side. Oral appliances Oral appliances work by keeping the airway open during sleep. These appliances fit over the teeth like retainers, and work by repositioning the jaw or holding the tongue forward to prevent airway obstruction. Oral appliances can improve sleep quality for both the user and their bed partner. When prescribed by a doctor and fitted by a dentist, these devices can be a comfortable and effective solution to address chronic snoring. (You can also purchase over-the-counter ""boil and bite"" oral appliances that you mold yourself.) While oral appliances can be effective, they are not without potential drawbacks. Some users experience temporary side effects such as drooling or jaw discomfort. And long-term use may lead to issues like changes in bite alignment. However, many people adjust to these devices with minimal discomfort, especially when they are properly fitted and regularly monitored by a dentist. Devices A relatively new device, called eXciteOSA, was approved by the FDA to reduce snoring and mild sleep apnea. The device is worn in the mouth and used while awake. It helps snoring by strengthening tongue muscles to prevent airway obstruction during sleep. It works by delivering gentle electrical stimulation through a mouthpiece with electrodes positioned above and below the tongue. In a clinical trial, users completed daily 20-minute sessions for six weeks, followed by weekly maintenance sessions. The trial showed improvements in the severity of sleep apnea as well as the percent of time spent snoring loudly. Side effects included excessive salivation, gagging, and tongue discomfort. Lifestyle changes to reduce snoring Reducing snoring frequency and intensity does not necessarily require spending money on a device. Some (free) lifestyle changes may help you reduce snoring. Avoid alcohol. Refrain from drinking alcohol within three hours of bedtime to prevent airway muscles from relaxing excessively during sleep. Maintain a healthy weight. Losing weight can decrease the amount of tissue in the neck and throat, reducing airway obstruction. Address nasal issues. Use saline rinses for a stuffy nose, minimize allergens in your bedroom, and consider a humidifier or medication for swollen nasal tissues. Quit smoking. Smoking irritates and inflames the upper airway, increasing the likelihood of snoring. Even exposure to secondhand smoke can contribute to the problem. Adjust sleeping position. Sleep on your side to prevent your tongue from blocking your airway. Try a body pillow, or sew a tennis ball to the back of your sleepwear to stay off your back. Elevate your head. Use extra pillows, a wedge pillow, or elevate the head of your bed to improve airflow. These strategies can help with simple snoring. But if symptoms like gasping, nighttime awakenings, or daytime sleepiness persist, consult a doctor to check for sleep apnea. Could your snoring be a sign of sleep apnea? Snoring can sometimes be a warning sign of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a sleep disorder that causes people to repeatedly stop breathing for short periods during sleep. Other signs and symptoms of sleep apnea include excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, morning headaches, or waking up feeling unrefreshed. It's important to see a doctor if you (or your bed partner) suspect you have sleep apnea. Untreated sleep apnea can lead to high blood pressure, putting a strain on the cardiovascular system, and other health concerns. To determine if snoring is a sign of sleep apnea, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. They may check for physical factors like a narrowed airway, a large neck circumference, or elevated blood pressure, all of which can indicate a higher risk of OSA. When doctors suspect sleep apnea, they typically recommended a sleep study to confirm the diagnosis. While sleep studies were once conducted exclusively in overnight labs, home-based sleep studies are now widely available and can provide sufficient data for diagnosis in many cases.",0,0.27358976,-0.10800964,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-26-the-science-locks-down-new-england-towns.html,The Science™ locks down four New England towns for ‘extremely rare’ virus after SINGLE infection,0,"Due to a single case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), four towns in New England are now subject to “voluntary” lockdowns for the foreseeable future, at least until the onset of winter. (Article republished from ArmageddonProse.Substack.com ) Via New York Post (emphasis added): “ Four Massachusetts towns — Douglas, Oxford, Sutton and Webster — have enacted a voluntary evening lockdown in an attempt to curb the spread of a potentially deadly mosquito-borne disease. The decision comes after the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) confirmed the first human case of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) since 2020 in Worcester County. On Wednesday, the Oxford Board of Health voted to support the recommendation for people to remain indoors after 6:00 p.m ., effective immediately, through Sept. 30, according to a public health advisory shared with Fox News Digital. Starting on Oct. 1, the recommendation is to remain indoors after 5:00 p.m. until the first hard frost .” The lockdowns are being marketed as “voluntary” — until, of course, you get into the fine print. Continuing: “ The lockdowns are considered recommendations , and there will be no enforcement if residents do not comply, the town spokesperson said. “We want to educate our residents about EEE and the seriousness of the illness and make them aware of the risk,” the statement continued. “However, if they want to use town fields outside these recommendations, they will have to show proof of insurance and sign an indemnification form .”” So, “voluntary” apparently means that if you want to use public lands, you need to sign a waiver and provide proof of insurance to the Public Health™ overseers — which really stretches the term to its limit.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-25-government-report-fluoride-intake-lowered-iq-children.html,Government report links fluoride intake to lowered IQ in children,0,"The United States government has once again found that consuming fluoride is really dangerous, especially for children. A new report from the National Toxicology Program (NTP), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), reveals that exposure to fluoridated water at levels twice the recommended limit of 0.7 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of water is linked to lower IQ. Keep in mind that prior to 2015, the government-recommended fluoride level for drinking water was 1.5 mg/l. For many decades – and still in some U.S. cities today that have not adjusted their fluoride levels to the new 0.7 mg/l standard – children across the U.S. have been forced to consume and bathe in water that was fluoridated at levels of 1.5 mg/l, which the NTP now admits causes brain damage and lowers IQ in children. The new study, which includes data and analyses from previously published research, marks the first time that a U.S. federal agency has determined ""with moderate confidence"" that fluoride damages children's brains. ""While the report was not designed to evaluate the health effects of fluoride in drinking water alone, it is a striking acknowledgment of a potential neurological risk from high levels of fluoride,"" The Associated Press (AP) reported. (Related: Harvard University researchers identified a link between fluoride and ADHD and mental disorders some 10 years ago, but fluoridated water keeps on flowing through taps across the U.S.) Drinking, bathing in any amount of fluoride isn't safe The CDC still claims that fluoride consumption at lower levels is safe, helping to re-mineralize teeth and prevent dental caries (cavities). How is a person supposed to regulate this, though, when people are exposed to fluoridated water at unknown levels each and every day? If a person lives in a fluoridated area and consumes food and beverages made with fluoridated water, not to mention brushing one's teeth with fluoridated toothpaste, the amount of fluoride that ends up being ingested has the potential to be very high. Even if fluoride does the things that public health officials continue to claim it does for the benefit of health, the drug needs to be regulated and controlled at specific levels in actual drug products, not laced into the water supply. ""I think this (report) is crucial in our understanding,"" commented Ashley Malin, a researcher at the University of Florida who has been studying the effects of fluoride on pregnant women and their unborn children, calling the study the most rigorous of its kind. For their study, researchers at the NTP reviewed a cohort of studies from Canada, China, Iran, India, Pakistan and Mexico looking at fluoridated drinking water. Based on the results of all these studies, the NTP determined that consuming fluoridated water at levels greater than 1.5 mg/l results in lost IQ points. While the review itself did not determine exactly how many IQ points are lost due to drinking fluoridated water, several of the studies included as part of the review suggested that children not exposed to fluoridated drinking water have an IQ that is anywhere between two and five points higher than their fluoridated counterparts. The World Health Organization (WHO), by the way, still recommends that water supplies be fluoridated at a level of 1.5 mg/l, which is more than double the new recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of 2015 that only 0.7 mg/l of fluoride be added to water supplies. Currently, about 0.6 percent of the total U.S. population, around 1.9 million people, are still exposed to drinking water fluoridated at levels of 1.5 mg/l or higher. ""The findings from this report raise the questions about how these people can be protected and what makes the most sense,"" Malin added.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-your-dentist-could-save-your-life,How your dentist could save your life,1,"""Open wide."" It's our main task when we sit in the dentist's chair, and we might assume our dentist has one job, too — to assess the condition of our teeth. But looking for plaque, cavities, and gum disease is only part of the picture. Dentists have a prime vantage point to be the first line of defense in identifying problems all over the body. More than 100 conditions can produce signs in the mouth, according to the American Heart Association, and dental training enables these clinicians to spot telltale clues in the teeth, gums, tongue, palate, lips, jaw, face, and neck. ""I think individuals should view their dentists as an indispensable part of their health care team,"" says Dr. Christine Riedy, an associate professor in oral public health and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. ""Some people describe the mouth as the gateway to the body and oral health as the canary in the coal mine. It's true — dentists might see things that can indicate other things happening in the body."" A lengthy list of threats What conditions can dentists detect, and what signs are they looking for? Oral cancer. Rough spots, swelling, bumps, or unexplained bleeding in the mouth might signal head and neck cancers, as do irregularities in the face, lips, jaw, or neck. While head and neck malignancies account for only about 4% of all cancers in the United States, they're more prevalent in older adults. ""Patches of mucosa that are either red or white, as well as lumps or sores, are some of the things dentists would find suspicious,"" Dr. Riedy says. ""Seeing your dentist on a regular basis is really important to pick up those changes."" (See ""Anxiety-busting strategies for visiting the dentist."") Diabetes. About 9% of Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes, but an estimated 23% of adults who have the condition don't know it, according to the National Institutes of Health. When sugar levels are elevated in the blood, they're also elevated in saliva. Bacteria in dental plaque feed on that, fueling inflamed and bleeding gums. Diabetes can also lead to dry mouth and infections in the mouth that take longer to heal. ""Some dentists have put HbA1c tests [which measure average blood sugar levels over the past three months] into their screening toolkit to better understand whether a patient has diabetes,"" Dr. Riedy says. Sleep apnea. More than a quarter of American adults are believed to have sleep apnea: a pattern of frequent lapses in breathing during sleep, often accompanied by heavy snoring. Untreated, the condition raises risk for serious conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Dentists might suspect sleep apnea if they notice enlargement of the tonsils, tongue, or jaw muscles; a red throat; or signs of teeth grinding. ""Because people with sleep apnea sleep with their mouth open, they can get dry mouth, which also creates an environment for oral disease,"" she says. Osteoporosis. Four times as common among older women than men, the progressive loss of bone density characterizing this condition might show up on x-rays of the teeth and jaw. Missing and loose teeth can also be a tip-off. ""With the loss of bone density, the jawbone becomes weaker, and teeth lose their stability,"" Dr. Riedy says. Acid reflux. Eroded enamel on back teeth is a major clue someone has acid reflux, and their teeth may also be discolored. ""People may experience heartburn and not realize that gastric acid has actually reached their mouth,"" she says. ""They think it's only centered in the chest."" Eating disorders. Surprisingly, Dr. Riedy says, dentists are often the first health care providers to recognize signs of eating disorders, particularly among people who purge by vomiting. Many people with eating disorders — which affect girls and women twice as often as males — engage in binge-purge cycles that don't substantially affect their weight or appearance. ""Outwardly, maybe they don't look like they have an eating disorder, but dentists can see deterioration of the back teeth and enamel erosion due to acid,"" she says. Anxiety-busting strategies for visiting the dentist Dentists can root out our health problems — whether in the mouth or elsewhere — only if we schedule an appointment. But while we're supposed to see our dentist every six months, many people view that recommendation as optional. Only two-thirds of American adults visited a dentist in the past year, according to the CDC. Why the low attendance? A big part of it is fear, says Dr. Christine Riedy, an associate professor in oral public health and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. An estimated 15% of people across the world report dental anxiety — women more often than men, according to an April 2023 study in Health Affairs. Whether it's pain, needles, or a loss of control, various aspects of dental care might contribute to reluctance to see a dentist. So can an unpleasant encounter in the past or embarrassment about oral health. Some people don't like when a dentist or hygienist leans close to their face. Some worry about how their breath smells. But there are ways you can reclaim a calmer frame of mind when you approach the dental chair. Dr. Riedy suggests these strategies: Distraction. Listen to music or a podcast through headphones. Some dentists also offer music or videos that help divert your attention. ""Try to focus on something other than what's happening in your mouth,"" she says. Relaxation techniques. Meditation can lower stress levels, and ""deep breathing can slow your heart rate and help you get yourself more in control,"" Dr. Riedy says. Sedation. Ask your dentist if she can administer medication that calms and relaxes you during treatment, such as nitrous oxide (laughing gas). Some dentists will provide a prescription for an oral sedative you can take at home before your visit, as long as you have someone to drive you. Bring a buddy. ""Having someone you trust come with you to the appointment can help reduce some of your anxiety,"" she says. Maximizing your dental check ups If your dentist notices signs of another health problem, she'll likely refer you to your primary care doctor or an appropriate specialist. But you can also make it easier for her to gather as much useful information as possible during dental check-ups. ""It may sound basic, but often your dentist will ask if you have any health updates,"" Dr. Riedy says. ""Sharing your health history and any updates can be really important, and asking questions is crucial."" It's also essential to voice any health concerns to your dentist, just as you would with your primary care doctor. You may believe a problem with another aspect of your health has nothing to do with your oral health, but you might be wrong. ""Be an advocate for your own care,"" she says.

Trump would continue in his speech to read the following statement to the crowd: ""I will rehire every patriot who was fired from the military with an apology and with back pay. They will get back pay and an apology from our government."" BREAKING: President Trump is going to apologize, rehire, and provide back pay to vets that were terminated for refusing the mRNA poison COVID vaccines.?

Trump denies knowing about Project 2025 What many Americans have trouble with is the fact that Trump played a pivotal role in the fast-tracked creation and unleashing of deadly COVID injections under Operation Warp Speed. Legislation was passed to protect Big Pharma from lawsuits over jab injuries and deaths, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was allowed to grant emergency use authorization (EUA) for the experimental drugs through lies and manipulation. At the time, Trump and his people were telling the world that ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were helpful remedies for COVID. At the same time, though, Trump kept hawking the then-upcoming vaccines that he repeatedly boasted that ""his"" vaccines were created at hyper-speed with his help. COVID jabs turned out to be wildly unpopular among Trump voters, so now Trump is saying that he will try to make things right for military veterans by giving them back what was taken from them during the ""pandemic."" ""Now he needs to apologize for pushing them at all on anyone,"" one person wrote on X about Trump. ""Let's go one step further and force hospitals to do the same,"" another person added about how everyone who punished others for not getting jabbed should be made to make things right. In response to criticism from Tim Walz about his alleged Project 2025 plan for the nation, Trump told Fox & Friends in a recent interview that Walz is a ""lightweight"" who ""shouldn't be even having any access to possibly being president."" ""The guy, he's been a terrible governor. They've had nothing but problems in their state. He has no capability. They call him coach. He's a semi-coach. You coach some football for a little while. This guy is a lightweight and he shouldn't have access."" Trump continued in the interview to claim that he ""has no idea"" what Project 25 [sic] even is, and that his opposition is simply making it all up to try to make him look bad. ""They know I have nothing to do with it,"" Trump said. ""I had no idea what it was. A group of people got together, they drew up some conservative values, very conservative values, and in some cases perhaps they went over the line. Perhaps they didn't. I have no idea what Project 25 [sic] is but they use it and they know it."" As for the restitution that Trump spoke about for persecuted, unvaccinated military vets, someone on X added that airline pilots who were fired for refusing the shots deserve the exact same restitution under a Trump presidency.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-22-study-covid-vaccines-heart-inflammation-failure-children.html,Oxford study reveals COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as the sole cause of heart inflammation and heart failure in children,0,"Researchers at the University of Oxford have uncovered one of the most significant data points with the COVID-19 vaccines. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are the sole cause of myocarditis, pericarditis and heart failure among children and adolescents. This revelation challenges the narrative pushed by the Food and Drug Administration , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and mainstream media, which have downplayed or outright denied the risks associated with these vaccines. Children should have never been injected with these instruments of medical fraud, and some suffered heart inflammation and death as a result. (Related: Science behind the CDC's childhood vaccines lacks double blind, placebo-controlled studies and conceals adverse events .) Myocarditis, pericarditis and heart failure occurred only in the vaccinated adolescents The extensive study, which analyzed official government data from over one million children and adolescents aged five to 15 in England, found that myocarditis and pericarditis were exclusively linked to COVID-19 vaccinations. No cases of heart inflammation were recorded among unvaccinated children or those infected with COVID-19. This finding contradicts previous claims linking these serious health issues to COVID-19 infection, sugar intake, video games, or even climate change. Health officials tried to scare parents into vaccinating , claiming their kids would contract COVID-19 and have heart problems from the virus. It turns out that the opposite is true. According to the Oxford study, all reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis occurred in children who had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Myocarditis and pericarditis cases were documented exclusively in the vaccinated groups, with a rate of 27 cases per million after the first dose and 10 cases per million after the second dose. “All myocarditis and pericarditis events during the study period occurred in vaccinated individuals,” the study authors wrote. Over half of the adolescents affected by myocarditis were hospitalized for their serious vaccine injury. Nearly 60% of children in the first vaccination group never received a second dose, so obviously there were widespread concerns about continuing with the harmful vaccine protocol. How many more children would have been injured had parents or doctors not stepped in and stopped the protocol? The COVID-19 vaccines were completely unnecessary for adolescents The study also highlighted that hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 were exceedingly rare in the study group, and there were no recorded deaths from the virus. In fact, both the unvaccinated and vaccinated children tested positive for the virus at similar rates, so there’s no solid data proving that the vaccine prevented anything. This data point also contradicts the fear-based narratives put out by governments and mainstream media authorities. The vaccine was unnecessary from the start and provided no known benefits for adolescents – only heart damage. Dr. John Campbell, a well-known commentator on medical issues, has condemned the results as “deeply troubling,” stressing that this revelation could have catastrophic implications for public health. ""This could not be a more serious report,"" Campbell warned, urging immediate action to address the public health crisis revealed by the study. He describes how the vaccine causes stroke in the following video . To make matters worse, a recent study by Harvard Medical School has linked COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to a sharp increase in sudden deaths worldwide , including fatal cerebral ischemia. The Harvard researchers specifically implicated Moderna's vaccine in the recent spike in this deadly brain disorder, which shuts off blood flow to the brain. This serious health issue is more prominent in studies that investigate health outcomes up to a year after vaccination. The study is also limited, because the control group is centered around unvaccinated populations that were subject to COVID-19 tests, an instrument of medical fraud that was used to forcibly admit children to hospitals and subject them to further deleterious protocol. The study doesn’t look at the large pool of adolescents who didn’t take the tests, who got mildly ill and easily recovered at home.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-winter-affects-chronic-conditions,How winter affects chronic conditions,1,"We all have triggers for some particular health condition. Eat spicy food, for example, and you might get heartburn. Lift something heavy, and it might set off chronic low-back pain. And if you're coping with cold weather, you might experience a flare-up of certain diseases. Here are four chronic ailments that seem to worsen in winter. Psoriasis Winter poses many risks for people with psoriasis, which causes raised red patches of skin covered in silvery or white scales. Flare-ups can result from dry skin due to being in heated indoor air or taking long, hot showers. Winter bugs such as viral infections or strep throat also can trigger a psoriasis flare, as can reduced exposure to sunlight. ""UVB radiation is actually a treatment for psoriasis, as it slows down the rapid skin growth that drives psoriasis,"" says Dr. Sally Tan, director of the Atopic Dermatitis Specialty Clinic at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Recommendations: ""Take shorter, lukewarm showers; use a humidifier around the house; and moisturize with bland, cream-based emollients liberally—at least once a day, right after showering—to keep the skin well-moisturized and the skin barrier intact during winter months,"" Dr. Tan advises. ""And try to get 10 to 15 minutes of natural sunlight exposure each day. Wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even if you're just sitting indoors by a window."" Asthma Many things we breathe in — such as pollen or pollution — can set off an attack of asthma, a chronic lung condition caused by inflammation and narrowing of the airways. ""Triggers vary, but most people with asthma are bothered by breathing cold air, which cools and dehydrates the airways. That causes them to spasm and tighten, known as bronchoconstriction,"" explains Dr. Nicholas Nassikas, a pulmonologist with Beth Israel Deaconess. Recommendations: ""Avoiding triggers is easier said than done when you live in a cold climate,"" Dr. Nassikas says. ""Try to do outdoor activities during warmer parts of the day. Before going outside for more than a few minutes, take a puff of a rescue inhaler. When outdoors, wear a mask, which will help reduce symptoms by warming and humidifying air before it gets into the lungs. Also, continue prescribed asthma therapies; stay away from heavy pollution, such as smoke from firepits; and avoid viral illness by washing your hands and masking around people who are sick."" Raynaud's disease Raynaud's disease is a blood vessel disorder triggered by cold environments. Instead of the normal response to cold weather, with blood vessels narrowing slightly to direct more blood and warmth to the organs, the response is exaggerated (vasospasm). ""The vessels in the fingers and toes narrow excessively upon exposure to cold. This can compromise blood flow in the affected fingers and toes, which can be painful,"" says Dr. Vasileois Kyttaris, a rheumatologist at Beth Israel Deaconess. Recommendations: Avoid unnecessary exposure to cold, and make sure to dress warmly outside: a coat, hat, and mittens are a must, and hand and foot warmers are a big help. Put on cold-weather gear before you step outside, and leave your coat, mittens, and hat on while you're in the freezer section of a grocery store. At home, turn up the thermostat a few degrees, and block cold air coming in through drafty doors and windows. Your doctor might also recommend a vasodilator drug to open blood vessels. Arthritis Many people with arthritis (no matter which kind) say that cold weather worsens joint pain. Is it true? ""Some people tend to have more pain and stiffness during certain weather conditions, but research on the connection is inconclusive,"" Dr. Kyttaris says. It's not that doctors don't believe there's a link; they just don't have enough scientific evidence for one. Or the weather may affect just some people with arthritis. Recommendations: If you feel cold weather makes your arthritis symptoms worse, ramp up your pill-free arthritis regimen. Use heat therapy (such as a heating pad or warm shower or bath) or wear a joint brace (such as a knee sleeve) to help reduce inflammation. Most importantly, exercise. Daily physical activity can lower inflammation and enhance blood flow; both contribute to pain relief. For more information, check out the Harvard Online Learning course Joint Pain Relief Workout. Finally, talk to your doctor. You may need a prescription adjustment or a new medication. Or it could be that another condition is causing pain.

But if it's hard to rack up the recommended amount of activity during the five-day work week (150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, like brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity, like swimming), consider the ""weekend warrior"" approach — fitting it all into one or two weekly sessions. The approach might offer the same brain health benefits, according to a study published online Oct. 29, 2024, by the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Researchers analyzed the health and self-reported activity information of more than 10,000 dementia-free people in Mexico who were followed for about 16 years. After accounting for factors that could influence the results, such as lifestyle habits, scientists found that weekend warriors were 13% less likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia, compared with people who didn't exercise — about the same benefit seen in those who exercised during the work week. While the study was observational and can't prove cause and effect, it supports the idea that even less frequent exercise might help protect brain health, and it might be a more convenient option for busy people.

Just how risky are these drugs?Because statins have been on the market for so long, the side effects are well known. About 10% of people develop muscle aches, which disappear when they stop taking the drug. Depending on the dose, statins also increase the risk of developing diabetes by 10% to 35%, possibly by preventing your body's insulin from working well, which causes blood sugar to rise. This side effect is most common in people with obesity and prediabetes, who are already prone to developing diabetes.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-22-hhs-ai-robots-inoculate-hpv-vaccine-misinformation.html,HHS deploys AI robots to “inoculate” social media users against HPV vaccine “misinformation”,0,"Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) have developed an artificial intelligence-powered weapon for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that will allow the government to police the internet for ""misinformation"" about HPV (human papillomavirus), Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and other ""vaccines"" on social media. The team says its AI policing robot can be ""swiftly and efficiently"" adapted to address the spread of content online that negatively impacts Big Pharma's vaccine sales pipeline. Using United States taxpayer dollars, UPenn researchers say they now have the technology at the ready to ""inoculate"" social media users against ""misinformation"" about childhood vaccines. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, Children's Health Defense (CHD) was able to procure grant documents showing that HHS is spending $4 million on an ""Inoculate for HPV Vaccine"" randomized controlled trial that began in April 2022 and will run through March 2027. The National Cancer Institute is also contributing cash to the project. Headed by Melanie L. Kornides, an associate professor of nursing at UPenn, the AI robot development program aims to increase vaccine uptake across the U.S. population. It is also focused on developing ""strategies to combat misinformation"" in general. Kornides and her cohort of digital health communication experts, software and program designers, social media analysts, and machine learning experts will run their social media ""inoculation"" experiment on the parents of 2,500 children between the ages of eight and 12. Data is being collected from platforms like YouTube, Twitter (now X), Facebook, and Instagram. (Related: Did you know that HPV vaccines like Gardasil are triggering severe injuries and deaths in children ?) Using natural language processing to train AI in the weapon of censorship Since most online talk about vaccines seems to take place on the above social media platforms, Kornides and her colleagues are using natural language processing to train their AI robot in how to identify ""HPV misinformation,"" also known as posts and comments that are critical or questioning of HPV vaccines. Regardless of whether the information is true or false, Kornides and her team aim to remove all of it that could cause parents to not vaccinate their children. Study subjects will be exposed to three separate study arms with different types of messaging in order to deploy the ""inoculation tool"" to test whether or not it makes them ""immune"" to ""misinformation."" ""A control group will get no particular messaging and two test groups will be exposed either to messaging designed to inoculate viewers against content critical of of HPV vaccines and content critical of anti-vaccine arguments,"" CHD reports. ""The subjects will get 'booster' doses of messaging at three and six months after their first inoculation ... If successful, the researchers wrote, this novel approach to combating health 'misinformation' can be used in 'wide-scale social media campaigns' addressing pandemics, childhood vaccination and other health issues."" The researchers claim that their new AI robot is necessary because ""misinformation"" about HPV vaccines is one of the leading drivers behind so-called ""vaccine hesitancy,"" which they claim often comes from ""anti-vaccine organizations."" According to Mary Holland, co-author of ""The HPV Vaccine on Trial: Seeking Justice for a Generation Betrayed,"" what these UPenn researchers are trying to do is ""a sign of weakness"" within the public health industry. ""When you are censoring information, labeling it misinformation and smearing us, this is a sign that they've lost the science and are now in a verbal food fight,"" Holland is quoted as saying.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-heartfelt-gift-ideas-for-valentines-day,5 heartfelt gift ideas for Valentine's Day,1,"On February 14 — a day symbolized by hearts and dedicated to love — give that special someone a present that shows you care. Or treat yourself to one (or more) of these five gift suggestions, all of which are designed to make it easier and more enjoyable to follow the cornerstones of a heart-healthy lifestyle: eating well, getting regular exercise, sleeping soundly, and managing stress. Dr. Beth Frates, a lifestyle medicine coach and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, explains why and how these gifts encourage habits that benefit the heart. 1. A cooking class Making home-cooked meals is one of the best things you can do for your cardiovascular health. Research suggests that people who eat more meals made at home tend to weigh less and have healthier cholesterol and blood sugar values compared with people who eat out frequently. ""You can control the amount of saturated fat, salt, and sugar in food you make yourself. You'll also avoid the preservatives, additives, and dyes found in convenience foods like frozen dinners and other processed foods,"" says Dr. Frates. For people who feel they don't have the time or skills to prepare healthy food, a cooking class can help. A great place to start is a single class or series of classes about Mediterranean cooking or a similar cuisine that highlights heart-healthy ingredients: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats like extra-virgin olive oil or canola oil, and plant-based proteins like nuts, seeds, legumes, and tofu (or fish or chicken for those who choose animal proteins). ""Taking cooking classes together is a wonderful way to bond, to have some fun, and to nourish your body,"" says Dr. Frates. Once you hone your skills and grow more comfortable making meals, cooking can also be a great way to express your creativity, she adds. Some restaurants, supermarkets, and cookware stores offer on-site cooking classes. Alternatively, you can check local community centers and colleges, or search online. 2. Strawberries dipped in dark chocolate Both strawberries and dark chocolate contain beneficial plant compounds called flavonoids, which are thought to improve cardiovascular health by relaxing blood vessels, improving blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and discouraging blood clots. Studies have linked diets rich in flavonoids to a lower risk of heart attacks and related problems. ""Chocolate-dipped strawberries are a classic Valentine's Day gift, and they're also delectable,"" says Dr. Frates. Look for those made with dark chocolate, which tends to have a higher flavonoid content than milk chocolate. Better yet, buy your own high-quality dark chocolate and berries and make them yourself — or maybe even together with your valentine, she suggests. 3. Custom-fit sneakers If people walk, jog, or hike in shoes that don't fit properly, they can run into problems, says Dr. Frates. For example, ill-fitting shoes can cause blisters, put pressure on bunions, or leave you vulnerable to plantar fasciitis (inflammation of the fibrous band of tissue on the bottom of the foot) and Achilles tendinitis (inflammation of the tendon connecting the calf muscle to the heel). Some experts recommend replacing your walking shoes at least every 300 to 500 miles, which translates to a new pair every six to 12 months if you regularly walk about three miles per day. Treat your valentine to an outing to your local specialty running store, where you'll find the best selection and expert advice about footwear options. Many running stores sell walking shoes, and you can even wear running shoes for walking. Outdoor equipment stores may be your best bet for hiking boots. It's well worth the investment of time (and the possibly higher price tag) to have a knowledgeable staff member help you select a well-fitting shoe to suit your needs. Be sure to try on several different brands and styles, and take them for a test walk or jog around the store. 4. Luxury sleep products Getting at least seven hours of sleep each night is vital for cardiovascular health, says Dr. Frates. Insufficient sleep can raise your risk for weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Creating a sleep sanctuary that's quiet, dark, and comfortable can make it easier to fall and stay asleep. A variety of accessories and products may help improve slumber. But it's important to know the preferences of your intended recipient, so ask questions or drop hints to gather clues. Some people might like a sleep machine that provides white noise or a recording of soothing sounds, such as falling rain, croaking frogs, or chirping crickets. Other might appreciate luxurious high-thread-count sheets, a silk pillowcase, or lavender-scented bath salts for a pre-slumber soak. If outside lights or early morning sunlight curtails sleep time, consider light-blocking curtains or shades. An eye mask made of soft, breathable material (such as cotton or silk) is another option. 5. A subscription to a meditation app Meditation and mindfulness have been shown to lower blood pressure, decrease levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and increase heart rate variability (microsecond time differences from one heartbeat to the next), all of which are linked to better heart health. ""A regular meditation practice can help you to better manage stress, which is an unavoidable part of life,"" says Dr. Frates. Because meditation doesn't come naturally to most people, guidance and coaching from an in-person or online class really helps. A more convenient option is a subscription to a meditation app that you can listen to on your smartphone at your leisure. Popular meditation apps include Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer, and Happier. Most offer a free trial period, so you could send sign-up links to a few that you think your valentine might enjoy, and then offer to treat them to a yearlong subscription.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/rfk-special-what-are-ultra-processed-foods-and-why-are-they-so-bad-for-us,RFK Jr. Special: What Are Ultra-Processed Foods and Why Are They So Bad for Us?,0,"Editor’s note: Now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed as President Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services, Infowars is republishing this definitive analysis on issues that will no doubt be addressed now that America is ready to be healthy again. Robert F. Kennedy Junior’s decision to retire and endorse Donald Trump has electrified a presidential race that was hardly lacking in excitement. Donald Trump had already come millimetres from having his head blown off, and Joe Biden was deposed in a carefully orchestrated palace coup, to make way for Kamala Harris. This has been a campaign of shocks and firsts, and now we can add another first to that list: a member of the Kennedy family supporting a Republican ticket. In his announcement on Friday, before he joined Trump on stage in Arizona, Kennedy said that he would work with the Trump administration to “make America healthy again.” He described watching a generation of children grow up “damaged” as a result of poor diet and environmental pollution, and said that four more years of Democratic rule will “complete the consolidation of corporate and neocon power, and our children will be the ones that suffer most.” “For 19 years I prayed, every morning, that God would put me in a position to end this calamity. The chronic-disease crisis was one of my primary reasons for running for president, along with ending the censorship and the Ukraine war.” Now Kennedy is in a position to do that, and Trump has confirmed that he will head a task-force to investigate, and hopefully solve, America’s unprecedented health crisis. The prevalence of obesity, diabetes, autism and AHDH, cancer, auto-immune conditions, infertility and reproductive issues, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s is exploding across the Western world, but especially in America, which leads the world, or once did, in virtually every single metric of ill health you could care to name. Over 40% of adults in the US are now classified as obese, and 1 in 36 American children have an autism-spectrum disorder. On Friday, Kennedy identified two major contributors to this health crisis: ultra-processed food and toxic endocrine-disrupting chemicals. These are things Kennedy has talked about, at length, for years—decades, actually—including in the 2022 Tucker Carlson documentary The End of Men, which I’m proud to say I featured in prominently, alongside him. The harmful effects of ultra-processed food and endocrine-disruptors are no longer fringe topics for discussion, but you may still be confused or unsure about what they are and why they’re bad. That’s where I come in. I’ve not been writing about these things for quite as long as RFK Jr. has, but I have been raising awareness about them for the last four years, including in my book The Eggs Benedict Option and my various media and podcast appearances. Today and on Monday, I’ll be telling you everything you need to know to get a handle on ultra-processed food and endocrine disruptors. These two primers can be shared with family and friends to help educate them and give them an incentive to improve their health by reducing their dependence on and exposure to ultra-processed foods and toxic chemicals. Today I’ll tell you about ultra-processed foods in particular. A BRIEF HISTORY OF FOOD PROCESSING Food has been processed since the dawn of human history, or at least as far back as we can see through the mists of time. Our distant ancestors used fire to cook meat and other foods, and they discovered how to grind wild grains to make flour for early forms of bread. They also discovered how to harness bacteria—not that they knew anything about microbes—to ferment foods, helping to preserve and increase their digestibility and nutritional value in the process. They learned other preservation techniques like drying, smoking and, where the weather was cold enough, freezing. Food prepared using any one or more of these techniques satisfies the common-sense definition of “processed food,” and for the longest span of human history, until the nineteenth century, this is how food was processed by human beings, if it was processed at all. We cooked at home. Bread was made at home or in a local bakery. The majority of ingredients were sourced locally, apart from luxury items obtained through long-distance trade like sugar and spices. In the last century or so, food began to be processed and sold to the public in new ways. Food started to be manufactured in factories owned by large-scale conglomerates, using new industrial processes and new ingredients like hydrogenated oils, seed and vegetable oils, refined sugars and refined grains. Special additives were created to alter the properties of the food produced—to alter its texture, color it or make it last longer—and new storage methods like canning and tinning also meant that the shelf-life of food could be extended, allowing these foods to reach new markets at home and overseas. The creation of the first factory-made foods heralded a major shift in Western dietary patterns, and these foods soon made their way outside the West, to every corner of the globe. The immediate effects of this dietary shift were nothing short of disastrous. The pioneering dentist Weston A. Price described the early effects in his classic book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration, from 1939, a book I consider to be the greatest book on nutrition ever written. Price noticed worrying changes in the physical health of his patients, especially the children, in his practice in Cleveland, Ohio. It wasn’t just that their teeth were getting worse—and they were: their mouths were suddenly full of cavities—it’s that the entire structure of their faces seemed to be collapsing. The teeth themselves, the jaw and the roof of the mouth weren’t forming properly, and nor were the cheeks or nasal passages. What’s more, these worrying physical changes were accompanied by behavioural changes, including learning difficulties, that had previously been unknown. One of the most amazing parts, and the most difficult for us to process as ""moderns"", of Weston Price's classic book Nutrition and Physical Degeneration (1939) is the fact that traditional peoples eating their ancestral diets rarely if ever suffered from diseases like cancer.… pic.twitter.com/hvq6Qz2EKu — RAW EGG NATIONALIST (@Babygravy9) July 30, 2023 Price knew that diet had to be to blame, and eventually he got the chance to test his hypothesis with rigor. He travelled the globe with his wife, visiting small-scale communities on every inhabited continent, from the Inuit in the Arctic to pastoralists like the Nuer and Masai in Africa, and even remote communities in Europe, like the crofters and fishermen of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, and the high Alpine Swiss. Price found that, wherever the people in these communities cleaved to their ancestral diets—wherever they ate locally produced whole foods, and especially nutrient-dense animal foods like organ meat, fatty cuts of meat, dairy, seafood and shellfish, eggs, blood products and butter—the people displayed remarkable health and vigor, including resistance to infectious diseases. The symptoms of physical degeneration Price had seen back in Ohio were totally absent. But wherever these people deviated from their ancestral diets and started eating Western industrial foods—especially tinned foods high in sugar and refined wheat products—the symptoms of physical degeneration became apparent very quickly. Weston Price’s work provided an early warning against the abandonment of traditional diets for new factory-made foods. Sadly, it went unheeded. In the decades since, we have moved further and further away from our traditional diets in the West, and across the rest of the world, increasing our reliance on factory-made foodstuffs that contain ingredients and additives that humans have little or even no history of ever consuming. The manufacture of processed foods has become more and more sophisticated, employing new techniques and an ever-expanding list of ingredients. Importantly, processed-food manufacturers have employed powerful targeted advertising that focuses on their products’ convenience and irresistible moreishness. These are the true “ultra-processed foods.” PROCESSED FOOD TODAY Before we go any further, here’s a minimal working definition of ultra-processed food: food that’s produced in a factory, contains one or more ingredients you wouldn’t find in a normal home kitchen—emulsifiers, humectants, colourings, stabilisers, preservatives—and is sold to you wrapped in plastic. There’s a certain amount of quibbling about the definition of ultra-processed food, especially from scientists who happen to be funded by manufacturers of ultra-processed food, but it’s absolutely clear that there is a significant difference between the kind of processed food people are consuming in enormous quantities today and even the sort of foods Weston Price associated with physical degeneration back in the 1930s. In many Western countries, children now derive the majority of their daily calories from ultra-processed food. A study from 2021 showed that toddlers in the UK (children aged between two and five) derive an average of 61% of their daily calories from ultra-processed food. Toddlers in the US hardly fare much better, getting 58% of their daily calories from ultra-processed food. Scientific research has linked processed foods to virtually every single one of the prevailing chronic diseases of modernity I discussed at the beginning of this piece—to everything from autism to Alzheimer’s. The best way to illustrate the whole host of problems associated with massive processed-food consumption would be to point you in the direction of a BBC documentary that was made during the pandemic. In What Are We Feeding Our Kids? a British doctor called Chris Van Tulleken spent one month eating a diet comprising 80% ultra-processed food. At least one fifth of British adults now follow such a diet. The changes Dr Van Tulleken experienced were shocking. He gained a considerable amount of weight. He suffered from constipation and hemorrhoids. He couldn’t sleep, and began waking up in the middle of the night to raid the fridge for more sugary snacks, despite, by his own admission, not being hungry. His libido disappeared and he became paranoid and anxious. MRI scans taken before and after the experiment revealed that Van Tulleken’s brain had actually been rewired in the manner we’d expect of a drug addict. The scans showed significant increases in connections between areas linking reward and automatic behaviour, and these changes appeared to be permanent. Months after the experiment ended, the connections were still lighting up under the scanner. He had been hardwired to crave ultra-processed food. Manufacturers of ultra-processed foods are well aware their food is addictive. They make it that way deliberately. They call this addictiveness “hyperpalatability,” and they employ small armies of highly paid food scientists to exploit the complicated neurobiology of food pleasure—sensations like sweetness, saltiness, crunch and chew—to ensure that consumers reach the so-called “bliss point” and can’t stop eating. A 2019 study showed that we eat ultra-processed foods 30% faster than normal foods. As a result, our bodies’ natural hormone mechanisms to signal satiety don’t have time to respond. That means we overeat, and if all we eat is ultra-processed food, we overeat all the time. I’ve called ultra-processed food “weaponized food” with good reason. The companies that manufacture it know exactly what they’re doing and why. Of course, if you were a food manufacturer, you’d probably do that too: you’d want to maximize your profits as well. But that doesn’t make it right. Interestingly, recent research has shown that tobacco companies may have played a pivotal role in hooking consumers on new ultra-processed foods in the 1980s, deploying the same marketing tricks and techniques as they used to hook people on cigarettes decades earlier. RFK Jr. has mentioned this. WHAT’S WRONG WITH ULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD? It’s not simply that ultra-processed food is designed to be overeaten, and overeating anything will, at the very least, make you overweight. The individual ingredients that go into processed food are bad too. Processed food is full of cheap, low-quality ingredients, many of which are now genetically modified. Production of the base commodities that are turned into these ingredients—which means corn and soy, principally—is heavily subsidized by the US government. Processed food has been the main vehicle for corn and soy producers to get rid of the vast amounts of these crops they produce annually, whether in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, modified corn starch, soy protein or soybean oil. If you want to know more, in detail, about why American farmers produce so much corn and how it ends up in so much of the food Americans eat, I’d recommend you read Michael Pollan’s book The Omnivore’s Dilemma. One ingredient of particular concern in ultra-processed food is seed and vegetable oils, which RFK Jr. has singled out for their health effects on a number of occasions, including during his announcement on Friday night. Although seed and vegetable oils have been marketed as healthy alternatives to traditional animal fats for the last 70 years, the truth is that they are anything but healthy. A large body of scientific evidence now links these novel fats to chronic inflammation, which is the cause of many diseases, as well as obesity and genetic dysregulation in animals and humans. These fats are toxic by their very nature, and shouldn’t be consumed in the kind of quantities people are consuming them today, mainly via processed food. Take soybean oil, for example, consumption of which has increased a thousandfold over the last century. A study from 2020 showed that, as well as being obesogenic, soybean oil causes serious genetic dysregulation and neurological damage in mice. The genes affected included genes associated with inflammation, neuroendocrine and neurochemical processes, insulin signalling, and the production of oxytocin, the “love hormone,” which is responsible for social bonding. Other genes that were affected are linked to neurological diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s, and autism. The authors of the study conclude that, although the study was conducted on mice, the results are likely to hold for humans as well: “the [soybean-oil-rich] American diet may be not only contributing to increased rates of metabolic disease but also affecting neurological function.” But it’s not just the “food” ingredients that we should be worried about. In recent years, there’s been a growing focus on the harmful effects of the non-nutritional additives that are found in ultra-processed food. These are the kind of ingredients you won’t find in a standard home kitchen: things like emulsifiers, colourings, humectants, texturisers, preservatives and anti-fungals, anti-caking agents and so on. Artificial sweeteners, for example, have been linked to depression and gut dysbiosis—disruption of the digestive system—which is, in turn, linked to a whole host of other illnesses, from behavioural conditions like autism and ADHD, to neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s. The US system of food additives, under the management of the FDA, is a beacon of stupidity and corruption. I’ve described the FDA’s “Generally Recognised as Safe” (GRAS) system as “Generally Recognised as Insane” for the ridiculous attitude to novel ingredients it licenses. The system was first introduced in 1958, when the Food Additive Amendments were passed, to require that all non-standard food additives—the kind of things that aren’t typically found in a normal kitchen—should be tested adequately for safety in humans. When the new system was introduced, there were reckoned to be about 700 food additives in use, 400 of which were thought to be safe in the long term. The new system was supposed to guarantee additives that were already in the food supply were safe, but what happened instead was a process of “grandfathering,” where substances that were in use were simply assumed to be safe, for that very reason. That included substances like potassium bromate, which over 50 years’ worth of research has since shown to be linked to cancers such as thyroid and testicular cancer, kidney damage, gut dysbiosis and reproductive issues. The EU, Canada, China and India have now banned it. Even Nigeria has banned it. But not the US. Around 2,000 additives are licensed for use in the EU. In the US, the figure rises to 10,000—and that’s just an estimate. Nobody knows how many additives are in the food supply, not even the FDA, because companies are simply introducing additives without telling anybody. A company can produce a new food additive, decide it’s safe and then bring it to market without any scrutiny from the FDA at all. How did this happen? When companies began applying for GRAS designation, they were allowed to submit their own safety data for their novel ingredients, which the FDA could then choose to accept or reject. But as a huge backlog of applications started to build up at the FDA, companies chose to add novel ingredients to their products without consulting the FDA at all. The FDA could have asserted its authority, but it did what any poorly staffed, totally compromised institution like the FDA would do: It simply made the problem disappear by defining it out of existence. The FDA retrospectively normalised the situation, a process that was finally completed in 2016. And so a company can produce a new food additive, decide it’s safe and bring it to market without any scrutiny from the FDA at all. We are now at the corrupt heart of the American food supply today, at the center of a system that favors corporate producers at the expense of the people it claims to nourish. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is right. If we are ever going to make America healthy again, the corporations that produce its food must be brought into line. They must be made to serve the needs of the American people, and not the other way round.",2,-0.25879192,-0.24839379,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/sleep-hygiene-simple-practices-for-better-rest,Sleep hygiene: Simple practices for better rest,1,"A good night's sleep is essential for good health and functioning. It revitalizes the mind and body, and prepares you to perform at your best the following day. Researchers define a good night's sleep in terms of quantity (not too little or too much) and quality (falling asleep quickly and staying asleep). But many people don't sleep the amount needed to function at their best, or they spend too much time awake during the night. According to the CDC, more than one-third of adults in the U.S. don't get enough sleep — 14.5% have trouble falling asleep and 17.8% have trouble staying asleep. Good sleep hygiene can help. What is sleep hygiene? Sleep hygiene is a set of practices and routines that help you get better sleep. Adequate, good quality sleep allows your body to experience the physical maintenance and repair, immune system boost, and emotional and cognitive renewal that sleep provides. Sleep hygiene encompasses: making your sleeping environment comfortable and conducive to uninterrupted sleep keeping a consistent sleep schedule of seven to nine hours per night for most adults following a bedtime routine that helps you fall asleep establishing daytime habits that optimize restful sleep at night tailoring these practices for your own best results. Expert recommendations have traditionally emphasized going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day, including weekends. Although it is healthier to sleep consistently throughout the week, a 2023 consensus statement by the National Sleep Foundation suggests that after a week with insufficient sleep, it may be beneficial to get some catch-up sleep on weekends. The amount of sleep we need varies by age and can be affected by each individual's unique health circumstances. The CDC offers sleep duration recommendations across the lifespan. Keep in mind that these are suggestions, and every individual may not have the same needs. Tips for sounder sleep Retiring to a comfortable environment with minimal disruptions makes it easier to fall asleep and sleep soundly. What you consume during the day and before bedtime also plays an important role. Create a sleep sanctuary Reduce or mask noise. Heavy curtains and rugs can help absorb sound. A sleep machine that provides white noise, or a recording of soothing sounds such as falling rain, can mask outside noise. Minimize light. Consider light-blocking curtains or shades if outside lights shine into your bedroom. Replace your mattress and pillows if they're worn or uncomfortable. Most people sleep better in a room that's slightly cool. Keep room temperature around 65°F to 68° F at night. Only use the bedroom for sleep and intimacy. Have children and pets sleep elsewhere. Keep electronic devices and anything work-related in another room. Don't let food and substances interfere with a good night's sleep Consume evening meals at least three hours before bedtime. Avoid alcohol in the evenings. Although alcohol can make you sleepy, after a few hours it becomes stimulating and may cause you to awaken and have difficulty falling back to sleep. It can also worsen snoring and reduces REM sleep, an important stage of sleep for cognitive function and mental health. Avoid caffeine after lunch if it keeps you awake at night. Nicotine is a stimulant. Avoid smoking, which can interfere with nighttime sleep (among many other detrimental health effects). Create a relaxing bedtime routine Reserve an hour before bedtime to wind down away from stressful, stimulating activities. Relaxing steps and rituals like these make it easier to fall asleep: Put away electronic devices, except if used for calming music or a guided relaxation routine. Read for pleasure in soft light. Take a warm bath. Do some easy stretches, progressive muscle relaxation, or deep breathing. Overcoming common barriers to good sleep hygiene Your actions during the day can affect your sleep that night. You can adjust your behaviors to support, rather than interfere with, nighttime sleep. Schedule exercise and naps to support sound sleep For many people, exercising within two hours of bedtime interferes with falling asleep. For others, evening exercise is fine. Experiment to find the exercise timing that works best for you. Long or late afternoon naps may interfere with falling asleep at bedtime. Sleep experts recommend naps of half an hour or less, if needed, and not too late in the day. Keep a sleep diary to identify possible obstacles Track the following each day for at least two weeks: time you go to bed and wake up medications you take time and amount of caffeine or alcohol consumption time you eat dinner and anything after that when and how long you exercise what time you put down electronic devices and stop watching TV. In the morning, note length and quality of the previous night's sleep, whether you awakened during the night, and for how long. Look for any patterns between your behaviors and your sleep duration or quality that may help you identify factors that are interfering with your sleep. Work with a partner Making changes to your daily routine can be hard to do on your own. If you live with a partner or roommates, you can help each other adopt and stick to recommendations for healthy sleep.",5,0.1785254,-0.05340366,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-more-probiotics,How to get more probiotics,1,"Our gut does more than digest food — it's a powerhouse for overall health, from boosting immunity to supporting mental well-being. Probiotics, the ""good"" bacteria in our systems, play a key role in maintaining this balance and are essential for keeping your body and mind thriving. There are two ways to get more good bacteria into your gut: fermented foods and dietary supplements. Probiotic supplements, which are typically sold over the counter, are reserved to treat specific ailments as suggested by your doctor. They are not recommended for everyday use. Plus, supplements do not have the same FDA oversight as medications do. Fermented foods, on the other hand, are an excellent natural source of probiotics. Fermenting is one of the oldest techniques for food preservation. Foods that are fermented go through a process of lactofermentation in which natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food, creating lactic acid. This process creates an environment that preserves the food and promotes beneficial enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as various species of good bacteria. Another way to look at fermentation is that it takes one type of food and transforms it into another kind. For instance, cabbage becomes sauerkraut, cucumbers become pickles, soybeans turn into miso, and milk can be made into yogurt, cheeses, and sour cream. Not all fermented foods contain probiotics. Some foods undergo steps that remove the probiotics, as with beer or wine, or make them inactive, like baking and canning. However, most fermented foods are probiotic foods as well. If there is a potential downside to fermented foods, it is that their taste and smell can be quite strong, which may be unpleasant for some people. The unique flavors and textures of fermented foods are due in part to the different species of bacteria used. On the upside, there are many types of fermented foods from which to choose, so there is a good chance you can find something you will enjoy. Good probiotic food choices The most common fermented foods that naturally contain probiotics, or have probiotics added to them, include yogurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, pickles, miso, tempeh, kimchi, sourdough bread, and some cheeses. Yogurt is considered the go-to player of probiotic foods because it has a flavor and texture that are generally appealing to Western palates. The number and type of bacteria species can vary depending on the yogurt brand. The probiotic content of yogurt products can range from 90 billion to 500 billion CFU per serving. (CFU stands for colony-forming units, which is how many bacteria divide and form colonies.) Look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label. It's easy to add yogurt to your diet. Besides having it for breakfast or a midday snack, you can substitute yogurt whenever you use mayonnaise in egg salad or potato salad, or in almost any baking recipe. Yogurt also can be the basis for sauces, salad dressings, or marinades. How many probiotic foods do you need? That's not easy to answer, as there is no recommended daily intake for probiotics, so there is no way to know exactly which fermented foods or what quantity is best. Therefore, the general guideline is to just add as many fermented foods to your daily diet as possible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/gum-disease-and-heart-health-probing-the-link,Gum disease and heart health: Probing the link,1,"About two-thirds of people over 65 have gum disease — more formally known as periodontal disease. It starts when plaque, a sticky film of bacteria and food, builds up around the teeth. In its earliest stage, gingivitis, irritated gums can bleed easily. Left untreated, periodontal disease can worsen and, in its most severe form, cause the teeth to loosen and fall out. Compared with people who have healthy gums, people with periodontal disease are about twice as likely to have a heart attack. Shared risk factors — including smoking, an unhealthy diet, or lack of access to health and dental care — may explain some of this association. However, some bacterial and viral infections also appear to increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. And growing evidence suggests that bacteria and inflammation may underlie the link between the mouth and the heart. ""Your mouth is a gateway to the rest of your body, so it's not surprising that your oral health can affect your overall health and vice versa,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, a prosthodontist in the Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Hundreds of different types of bacteria occur naturally in the mouth. Some, fed by sugars, release acids that break down the outer layer of your teeth, causing cavities. Other types of bacteria form plaque that — if not removed by regular brushing and flossing — hardens into tartar, Dr. Jiang explains. Only a professional dental cleaning can remove these hard, calcified deposits. Signs of gum disease If you experience any of these signs, you may have periodontal disease: swollen, red, or tender gums gums that bleed easily pus between the teeth and gums bad breath buildup of hard yellow or brown deposits along the gum line teeth that are moving apart or loose dental appliances no longer fit well. Bacteria on the move? The bacteria responsible for periodontal disease can travel to blood vessels throughout the body. In fact, periodontal bacteria have been found in the fatty debris (atherosclerosis) that clogs arteries located far from the mouth — and in blood clots from people who have experienced heart attacks. ""In both gum disease and heart disease, we find bacteria in places where they're not supposed to be,"" says Dr. Jiang. The body's immune response to these misplaced bacteria triggers an outpouring of white blood cells. The resulting inflammation may lead to tiny clots and cause a heart attack or stroke. In addition, many factors linked to a higher risk of heart disease—diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity — are all more common in people with periodontal disease, according to a 2021 review article about oral health and cardiovascular disease in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology. One way to treat periodontal disease is for dentists and hygienists to use manual scalers or ultrasound devices to scrape away tartar above and below the gum line. Known as scaling and root planing, this deep cleaning is more extensive than the twice-yearly cleanings people typically get at the dentist. But while treating periodontal disease may help bring down levels of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream, there's limited evidence it can reduce heart attacks or other cardiovascular problems. Preventing periodontal disease To prevent gum disease, daily brushing and flossing is essential — and can even reverse gingivitis before it worsens. If you've slacked off on your flossing, you may notice a little bleeding when you start up again, says Dr. Jiang. When that happens, some people get nervous and stop flossing. But don't worry; just get back into the habit and chances are the bleeding will improve within a few days, she advises. If it doesn't, and you notice other signs of gum disease (see box), schedule an appointment with your dentist. A healthy diet can also help, says Dr. Jiang. Most people know that hard or chewy candy and other sticky sweets promote cavities. But sugary drinks like sodas (especially if you sip them throughout the day) also feed the bacteria that cause cavities and gum disease. ""That's also true for refined carbohydrates that stick to your teeth, like crackers and breads made with white flour,"" says Dr. Jiang. What's more, a sugary diet is itself associated with higher heart disease risk.

A new blanket might help,1,"Weighted blankets have long been used for certain conditions. They may provide benefits for people with insomnia and anxiety, but research is scarce. Image: © Eyecandy Images/Getty Images Some people count sheep at night. You count worries. If you often find yourself lying awake at night, staring at the ceiling, you may be looking for solutions to help you get back to sleep. One approach that doesn't involve drugs or doctors is weighted blankets. These blankets look like regular blankets, but they're filled with plastic beads or pellets to make them heavier. They typically weigh from 3 pounds to upwards of 20 pounds. Companies are marketing them as a solution for insomnia as well as nighttime anxiety and stress reduction. And people are buying. Sales of the blankets have surged in the past two years. The use of weight in therapy The idea of using weight as a calming strategy does have some basis in current medical practice. You may be interested in... A Guide to Cognitive Fitness Harvard Health Publishing’s A Guide to Cognitive Fitness 7 Steps to optimizing brain function and improving brain health LEARN MORE Weighted blankets have been around for a long time, especially for kids with autism or behavioral disturbances. It is one of the sensory tools commonly used in psychiatric units. Patients who are in distress may choose different types of sensory activities — holding a cold object, smelling particular aromas, manipulating dough, building objects, doing arts and crafts — to try to calm down. The blankets are supposed to work much the same way tight swaddling helps newborns feel snug and secure so they can doze off more quickly. The blanket basically simulates a comforting hug, in theory helping to calm and settle the nervous system. Companies that sell the blankets typically recommend that you buy one that weighs approximately 10% of your body weight, which would mean a 15-pound blanket for a 150-pound person. Weighing down anxiety The question is, do they really work? While some people swear by these blankets, concrete evidence is unfortunately lacking. There are really no definitive scientific studies to back up the claims. A randomized clinical trial to test the blankets would be very difficult. A blind comparison is impossible because people can automatically tell if the blanket is heavy or not. And it's unlikely that somebody would sponsor such a study. Should you use a weighted blanket? While there is no robust evidence that weighted blankets are truly effective, for most healthy adults, there are likely few risks to trying one — other than price. Most weighted blankets cost at least $100 and often more than $200. There are certain people who should not use a weighted blanket or should check with their doctors before doing so, including people with sleep apnea certain other sleep disorders respiratory problems or other chronic medical conditions. Also, check in with your doctor or a trained therapist if you are interested in trying a weighted blanket for a child. If you do decide to try a weighted blanket, be realistic about your expectations and realize that results may vary. Blankets may be of help for anxiety or insomnia. But just as swaddling works for some babies and not others, weighted blankets won't be a miracle treatment for everyone. Is there a better option? In addition, keep in mind there may be better, evidence-based solutions out there for your sleep struggles, particularly when it comes to chronic insomnia, which is defined as having trouble falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week for three months or more. For insomnia, a first-line recommendation is a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and relaxation techniques, practices that are supported by evidence from controlled trials. CBT is typically administered in a four- to 10-week program that helps you make lasting changes to your sleep habits, including limiting the amount of time you spend in bed. This helps to train you to avoid being in bed unless you are sleeping. CBT can be challenging and typically works best when performed by a professional.",5,0.21964319,-0.12851422,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/overcome-your-fear-factor,Overcome your fear factor,1,"Fear and worry got you down? Here's how to calm these feelings. Have you grown more worried and fearful about life over the years? You aren't alone. Research has shown that feelings of fear, general anxiety, and nervousness tend to rise with age. These negative feelings can manifest in many ways. You could be more concerned about your financial future, the risk of a new or returning health problem or injury, or as the recent COVID-19 pandemic has shown, changes in world events. People become more fearful about daily life because they worry a setback will come at any time, and it's something they can't control. Tell worry to take a walk Need a mental break from fear or worry? Take a mindful walk during which you focus on your body awareness, movement, breathing, and surroundings. It is a simple way to refresh your mind and be more present. One study found that people who did 30 minutes of mindful walking twice a week for four weeks had less stress and better quality of life. A cumulative effect It's not clear what drives this mindset. Researchers speculate it could be a combination of biological changes in the aging brain along with the cumulative effects of unhappy life experiences, either your own or those of someone close to you. These ongoing feelings of fear and worry can have a deep impact on your health. You may become less active and less social, both of which can contribute to frailty, heart disease, and depression. If not addressed, constant fear and worry may progress to a specific disorder, such as social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia (fear of public places), or generalized anxiety disorder (chronic worrying that may lead to physical problems like chest pain and muscle fatigue). What to do There are many ways to address constant fear and worry so they do not consume your life. The first step is to identify your fear's source. The right treatment begins with recognition. Often, people cannot articulate why they are fearful or worry too much, and why it's happening. Consider meeting with a psychiatrist or therapist. A professional analysis can help pinpoint where your specific worries and fears may lie. After that, the two of you work together to create strategies that address those fears. These could include one-on-one or group therapy sessions, relaxation training exercises, or cognitive behavioral therapy (in which you learn to reframe your response to your fearful thoughts). Once you are aware of your specific fears and when they typically arise, you can take other means to manage them. For example: Practice mindfulness. Mindfulness trains your mind's attention to be more present without drifting into concerns about the past or future. This mindset helps you not to overreact to fearful thoughts and reduce any stress, depression, or anxiety that accompanies them. Meditation is a popular way to learn mindfulness. The goal of meditation is not to push aside or block fearful thinking, but rather to notice your thoughts and feelings and realize that you don't have to act on them. This could be as simple as closing your eyes and repeating a single phrase or word, or counting breaths. Consult a financial expert. If money issues worry you, meet with a financial planner or adviser. He or she can do a thorough review of your financials, create or adjust your budget, focus on specific concerns, and help set goals. This can help you feel more confident about your situation and address any issues that may trigger worry. Hire a personal trainer. If you avoid activity or exercise because you fear injury, hire a personal trainer who specializes in older adult conditioning. A trainer can assess your current fitness, identify strengths and weaknesses, and develop a program to help you improve. Because you will see and feel your physical improvements as you progress, this will help you overcome fear of injury and the worry that you can't exercise or be more active. You can realize that you are more than capable of being active than you think. Look for trainers with specialized certification from organizations like the American Council on Exercise or the National Academy of Sports Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/got-a-hangnail-heres-what-to-do,Got a hangnail? Here's what to do,1,"Hangnails are small, but they can be surprisingly annoying and even painful. They often appear when the skin around your nails becomes dry, cracked, or damaged. While most hangnails are harmless and can be treated at home, they can sometimes lead to infections if not properly cared for. What is a hangnail? A hangnail is a small, torn piece of skin that appears at the edge of a fingernail. Despite its name, a hangnail isn't part of the nail itself but instead a sliver of skin that can peel away from the nail's edge. Hangnails are common and can be painful, especially if they snag on something or get infected. Why do hangnails happen? Hangnails often form when the skin around your nails becomes dry and damaged. Common causes include cold weather, frequent hand washing, or exposure to harsh chemicals. People who bite their nails or pick at their skin may also be more likely to get hangnails. Hangnails can also happen if you have brittle nails or if your hands are in water a lot, as they might be when washing dishes. Treating hangnails at home Hangnails can often be managed simply at home. Here's how: Soak your fingers. Start by soaking your fingers in warm, soapy water for about 10 minutes to soften the skin. Trim carefully. Using sanitized nail clippers or small scissors, gently trim the hangnail close to the skin. You might be tempted to pull out the raised piece of skin, but that's something you should avoid. Tearing the skin can cause further damage at the base and increase your risk of developing an infection in the cuticle. Apply moisturizer. Use a fragrance-free moisturizing cream or a bit of petroleum jelly to keep the skin around your nails moisturized. Another option is to use a small amount of over-the-counter antibacterial ointment such as bacitracin. Bandage if needed. If the area is sore or bleeding, cover with a bandage to protect it from infection until it heals. How to prevent hangnails The best way to prevent hangnails is to keep the skin around your nails healthy and hydrated. These skin and nail care tips can help: Maintain clean, dry, and hydrated skin. Wash your hands and feet with gentle cleansers, ensuring they are thoroughly dried afterward. Use moisturizers daily and reapply them after each time you wash your hands. Use a fragrance-free hand cream or cuticle oil to keep your skin soft. Don't bite your nails. Biting your nails or picking at the skin around them can lead to tears and infection. Instead, trim your nails carefully with a clean tool and avoid cutting your cuticles. Protect your hands by wearing gloves. For activities like dishwashing, layer cotton gloves beneath waterproof gloves, such as vinyl ones. Use protective gloves while cleaning, gardening, or spending time outdoors in cold weather. Prioritize nail care. Trim your nails straight across using sharp nail clippers or scissors. Use an emery board to slightly round the tips and smooth out any rough edges or snags. Avoid using your nails as tools — for example, don't use a nail to pry open a soda can. When to see a doctor for a hangnail Most hangnails heal on their own with home care. However, when the protective barrier of skin around the nail is damaged, it can let in bacteria that can cause an infection. This is known as acute paronychia. Signs of infection include: Redness: The skin around the nail becomes red and inflamed. Swelling: The affected area may appear puffy or swollen. Pain or tenderness: The area around the nail may feel sore or painful, especially when touched. Warmth: The infected skin may feel warm to the touch. Pus: A pocket of yellow or white fluid (pus) may form near the nail if the infection progresses. If you notice these symptoms, it's a good idea to seek medical attention, especially if the infection doesn't improve or worsens. Infected hangnails can be painful. And left untreated, the infection can spread to other parts of your finger.",0,0.15902273,-0.17947102,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/brain-health-rests-on-heart-health-guidelines-for-lifestyle-changes-202206291895,Brain health rests on heart health: Guidelines for lifestyle changes,1,"Dementia affects millions of people and millions more of their caregivers — staggering numbers that are projected to triple by 2050. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a strategic public health action plan, including compiling an organized database of quality dementia research and creating guidelines for the prevention of dementia. Dementia is a progressive, heartbreaking deterioration of brain functioning associated with aging. While there are different causes, the most common — Alzheimer's and vascular dementias — are now thought to be closely related to, and greatly impacted by, the same diet and lifestyle factors. Your diet and lifestyle can lower your risk of dementia Several key protective health habits are highly recommended: Regular physical activity — any activity, for at least 150 minutes per week, is number one on the list of evidence-based actions you can take. Exercise clearly lowers the risk of dementia, even Alzheimer's. People who regularly exercise are less likely to develop dementia of any kind, and this stands even for adults with mild cognitive impairment. Eating a plant-based diet is crucial. There is substantial research evidence showing that eating a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and seafood is associated with a significantly lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia. This approach to eating is often referred to as the Mediterranean-style diet, but it can be adapted to any culture or cuisine. The WHO also recommends avoiding toxic, inflammatory foods like processed grains (white flour, white rice), added sugar, sodium, and saturated fats like butter and fatty meat. It's important to note that the WHO does not recommend taking any vitamins or supplements for brain health, because there is no solid evidence showing that these have any effect whatsoever. Just eat a healthy plant-based diet and avoid unhealthy foods as much as possible. The WHO also issues strong recommendations to avoid or quit smoking and to minimize alcohol use, especially in those who already have cognitive concerns. They mention additional lifestyle factors that have less evidence but may also help: getting enough good sleep, positive relationships, and social engagement have been shown to protect cognition. What's fascinating about these dementia prevention guidelines is how similar they are to those for heart disease prevention. How is heart health related to cognitive health? We have long known that the diseases and conditions that clog the arteries of the heart also clog the arteries of the rest of the body, including the brain. It all boils down to damage of the arteries, the blood vessels that are critical for blood flow and oxygen delivery to the organs. Arterial damage leads to arterial blockages, which lead to heart disease and heart attacks, strokes, peripheral vascular disease, and vascular dementia. Meanwhile, Alzheimer's disease used to be thought of as a different process, because the brains of people with Alzheimer's seemed to be full of tangled tube-shaped proteins (neurofibrillary tangles). However, more and more research is linking Alzheimer's dementia to the same risk factors that cause heart disease, strokes, peripheral vascular disease, and vascular dementias: obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. The evidence is substantial: studies show that people with these risk factors are significantly more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, studies also show that people with Alzheimer's disease have significantly reduced brain blood flow, and autopsy studies show that brains affected by Alzheimer's can also have significant vascular damage. Researchers are now focusing on why this is — what is the connection? It appears that good brain blood flow is key for clearing those tubular proteins that can accumulate and become tangled in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, and so one solid hypothesis is that anything that reduces brain blood flow can increase the risk for Alzheimer's, and conversely, anything that increases blood flow can reduce the risk for Alzheimer's. What's the take-home message? Even if someone has a family history of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's dementia, and even if they already have mild cognitive impairment (forgetfulness, confusion), they can still reduce their risk of developing dementia by simply living a heart-healthy lifestyle. That means a minimum of 150 minutes per week of activity; a plant-based diet aiming for at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily; avoiding toxic foods like processed grains, added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats; avoiding or quitting smoking; and curbing alcohol use.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ease-anxiety-and-stress-take-a-belly-breather-201904261861,Ease anxiety and stress: Take a (belly) breather,1,"Quick: think of three things that make you feel anxious or stressed. Most of us have no trouble reeling off answers. And people who suffer from anxiety disorders — such as social anxiety, phobias, or generalized anxiety — may have a variety of triggers that send anxiety soaring. While belly breathing alone can't fix deep-seated anxieties, it works well as a tool to help ease anxiety and garden-variety stress. Regularly engaging in belly breathing (or trying the mini strategy described below) can help you turn a fight-or-flight response into a relaxation response that's beneficial to your health. How should you breathe? You take up to 23,000 breaths per day, so make sure you do it right. How should you breathe? Like a sleeping child, says Dr. Katherine Rosa of the Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. ""If you ever watch children sleep, they all breathe from the belly and not the chest. This relaxed state is the more normal way to breathe."" Yet most people are chest breathers, which is how we react to stress. When we sense a threat, our fight-or-flight response automatically kicks in. We breathe at a rapid pace to suck in extra oxygen, to fuel our heart and muscles so we can flee the danger. Of course, we don't need our fight-or-flight response to escape predators anymore. Our threats now come from the stress of emails, personal confrontations, daily news, and traffic jams. ""Your fight-or-flight response is meant to be a short-term reaction that comes and goes,"" says Dr. Rosa. ""But today, we are surrounded by so many stressors that we constantly stay in this state of tension. It doesn't turn off, and we often don't even notice it."" The result: we have become a nation of chest breathers. Feel it in your belly One way to change our reaction to modern stress is to learn how to belly breathe instead of chest breathe. Belly breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, which runs from the head down the neck, through the chest, and to the colon. This activates your relaxation response, reducing your heart rate and blood pressure and lowering stress levels. If you are not familiar with belly breathing, try this exercise: sit in a chair, lean forward, and place your elbows on your knees. Then breathe naturally. ""This position forces you to breathe from the belly, so you know what the sensation feels like,"" says Dr. Rosa. A mini strategy to ease anxiety and stress A strategy to teach yourself mindful belly breathing is to practice what Dr. Rosa calls ""the mini."" Here's what you do: every time you feel stressed, simply take three slow and controlled deep belly breaths. ""It's a simple act, but this interrupts the fight-or-flight response and puts it on pause,"" says Dr. Rosa. ""Over time, belly breathing can buffer your resistance to your fight-or-flight response, so you are not as sensitive to stress triggers."" To help you be more mindful about your breathing pattern, place one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. ""You want the chest hand to be still and the belly hand to move out like you are blowing up a balloon,"" says Dr. Rosa. She suggests practicing belly breathing throughout the day, like once every hour or up to 10 to 15 times per day. ""As it becomes more of a habit, you can automatically engage belly breathing whenever you face a stressful event.""",5,0.24088924,-0.14719522,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-20-harris-issues-vaccine-mandates-campaign-workers-president.html,Kamala Harris issues vaccine mandate for campaign workers – can Americans expect government-enforced jab mandates if she becomes president?,0,"Kamala Harris is requiring that everyone who works on her presidential campaign receive the COVID-19 vaccine – even though the pandemic peaked long ago and the vaccines have since been proven to be ineffective in preventing spread and potentially quite dangerous – demonstrating yet again that this is much more of a political issue for liberals than something done out of a genuine concern for public health. On the official Harris-Walz presidential campaign website, a list of job opportunities appears on a page entitled “Work for Us.” The page lists several job opportunities and their requirements, with a disclosure at the bottom informing potential candidates of the vaccine mandate . They stop short, however, of explaining why the mandate exists. While many COVID-era vaccine mandate policies claimed they were enacted for the “safety” of employees or clients, it’s getting a lot harder to convince the public there is any benefit in such mandates these days. They write: “Harris for President requires all employees to be ""up to date"" on COVID-19 vaccination status as prescribed by the CDC as a condition of employment, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law,” they write. “If you seek a reasonable accommodation in relation to the campaign's COVID-19 policy, you should speak to the HR Department prior to reporting to an office location,” the listing adds. Just what does the CDC “prescribe” these days? A message on their website says that they recommend the “2023-2024 updated COVID-19 vaccines” from makers such as Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Novavax. Meanwhile, they define “up to date” as getting “1 age-appropriate updated COVID-19 vaccine” for those aged 5 to 64; for those 65 and older, “2 updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine doses” are required. It’s a laughable requirement for a number of reasons, not least of which is the fact that Harris tested positive for COVID-19 in 2022 after receiving the jabs and boosters publicly. There’s also the fact that Harris likes to insist on platforms like X that women should be trusted to “make decisions about their own body, health care, and future” – except, apparently, when it comes to decisions about putting poison into their bodies if they want to be employed. Last year, the Biden administration ended COVID-19 vaccine requirements for all federal employees and contractors, as well as international air travelers, and put an official end to the COVID-19 public health emergency, so why is Harris insisting on her employees getting jabbed? An unhealthy workforce It’s easy to joke that only someone with a questionable mental state would be willing to work for Kamala – even those who somehow can get past her politics would surely be turned off by the numerous reports over the years of her being a nightmare boss – but the truth is that many of her job candidates could well be experiencing mental and physical ailments as a result of the vaccine. The biggest global study so far examining medical issues in nearly 100,000 individuals who got COVID-19 vaccines revealed a higher-than-expected rise in both neurological and cardiac problems after getting jabbed. Meanwhile, nearly 13,000 claims have been filed with the U.S. vaccine compensation program related to the pandemic response; more than 10,000 of the claims cite the COVID-19 jabs as causing either injury or death. If Kamala Harris is requiring all those who work on her campaign to get the jab, it isn't much of a stretch to assume that she is likely to also implement vaccine mandates for the American public if she wins the election.",6,-0.41168827,0.13539399,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-19-cdc-report-vaccines-saved-millions-lives-laughable.html,CDC releases report claiming vaccines have saved 1.1 million lives; experts call it “laughable”,0,"The many dozens of ""safe and effective"" vaccines that children in the United States typically receive after birth have saved hundreds of millions of them from illness and death, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a new report that experts are calling ""laughable."" The CDC's latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) claims that routine childhood vaccinations for things like measles, diphtheria, tetanus, and hepatitis B have prevented more than half a billion cases of illness, 32 million hospitalizations, and precisely 1,129,000 deaths over the past roughly 30 years. The federal public health agency is also claiming responsibility for allegedly saving U.S. taxpayers $540 billion in direct costs, as well as $2.7 trillion in indirect social costs, with its longtime childhood vaccination program. The corporate media is parroting the CDC's claims as a ""testament to the success"" of childhood vaccination in America. Experts like Toby Rogers, PhD, a fellow at the Brownstone Institute for Social and Economic Research, however, say otherwise. ""The methods are shoddy, the data are untethered from reality and the conclusions are a preposterous fiction,"" Roberts told The Defender , a project of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Children's Health Defense (CHD). ""This study is an advertisement on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry and it should be treated as such."" (Related: Remember when the CDC admitted that COVID injections maybe only help prevent one death for every one million people who get jabbed?) CDC paper is bogus propaganda The paper was constructed by Fangjun Zhou, PhD, and other researchers from the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease. They looked at data on approximately 117 million children born between 1994 and 2023, reproducing the methodology from a 2014 paper that Zhou and colleagues published on estimated health and economic benefits of vaccination for a single year, 2009. One of the new study's major problems is the fact that it included data for all vaccinated children rather than just participants in the CDC's Vaccines for Children Program, which provides ""free"" vaccines to about half of all American children. They conducted a very simplistic and scientifically shoddy series of calculations that intended to show that getting jabbed is much better for children and society than not getting jabbed. ""If there are two more conflicted journals to represent the benefits of the childhood vaccination program, you could not find them,"" commented Mark Blaxill, co-author of ""The Age of Autism: Mercury, Medicine, and a Man-Made Epidemic,"" about the bogus nature of the paper. ""The profession of pediatrics is the delivery channel for the childhood immunization program, that's why it exists. And the MMWR is put out by the CDC, which is recommending the program. So this is propaganda, and it is put out by those parties most interested in defending the outcome."" Interestingly, the CDC analysis did not include flu shots, Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) injections, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, and RSV monoclonal antibodies, all of which were more recently added to the CDC's childhood injection schedule. ""The mortality rates they used of 15-20% were reported prior to the development of the vaccine in the 1920s,"" said Brian Hooker, PhD, chief scientific officer at CHD, about how the CDC study skewed the mortality rates for diphtheria. ""However, this was prior to the development of antibiotics. Corynebacterium diphtheriae (the bacteria that causes diphtheria) is treatable with penicillin or erythromycin."" Rogers added that none of the vaccines available through the CDC's Vaccines for Children Program are as effective as the CDC claims, which means the data is even more skewed. ""We know that the mumps portion of MMR does not work,"" Rogers said. ""The pertussis portion of DTaP does not stop infection nor transmission of pertussis. That's true for lots of vaccines on the schedule."" The CDC cannot be trusted to ever tell the truth. Learn more at CDC.news .",6,-0.44534388,0.20704581,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-19-going-vegan-8-weeks-reverse-biological-age.html,New study suggests going vegan for 8 weeks can help turn back your biological clock,0,"A recent study suggests that following a vegan diet for just eight weeks may help lower an individual's biological age . This is being touted as a way to help lower risks for conditions like dementia and diabetes . The study, featured in BMC Medicine , found that the reduction in biological age was connected to changes in DNA methylation – a process that can influence gene activity without changing the genetic code. The study was a randomized controlled trial involving 21 pairs of adult identical twins. In each pair, one twin maintained an omnivorous diet – eating both animal- and plant-based foods, along with an egg and one and a half servings of dairy. The other twin adhered to a vegan diet based on plants, such as fruits, grains, nuts and vegetables Findings showed that those on a vegan diet had a reduction in their epigenetic aging markers, while those on the omnivorous diet did not. Additionally, the vegan group experienced a decrease in the biological ages of their heart, hormone, liver and inflammatory and metabolic systems. They also lost an average of two kilograms (4.4 pounds) more than the twins on the omnivorous diet, likely due to differences in calorie intake. The researchers emphasized the importance of further investigation to understand the complex interactions between aging, diet and weight management. Veganism, which involves eliminating meat and dairy from one's diet, has become increasingly popular. Since 2008, the number of people identifying themselves as ""vegan"" in the United Kingdom has surged by 350 percent . The reasons for this shift are diverse – ranging from concerns about animal rights and environmental issues to personal and religious motivations. A significant number of individuals adopt a vegan diet in pursuit of better health. Evidence indicates that, when properly planned, a vegan diet can offer various health advantages. For those transitioning from a diet high in animal products, switching to a plant-based diet can bring about notable changes in the body. Initial changes during the first few weeks of a vegan diet One of the most noticeable effects of going vegan is a notable boost in energy levels. This improvement comes from eliminating processed meats, which are common in omnivorous diets, and replacing them with nutrient-rich fruits , nuts and vegetables. These plant-based foods enhance the intake of vitamins, minerals and dietary fibers. Continuing the vegan diet over the next few weeks will see people experience changes to their bowel movements due to the increase in consumption of foods high in fiber associated with the vegan diet Registered dietitian Jennifer Mimkha notes that many individuals are pleasantly surprised by how easily they lose weight after switching to a plant-based diet. Along with the improvement in the consumption of dietary fibers, the weight loss is also attributed to the lower calorie content of many plant-based proteins compared to meat. However, the vegan diet's impact on weight still largely depends on its quality. Consuming "" vegan junk food "" or excessive simple carbohydrates can lead to weight gain, whereas a balanced and nutritious plant-based diet – particularly if replacing a diet high in saturated fats and processed foods – is more likely to support reasonable weight loss. (Related: Researchers link ultra-processed VEGAN food products to heart disease risk and early death .) Changes after three to six months on a vegan diet After three to six months on a vegan diet, individuals may notice that the increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, combined with a reduction in processed foods, can lead to skin improvements and the near-disappearance of skin conditions like acne. By this time, individuals might see a decrease in vitamin D levels , since this essential nutrient is predominantly found in animal products like dairy, fish and meat. To prevent deficiencies, it is important to consume fortified foods or take supplements, upon the advice of physicians or other licensed health practitioners, especially during the winter months when sunlight is less available. A well-planned vegan diet that is low in sodium and processed foods in a few months might show significant benefits for heart health, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and strokes. It must be noted that a vegan diet typically lowers an individual's intake of nutrients , such as calcium, iron and zinc. While the body can become more efficient at absorbing these nutrients from plant sources, adjustments to diets may also help prevent deficiencies for some individuals, although supplements may be needed to meet the nutritional needs of others. Long-term effects of a vegan diet As people reach the six-month to one-year marks on vegan diets, people who have stayed true to these nutrition plans may start to experience a decrease in vitamin B12 levels. This vitamin is crucial for maintaining healthy blood and nerve cells and is primarily found in animal products. A lack of vitamin B12 can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, memory issues and tingling sensations in the extremities. To prevent B12 deficiency, incorporating fortified foods or supplements into your diet is essential. Without adequate B12, the benefits of a vegan diet, particularly in terms of reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke, can be compromised. Long-term B12 deficiency can also result in serious, irreversible nerve and brain damage. As time progresses, typically over a few years, vegans might observe changes in their bone health. Up until around age 30, the body effectively absorbs and deposits minerals into the bones. After this age, bones start to deplete their stored minerals to maintain calcium levels in the blood. Therefore, it's important to ensure sufficient calcium intake during younger years to support bone health. While vegetables such as kale and broccoli provide calcium, many vegans fall short of their calcium needs, leading to a higher fracture risk compared to omnivores and vegetarians. Plant-based calcium is also less readily absorbed by the body, so supplementation or consuming fortified foods may be necessary to meet nutrition requirements. In the long run, maintaining a balanced vegan diet could help individuals maximize the health benefits associated with it. Although many of the benefits of a vegan diet are well-documented , nutrient deficiencies can undermine these benefits if not managed properly. Fortunately, the growing availability of clean and nutritious vegan food products makes it easier to maintain a nutritious and varied diet. With thoughtful planning, a vegan diet can be a healthful choice. Watch the following video discussing what happens to the body when people go vegan .

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sleep-apnea-and-heart-disease-a-weighty-matter,Sleep apnea and heart disease: A weighty matter,1,"In addition to helping control diabetes and obesity, the popular drugs known as GLP-1 agonists may also alleviate another disorder that's closely linked to cardiovascular problems: obstructive sleep apnea. This common condition — which is marked by brief pauses in breathing, often accompanied by loud snoring — doesn't just leave people groggy and sleepy during the day. Left untreated, this serious disorder raises the odds of high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. Excess weight is the strongest risk factor linked with sleep apnea, which affects about 25% of men and 10% of women in the United States. More than half of people with the condition are overweight or obese, and the risk rises as body size increases, according to Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Extra fat tissue in the neck and throat can narrow the airway, and extra weight on the chest and belly puts pressure on the lungs, which makes the normal process of inhaling and exhaling less effective,"" she explains. What happens during sleep apnea? The 10- to 30-second breathing pauses that characterize sleep apnea occur when the airway in your nose or throat becomes partially or completely blocked by large tonsils, a large tongue, or too much tissue in the airway. Image: © Blueastro/Getty Images Treating sleep apnea In sleep apnea, the breathing pauses happen when the airway briefly closes (see ""What happens during sleep apnea?""). The first-line treatment is positive airway pressure (PAP), which uses a small bedside machine to push a forceful stream of air to a mask covering the nose or the nose and mouth to keep the airway open. A recent study found that one of the GLP-1 drugs, tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for obesity) can slash the number of breathing interruptions during sleep — a key measure of sleep apnea severity. Published June 21, 2024, in The New England Journal of Medicine, the yearlong study included 469 people with obesity and moderate-to-severe sleep apnea, some of whom used PAP machines when sleeping. Compared with people who got a placebo injection, those treated with tirzepatide had a nearly 59% drop in their apnea-hypopnea index, a measure that describes the number of times a person's breathing slows or stops during an hour of sleep. Those taking tirzepatide lost close to 20% of their body weight. Ditch your PAP machine? ""At least once a week, I see people in my clinic who have lost so much weight on one of the obesity drugs that they don't need to use their PAP machine any longer,"" says Dr. Javaheri. (The other GLP-1 obesity drug, semaglutide, is sold as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss). ""Several patients lost between 50 and 60 pounds, which was enough to completely cure their sleep apnea."" While tirzepatide is not approved for treating sleep apnea, it's currently under consideration by the FDA for that use. However, even if you qualify for a prescription for either semaglutide or tirzepatide based on your medical conditions, these medications can be challenging to obtain due high demand, limited supplies, cost, and other factors. That said, the growing list of health benefits from GLP-1 agonists (see ""Anti-obesity drug lowers heart-related problems"" in the February 2024 Heart Letter) may make them both more accessible and affordable in the future. If and when tirzepatide is approved for treating sleep apnea, sleep medicine clinics will likely provide the medication, says Dr. Javaheri. Weight loss has long been recommended for sleep apnea sufferers who are overweight or obese. After people lose at least 10% of their initial weight (that is, their weight at diagnosis), insurance companies usually pay for another sleep study to see if they've improved enough to stop using PAP, which people often find cumbersome and inconvenient. ""But I advise people using anti-obesity drugs to wait until they reach their goal weight before getting retested,"" says Dr. Javaheri. Other contributors to sleep apnea Finally, it's worth noting that obesity is just one of the factors that predispose people to sleep apnea, which also occurs in people who aren't overweight. ""Some people are born with anatomical differences that leave them prone to sleep apnea, such as a narrow airway, a thicker neck, a large tongue, enlarged tonsils, or a small, receding chin,"" says Dr. Javaheri. ""Smoking also increases the risk of sleep apnea significantly, and alcohol can cause sleep apnea or make it worse,"" she adds. Image: © vitapix/Getty Images",5,0.341172,0.11044599,True

If you often find yourself tense and on-edge, try these seven ways to reduce stress. Get enough sleep. Inadequate or poor-quality sleep can negatively affect your mood, mental alertness, energy level, and physical health. Learn relaxation techniques. Meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, deep breathing exercises, and yoga are powerful relaxation techniques and stress-busters. Strengthen your social network. Connect with others by taking a class, joining an organization, or participating in a support group. Hone your time-management skills. The more efficiently you can juggle work and family demands, the lower your stress level. Try to resolve stressful situations if you can. Don't let stressful situations fester. Hold family problem-solving sessions and use negotiation skills at home and at work. Nurture yourself. Treat yourself to a massage. Truly savor an experience: for example, eat slowly and really focus on the taste and sensations of each bite. Take a walk or a nap, or listen to your favorite music. Ask for help. Don't be afraid to ask for help from your spouse, friends, and neighbors. If stress and anxiety persist, talk to your doctor. Along with these ways to reduce stress, add in a healthy lifestyle — maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, regular exercise, and a diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthful fats — and high blood pressure could be a thing of the past.

Gastric belching is the everyday kind that most people experience. Every time you swallow, you take in a little air, and some of it travels down the esophagus and into the upper part of the stomach. When the stomach begins to stretch out from this air, sensors in its wall send signals to your esophagus. These signals tell the sphincter (the small ring of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus) to open, allowing air that has built up in the stomach to escape up and out as a belch. A gastric belch often smells. ""The air might have the odor of whatever you recently ate,"" says Dr. Staller. By contrast, with supragastric belching, swallowed air stays in the esophagus and never makes it to the stomach. The air gets quickly expelled in fast and frequent odorless belches. People can swallow too much air for various reasons. For example: Eating too fast. ""When you eat quickly, you gulp more air, which is why people often feel the urge to belch after eating,"" says Dr. Staller. The solution is to eat slower so you swallow less air. Try this: At the beginning of your meal, set a timer for 20 minutes. Then pace yourself to make your meal last until the timer goes off. Chew each mouthful 30 times, and put your fork down between bites. Carbonated beverages. Drinks like beer, soda, and seltzer can bring extra air into the esophagus and stomach. Gulping these drinks or using a straw can also increase air intake. Cutting down on carbonated beverages, drinking slower, and not using a straw can help. Gum and hard candy. Chewing gum and sucking on hard candies also can lead to inadvertent air swallowing. What if you can't belch? If you can't belch, you may have a condition called retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction (R-CPD), also known as ""no burp syndrome."" ""We still have a lot to learn about R-CPD, as there are limited data on the efficacy of treatment or how to make a true diagnosis,"" says gastroenterologist Dr. Kyle Staller at Massachusetts General Hospital. R-CPD is believed to occur when the cricopharyngeus muscle, a sphincter muscle that sits at the top of the esophagus, cannot relax and, as a result, does not open to allow air to exit the esophagus. As a result, air accumulates in the stomach, esophagus, and intestines, causing bloating and pressure in the abdomen, chest, and lower neck, and gurgling sounds from the chest and neck. Because the air cannot leave through the esophagus, it instead exits the body as flatulence, which is often excessive. Treatment options for R-CPD include a botulinum toxin injection into the cricopharyngeus muscle or surgery to cut partway through it. Both of these approaches allow the muscle to relax and air to exit the esophagus. Sound of trouble Belching is usually nothing to worry about, says Dr. Staller, but he suggests seeing your doctor if it becomes more frequent and causes distress and discomfort. Excessive belching is a common symptom for digestive disorders like functional dyspepsia (recurring symptoms of an upset stomach with no obvious cause) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). ""Belching could be a red flag if it accompanies other symptoms like sudden weight loss, difficulty swallowing, or blood in the stool,"" says Dr. Staller. Problematic belching also could be related to stress or anxiety, and treating these issues with psychotherapy and diaphragmatic breathing techniques often helps. When you do feel a belch coming, don't try to squelch it. ""There is little you can do to stop it,"" says Dr. Staller. ""You can be discreet by muffling a belch or holding it in for a few seconds until you're in a more private setting, but eventually, your body will win."" So, when you must belch, let it out and just say, ""Excuse me."" Image: © CSA-Archive/Getty Images",1,0.223385,-0.16233714,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/clearing-up-a-foggy-memory,Clearing up a foggy memory,1,"At some point, most older adults experience ""senior moments."" You misplace your phone or keys, lose your train of thought during a conversation, forget directions or a name minutes after being told, or walk into a room and don't know why. These moments of brain fogginess can be stressful and embarrassing, but are they ever cause for concern? ""The brain is like any other part of the body, and over time, it may not function as well as it used to,"" says neuropsychologist Julie Brody Magid, clinical director of the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital Memory Disorders Assessment Clinic. ""While most memory glitches are part of normal aging, in some cases they are exacerbated by problems that people can manage."" Aging and the brain People often notice memory lapses beginning in their 50s or 60s. This is when age-related chemical and structural changes begin in brain regions devoted to memory, such as the hippocampus and frontal lobes. These brain regions begin to shrink, often related to narrowing of the small arteries that deliver oxygen and nutrients. ""These changes can make learning and recalling new and existing information slightly more challenging,"" says Brody Magid. Yet age is not always to blame. Your doctor can help you sort out whether there are other problems contributing to your memory lapses. Here are some of the possibilities: Depression, anxiety, and stress. Depression can disrupt the brain's ability to focus, process, and access information, according to Brody Magid. Chronic stress and anxiety can flood the brain with the stress hormone cortisol, which, over time, can affect the brain regions responsible for storing and recalling information. ""Depression, stress, and anxiety can also cause negative and preoccupying thoughts that keep people from focusing and being present, which may contribute to memory issues,"" says Brody Magid. Medication. Brain fogginess can be a common side effect of some medications. ""If you are taking a new drug, either prescription or over the counter, ask your doctor or pharmacist if it could be affecting your cognition,"" says Brody Magid. Sleep. Research has linked a decline in brain functions with sleep problems, such as sleeping less than the recommended seven to eight hours nightly, fragmented sleep, and sleep disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea. Mind tricks Even though most memory lapses are normal, you can take measures to manage and improve your existing brain skills. Here are some memory obstacles people encounter and ways to deal with them. Absentmindedness. This happens when you take on too many tasks or get distracted. When faced with multiple tasks, make a list, put them in order of importance, and focus on only one at a time before moving on to the next. Setting up routines and reminders can also help. For example, create a memory table by your front door or in the bedroom where you place vital objects, like your phone, medicines, keys, and glasses. Blocking. A common example of blocking is remembering and recalling names. When you meet someone, try linking that person with something that may help trigger name recall, like their hobby, work, background, or spouse. Another method is to associate the person with someone with the same name or a similar one, like a relative, celebrity, or movie character. Transience. Transience is the loss over time of certain memories like facts and events. To help retain specific memories, keep the information active in your memory; for instance, share it in conversation whenever possible, record it for future reference, and review related photographs. When to get checked If memory lapses become more frequent or substantial enough to interfere with your daily life or safety, you should get checked out, says Brody Magid. When speaking with your doctor, provide as much detailed information as possible surrounding your memory glitches. For instance, were you distracted because you were upset about something or were juggling too much at once? Does your memory recover in the moment, or does it take time for your brain to ""kick in""? Is there a pattern to your memory lapses? ""All of this background information can help your doctor determine if lifestyle factors or medical issues might be at play and need to be addressed, or if you need a formal examination at a memory clinic,"" says Brody Magid.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-can-cause-blood-in-stool,What can cause blood in stool?,1,"Discovering blood in your stool can be alarming, but it doesn't always signal a serious medical condition. Regardless of the cause, it's crucial to seek medical advice if you notice blood in your stool, as early detection and treatment can lead to better outcomes if it is caused by something serious. What does blood in stool look like? The appearance of blood in stool can vary, and the color of the blood often gives clues about the source of bleeding. Bright red blood usually suggests bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract, such as the rectum or anus, and may be visible on toilet paper, in the toilet bowl, or on the surface of the stool. Small amounts of blood in the toilet bowl or on toilet paper are often linked to conditions like hemorrhoids or anal fissures. However, certain foods such as beets, tomatoes, or foods with red food coloring can also cause stools to appear reddish. If you notice larger amounts of bright red blood, you should immediately let your healthcare provider know. Dark or tarry stools may indicate bleeding from a higher part of the digestive tract such as the stomach or small intestine. As the blood moves through the gastrointestinal system, it may be partially digested, resulting in a black, sticky appearance. However, certain foods, including blood sausage, blueberries, and black licorice, can also lead to dark stools. So can iron supplements, bismuth subsalicylate (found in Pepto-Bismol), and activated charcoal. What can cause blood in stool? There are many potential causes of rectal bleeding or blood in stool, ranging from minor issues like foods recently eaten, hemorrhoids, or anal fissures to more significant concerns such as gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, or inflammatory bowel diseases. Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels that can develop either externally (around the anus) or internally (in the lower rectum). They are the most common cause of rectal bleeding in middle-aged and older adults. Factors such as chronic constipation, straining during bowel movements, pregnancy, and prolonged sitting on the toilet can cause hemorrhoids. Symptoms of hemorrhoids can include rectal pain, itching, bleeding, and, in some cases, prolapse, where the hemorrhoids protrude through the anal canal. Anal fissures Anal fissures are small tears in the skin of the anal canal, often caused by constipation and straining to pass hard stools. Fissures can also occur due to diarrhea, vaginal childbirth, or infections. Common symptoms of anal fissures include sharp pain during bowel movements, itching around the anus, muscle spasms in the anal area, a lump or skin tag near the anus, and bright red blood in the stool, which may be seen on toilet paper after a bowel movement. Diverticulosis Diverticulosis occurs when weak spots in the inner wall of the colon cause small pouches to form. Over time, the blood vessels within these pouches can become fragile and prone to rupture, leading to bleeding. While diverticulosis is quite common, many people are unaware that they have it. Colon polyps Colon polyps are growths that occur in the large intestine (also called the colon). They are quite common — between 15% and 40% of adults may have polyps. Most polyps are benign, but some have the potential to develop into cancer over time. Removing polyps is an important step in preventing colorectal cancer. Most people with colon polyps don't experience symptoms. However, you should see your doctor immediately for advice if you develop rectal bleeding, as it may be a sign of polyps. Gastrointestinal infections Certain gastrointestinal infections can cause inflammation and irritation anywhere in the digestive tract. Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial overgrowth in the stomach that can lead to bleeding ulcers and black stools. Other bacteria and parasites that infect the intestines can cause bright red blood in the stool, often associated with abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease — results from an abnormal reaction by the body's immune system. This can expose your entire gastrointestinal system to inflammation and lead to a series of digestive problems including abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, more urgent bowel movements, and bloody stools. Colon cancer Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the tissues of the colon or rectum. When cancer originates in the colon, it is referred to as colon cancer. While colorectal cancer may not always cause noticeable symptoms, common signs can include changes in bowel habits, blood in the stool (either bright red or dark), frequent gas pains, bloating, feelings of fullness or cramping, weight loss, and fatigue. Screening for colon cancer saves lives. Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard screening test because polyps identified during the procedure can be removed before they become cancerous. Colonoscopy can also detect early cancers that can be cured with surgery. Alternative tests include stool tests for DNA and occult blood, with or without sigmoidoscopy. When should you see a doctor for blood in stool? Anyone experiencing persistent or recurring blood in the stool, even in small amounts, should schedule an appointment with their doctor. The stool should be assessed by a health care provider to identify the underlying cause.",1,0.18278708,-0.22380447,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/eggs-protein-and-cholesterol-how-to-make-eggs-part-of-a-heart-healthy-diet,"Eggs, protein, and cholesterol: How to make eggs part of a heart-healthy diet",1,"One large egg has 6 grams of protein and contains lots of healthy nutrients for just 70 calories per egg. That makes them a good choice for most people. Unfortunately, public awareness has lagged behind research findings about eggs and heart health. The humble chicken egg has had a checkered past in the nutrition world. Egg yolks contain cholesterol, so at one time it seemed logical to assume that eating eggs could raise your risk for cardiovascular disease. Many people still limit their egg consumption for this reason. But the scientific evidence around eggs and heart health has evolved. It's true that eggs are rich in dietary cholesterol. But we've learned that saturated fat and trans fat are far worse for your cardiovascular health than dietary cholesterol. The good news for egg lovers is that eggs contain very little saturated fat and no trans fat. So for most people, eating an egg a day won't negatively impact your heart health. How healthy are eggs? Eggs contain healthy vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and nutrients, including: the nutrient choline, which is good for your brain and your nerves (and particularly important for pregnant women) the minerals phosophorus, calcium, and potassium the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which are good for your eyes vitamins A, B, and D. One egg has only 1.24 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D. That's not a lot — a single serving of wild-caught salmon exceeds the recommended daily amount of 15 mcg. But egg yolks are one of the few naturally occurring food sources of vitamin D. So if you live in the Northern Hemisphere and have limited access to sun-induced vitamin D synthesis, eggs can help minimize a shortfall in vitamin D intake during the fall and winter months. How much protein is in an egg? A large egg has 6 grams of protein. The protein in eggs is considered high-quality protein because it contributes all nine essential amino acids. (These nine are considered essential because your body can't synthesize them on its own and must obtain them through your diet.) Each essential amino acid has unique functions, but eating a diet that includes all nine is necessary for your body to perform a range of critical tasks. The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.36 grams per pound of body weight. This tool from the USDA can help you calculate your exact need, but the average sedentary man needs about 56 grams of protein per day, and the average sedentary woman needs about 46 grams. You may need even more than that, based on your age, activity levels, and other factors. Health benefits of eating eggs In addition to being relatively low in calories and providing a wide range of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and nutrients, the protein in eggs can also help you feel fuller for longer by increasing the production of hormones that signal that you've eaten enough. Eating protein also reduces levels of ghrelin, the hormone that makes you feel hungry. Do you need to worry about cholesterol in eggs? While eggs yolks do contain cholesterol, we now know that most of the cholesterol in the body is made by the liver. That means our cholesterol levels aren't greatly affected when we eat foods, like eggs, that contain cholesterol. Instead, the liver is prompted to make cholesterol (which can increase risk of cardiovascular disease) based on the amount of saturated fat and trans fat in our diets. Eggs contain only a small amount of saturated fat — about 1.5 grams per egg — and no trans fats. How many eggs can you eat per week as part of a heart-healthy diet? Eating an egg per day is safe for most healthy people. And the benefits you get from the protein, vitamins, minerals, and relatively few calories in your eggs outweigh risks from the tiny amount of saturated fat that you also get in the egg yolk. But watch what you eat with your eggs. If you're eating sausage, bacon, or ham with your eggs — or cooking them in a lump of butter and then slathering them in cheese — you're right to be concerned about your heart health, because you're introducing saturated fat and sodium into your meal. Instead, try your eggs poached, hard-boiled, or cooked in a little olive oil and served alongside some cooked spinach or sauteed mushrooms.",3,0.3289727,0.078098044,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-a-quick-snooze-help-with-energy-and-focus-the-science-behind-power-naps,Can a quick snooze help with energy and focus? The science behind power naps,1,"If you need a quick pick-me-up during the day, a power nap can be just the thing to help restore mental clarity and fight off fatigue. Power naps can help boost productivity and improve overall well-being, especially when taken at the right time and for the right duration. What is a power nap? A power nap is a short nap that lasts anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Even though you're only resting for a short period of time, power naps can effectively increase your level of alertness and focus. How? Power naps allow your body and mind to rest without entering deeper stages of sleep. Once you enter deep sleep — typically about 30 minutes after you've fallen asleep — you are likely to experience ""sleep inertia"" upon waking. Sleep inertia is the drowsy feeling you may get when you wake up, in which you feel temporarily disorientated and are slower to react. It can take your body 30 to 60 minutes to recover from sleep inertia. Benefits of a quick snooze: An energy boost and mental clarity Naps offer several health benefits that can improve your quality of life. Studies show that naps can enhance mood, reduce fatigue, and improve alertness. Additional research has found that power naps may help decrease blood pressure and improve heart health, especially when taken in the early afternoon. Power naps may support work performance as well. Researchers at NASA found that pilots who napped 20 to 30 minutes were over 50% more alert and over 30% more proficient at their jobs than pilots who didn't nap. How long should a power nap be? Keep your power nap to 30 minutes or less to avoid sleep inertia. A shorter nap can also help you bypass some health risks associated with longer naps. For example, a study published in Obesity found that adults who napped longer than 30 minutes were more likely to experience higher blood pressure and blood sugar levels than people who did not nap. Short nappers did not share this increased risk. Set an alarm to ensure your nap doesn't exceed the 30-minute mark. Tips for a restorative power nap The following tips can help you get the biggest boost out of your power nap. Time it right. Aim to nap in the early afternoon, ideally between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., when your body naturally experiences a dip in energy. Napping too late in the day can interfere with nighttime sleep. That said, the ideal time to nap varies by individual. Some people may benefit from earlier naps depending on what time they wake up and go to sleep. Keep it short. Set an alarm to wake you after 20 to 30 minutes. A short nap will leave you refreshed rather than groggy. Create a cozy environment. Find a quiet, dark, and comfortable space where you won't be interrupted. If you're in a bright or noisy area, consider using an eye mask or earplugs to help you fall asleep faster. Listen to your body. If you frequently feel the need for a nap, it may be a sign of inadequate nighttime sleep. While a power nap can help boost energy in the short term, make sure you're prioritizing a good night's rest as well. Frequent daytime drowsiness can also be a sign of sleep apnea, a common disorder that causes people to stop breathing for short periods during sleep. Talk to your doctor if you are regularly sleepy during the day or if you're a loud snorer. Finally, napping is not for everyone. Some people may not feel refreshed even after a short nap. In that case, the best approach may be to avoid napping and focus on getting a good night's sleep.",5,0.23144735,-0.1625297,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-latest-thinking-on-inherited-high-cholesterol,The latest thinking on inherited high cholesterol,1,"Nearly one-third of American adults have high levels of harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol circulating through their blood, which doubles their risk of heart disease compared to people with normal levels (see ""Classifying LDL level""). Most of these people likely have dozens of different genetic mutations, each of which raises LDL by a little bit. Over time — coupled with a less-than-ideal diet and not enough exercise — their LDL levels slowly creep up. But what about very high LDL? ""About 5% of the population have LDL values of 190 or higher, and their risk of heart disease is five times higher than people with near-optimal LDL,"" says Dr. Amit V. Khera, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Within this group, an important minority has familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic condition that affects about one in 250 adults. What is FH? Most people with FH have a mutation or variant in one of three different genes that provide instructions that help remove excess LDL from the bloodstream. People who inherit one variant from a parent have heterozygous FH, which can cause LDL levels as high as 350 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). People who inherit two variants (one from each parent) have homozygous FH. This very rare condition, which affects only about four in a million people, can lead to LDL levels as high as 1,000 mg/dL. Excess LDL in the bloodstream can accumulate in the skin and tendons, which is why some people with FH develop small, cholesterol-filled nodules on their eyelids or their tendons, especially those along the backs of the hands, the elbows, or the backs of the ankles (the Achilles tendons). But the biggest threat is the buildup of LDL in the arteries supplying the heart. People with untreated FH can succumb to a heart attack in their 40s or earlier, likely because of the cumulative exposure to high LDL starting at birth. Classifying LDL level These targets are for people without known heart disease. People who have heart disease or are at high risk for it should aim for an LDL of 70 or lower. LDL category Value (mg/dL) Optimal 100 Near/above optimal 100–129 Borderline high 130–159 High 160–189 Very high 190 or higher Is genetic testing necessary? If a person's close relative — a parent or sibling — has very high cholesterol or had a heart attack at a young age (before 55 in a man or 65 in a woman), that's a red flag for possible FH. Genetic testing isn't strictly necessary, as high LDL is a reliable sign of heart disease risk in anyone, regardless of the cause. However, FH testing can be beneficial for two reasons, says Dr. Khera. ""First, if you've struggled your whole life with high cholesterol despite following a healthy diet and getting regular exercise, knowing there's a genetic explanation is often helpful."" Second, an FH diagnosis can be important for your biological parents, siblings, and children, each of whom has a 50/50 chance of having the same FH variant. Although guidelines recommend checking cholesterol levels in children and adolescents at least once between ages 9 and 11 and again between ages 17 and 21, such tests usually aren't done. And when high cholesterol is found, physicians typically don't treat children and teens very aggressively. But once they hit adulthood, treating very high cholesterol is crucial, says Dr. Khera. The Family Heart Foundation has more information on FH, including a tool to search for doctors who specialize in the condition. Treating very high LDL The latest cholesterol treatment guidelines emphasize the importance of lowering excessively high LDL and keeping it low for decades. ""It's most practical to focus on finding and treating severe hypercholesterolemia, regardless of the underlying cause,"" says Dr. Khera. The first choice is a high-intensity statin: 40 to 80 milligrams (mg) of atorvastatin (Lipitor) or 20 to 40 mg of rosuvastatin (Crestor), both of which will slash LDL by about 50%. While those drugs get many people with very high LDL close to the target range of 70 mg/dL for high-risk individuals, some need additional medications, which may include ezetimibe (Zetia), a pill that inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut bempedoic acid (Nexletol), a pill that blocks cholesterol production in the liver alirocumab (Praluent) or evolocumab (Repatha), injectable drugs that help remove excess LDL from the bloodstream inclisiran (Leqvio), a twice-yearly injection that interferes with a protein in the liver that regulates LDL. Following heart-healthy habits, as outlined in the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 is also crucial. Image: © jarun011/Getty Images",7,0.19307378,0.1802275,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-diseases-gender-bias,Inflammatory bowel disease's gender bias,1,"Just because a situation is equal doesn't make it equitable. Case in point: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — which has been diagnosed in about one of every 100 American adults — affects roughly equal numbers of both sexes. But the condition clearly inflicts a disproportionate burden on women, shaping symptoms, affecting reproductive decisions, and increasing risks of ominous downstream effects. IBD comprises both Crohn's disease — which can affect any part of the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus — and ulcerative colitis, which is limited to the colon. Diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, urgency, rectal bleeding, weight loss, and fatigue are commonplace among both men and women with the disorder. Some patients with IBD experience only mild symptoms, while others cope with much more severe cases. People with Crohn's, for instance, can develop abnormal, tunnel-like fistulas between their colon or rectum and nearby tissues such as the skin, bladder, or vagina. IBD's gender bias was highlighted by a study published in the February 2023 issue of the Journal of Personalized Medicine, which reported that women with the condition report more psychological distress and a worse quality of life than male peers. IBD can also be harder on women because of its array of specific effects on their reproductive and overall health, says Dr. Rachel Winter, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Formidable challenges Here's how IBD can affect women differently from men: Symptoms ramp up during menstruation. For many women, even without IBD, periods bring intestinal troubles such as abdominal pain, loose stools, or indigestion. For women with IBD, such overlapping symptoms can make them feel like they're having a flare even if they're not, Dr. Winter says. Sex can be painful. If Crohn's disease affects a part of the intestine near the perineum — the area between the vulva and anus — women can find vaginal sex excruciating. A fistula between the intestinal wall and the vagina can create the same issue, as can abdominal scar tissue from IBD-related surgeries. Even the idea of sex can be off-putting, since IBD patients may worry about passing stool during intercourse or feel inhibited if they have an ostomy bag that collects stool outside the abdomen. It may be harder to conceive. Fertility may suffer when rampant inflammation from IBD affects the fallopian tubes, where fertilization occurs. And IBD flares during pregnancy can raise the risk of complications such as low birth weight or premature birth. ""We have open conversations with all of our patients who are considering becoming pregnant in the near future, because certain medications shouldn't be taken during pregnancy,"" Dr. Winter says. ""We want to transition to medications that are safe if they conceive."" Women who take immunosuppressive drugs have a higher risk for cervical cancer. Certain IBD medications that suppress the immune system can raise the risk of abnormal cells developing on the cervix. Because of this, doctors advise women with IBD who take these drugs to undergo screening Pap tests more frequently than other women. IBD itself does not increase the risk for precancerous or cancerous changes of the cervix. Iron-deficiency anemia is more likely. Menstrual bleeding — which carries iron out of the body — already increases women's odds of anemia. Adding in digestive tract bleeding from IBD creates a double whammy. IBD also hinders the body's ability to absorb iron, increasing anemia risk. Osteoporosis risks increase. This bone-thinning disease already disproportionately strikes women over 50 compared to men. But women with IBD are especially at risk for osteoporosis even at younger ages, particularly if they've had problems absorbing nutrients or have taken the steroid prednisone, which weakens bones. Support tips How can women with IBD generate support for any sex-specific concerns? Dr. Winter offers these suggestions: Be candid. Sharing private, potentially embarrassing symptoms or downstream effects of IBD can be daunting. But it's vital to push past awkward moments and be frank with your doctor, who may be able to propose solutions you hadn't considered. ""Women should not be afraid to openly discuss any of these issues with their providers,"" she says. Look for dedicated IBD programs. Some academic medical centers have programs aimed directly at patients with IBD, increasing the chances that clinicians there will be well versed in women-specific concerns.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/digestive-health-changes-when-to-seek-medical-care,Digestive health changes: When to seek medical care,1,"It's been an eventful year in the world, and if it seems like it's been a bumpy ride for your gastrointestinal tract, too — with bouts of heartburn, diarrhea, or constipation — this is a good time to consider whether you've been experiencing temporary symptoms or signs of something more serious or chronic. Identify your distress The first step in understanding gastrointestinal distress is putting a name to the problem. Heartburn. This fiery feeling in your chest is usually caused by stomach acid that leaks upward into the esophagus (the tube connecting your mouth and stomach). It occurs when the ring of muscles that normally stop leakage temporarily loosen or aren't working well. Heartburn might also cause a sore throat, a cough, or a metallic taste after meals. Constipation. If you're not having a bowel movement at least three times a week, that's considered constipation. Or if your stool is hard and lumpy and you strain to get it out or you have the feeling you aren't evacuating completely, that's also constipation. Diarrhea. Diarrhea is watery, unformed stool. It usually doesn't feel great as it's brewing in your gut, and it's often uncomfortable to pass it. What's causing the trouble? The digestive tract is a sophisticated yet sensitive system that can be disrupted anywhere along its route from the mouth to the anus—and it doesn't take much to cause temporary discomfort. For example, stress can slow digestion and cause constipation, increase acid production and trigger heartburn, or speed digestion and send you running for the bathroom with diarrhea. ""We call the gastrointestinal tract the 'second nervous system.' There are many nerve endings going to all parts of it, including the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Stress might result in the brain telling the tract how to react, even when there might not be anything wrong structurally,"" says Dr. Alexander Goldowsky, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Other possible causes of occasional gastrointestinal problems include your diet, weight gain, an infection, or a medication side effect. Coping with occasional bouts If you've been experiencing new digestive issues, try making a few changes to see if symptoms go away in a few days or weeks. For heartburn. Two approaches can help. One is using over-the-counter medications. Dr. Goldowsky recommends taking a fast-acting drug that targets stomach acid. Examples include calcium carbonate (Tums), aluminum hydroxide (Mylanta), and H2 blockers such as famotidine (Pepcid) and cimetidine (Tagamet). The other approach is making lifestyle changes. Avoid foods and drinks that seem to trigger your heartburn, such as spicy, fatty, or tomato-based foods; citrus; garlic; onion; peppermint; and anything with caffeine, such as chocolate, tea, or coffee. Also: eat smaller meals, stay upright for at least two hours after meals, avoid drinking alcohol or eating late at night, and sleep on a wedge pillow. For constipation. To combat constipation, Dr. Goldowsky advises taking a powdered fiber supplement that you add to food or drinks, such as Metamucil, Benefiber, or Citrucel. ""Fiber is a miracle. It helps stool form a shape and get out, so you feel empty,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. He also recommends increasing fiber in your diet (great sources include beans, lentils, peas, whole grains, berries, nuts, seeds, artichokes, pumpkin, and brussels sprouts). ""Your total goal should be around 30 grams of fiber per day,"" he says, ""but it's hard to reach that goal with food. That's why the supplement is important."" Other ways to fight constipation include drinking more fluids to help stool move along, and exercising every day (which keeps the muscles in your intestines strong). For diarrhea. Dr. Goldowsky recommends using a fiber supplement for this problem, too, since fiber helps stool form properly. It's also essential to stay hydrated to replace fluids you're losing through diarrhea. Additionally, it's a good idea to keep track of foods that might be triggering diarrhea. Common culprits include dairy foods; foods that contain gluten, artificial sweeteners, or caffeine; fried, fatty, spicy, or sugary foods; and foods with natural sugars that are difficult for some people to digest, such as those in wheat, rye, onions, garlic, legumes (chickpeas, lentils, beans), honey, pistachios, cashews, asparagus, artichokes, and sun-dried tomatoes. It might also help to take an anti­diarrheal medication such as loperamide (Imodium). ""Medications for diarrhea are helpful, but they can overdo it and cause constipation. Take a few doses and see how you feel, then gradually reduce the amount you're taking,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. When to call your doctor Call your doctor immediately if your symptoms include bloody stools, fever, loss of bowel control, severe pain, or severe dehydration. If you don't have those symptoms but you do have heartburn, diarrhea, or constipation that isn't going away after a week or two of home remedies, it's time to see your doctor. ""We don't want to miss colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""These are unlikely causes of such symptoms, but we need to rule them out."" Your physician will also rule out other disorders that can cause gastrointestinal problems (such as low thyroid function), gut changes that affect how fast food moves through the digestive tract, and medication side effects that might be causing trouble. The encouraging news is that there's usually a way to treat the problem, including specialized diets, physical therapy, or medications. ""Don't give up. We can get you feeling better,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""My goal is for you to be able to control or eliminate your symptoms so you can function well and have a better quality of life.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/forearm-workouts-strengthening-grip-for-everyday-function,Forearm workouts: Strengthening grip for everyday function,1,"When you think about building strength, your mind might immediately go to strength-training workouts for the larger muscles in your body such as your back, chest, or legs. But the muscles of the forearm — the part of the arm that extends from the elbow to the wrist — are also worth paying attention to. Why grip strength matters Strong forearms support grip strength, which plays an important role in how well you can grasp and hold items. Think squeezing a tube of toothpaste, turning a doorknob, or holding a glass of water. Research has also found that grip strength is associated with many measures of overall health, especially as you age. A weak grip is associated with: lower total strength reduced bone mineral density falls and fractures sleep problems memory problems depression malnutrition death from any cause. How strengthening forearms can improve grip Many of the muscles that help your hand and wrist grip something solidly extend into your forearms. One study found that having larger forearm muscles was correlated with greater grip strength. Strengthening forearm muscles can help you perform gripping and grasping movements more effectively and efficiently As of now, there's no evidence that building forearm muscles and grip strength will improve longevity or overall health. However, increased grip strength will support your ability to perform gripping and grasping tasks — from opening jars to holding a cane and opening doors — that could help you stay independent longer. Simple forearm exercises to boost grip strength Some of the best forearm workouts involve surprisingly simple movements. Start with one set of 10 repetitions for each of the following strength exercises. Build up to two to three sets over time. You'll need a set of light dumbells (1 to 3 pounds) and some therapy putty (start with the softest putty), which you can purchase at a medical supply store, to perform these exercises. Wrist extension and flexion Hold a light dumbbell (1 to 3 pounds) in each hand. Keep your arms at your sides with your elbows bent, palms facing down. Moving from your wrist, lift the weights upward until you feel a gentle stretch on the inside of your wrist. Hold for a count of five. Then bend your wrist and lower the weights down until you feel a gentle stretch on the outside of your wrist. Hold for a count of five. Continue for 10 repetitions. Wrist supination/pronation Hold a light dumbbell (1 to 3 pounds) in each hand. Keep your arms at your sides with your elbows bent, palms facing down. Rotate your forearm, so your palm faces up. Hold for a count of five. Then rotate your forearm so your palm faces down. Hold for a count of five. Continue for 10 repetitions. Putty grip Roll the putty into a ball. Place the putty in your palm. Gently squeeze and release. Repeat 10 times on each hand every other day. Putty three-point pinch Roll the putty into a short, fat cylinder. Place the putty between the pads of your thumb and your index and middle fingers. Gently squeeze the putty between your fingers and thumb and release. Repeat 10 times on each hand every other day. Some people also use tools called hand grippers or grip strengtheners for a few minutes each day to build grip strength. There are many different models available online and in fitness stores. Gadgets to help compensate for reduced grip strength Forearm workouts only go so far. Sometimes you need a little assistance to accomplish tasks like opening a stubborn jar or confidently holding a sharp knife. There are a number of tools and gadgets that can help. These are often available at medical supply stores or online. They include: electric can openers jar key openers nonslip gripper mats to open jars rocker knives dental floss holders soap-on-a-rope shoehorns doorknob extenders book stands nonslip gloves.",5,0.35293502,-0.050553307,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/botulism-a-to-z,Botulism,1,"What is botulism? Botulism is a form of poisoning caused by exposure to Clostridium botulinum bacteria. These bacteria manufacture a chemical poison known as botulinum toxin that interferes with muscle function in many areas of the body, causing paralysis of individual muscles or groups of muscles. Exposure to this toxin is life-threatening, since one of the muscles it can paralyze is the diaphragm, the muscle that controls breathing. You can be exposed to the bacteria causing botulism in several ways, the most familiar being by eating contaminated food. In most food-borne cases of botulism in adults, home-canned foods are responsible. The bacteria that cause botulism exist in dirt and dust as a spore, but this form is inactive and does not produce toxin. However, when a spore is moved into a low-oxygen environment such as an enclosed jar or can, it can reproduce and make its dangerous toxin. Home-canned vegetables that are not highly acidic (asparagus, green beans, peppers, beets, and corn) are good incubators for botulism bacteria, unless they are heat-treated appropriately to kill the spores during the canning process and eaten quickly after opening. The bacteria can release large quantities of toxin into the canned food jar, causing botulism symptoms in people who sample the produce. Home-canned, smoked, or fermented fish is also a risk. Recent outbreaks have been reported from commercial carrot juice and home-canned bamboo shoots. In the United States, roughly 100 people become ill with botulism each year. About a quarter are due to consumption of contaminated food. Most cases today (about 70%) occur in infants. Babies less than 1 year old, especially those that are breastfeeding, have a different intestinal system than adults. Spores swallowed by an adult with a mature digestive tract usually will remain in their hibernating, inactive state. But spores ingested by a young infant can reproduce and can form toxin that is absorbed into the bloodstream, causing botulism. In one out of five cases of botulism in infants, the infant has eaten raw honey. More rarely, botulism spores are found in corn syrup. Since the majority of cases of infant botulism can't be traced to a food source, experts suspect that babies are exposed simply by swallowing small amounts of dust or dirt. Rarely, botulism is the result of a contaminated wound. Most wound botulism today occurs in people who inject or snort recreational drugs. Symptoms of botulism All of the symptoms of botulism are the result of nerve paralysis during exposure to the toxin. Symptoms usually begin within one to two days after eating contaminated food. Symptoms of infant botulism and wound botulism also appear suddenly. The earliest symptoms involve the eyes and face, because nerves controlling their function are affected most quickly by the botulism toxin. Early or mild symptoms, which may go away on their own, include: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (not usually present in wound botulism) double vision, blurred vision (especially when viewing close objects), or drooping eyelids dryness of the mouth. More severe cases can cause these additional symptoms: slurred or garbled speech difficulty swallowing muscle weakness in arms or legs; general fatigue difficulty breathing, sometimes severe in infants, usually constipation at first; also lethargy and a ""floppy"" neck, arms, and legs, demonstrating weak muscles; difficulty feeding; failure to cry well. Diagnosing botulism If your doctor suspects botulism after asking you about your medical history and examining you, both blood and stool samples may be tested to check for the presence of botulinum toxin. Generally these tests are done in a government laboratory that specializes in detecting botulism. Sometimes botulism bacteria can be grown from a stool sample. Botulism is uncommon enough that your doctor will consider other explanations for your symptoms. In most cases, several other tests will be ordered: a brain scan, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, to check for other diagnoses such as stroke blood tests to check for Lyme disease a lumbar puncture to help to distinguish botulism from a similar illness called Guillain-Barre syndrome an electromyogram, a test of nerve and muscle function, to determine if the problem might be another muscle-weakening disease such as polymyositis or myasthenia gravis. Once definite evidence of botulism is found with laboratory tests, usually no additional testing is needed. Expected duration of botulism Most paralysis symptoms of botulism last for several weeks and then slowly go away in the following months. Sometimes fatigue and shortness of breath can last for years. Preventing botulism You can prevent food-borne botulism with careful food-handling techniques: When home canning, use a pressure cooker that can reach temperatures adequate to kill botulism spores. Preserved food should be heated above 248º F (120º C) for at least five minutes during the canning process. Some foods, such as jams and jellies, do not require a pressure cooker because their high sugar level makes it difficult for Clostridium botulinum bacteria to grow. Do not eat or store cooked foods that have stayed at room temperature for more than four hours. Do not eat or even taste canned goods from a jar that has a bulging lid or a bad odor. Do not leave foil-wrapped baked potatoes at room temperature. They should be served hot or refrigerated. Do not store chopped garlic or onions in oil at room temperature. If you are eating home-canned fish or vegetables, first boil the food for 10 minutes with frequent stirring. This will destroy any botulinum toxin that has been produced in storage. Do not feed honey or corn syrup to infants less than 1 year old. To prevent wound botulism, do not use recreational injected drugs. Report deep wounds promptly to a physician. Treating botulism Botulism usually requires hospitalization, sometimes for a prolonged time. The main treatment for botulism is administration of an antitoxin (a chemical antidote to the toxin), and good nursing support and physician care, sometimes in an intensive care unit, with machine support by a ventilator as needed to assist breathing. If antitoxin is given early in the course of the disease, it will prevent further paralysis from the toxin, but it does not affect symptoms that are already present. Physical therapy can be helpful in aiding recovery of muscle strength. Infants with botulism present a special challenge: They are treated with antitoxin but are not given antibiotics because killing the botulism bacteria in their gut can cause a sudden release of more antitoxin. Instead, medicines that cause vomiting or treatments such as enemas are used to remove undigested food from the gut. Wounds that are a source of botulism must be treated with surgery to remove contaminated tissue. When to call a professional Botulism can worsen rapidly and is a life-threatening emergency. If you or your infant has symptoms of botulism and these symptoms do not have a known explanation, you should contact a physician immediately. Prognosis Although botulism can cause severe and prolonged symptoms, most people recover completely from the illness. Early treatment reduces the risk of permanent disability and death.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/7-ways-to-snack-smarter,7 ways to snack smarter,1,"Choosing the right snacks can be a game-changer for maintaining energy and overall health, but looks can be deceiving when it comes to nutrition. Many snacks marketed as ""healthy,"" like bran muffins and cereal bars, are actually loaded with hidden sugars and unhealthy fats. Even ""fat-free"" options can sneak in excess salt and sugar to make up for the flavor loss, which may ultimately do more harm than good. Knowing what to look for can help you enjoy satisfying, nourishing snacks that support your goals rather than derail them. Here are 7 tips for smarter snacking. Go for the grain. Whole-grain snacks can give you energy with staying power. Try some whole-grain low-salt pretzels or tortilla chips, or a serving of high-fiber cereals. Bring back breakfast. Many breakfast foods can be repurposed as a nutritious snack later in the day. How about a slice of whole-grain toast topped with low-sugar jam? Low-sugar granola also makes a quick snack. Try a ""high-low"" combination. Combine a small amount of a food with healthy fat, like peanut butter, with a larger amount of a very light food, like apple slices or celery sticks. Go nuts. Unsalted nuts and seeds make great snacks. Almonds, walnuts, peanuts, roasted pumpkin seeds, cashews, hazelnuts, filberts, and other nuts and seeds contain many beneficial nutrients and are more likely to leave you feeling full (unlike chips or pretzels). Nuts have lots of calories, though, so keep portion sizes small. The combo snack. Try to have more than just one macronutrient (protein, fat, carbohydrate) at each snacking session. For example, have a few nuts (protein and fat) and some grapes (carbohydrates). Or try some whole-grain crackers (carbohydrate) with some low-fat cheese (protein and fat). These balanced snacks tend to keep you feeling satisfied. Snack mindfully. Don't eat your snack while doing something else — like surfing the Internet, watching TV, or working at your desk. Instead, stop what you're doing for a few minutes and eat your snack like you would a small meal. Take it with you. Think ahead and carry a small bag of healthful snacks in your pocket or purse so you won't turn in desperation to the cookies at the coffee counter or the candy bars in the office vending machine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/do-you-need-diagnostic-tests-for-heartburn,Do you need diagnostic tests for heartburn?,1,"You just enjoyed a delicious meal, but now there's a burning feeling creeping up your chest—classic heartburn. Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or ""acid reflux,"" which occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus. But sometimes, this pain can be so intense it mimics a heart attack, making you wonder if it's something more serious. While doctors often skip extensive tests for straightforward cases, certain red flags—like trouble swallowing, internal bleeding, or severe, unresponsive symptoms—can call for deeper investigation. Here's a look at some of the diagnostic tests your doctor might recommend to get to the root of persistent heartburn. Upper GI endoscopy. This is the most commonly ordered initial test when people have worrisome symptoms. For this test, a person receives intravenous medicine to induce relaxation. It's called conscious sedation. The doctor sprays a local anesthetic in the back of the throat to prevent gagging. Next the doctor inserts a flexible tube called an endoscope down the throat. The tube has a light and camera attached, which let the doctor inspect the lining of the esophagus, stomach and first part of the small intestine to look for areas of irritation, ulcers, or strictures. Special tools can be inserted through the endoscope to take a biopsy (tissue sample), if necessary. Barium study. After drinking a liquid barium mixture, a person has an x-ray of the chest and upper abdomen. Barium helps define the esophagus on the x-ray image and can help the physician identify problems such as a hiatal hernia, esophageal ulcers, or a stricture (narrowing) of the esophagus. This test is called an upper GI series when the stomach and first part of the small intestine are also examined. pH monitoring. This test is used less frequently than those described above. It monitors a person's reflux episodes over 24 hours via a thin, acid sensing probe inserted through the nose and positioned at the bottom of the esophagus just above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This is an excellent method for documenting acid reflux in people who have unexplained chest pain, coughing, wheezing, or hoarseness. It's also used to assess the effectiveness of acid-suppressing drugs when symptoms persist. A wireless form of the pH monitor is contained in a capsule and looks like a pill. It is placed in the esophagus and can be used to monitor pH levels for 48 hours, during periods while the person is both on and off acid-suppressing therapy. The wireless pH system is particularly useful in people who do not respond to PPIs. Impedance testing. This test can be done at the same time as pH monitoring. It measures how well food and gas pass through the esophagus and is a good way to evaluate both acid- and non-acid reflux.

Relationship issues. Because the mind and body are so closely linked, these constant worries can take a toll on health, contributing to a host of diseases. While you can't erase all sources of stress, you can learn how to reduce stress and also build resilience—which is your ability to bounce back from stress. William James was a notable Harvard philosopher-psychologist of the late 19th century and a graduate of Harvard Medical School. James was also a stressed-out melancholic. He marveled at people he called ""the healthy-minded""—optimistic and positive people who appeared to live hap­pier and healthier lives. Amid the run-of-the-mill volatility everyone must deal with, James observed that the healthy-minded seemed to turn challenges and potential failures into grist for opportunities and successes. The characteristics that James saw as ""healthy-minded,"" statistician and risk-management specialist Nassim Nicholas Taleb called ""antifragile."" In his book Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder, Taleb defines fragility as the tendency to be damaged by volatility and uncertainty—the kinds of things that often create a chronic stress response. By contrast, says Taleb, the antifragile person realizes that stress is just the price we pay for being alive. Cultivating anti­fragility helps us use our strengths to overcome chal­lenges and become stronger in the process. A prime example of antifragility is the Navy Seals. The Seals are able to manage high degrees of stress and still function admirably. Faced with life-threatening situations, they can rapidly change the focus of their attention and address the issue at hand efficiently and flexibly. Brain scans show that Seals have altered acti­vation in a prefrontal brain region called the insula, which is involved in managing stress signals. As a group, Navy Seals exhibit at least seven characteris­tics of resilient people: Calm, innovative, nondogmatic thinking The ability to act decisively Tenacity Inter­personal connectedness Honesty Self-control Optimism and a positive perspective on life. Whether adopting a ""healthy-minded"" mindset, cultivating antifragility, or thinking like a Navy Seal, building resilience is a powerful tool against stress. People tend to think of resilience as a trait that you either have or don't have, but it's actually a capacity that you can develop with the right approach.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/emlisteriaem-how-to-protect-yourself-from-this-common-cause-of-food-poisoning,Listeria: How to protect yourself from this common cause of food poisoning,1,"Listeria infection is rare compared to other types of food-borne illness. But outbreaks from deli meats and other foods do occur from time to time. What is Listeria? Listeria infection is a food-borne illness caused by bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes. A Listeria infection is also called listeriosis. Most people develop listeriosis from eating contaminated foods. Food poisoning from Listeria can be dangerous, or even deadly. About 1,600 people get a Listeria infection each year in the U.S., and about 260 people die from the disease. How Listeria causes food poisoning The bacteria that cause listeriosis can be found in moist environments, including soil, water, and decaying vegetation. Animals can also carry Listeria bacteria in their intestines without getting sick themselves. As a result, tood can become infected with Listeria during harvesting, processing, preparation, or storage. If contaminated food is eaten, the bacteria can cause food poisoning. Symptoms of listeriosis The symptoms of listeriosis vary depending on whether the infection is limited to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or has spread beyond the gut. People infected with Listeria may feel symptoms within a few hours or days after eating contaminated food. Intestinal symptoms include diarrhea and vomiting. Symptoms usually resolve within three days, and most people feel better with rest and drinking plenty of fluids. Invasive listeriosis, the term for listeriosis that spreads beyond the GI tract, can take several weeks to cause symptoms. Symptoms of invasive Listeria infection include: fever muscle aches fatigue headache stiff neck gastroenteritis confusion loss of balance seizures. A severe Listeria infection may spread to the bloodstream or brain. Severe infections may cause life-threatening conditions such as sepsis, meningitis, or encephalitis. Some pregnant women who develop listeriosis have no symptoms or have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, or a serious infection in the newborn. Foods most likely to be contaminated with Listeria The foods that are most likely to be contaminated with Listeria include: deli meats hot dogs unpasteurized raw milk unpasteurized soft cheeses raw sprouts smoked seafood. While these foods have the highest risk of Listeria monocytogenes contamination, listeriosis can affect almost any improperly handled or prepared food. How to reduce your risk of food poisoning Some tips to reduce your risk of food poisoning from listeriosis or other food-borne illnesses, such as Salmonella poisoning, include the following: Set your refrigerator at 40o F (4o C) or lower and your freezer at 0o F (andndash;18 o C). Those temperatures can slow the growth of Listeria, which can grow even in cold temperatures. Use a refrigerator thermometer and adjust the settings if necessary. Use refrigerated foods by the date listed on the package. The longer you keep them, the higher the risk of Listeria growing. Clean your refrigerator regularly, and wipe up spills right away so Listeria doesn't have a place to grow. Other steps you can take to reduce your risk of food poisoning include washing your hands before and after handling food, and using separate cutting boards and utensils for produce and raw meats or seafood. A food thermometer can help ensure that meat, poultry, fish, and other foods are cooked to a safe internal temperature. Raw pet food is another potential source of Listeria contamination, so take care when preparing your pet's meals. Who is at greatest risk for severe illness from Listeria? People at greatest risk for severe illness from Listeria include pregnant women, newborn babies, people ages 65 and older, and people with a weakened immune system, such as those being treated for cancer. Listeria can harm a fetus even if the mother has mild symptoms. About one in four pregnant women who get listeriosis will miscarry or lose their baby shortly after birth. What to know about food recalls When a number of people get sick from eating or drinking the same contaminated food, it's defined as a food-borne disease outbreak. This can lead to a food recall by the U.S. government. If a food in your home matches the details on a food recall notice, don't open or consume the product. Instead, bring the product to the place where you bought it for a refund, or dispose of it to make sure no one will consume it. FoodSafety.gov, a U.S. government website, maintains a current list of food recalls and food-borne disease outbreaks, and advises what to do with a recalled product. Treating food poisoning caused by Listeria Most people with intestinal symptoms of listeriosis, such as vomiting and diarrhea, recover within a couple of days with rest and fluids. Women who are pregnant will be prescribed an antibiotic to treat listeriosis. Antibiotics are also prescribed to people who are very ill or who are at risk of becoming very ill with an invasive Listeria infection.",1,0.099463694,-0.008123562,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-probiotics-help-calm-inflammatory-bowel-disease-202411133081,Can probiotics help calm inflammatory bowel disease?,1,"Approximately three million Americans have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is an umbrella term for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, illnesses marked by chronic or repeated bouts of inflammation in the digestive tract. Both types of IBD represent a complex interplay of genes, environment, and immune factors. Current therapies for IBD suppress the immune system to reduce inflammation. But emerging research on the human microbiome may help scientists better understand and manage IBD. And some preliminary studies on cells, animals, and humans have investigated whether probiotics — which are sometimes called ""good"" bacteria — are beneficial for people with IBD. The healthy microbiome: Building a barrier The human intestinal microbiome is the vast community of trillions of helpful and harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms that inhabit our gut. Ideally, the lining of the gut acts as a barrier that prevents harmful bacteria and toxins from entering the bloodstream. A healthy microbiome helps this lining block out harmful bacteria while enabling it to absorb nutrients. Beneficial bacteria in the microbiome promote a healthy, hospitable gut environment that limits inflammation and helps crowd out harmful bacteria. Recent studies on human cells and in mice suggest that a healthy microbiome produces substances that nourish cells lining the colon, so that they form a tight barrier difficult for harmful bacteria to penetrate interact with immune cells in the gut, reducing inflammation prompt the gut lining to make mucus that acts as an additional barrier to harmful bacteria. In animal studies, a healthy microbiome is essential to help build and maintain an effective barrier. Animals raised in the laboratory without a microbiome, or whose microbiome has been depleted by antibiotics, have intestinal linings that are easily damaged. An unbalanced microbiome: Inflammation and damage What happens if the microbiome doesn't have a good balance of helpful and harmful bacteria? The gut lining may become increasingly permeable. That may allow potentially harmful bacteria and their toxins to cross into the intestinal tissue and then into the bloodstream, triggering inflammation that can damage the gut. An imbalanced microbiome is known as dysbiosis. And the inflammatory cascade linked to dysbiosis is a hallmark of IBD. Probiotics: More promise than evidence Probiotics — live microorganisms in supplements or in fermented foods like kombucha, kefir, yogurt, and sauerkraut — have been proposed as therapies for IBD. The idea is that by eating beneficial bacteria we can restore and maintain a balanced microbiome, reduce inflammation, and improve the gut barrier. But what does the evidence say? Thus far, no probiotic therapy is routinely prescribed for IBD. Small randomized studies have compared specific probiotics with standard immunosuppressive therapies for IBD. The studies measured IBD symptoms, remission rates, or quality of life. Results were mixed at best: Ulcerative colitis. Some studies suggest that certain bacterial strains, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, are somewhat effective for ulcerative colitis, reducing symptoms, promoting remission, and improving quality of life. But these effects are modest compared to standard therapies, and probiotics have not shown enough benefit to be accepted in medical practice. Pouchitis. Some people with IBD may need surgery to remove the colon (large intestine). This can lead to inflammation in the remaining small intestine, which gets formed into a J-shaped pouch and attached to the anus. However, 25% to 45% of people who have a J-pouch later experience inflammation known as pouchitis. Several studies show that combining standard medication with a probiotic mix called VSL#3 effectively quells the symptoms and inflammation of pouchitis. VSL#3 contains eight strains of bacteria. It is used to treat chronic pouchitis, which is the only accepted use of probiotics in common practice for IBD. Crohn's disease. Probiotics have not been studied as rigorously in Crohn's disease as in ulcerative colitis. Most of the limited set of studies found that probiotics are no better than placebo in reducing symptoms or promoting remission. Diet, fiber, and prebiotics: A role in IBD? The makeup and activity of our microbiomes can be altered by diet. That's true even if the foods you consume aren't well-known probiotic stars like kombucha, yogurt, kefir, and other fermented foods. Gut bacteria that break down dietary fiber are a cornerstone of a healthy microbiome. A high-fiber diet can boost the number of these bacteria, as well as their beneficial and anti-inflammatory effects. Food ingredients that are not absorbed by the gut but are instead consumed by the gut microbiome are called prebiotics. We have limited — though promising — evidence supporting prebiotics for people with IBD. Currently, no specific prebiotic food or supplement is recommended for general use. However, the Mediterranean diet, which encourages fiber-rich vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, may modestly reduce symptoms and markers of inflammation in IBD. While these effects are small and inconsistent, the Mediterranean diet improves overall health in people with or without IBD. Largely for this reason, the American Gastroenterology Association recommends it for people who have IBD. The bottom line Probiotics, and possibly even prebiotics, hold promise. But we don't yet know how to harness their full potential for treating IBD. While current evidence suggests probiotics may one day be an effective way to help treat IBD, the complexity of the microbiome means that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to work. Many questions remain: Which strains of bacteria in the gut should we study? How do we determine the best cocktail of probiotics to reap maximum benefit?

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/digestive-enzymes-how-supplements-like-lactaid-and-beano-can-help-with-digestion,Digestive enzymes: How supplements like Lactaid and Beano can help with digestion,1,"If you're struggling with bloating or discomfort after consuming dairy, beans, or certain vegetables, digestive enzyme supplements might be what your body needs to process these tricky foods. What are digestive enzyme supplements? There's a lot that goes on behind the scenes during digestion. As food makes its way through your gastrointestinal (GI) tract, your digestive organs break it down into smaller parts, in part by using digestive juices. Digestive juices contain enzymes that break down food into smaller components of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. There are different enzymes for different components; for example, the enzyme amylase breaks down carbohydrates, the enzyme protease breaks down proteins, and the enzyme lipase breaks down fats. Your pancreas, stomach, and small intestine naturally produce these enzymes. However, sometimes the body doesn't produce enough enzymes. This can slow down digestion and lead to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and gas. Sometimes people can't make enough digestive enzymes because of a health condition like chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis. In these cases, a doctor will prescribe enzyme pills to substitute for the lack of natural enzyme production. However, in cases of lactose intolerance or difficulty digesting complex carbohydrates found in beans and certain gas-producing vegetables, over-the-counter (OTC) digestive enzyme supplements may be enough improve digestion and provide relief from discomfort. How do supplements like Lactaid and Beano work? Lactaid and Beano are two popular digestive enzyme supplements that can help people digest specific foods more easily. Both supplements target specific digestive issues by providing enzymes the body may not naturally produce in sufficient quantities. And both are available without a prescription. Lactaid dietary supplements contain lactase, an enzyme that breaks down lactose, a sugar found in dairy products. People who are lactose intolerant lack sufficient lactase, leading to symptoms like gas, bloating, and diarrhea after consuming dairy. Lactaid dietary supplements can be used every time you eat foods that contain dairy. But many people find that they can digest certain forms of dairy (like hard cheeses) more easily than other forms (like milk or ice cream). A little experimentation can help you figure out when you need an assist from an enzyme supplement. Beano contains alpha-galactosidase, an enzyme that helps break down a type of non-absorbable fiber found in beans, root vegetables, and some dairy products. These foods can be difficult for the body to digest, and may cause gas and bloating. Beano breaks down the non-absorbable fiber before it reaches the intestines, where it would otherwise ferment and produce gas. Taking Beano before meals can help prevent gas-related symptoms like flatulence, abdominal cramping, and bloating. Beano is taken in tablet form right before eating or with your first bite. Who can benefit from digestive enzyme supplements? Digestive enzyme supplements can benefit people who struggle to digest certain foods due to low levels of the enzymes that process those foods. For example, individuals with lactose intolerance (which affects up to 75% of the world's population) may benefit from lactase supplements like Lactaid. Similarly, more than 20% of the population experiences abdominal pain caused by intestinal gas resulting from difficulty digesting complex carbohydrates in beans and certain vegetables. They may find relief from supplements like Beano. While the evidence is still unsettled, some people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may find digestive enzymes helpful for managing their symptoms. Are digestive enzyme supplements safe? Digestive enzyme supplements are generally safe for most people, but there are a few important considerations. For example, Beano may cause allergic reactions in people with alpha-gal syndrome or mold allergies. Those with galactosemia, a metabolic disorder that causes an inability to metabolize the sugar galactose, should consult their doctor before using Beano. Pregnant and breastfeeding women and young children should check with their doctor before using a lactase product like Lactaid. Finally, as is the case with all OTC supplements, digestive enzyme supplements are not regulated by the FDA. As a result, the quality and content of these products can vary. This means you can't always be sure about the ingredients or enzyme concentration in these supplements. Prescription enzyme medications, on the other hand, are tightly regulated.",1,0.40623456,-0.019503728,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/celiac-disease-exploring-four-myths-202411063079,Celiac disease: Exploring four myths,1,"Celiac disease is a digestive and immune disorder that can keep the body from absorbing necessary nutrients. ""Our conception and awareness of celiac disease has evolved over the past few decades, but there are still aspects that remain poorly understood,"" says Dr. Ciaran Kelly, medical director of the Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Perhaps not surprisingly, misconceptions are widespread among the general public. One example? Many people assume that everyone who has celiac disease is plagued by abdominal pain, bloating, or diarrhea. But actually, many adults newly diagnosed with this inherited gluten intolerance don't have these symptoms. What's more, gluten — the sticky protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye — can cause gastrointestinal distress and other symptoms in people who don't have celiac disease. Read on for a deeper dive into four myths and facts about celiac disease and related digestive conditions. Myth # 1: Celiac disease is usually diagnosed at a young age Not typically. While celiac disease can develop any time after a baby's first exposure to gluten, it's usually diagnosed much later in life. According to the National Celiac Association, the average age of diagnosis is between 46 and 56. Around 25% of people are diagnosed after age 60. Celiac disease is slightly more common in women and among people with other autoimmune conditions, including type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (a common cause of low thyroid levels), and dermatitis herpetiformis (a rare condition marked by an itchy, blistering rash). ""We don't know why some people go from being susceptible to actually having celiac disease,"" says Dr. Kelly. The prevailing theory is that some sort of physical or emotional stress — such as a viral infection, surgery, or anxiety from a stressful life event — may ""flip the switch"" and cause the disease to appear, he says. ""Increasing numbers of people are being diagnosed at midlife and older, often after they're found to have conditions such as anemia or osteoporosis caused by nutrient deficiencies,"" says Dr. Kelly. Myth #2: Celiac disease only affects the gut When people have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune system attack that can ravage the lining of the small intestine. A healthy small intestine is lined with fingerlike projections, called villi, that absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the immune system attacks the villi, causing them to flatten and become inflamed — and thus unable to adequately absorb nutrients. While gastrointestinal problems can occur, they aren't always present. In fact, celiac disease can present with many different symptoms that affect the nervous, endocrine, and skeletal systems. A few examples are brain fog, changes in menstrual periods, or muscle and joint pain. Myth # 3: Celiac disease versus gluten intolerance If you feel sick after eating gluten, you probably have celiac disease, right? Actually, that may not be true. Some people have non-celiac gluten sensitivity (also called gluten intolerance), which can cause uncomfortable digestive symptoms after eating gluten. But gluten intolerance differs from celiac disease. Celiac disease is diagnosed with blood tests that look for specific antibodies. If antibodies are present, a definitive diagnosis requires an intestinal biopsy to look for signs of damage that characterize the condition. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not trigger antibodies or cause intestinal damage. Yet some people with this problem say they also experience brain fog, trouble concentrating, muscle aches and pain, and fatigue after eating gluten-containing foods. ""Non-celiac gluten sensitivity appears to be a real phenomenon, but it's not well defined,"" says Dr. Kelly. It's unclear whether people experiencing it are intolerant to gluten or to something else in gluten-containing foods. One possibility is sugarlike molecules known as FODMAPs, which are found in many foods — including wheat. Short for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, gas and bloating can occur when gut bacteria feed on FODMAPs. Another possibility is an allergy to wheat, which can cause symptoms such as swelling, itching, or irritation of the mouth and throat after eating wheat. Other symptoms include a skin rash, stuffy nose, and headache, as well as cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Some people may develop a life-threating allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. Myth #4: A gluten-free diet always relieves the symptoms and signs of celiac disease The sole treatment for celiac disease — adopting a diet that avoids all gluten-containing foods — doesn't always help. This problem is known as nonresponsive celiac disease. ""About 20% of people with celiac disease have ongoing symptoms, despite their best efforts to stick to a gluten-free diet,"" says Dr. Kelly. Others have intermittent signs and symptoms, particularly when they are accidentally exposed to gluten. Accidental exposures often happen when people eat prepared or restaurant foods that claim to be gluten-free but are not. Cross contamination with gluten-containing foods is another potential route. Potential solutions to nonresponsive celiac disease are being studied. Three promising approaches are: Enzymes that break down gluten, which people could take alongside gluten-containing foods. ""It's a similar concept to the lactase pills taken by people who are lactose intolerant to help them digest dairy products,"" says Dr. Kelly. Dampening the immune response to gluten by inhibiting an enzyme called tissue transglutaminase that makes gluten more potent as an antigen. Reprogramming the immune response to prevent the body from reacting to gluten.",1,0.23836663,0.024918541,True

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-13-emails-nytimes-mask-promoting-activist-manipulated-cochrane-review.html,"Emails reveal New York Times mask-promoting activist manipulated and misrepresented the Cochrane Review, which originally found masks useless",0,"Journalist Paul D. Thacker recently exposed corruption at the New York Times . An activist named Zeynep Tufekci misrepresented scientific findings on masks by the Cochrane Review , a prestigious medical journal, Thacker reveals. The investigation is based on hundreds of emails obtained through Freedom of Information requests and leaks from within Cochrane itself. According to internal emails from Cochrane, the New York Times mask propagandist and social media influencer -- Zeynep Tufekci -- pressured Cochrane to publicly criticize its own review showing that masks fail to stop respiratory viruses. This investigation raises significant concerns about the intersection of social media influence and scientific integrity. Thacker’s UnHerd article, titled "" How the NYT Undermined Mask Evidence: Leaked Emails Reveal How Scientists Were Smeared ,"" uncovers a troubling pattern of interference involving Tufekci, Cochrane and the broader scientific community. NYT mask propagandists exposed, manipulating scientific findings and twisting approver’s words In March 2023, Tufekci published an essay asserting that masks are effective against respiratory viruses, while attacking a mask use review by Cochrane. This came in the wake of Cochrane’s February 2023 review on masks , which found scant evidence supporting the efficacy of masks in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses. The review, considered the gold standard in medical evidence, has been consistently critical of masks in prior editions dating back to 2007. However, Tufekci pressured the publisher into an interview, where she twisted the words of those involved with the review and approval process, while misrepresenting their findings. Outside observers picked apart Tufekci’s New York Times op-ed, noting a disconnect between her claims and the established scientific consensus. Tufekci contacted Cochrane’s Michael Brown, who was involved in the review’s approval process, shortly after the publication of a New York Times op-ed critical of mask mandates. The emails suggest that Tufekci misrepresented Brown’s views , citing him as supportive of her arguments while ignoring his actual stance on the review. The emails indicate that Tufekci not only sought to discredit the Cochrane review but also manipulated scientific opinions to bolster her mask mandate narrative. For instance, Brown’s comments were twisted to imply a stronger endorsement of mask efficacy than what he actually provided. Additionally, Tufekci’s communications with Cochrane’s Karla Soares-Weiser, who oversees the review, led to a rushed statement from Soares-Weiser promising revisions to the review — a move that Brown and other scientists argue was driven by media pressure rather than scientific evidence. The situation escalated when Soares-Weiser’s statement about correcting the review was later retracted, as it became clear that no substantive changes would be made. As Thacker points out, Tufekci’s pressure and influence contributed to a public relations crisis rather than a genuine scientific re-assessment. This controversy highlights a broader issue of how major news publications and influential voices on social media can impact scientific discourse and public health policy. This investigation highlights how opinion-driven journalism shapes scientific debates , disregarding evidence-based analysis, manipulating public discourse and behavior. Tufekci’s rise to fame was generated by social media hysteria and corporate media pressure Masks were first used by physicians nearly a hundred years ago, but they were used to stop the spread of bacteria during surgery. Bacteria are hundreds of times larger than viruses and can be blocked by masks. However, respiratory viruses are ubiquitous in nature and readily spread through masks. The World Health Organization, prior to their complicity in spreading propaganda during the COVID-19 scandal, ruled in 2019, as part of their "" pandemic preparedness plan "" There have been a number of high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating that personal protective measures such as hand hygiene and face masks have, at best, a small effect on influenza transmission. The researchers who worked on the Cochrane review originally agreed that masks were useless against COVID-19 . However, science, reality, common sense, personal autonomy, medical prudence and human rights have not mattered since 2020 -- when hysteria, propaganda, totalitarianism and corruption merged into a new orthodoxy. Masks are nothing but a sign of compliance to this belief system of hysteria, fraud and abuse. Tufekci’s rise to mask mandate fame occurred in March 2020, when a New York Times media reporter promoted Tufekci’s opinion piece, which generated a tweetstorm and pressured the CDC to alter their federal guidance, mandating people to mask up. In the end, national policy supporting useless medical mandates was established by tweets and a hysterical essay, without any input from scientists or a medical review process. The ensuring mask mandates went on to harm schoolchildren and would lead to abuse and mass harm to people’s immune systems, with no evidence that they prevented a single respiratory illness. Anyone who refused to comply with the insanity was accused of ""spreading covid"" and ""misinformation."" The people who rightfully fought for medical freedom and sanity faced intimidation throughout society and sometimes were segregated from society and wrongfully detained. But those who opposed the mask mandates and stood up for body autonomy were always in the right, and the science is there to prove what was obvious from the start.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cant-shake-that-cough,Can't shake that cough?,1,"Dry. Hacking. Loose. Deep. Phlegmy. Barking. Chesty. A cough can sound like any of these descriptors — often more than one at the same time — and these characteristics can sometimes point toward its cause. Now add another: lingering. What does that tell us? Not as much as we might hope, a Harvard expert says. A natural reflex that helps keep our airways clear, the average cough — typically due to a cold or another respiratory virus — lasts three weeks or less, says Dr. Jessica McCannon, a pulmonary critical care specialist with Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham. When a cough endures for eight weeks or more, it's considered chronic. Only rarely is this dangerous, but it certainly can be mystifying. ""When people come to a lung doctor for a chronic cough, they usually hope that at the end of the first visit they'll leave with an answer and some medication and will quickly feel better,"" Dr. McCannon says. ""But of all the things we care for, it's one of the most difficult. And if we don't talk about that up front, I think people will have ongoing frustration and disappointment."" Many possible culprits Indeed, be prepared for a detective hunt. Many chronic coughs have more than one contributor, so doctors don't just look to the airway or lungs to unearth the cause. ""Often we're thinking top to bottom — about the sinuses, swallow function, and esophagus and stomach in addition to the airways and lungs themselves,"" Dr. McCannon says. More than a dozen conditions or situations can explain a lingering cough, including sinus problems, such as sinusitis bronchitis seasonal allergies gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) side effects from medications, such as ACE inhibitors to treat high blood pressure. But only a handful of chronic cough triggers are serious, such as asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) interstitial lung disease, a progressive condition involving coughing and breathlessness chronic lung infections bronchiectasis, chronic inflammation of the tubes leading to the lungs lung cancer. Occasionally, chronic coughs arise from ""very weird causes"" such as impacted earwax, Dr. McCannon points out. And sometimes the culprit is all too clear: smoking — whether tobacco, marijuana, or vaping. ""Basically, anything going into the lungs that shouldn't be there will potentially cause a cough."" Seeking a diagnosis It's reasonable to try over-the-counter medications to quell your cough. The choice depends on the apparent cause of the cough, so you might take cough suppressants, antihistamines if you think it may be allergies, or antacids for acid reflux as a possibility. But if they don't make a dent, Dr. McCannon says, it's time to see a health care professional. ""Tell your doctor what's worked and what hasn't. That can give us some clues,"" she says. Certain red flags make a doctor's visit more pressing. Schedule an appointment (or a follow-up) if your lingering cough doesn't resolve after treatment with antibiotics or if you also experience breathlessness; wheezing; chest pain, pressure, or tightness; blood in your sputum; weight loss; or fatigue. ""A lingering cough with any of those things should lead you to seek care soon,"" Dr. McCannon says. Getting to the bottom of things will likely involve a physical exam, x-rays, or lung function testing. Your doctor may order CT imaging as well, ""although that's certainly not necessary at the threshold of three months unless there are other warning signs,"" she says. To make your doctor's visit more fruitful, Dr. McCannon suggests one important strategy: track your cough. ""Note its patterns. What circumstances bring it on? Is it productive or dry? Is it worse after meals, or when you're lying down? Does it intrude on sleep?"" she asks. ""Paying attention to the circumstances in which you notice it can provide us with some really helpful clues."" Image: © JGalione/Getty Images",0,-0.003938999,0.089219466,True

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/an-easy-hiit-home-workout-for-older-adults,An easy HIIT home workout for older adults,1,"High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been one of the most popular fitness trends for over a decade. It's no wonder. HIIT workouts efficiently boost cardiovascular health, improve metabolism, and burn fat. Despite what you may think, you can enjoy the benefits of a HIIT workout even if you are older or haven't exercised in a while. The key is to start with shorter and lower-intensity intervals, focus on proper form, and gradually progress to suit your fitness level and physical abilities. Try this sample HIIT workout at home to see if HIIT is a fit for you. Sample HIIT workout for older adults If you'd like to try a HIIT workout, this routine is a great way to start. It requires no equipment, and you can easily modify the intensity of each HIIT exercise. HIIT alternates intervals of high-intensity exercise with periods of recovery. To create a HIIT workout from the exercises below, do each exercise for 30 to 60 seconds. Then march in place for 30 to 60 seconds to recover before moving on to the next exercise. You can always march in place for longer if you're not ready to push yourself again. Repeat this pattern, gradually working up to a 30-minute workout. As you're getting started, do only as much as you can do while maintaining good form. HIIT workouts should never be painful or so draining that you can't finish the intervals. A note on terminology: In the following exercises, ""tempo"" tells you the time to allot to each of the key movements in an exercise. For example, a 3–1–3 tempo means you should count to 3 as you do the first part of the exercise, hold the new position for a count of 1, and return to the starting position as you count to 3. Faster-paced cardio moves often have a tempo that looks like 1–1–1–1–1, meaning one count for each portion of the exercise. Warm up As with any exercise, begin with a dynamic warmup. This can be as simple as a 10-minute walk or easy pedaling on a stationary bike. Try to warm up the muscle groups you'll be using during the workout. Moving squat with arm sweep Stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Keep your shoulders back and down at all times. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Step out to the right, bending your knees and hips, and lowering into a squat as you sweep your arms out to the sides and up overhead. Keep your knees no farther forward than your toes as you squat. Don't let your shoulders come up toward your ears as you raise your arms. Straighten your legs, bringing your left foot next to your right and your arms down to your sides as you return to the starting position, but to the right of where you started. Repeat, stepping to the right two or three more times, depending upon the amount of space you have. Reverse, stepping to the left. Repeat this sequence for 30 to 60 seconds. To make this exercise easier: Take smaller steps to the side. Don't squat so low. Keep your hands on your hips. To make this exercise harder: Squat lower, but not below knee height. Move faster while maintaining good form. Side kick Stand up straight with your feet about hip-width apart. Keep your upper body relaxed. Bend your arms so your hands are in front of your chest like a boxer. Make loose fists with your hands. Step forward with your left foot, placing it in front of your right foot. Lean your upper body to the left, raise your right knee out to the side, and then extend your leg, kicking to the side with your foot flexed. Tighten your abdominal muscles and power the move from your gluteal (buttock) muscles. Your knees and toes should be pointing forward as you kick. Bend your right knee, lower your leg, and step back to the starting position. Repeat for half of the 30 to 60 second interval period, and then switch sides, kicking with your left leg for the rest of the interval. The tempo of this interval is 1–1–1–1. To make this exercise easier: Kick lower. You can hold on to the back of a chair for balance if needed. To make this exercise harder: Kick higher. Add a punch with the same-side arm. Plank stand Stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Hinge forward from your hips, bending your knees, and place your hands on the floor. Bend your knees as much as you need to in order to place your hands on the floor. Walk your hands out until your body is in a plank position. Your body should be in line from your head to your heels and your hands directly beneath your shoulders in the plank position. Then walk your hands back toward your feet and roll up to the starting position. Repeat for the duration of the 30 to 60 second interval. The tempo for the interval is 1–4–1–4–1. To make this exercise easier: Start on all fours and walk your hands out to a plank from that position. You can keep your knees on the floor for the easiest variation or raise them off the floor as you move your hands out. To make this exercise harder: While in the plank position, raise and lower each leg, lifting your foot off the floor, before walking your hands back. Tips for preventing injuries To stay safe and prevent injuries during HIIT workouts, keep these tips in mind: Always start with a thorough warm-up to prepare your muscles and joints for the workout. Proper form is essential to avoid strain. Consider working with a trainer or physical therapist to ensure you're doing the movements correctly. Don't jump into high-intensity exercises too quickly. Begin with lower-intensity intervals and gradually increase the intensity as your fitness improves. Allow time for rest and recovery. Don't do more than two or three high-intensity or high-impact workouts per week. Instead, allow rest days between workouts to avoid burnout and injuries.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/midlife-adhd-coping-strategies-that-can-help-202102052381,Midlife ADHD? Coping strategies that can help,1,"Trouble staying focused and paying attention are two familiar symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a common health issue among children and teens. When ADHD persists through early adulthood and on into middle age, it presents many of the same challenges it does in childhood: it's hard to stay organized, start projects, stay on task, and meet deadlines. But now life is busier, and often expectations from work and family are even higher. Fortunately, there are lots of strategies that can help you navigate this time in your life. Staying organized Organizational tools are a must for people with adult ADHD. They'll help you prioritize and track activities for each day or the coming weeks. Pick the right tools. Tools can include a pen and paper to make lists, or computer or smartphone apps to set appointment reminders, highlight important days on the calendar, mark deadlines, and keep lists and other information handy. Schedule updates. Set aside time each day to update your lists and schedules. Don't let the task become a chore in itself; think of it like a routine task such as brushing your teeth, and do it daily so it becomes an established habit. Set a timer. And a word of caution: smartphones and computers can also turn into a distraction. If you have adult ADHD, you may find yourself spending hours looking at less useful apps or sites. If that's a frequent trap for you, set a timer for each use or keep the phone off or in another room when you are trying to work. Staying focused Just being organized doesn't mean your work will get done. But a few simple approaches can at least make it easier to do the work. Declutter your home and office. Give yourself an appealing work environment and keep important items easily accessible. Reduce distractions. This could mean changing your workstation so it doesn't face a window, moving to a quieter space, or just silencing your smartphone and email alerts. Jot down ideas as they come to you. You may have an ""aha"" moment for one task while you're in the middle of another. That's okay; just write down that thought and get back to it later, after your more pressing work is finished. Meeting deadlines Deadlines pose two big challenges when you have adult ADHD. First, it's hard to start a project, often because you want it to be perfect, or you're intimidated by it so you put it off. Second, when you do start a project, it's very easy to become distracted and leave the task unfinished. How can you avoid these traps? Put off procrastinating. Put procrastination on your to-do list — like a chore — and fool yourself into actually starting your work. Deal with emails, phone calls, or other matters as soon as you can. That way there will be fewer things hanging over your head and overwhelming you later on. Be a clock watcher. Get a watch and get in the habit of using it. The more aware you are of time, the more likely you'll be able to avoid spending too long on a task. Take one thing at a time. Multitasking is overrated for everyone — and it's a nightmare for people with adult ADHD. Focus on completing one task, then move on to the next. Be realistic about your time. This can mean having to say no to new projects or other commitments. Get more help The ideas listed here can help you start coping with adult ADHD, but they may not be enough to help you overcome adult ADHD's challenges. Consider hiring an ADHD coach who can provide more strategies and give you additional tools to cope with your condition. Look for an ADHD coach who is a licensed mental health professional who specializes in treating ADHD, and may also have a certification in ADHD coaching from the ADHD Coaches Organization.",5,0.22166596,-0.1714957,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/narcolepsy-a-to-z,Narcolepsy,1,"What is narcolepsy? Narcolepsy is a disorder that causes sudden episodes of deep sleep. These episodes can occur often and at inappropriate times, for example while a person is talking, eating, or driving. Although sleep episodes can happen at any time, they may be more frequent during periods of inactivity or monotonous, repetitive activity. Narcolepsy usually appears between ages 15 and 30, but the condition can appear earlier or later. Once it appears, narcolepsy is present for life. Men and women are affected equally. About 50% of people with diagnosed narcolepsy have the combination of marked daytime sleepiness and sudden episodes of muscle weakness (called cataplexy). The muscle weakness can be so severe that a person with narcolepsy will collapse to the floor, but not become unconscious. This type of narcolepsy is associated with a shortage of a brain-stimulating protein called orexin (also known as hypocretin). The cause of other types of narcolepsy is unknown. A genetic (inherited) predisposition appears to play a role. People with narcolepsy don't require extra hours of sleep, but they do need daytime naps because they have difficulty staying awake for long periods. During the night, healthy people normally progress through several stages of sleep before entering or leaving the state of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM). During REM sleep, your brain waves resemble those of an awake person, visual dreams occur, and muscle tone is slack. In narcolepsy, the brain-wave pattern can skip some or all of the other sleep stages, causing the person to move from the awake state immediately to REM sleep, or to awaken directly from the REM sleep stage. Symptoms of narcolepsy The earliest symptom of narcolepsy is usually daytime sleepiness, which may be extreme. However, it may take years to recognize the disorder because other, more common causes of daytime sleepiness often are blamed for the symptoms. Narcolepsy has four main symptoms. It is common for people with narcolepsy to have more than one symptom, but it is rare for a person with the disease to experience all four: Excessive daytime sleepiness — This is always present and is usually the most prominent symptom. Cataplexy — This is the sudden, temporary loss of muscle tone, which causes paralysis of the head or body while the person remains conscious. It can last a few seconds or several minutes. Mild attacks can cause slurred or stuttering speech, drooping eyelids or hand weakness that causes the person to drop objects. Severe attacks can cause the knees to buckle, leading to collapse. Typically, cataplexy is brought on by laughter, excitement or anger. The sudden relaxing of muscle tone is probably the result of the brain abruptly entering REM sleep. Sleep paralysis — This is the temporary inability to move while falling asleep or awakening. It lasts no more than several minutes. Like cataplexy, sleep paralysis probably is related to insufficient separation between REM sleep and the awake state. Hypnagogic hallucinations — These are dreamlike images that are seen during the awake state instead of during sleep. These often-frightening visions are seen just as the person is falling asleep or waking up. They tend to occur in people who also have sleep paralysis. Symptoms usually begin during adolescence or young adulthood. People with narcolepsy complain of fatigue, experience impaired performance at work and school, and may have difficulty in social relationships. Excessive daytime sleepiness can be disabling and may greatly diminish a person's quality of life. Memory lapses and visual disturbances may be particularly upsetting. More than 50% of people with narcolepsy experience periods of memory lapse or blackouts caused by very short periods of sleep called microsleeps. Microsleeps are not unique to people with narcolepsy, and they can be experienced by anyone who is severely sleep deprived. They are periods of sleep that last only a few seconds, and usually are not noticed. During such episodes, a person may get lost while walking or driving, write or speak nonsense, misplace objects, or bump into things. Later in the course of narcolepsy, a person also can develop insomnia (difficulty sleeping) during normal sleeping hours. Diagnosing narcolepsy To diagnose narcolepsy, your doctor will ask you about your history of typical episodes and will have you undergo an overnight sleep study. The sleep study checks for other explanations that could account for daytime sleepiness, such as sleep apnea or other causes of sleep interruptions. The sleep test measures brain waves, eye movements, muscle activity, heartbeat, blood oxygen levels, and breathing. A specific study called a multiple sleep latency test is a necessary part of the evaluation for narcolepsy. This test must be done after the person has had an adequate night's sleep. A multiple sleep latency test consists of four 20-minute opportunities to nap, which are offered every two hours throughout the day. Patients with narcolepsy fall asleep in approximately five minutes or less, and move into REM sleep during at least two of the four naps. Normal, well-rested sleepers take about 12 to 14 minutes to fall asleep for a daytime nap, and don't fall directly into REM sleep. Expected duration of narcolepsy Narcolepsy cannot be cured and does not go away. In most cases, symptoms can be diminished with medications, regularly scheduled naps, and good sleep habits. Preventing narcolepsy There is no way to prevent narcolepsy. For people who have the condition, avoiding conditions that bring on narcolepsy episodes may help to reduce their frequency. If you have narcolepsy and your symptoms are not controlled with medicines, you should never smoke because you could fall asleep with a lit cigarette, and you should never drive. Treating narcolepsy The main symptom of narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness, can be partially relieved with medications that stimulate the central nervous system. Doctors often prescribe a trial of modafinil (Provigil) first. Other potential choices include armodafinil (Nuvigil), pitolisant (Wakix), or solriamfetol (Sunosi). regularly scheduled time for exercise and short naps during the day also helps reduce daytime sleepiness. Cataplexy and sleep paralysis can be treated with a variety of medicines that can make you more resistant to entering REM sleep. Most of these medicines were developed for use as antidepressants. Examples of potentially effective medications include venlafaxine (Effexor), fluoxetine (Prozac), and protriptyline (Vivactil). Cataplexy also can be treated with sodium oxybate (also called gamma hydroxybutyrate or Xyrem), although the use of this drug is tightly controlled because it has been abused recreationally. For reasons that are not well understood, a low dose of this medicine reduces cataplexy attacks and improves daytime sleepiness in people who have narcolepsy with cataplexy, even though the drug causes sedation in most people without narcolepsy. Psychological counseling may be important for difficulties associated with self-esteem and for emotional support, especially since people with narcolepsy have difficulty doing tasks that require concentration, and may be regarded as unmotivated by family and peers. When to call a professional Call a doctor if you are excessively sleepy during the day. You should be evaluated as quickly as possible if episodes occur while you are driving a car or operating machinery. Prognosis People with narcolepsy have a significantly higher risk of death or serious injury resulting from motor vehicle or job-related accidents, and they must take care to avoid situations where such accidents might occur.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/giardiasis-a-to-z,Giardiasis,1,"What is giardiasis? Giardiasis is an intestinal illness caused by infection with the parasite Giardia lamblia, which lives in contaminated water. Although the illness most often occurs in developing countries, giardiasis is also a common cause of waterborne illness in the United States. A person can remain infected with Giardia until the infection is diagnosed and treated. In developing areas of the world, it is common for more than 20% of a country's population to have ongoing Giardia infection. In the United States, only one or two out of every 10,000 people have Giardia in a typical year, but the infection is found in about one out of three people who have prolonged diarrhea symptoms if they have recently traveled to a developing country. As one part of their life cycle, G. lamblia parasites change into cysts. Contagious cysts are found in the feces of infected people or animals. You can become infected with G. lamblia by: drinking water that has been contaminated with Giardia cysts (usually because the water has come into contact with sewage) eating uncooked fruits or vegetables that have been washed in contaminated water eating uncooked fruits or vegetables from a garden where contaminated fertilizer has been used touching feces, diapers, or objects soiled with feces, then failing to adequately wash your hands having direct contact with an infected person or animal, then failing to adequately wash your hands. G. lamblia can survive in cold, chlorinated water for up to two months, and outbreaks have occurred in municipal water supplies. People at greatest risk of giardiasis include: children in day care centers and their families day care workers travelers to developing countries campers who drink unprocessed water homosexual men (because of anal sex). Children are three times more likely to develop giardiasis than adults. It is possible that the human body develops some immunity to the parasite over time. Symptoms of giardiasis Up to two-thirds of people infected with the organism do not have any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can appear suddenly and be obvious or they may worsen slowly. Typically, symptoms start one to three weeks after exposure and include: watery diarrhea abdominal cramping bloating nausea with or without vomiting gas floating or unusually smelly stools weight loss new intolerance to milk and dairy foods in your diet low-grade fever loss of appetite. Some of the symptoms can take several months or more to begin because they are caused by gradual changes in the lining of your intestine. G. lamblia interferes with the body's ability to absorb fats, so your stools may have more fat in them during a Giardia infection. This is why your stools may float and smell foul. Diagnosing giardiasis Your doctor will ask you about your travel history, whether you might have had contact with contaminated water during camping or hiking, and whether your home has well water. If the patient is a child who attends day care, the doctor will ask about any recent outbreaks of diarrhea at the day care center. He or she also will review the patient's symptoms. The diagnosis is made by testing the stool for Giardia antigen, a protein that is made by G. lamblia parasites, or by identifying G. lamblia cysts or parasites in stool samples. Multiple stool samples may need to be collected since the infection can only be detected in a portion of collected stool samples, even if infection is present. Infrequently, diagnosis may require an inspection of the intestine with a procedure called endoscopy. In this procedure, an instrument called an endoscope is inserted through your mouth into your intestine. An endoscope is a narrow, flexible, cord-shaped instrument that is equipped with a camera. If necessary, your doctor can use the endoscope to take a small piece of tissue from your small intestine (a biopsy) to be examined in a laboratory. Expected duration of giardiasis The worst symptoms of giardiasis typically last for five to seven days, as long as diagnosis and treatment is not delayed. Symptoms can take as long as several months to completely go away after treatment because the intestine needs to repair itself. It is common to be intolerant to milk and other dairy products that contain lactose for the first few months after a Giardia infection. In some people who are not treated, the infection can cause repeated bouts of abdominal pain and diarrhea for a year or longer. Preventing giardiasis There is no vaccine that can prevent giardiasis. Medicine to prevent infection is not recommended. The best way to prevent infection is good travel habits and good sanitation. Travelers should take special care to avoid food and water that could be contaminated. It is safest to eat produce that has been peeled or cooked. Cooking kills Giardia parasites and cysts. To prevent giardiasis caused by contaminated water, drink water only from approved sources. When camping and when traveling to developing countries, drink bottled water or other beverages that have been bottled or canned. Campers can drink bottled water, treat water with iodine for eight or more hours, use a high-quality water filter or boil water for at least one minute. Travelers to developing countries should avoid drinking beverages that are served with ice. It is always a good habit to wash your hands frequently. This can reduce your risk of Giardia infection at home and while traveling. It is especially important to wash your hands after you use the bathroom, before you eat, after you change a diaper and after you care for a sick person or animal. Treating giardiasis If you don't receive treatment for a Giardia infection, you will probably eventually recover on your own. However, treatment is a good idea for anyone who is having symptoms. Treatment can also help if you don't have symptoms because treatment can prevent the spread of infection to others. This is especially true for children and for people who prepare or serve food. Commonly prescribed medications used to treat Giardia infection include tinidazole (Tindamax), nitazoxanide (Alinia), and metronidazole (Flagyl). A doctor should examine and consider treatment for sexual partners and people who have had close contact with the infected person, such as household members, even if they have no symptoms. Pregnant women generally are not treated with medications during the first trimester. If you have giardiasis, be sure to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Over-the-counter medications for diarrhea, such as loperamide (Imodium), may help your symptoms. Wash your hands frequently if you have giardiasis or if you are caring for a person or animal with this infection. When to call a professional See your doctor if you get diarrhea, especially if this diarrhea lasts for longer than several days, produces stools that float and smell foul, or if you also have abdominal cramps, bloating and fever. Prognosis In otherwise healthy people, giardiasis generally goes away completely within weeks, with or without treatment. In some cases, Giardia can be a long-term problem if it is not treated.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs-a-to-z,Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),1,"What is IBS? Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that causes a variety of symptoms, including: abdominal pain diarrhea and/or constipation bloating gassiness cramping. The severity of the disorder varies from person to person. Some people experience symptoms that come and go and are just mildly annoying. Others have such severe daily bowel problems that IBS affects their ability to work, sleep, and enjoy life. In addition, symptoms may change over time. A person may have severe symptoms for several weeks and then feel well for months or even years. Most people are never cured of IBS. However, the disorder is not related to any other disease. It does not develop into colitis. People with IBS do not have an increased risk of colon cancer. IBS usually starts in early adulthood. It affects twice as many women as men. Approximately 10% to 20% of the population has IBS, but half of all people with the condition never seek medical care for their symptoms. No one knows what causes IBS. Some studies suggest that the nerves of the colon may be much more sensitive than usual in people with IBS. The normal movement of food and gas through the colon causes pain, intestinal spasms, and an irregular pattern of bowel movements. Stress does not cause IBS, but stress can increase the frequency and severity of symptoms. IBS has been called irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis, and functional bowel disease. Symptoms of IBS People with IBS may have some or all of these symptoms: mild or severe abdominal pain, discomfort, or cramping that usually goes away after a bowel movement periods of diarrhea or constipation, or alternating between these two symptoms bloating, gassiness, or a feeling of having a distended abdomen mucus in bowel movements feeling as though a bowel movement is incomplete. Although the symptoms of IBS often change over time, people tend to develop their own pattern. For example, some people have mostly diarrhea, some have mostly constipation, and others have abdominal pain without a major change in bowel movements. Diagnosing IBS There is no test for IBS. Your doctor will diagnose IBS if you have the typical symptoms and have been tested for other disorders that can cause similar symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms. Your doctor will examine you, testing your abdomen for tenderness and feeling to determine whether internal organs are larger than normal. The doctor will check for fever or weight loss. If you have any of these signs, you likely have something other than IBS. Depending on your medical history, your doctor may do tests to eliminate other diseases that may cause similar symptoms. These tests might include: blood tests stool sample, to check for blood or evidence of infection sigmoidoscopy, in which a flexible, lighted tube with a tiny camera on the end is inserted into the rectum and up the left side of the colon colonoscopy, in which a longer tube examines the entire colon. Your doctor may suggest that you stop eating or drinking certain foods for up to three weeks to determine if your diet is contributing to your symptoms. For example, your doctor may ask you to eliminate milk products if he or she suspects lactose intolerance. Expected duration of IBS IBS symptoms may be a daily problem throughout a person's life. Symptoms may come and go, lasting a day, a week, or a month before disappearing. Dietary changes with or without medication may help to reduce the frequency or severity of symptoms. Preventing IBS Because no one knows what causes IBS, it is impossible to prevent the disorder. Once diagnosed with IBS, a person may be able to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms by reducing stress or changing the diet. Treating IBS Changing your diet may improve symptoms dramatically. It often takes a long time to discover what works well for you, and you may need to alter your original program if symptoms flare. Keep track of the different foods you eat throughout the day. See which foods seem to make your symptoms worse. After you discover your particular trigger foods, eliminate them from your diet. Some common IBS trigger foods include: cabbage, broccoli, kale, legumes, and other gas-producing foods caffeine alcohol dairy products fatty foods, including whole milk, cream, cheese, butter, oils, meats, and avocados raw fruits foods, gums, and beverages that contain sorbitol, an artificial sweetener. The way you eat may help to create IBS symptoms. Eating large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea, so eating smaller meals more often may help some people with IBS. Eating quickly can cause you to swallow air, which can cause belching or gas. Adding fiber to your diet, especially if constipation is one of your main symptoms, often helps to regulate your bowel movements and reduce abdominal discomfort. At first, fiber will increase the amount of gas in your system, so add fiber gradually. Over time, the body adjusts to the effects of fiber and the gassiness will decrease. Fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain breads and cereals are good food sources of fiber. Your doctor may recommend a fiber supplement. Some experts believe that the fiber methylcellulose creates the least amount of gas, and brands of this fiber are often recommended for people with IBS. Psyllium is also a good source of fiber. A low-FODMAP diet helps relieve symptoms for many people with IBS. You need to review a list of foods that have a high amount of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, and reduce their intake. If your symptoms are not relieved after you eliminate trigger foods and add fiber, your doctor may prescribe medications. For people that have frequent loose stools (diarrhea-predominant IBS), medication options include: antidiarrheals — loperamide (Imodium), diphenoxylate (Lomotil and other brand names) antispasmodics to reduce cramping — dicyclomine (Bentyl) pain-reducing agents — amitriptyline (Elavil), desipramine (Norpramin) alosetron (Lotronex) is approved only for women with severe diarrhea-predominant IBS who have very severe diarrhea and have not responded to other treatments. To receive this drug, you must sign a form stating that you are aware of life-threatening complications, such as a blocked, ruptured, or damaged bowel. For people with constipation-predominant IBS, fiber and plenty of fluids are the mainstays of therapy. If medication is needed, your doctor may prescribe an osmotic laxative such as lactulose. Other drugs available for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome include: lubiprostone (Amitiza), which is approved for women with persistent constipation linaclotide (LINZESS) and plecanatide (Trulance), which are approved for adults age 18 and older. Both drugs act on the cells that line the inside of the intestines. They promote increased fluid secretion into the intestine, making stool passage easier. Stress reduction through mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other practices, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can be extremely helpful. When to call a professional It is useful for anyone with irritable bowel symptoms to discuss their symptoms with a doctor, so that diet, fiber, stress reduction, and drug treatment strategies can be planned. After you have been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, contact your doctor if you have: an episode of severe symptoms unexplained weight loss or fever blood in your stool abdominal pain that is accompanied by vomiting, dizziness, or fainting abdominal pain or diarrhea that awakens you from sleep. Prognosis There is no cure for IBS. But most people can lessen the symptoms by making dietary changes, reducing stress, and — if necessary — taking medication.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/diverticulosis-and-diverticulitis-a-to-z,Diverticulosis and diverticulitis,1,"What are diverticulosis and diverticulitis? In diverticulosis, small pouches develop and bulge out through weak spots in the walls of the colon, typically in the part of the colon called the sigmoid colon on the left side of the abdomen. These small, balloon-like pouches are called diverticula. The condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States ages 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men. If the diverticula become inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can lead to serious complications such as abscess, perforation, intestinal blockage from internal scarring, or fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two organs. A rare but life-threatening complication called peritonitis can occur when diverticula rupture, leaking infection into the abdominal cavity. Symptoms of diverticulosis and diverticulitis Most people who have diverticulosis don't have any symptoms, but some have mild cramps, constipation, or bloating. Diverticulitis causes more severe symptoms, including any of the following, but particularly the first two: steady abdominal pain tenderness to pressure in the lower abdomen, especially on the left side fever nausea vomiting chills cramping change in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea) sharper pain with breathing or jarring movements such as walking. Lower intestinal bleeding can occur in people with diverticulosis. The loss of blood can cause weakness and dizziness. Diagnosing diverticulosis and diverticulitis The condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States aged 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men. However, unless you have had a colonoscopy, CT scan of your abdomen, or barium enema, you would not be aware they exist. On the other hand, diverticulitis almost always causes symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your medical history, bowel habits, and diet and will conduct a physical examination. Your doctor will press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. Based on the location of your symptoms and the location of abdominal pain and tenderness, your doctor may be able to make the diagnosis without further testing. If your doctor is unsure or concerned that you may have an abscess or other complication, he or she will likely order additional studies. These usually include blood tests for signs of infection and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. Lower intestinal bleeding is commonly caused by a broken blood vessel within a diverticula. But it is often very difficult to identify the exact bleeding site, even with colonoscopy. Expected duration of diverticulosis and diverticulitis Diverticula do not disappear unless the section of colon is removed surgically. Diverticulosis is a lifelong condition that can be managed, primarily with adjustments in diet. Symptoms of diverticulitis or bleeding from diverticulosis may subside within a few days after treatment, may continue, or may get worse in the case of severe illness or complications. Preventing diverticulosis and diverticulitis People whose diets contain large amounts of fiber are less likely to develop diverticular disease. The recommended daily fiber intake is at least 20 grams per day, but a healthier goal is 35 grams of fiber daily, preferably from fruits, vegetables, and grains. Your doctor also may recommend unprocessed bran or a fiber product. It is important to increase fiber intake gradually and to drink more water to increase the bulk of the bowel movements, which reduces pressure inside the bowel. Physical activity also may lower the risk of diverticulosis. Many doctors previously recommended that people with diverticulosis avoid eating nuts, popcorn, and foods with seeds. This restriction has not been proven to prevent diverticulitis. Treating diverticulosis and diverticulitis The only possible treatment for diverticulosis is to increase fiber in the diet. Fiber will not heal existing diverticula, but it may prevent more from forming. If you have symptoms of mild diverticulitis, your doctor may recommend a short period of observation without antibiotics. There are no specific dietary recommendations, but many doctors suggest a low-fiber diet until symptoms resolve. If the diagnosis is uncertain, an abdominal CT scan is usually ordered. Depending on the results, your doctor can then decide if treatment at home with oral antibiotics versus intravenous (IV) antibiotics, either at home or in the hospital. If fever and pain continues, you may be developing complicated diverticulitis, For example, an abscess can develop when a diverticulum becomes perforated (develops a hole). An abscess is a collection of pus. A surgeon then will help your doctor plan the next step: drainage or surgery. The choice depends on the extent of the problem and your overall health. Drainage means that the surgeon cleans out the pus. Surgery also may be required during the hospital stay to treat a particularly severe episode of diverticulitis. Emergency surgery is required if the abscess breaks open and causes peritonitis, the most serious potential complication of diverticulitis. Peritonitis requires surgical repair as well as intravenous antibiotics. For persistent or recurrent bleeding from diverticulosis, surgery may be the only option. The most common procedure, known as a colon resection, involves removing the part of the colon that contains the bleeding diverticula and reattaching the ends. When done during emergencies, a colon resection is often done as a two-stage process. First, a section of colon is removed, but because of infection, it is not safe to rejoin the ends. Instead, the surgeon creates a temporary hole, or stoma, in the abdomen and connects the colon to it, a procedure called a colostomy. A bag is attached to collect the stool. Later, a second operation is done to reattach the end of the colon, and remove the colostomy. After successful treatment for diverticulitis, your doctor normally will recommend a high-fiber diet. Later, you may need to have a procedure called a colonoscopy, which is an internal examination of the colon. In general, surgery is not recommended after only one or even two attacks without complications. However, it is usually recommended after a third episode occurs in the same location within the colon. Repeated episodes of diverticulitis can lead to internal scarring and narrowing of the colon, which also may require surgery to remove a piece of the colon. When to call a professional Call your doctor if abdominal pain in one spot lasts for longer than a few hours, especially if it becomes worse or is accompanied by fever. Prognosis With proper treatment and a high-fiber diet, the outlook for people with diverticulosis and uncomplicated diverticulitis is excellent. Most people with diverticulosis never have symptoms. People who have diverticulitis usually improve within two to four days after treatment begins. Over 85% of patients recover with bed rest and liquid diet, with or without antibiotics. Most never have a second episode of diverticulitis. The prognosis varies if complications develop and is particularly serious in the case of peritonitis. About 90% of people who have a colon resection do not have symptoms return after the surgery.

With so much going on in daily life, who has time to stop and be present? But everyone has at least 10 minutes to spare to practice mindfulness. The point of these brief, daily reflections is to help you tap into calmness whenever life gets too hairy. Practicing everyday mindfulness can also improve your memory and concentration skills and help you feel less distracted and better able to manage stress . And mindfulness tools have been successfully incorporated into treatments for anxiety and depression. There is more than one way to practice mindfulness. Still, any mindfulness technique aims to achieve a state of alert, focused, relaxed consciousness by deliberately paying attention to thoughts and sensations without passing judgment on them. This allows the mind to focus on the present moment with an attitude of acceptance. Three easy mindfulness exercises to try Here are three simple exercises you can try whenever you need a mental break, emotional lift, or just want to pause and appreciate everything around you. Devote 10 minutes a day to them and see how the experience changes your outlook. It's time well spent. Simple meditation A quick and easy meditation is an excellent place to begin practicing mindfulness. Sit on a straight-backed chair or cross-legged on the floor. Focus on an aspect of your breathing, such as the sensations of air flowing into your nostrils and out of your mouth, or your belly rising and falling as you inhale and exhale. Once you've narrowed your concentration in this way, begin to widen your focus. Become aware of sounds, sensations, and ideas. Embrace and consider each without judgment. If your mind starts to race, return your focus to your breathing. Then expand your awareness again. Take as much time as you like: one minute, or five, or 10 — whatever you're comfortable with. Experts in mindfulness meditation note that the practice is most helpful if you commit to a regular meditation schedule. Open awareness Another approach to mindfulness is ""open awareness,"" which helps you stay in the present and truly participate in specific moments in life. You can choose any task or moment to practice open awareness, such as eating, taking a walk, showering, cooking a meal, or working in the garden. When you are engaged in these and other similar routine activities, follow these steps. Bring your attention to the sensations in your body, both physical and emotional. Breathe in through your nose, allowing the air to fill your lungs. Let your abdomen expand fully. Then breathe out slowly through your mouth. Carry on with the task at hand, slowly and with deliberation. Engage each of your senses, paying close attention to what you can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste. Try ""single-tasking,"" bringing your attention as fully as possible to what you're doing. Allow any thoughts or emotions that arise to come and go, like clouds passing through the sky. If your mind wanders away from your current task, gently refocus your attention back to the sensation of the moment. Body awareness Another way to practice mindfulness is to focus your attention on other thoughts, objects, and sensations. While sitting quietly with your eyes closed, channel your awareness toward each of the following: Sensations: Notice subtle feelings such as an itch or tingling without judgment, and let them pass. Notice each part of your body in succession from head to toe. Sights and sounds: Notice sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. Name them ""sight,"" ""sound,"" ""smell,"" ""taste,"" or ""touch"" without judgment and let them go. Emotions: Allow emotions to be present without judging them. Practice a steady and relaxed naming of emotions: ""joy,"" ""anger,"" ""frustration."" Urges: When you feel a craving or an urge (for instance, to eat excess food or practice an unwanted behavior), acknowledge the desire and understand that it will pass. Notice how your body feels as the craving enters. Replace the wish for the craving to go away with the specific knowledge that it will subside.",5,0.25073224,-0.24250439,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/depressions-cognitive-cost,Depression's cognitive cost,1,"Elaine's memory lapses seemed minor, but they happened often. She frequently forgot where she parked her car or why she walked into a room; reminiscing with a good friend, she could barely remember a wondrous vacation the two had shared in their 40s. Now in her mid-60s — and with a mother with Alzheimer's disease — Elaine fretted that these memory blanks signaled she, too, was developing dementia. But the true culprit was a lot sneakier: longstanding depression. A battery of cognitive tests ruled out dementia, easing Elaine's mind but provoking distress that a condition characterized by persistent sadness and apathy could also steal her ability to recall simple details. ""Few things are as depressing and anxiety-provoking as being aware you're having memory lapses or being afraid you might develop dementia,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School who conducted Elaine's cognitive tests. Inattention a factor An estimated 21 million American adults — roughly 8% — have experienced at least one episode of depression, and women are twice as likely as men to have the condition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Most people associate depression with its hallmark symptoms, which include not only sadness and apathy, but also loss of enjoyment in things that previously brought pleasure, appetite changes, and trouble sleeping. Yet memory is often a casualty as well, with research suggesting that having depression increases a person's risk for memory problems. Depressive symptoms can even speed memory decline in older people, according to a study of 8,200 adults published online June 11, 2024, by JAMA Network Open. Dr. Budson points out that memory glitches common in depressed people are a byproduct of an overstimulated mind. ""I think of these more as attention deficits than memory deficits,"" he says. ""If someone has depression, they always have something on their mind that prevents them from focusing their full attention on where they are and what they're doing."" Indeed, just getting through the day can feel exhausting when you're depressed. But an inability to drum up energy and attention is only one contributor to depression-fueled memory problems, Dr. Budson says. It's believed that depression also alters levels of brain chemicals that help us focus, such as dopamine and norepinephrine. Memory issues may also stem from other depression-related changes in the brain involved in creating, combining, and recalling memories. How dementia is distinct Importantly, however, memory problems show up in depression quite differently than in Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. Someone who's depressed, for example, is likely to have a harder time retrieving long-ago memories — like the camping trip her family took when she was 8 — than remembering what she ate for breakfast that morning. A person with dementia, on the other hand, can typically summon memories from many years ago with ease, but can't recall where she went yesterday. That's because dementia damages the hippocampus, a brain structure in charge of helping us learn new information and retrieving recent memories. We don't need the hippocampus to retrieve older memories, though, which is why people with Alzheimer's have less difficulty recalling their childhood or early adulthood. ""People with Alzheimer's can remember things that happened 20, 30, and 50 years ago quite well, at least in the early stages of the disease, but have great difficulty remembering things that happened that morning or yesterday or last week,"" Dr. Budson says. ""The pattern is almost the exact opposite of what you see in depression."" Positive memories fade first Another curious distinction in depression-related memory problems is how the mood disorder doesn't target all memories in the same way. Often, the first to fade are recollections of happier times — just when that type of boost would be especially welcome. Why? Again, brain biology is the culprit: areas that process positive or rewarding experiences are disrupted in people with depression. Many, if not most, memories are context-dependent, Dr. Budson explains. Case in point: visit the town where you grew up or your old high school, and ""all of a sudden you'll be able to retrieve memories you didn't even know you still had,"" he says. But this type of context-dependent memory retrieval doesn't just involve places—it's also relevant for moods. ""When you're feeling happy, you're more likely to be able to easily retrieve memories of other times when you were feeling happy,"" he explains. ""And when you're depressed, it's easy to retrieve memories of other times when you were feeling depressed, but difficult to retrieve those from when you were feeling happy."" This unlucky phenomenon might make it more difficult to recover from depression, creating a vicious cycle. ""It's hard to remember those happy times — and that you can be happy again,"" Dr. Budson says. ""I don't know if that worsens depression, but it makes it hard to get out of it."" Proactive steps Dr. Budson offers these strategies to lower your risk of depression and protect your memory if you're prone to the mood disorder: Get your heart pumping. Regular aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, biking, or swimming, not only generates feel-happy endorphins, but also increases growth factors in the brain that help produce new cells in the hippocampus. Stay socially engaged. Spending time with friends and family and engaging in social activities may not only stave off depression, but also help ease it. ""Being around people you like and who like you is super-helpful,"" he says. Plan around your triggers. Hard experience may have taught you that certain people, places, or events can trigger your depression to recur. Avoid those situations as much as you can, and consider alternative actions during happier moments, when you have the mental bandwidth to plan ahead. Keep your ""happy people"" on speed dial. Many of us have a special someone — perhaps a friend, relative, or religious adviser — who can lift our spirits on the bleakest days. Reach out to that person if you find yourself in emotional quicksand. To help you remember to do that, add reminders to your phone or calendar. Log your favorite memories. Knowing it's normal to have difficulty summoning up pleasant memories when you're depressed, post a written list of some of your favorites on a bulletin board or refrigerator. ""When you're feeling blue, read the list,"" Dr. Budson says. ""It might just make you smile."" Common infection's dark side: Could it trigger Alzheimer's? Being infected with Helicobacter pylori—a stomach bacterium found in an estimated two-thirds of the world's population—may be linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in adults 50 and older, a new study suggests. Passed from one person to another, H. pylori is often harmless. But it can lead to indigestion, ulcers, and (in rare cases) stomach cancer. Alzheimer's may join that list, according to the study, which was published in the March 2024 issue of Alzheimer's and Dementia. Researchers analyzed medical records spanning nearly three decades from more than 4.2 million people in the United Kingdom ages 50 and up. None of the participants had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's at the study's start. People with a symptomatic H. pylori infection had 11% higher odds of developing Alzheimer's disease over an average follow-up period of 11 years, the study found. The findings are only observational and therefore do not prove that H. pylori causes dementia. But the possibility doesn't surprise Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. ""We've known for more than 10 years that other infections are also associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease,"" he says. How might infections be linked to Alzheimer's? Research increasingly suggests that beta-amyloid—a type of protein involved in Alzheimer's-related brain plaques— is normally deposited in the brain to help it fight off infection, Dr. Budson says. But some people, due to genetic or other factors, aren't able to clear this protein out of the brain after the threat has passed. ""We all make a bit of amyloid during the day, and when we sleep at night, it gets flushed away,"" he says. ""That's why it's important to get a good night's sleep. But over a lifetime, people sometimes generate a little too much amyloid or have trouble clearing it away. When too much of it builds up, that's what leads to Alzheimer's.""

But sometimes people sleep too little, and then try to catch up by sleeping more than usual. However, a study published online June 27, 2024, by the journal Diabetologia found that this kind of erratic sleeping may increase a person's risk for diabetes. Researchers collected health questionnaires from approximately 36,000 adults in their 50s. The information included the average number of hours they slept on weekdays and weekends. The researchers divided sleep patterns into three categories: short (less than seven hours), normal (seven to nine hours), and long (more than nine hours). Next, to show how consistently people slept from night to night, they created nine sleep trajectory combinations — for example, short-short, short-normal, short-long, normal-normal, and normal-short. Five years later, the questionnaires were repeated. The researchers found that people who regularly reported short-long or long-short sleeping patterns — meaning they bounced back and forth from sleeping less than seven hours to longer than nine — had a 50% higher risk for diabetes than people who regularly slept the normal seven to nine hours.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/cognitive-benefits-from-high-intensity-interval-training-may-last-for-years,Cognitive benefits from high-intensity interval training may last for years,1,"Engaging in regular exercise is linked to multiple health benefits, including maintaining cognitive abilities and perhaps reducing the risk of dementia. Results from a study published online July 8, 2024, by Aging and Disease suggest high-intensity interval training (HIIT) may be better for brain health than other, less vigorous routines. HIIT workouts consist of repeated cycles of short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by brief ""recovery"" periods of lower-intensity movement. In the study, researchers enrolled 151 healthy adults, ages 65 to 86, in a six-month exercise program. Participants underwent a battery of tests to assess function in the hippocampus — the brain area associated with learning and memory. Everyone was randomly assigned to do one of three half-hour exercise routines: balance and stretching, brisk walking on a treadmill, or four HIIT cycles on a treadmill. (Each HIIT cycle consisted of four minutes at 85% to 95% of a person's maximum heart rate, followed by three minutes of recovery.) Everyone did approximately 30-minute workouts three days a week for about six months, for a total of 72 sessions. On repeat testing, only the HIIT exercisers showed positive changes in hippocampus functioning compared to their initial evaluation. At a follow-up evaluation five years later, the researchers found that again only the people in the HIIT group retained their improved cognitive function, even if they were no longer doing HIIT.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-intermittent-fasting-help-with-weight-loss,Can intermittent fasting help with weight loss?,1,"Intermittent fasting — the use of a strict eating schedule to help with weight loss — continues to grow in popularity. But can it really help? ""Recent research has found that intermittent fasting has a similar or even modest benefit over traditional calorie-restriction dieting for weight loss,"" says Dr. Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""But perhaps its main advantage is its simplicity, making it easier to follow compared with other weight-loss plans."" Timing your eating Whereas other weight-loss diets emphasize what you should and should not eat, and how much, intermittent fasting focuses on when you can eat. Intermittent fasting means you don't eat for a designated amount of time during the course of the day. There are many ways to do this, but one of the most popular approaches is called 16/8. Here, you do all your eating during an eight-hour period (for example, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and then don't eat at all over the following 16 hours (in this case, from 6 p.m. until 10 a.m. the next day). The pattern then repeats. You can drink plain water, tea, or coffee during the fasting period, and you need to follow regular healthy eating habits during your eight-hour eating window. Short-term studies suggest that people stick to intermittent fasting diets better than low-carb diets. ""The 16/8 schedule is often easier to follow, since you sleep for about half of the fasting period,"" says Dr. Hu. ""You just don't eat after dinner — no nighttime snacking — and either skip or postpone breakfast."" The state of ketosis How might intermittent fasting help with weight loss? Not eating for such a long period can place the body in short-term ketosis, where the body burns fat for energy, according to Dr. Hu. Ketosis is the metabolic process that kicks in when your body runs out of glucose (its preferred energy source) and begins burning stored fat. ""Sixteen hours of not eating is sufficient for some people to start producing ketones or go into ketosis,"" says Dr. Hu. Intermittent fasting has been linked with various health benefits, such as reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as obesity, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Research has also suggested it may be linked to a healthier gut microbiome, with possible improved digestion and protection against infections. Some people who follow intermittent fasting claim it helps increase energy levels, too. Still, the existing evidence of intermediate fasting's benefits is limited, and any long-term benefits or drawbacks are unknown. ""Most studies have not looked at large populations and only explored its effect over several weeks or up to one year,"" says Dr. Hu. Go slow with fasting Should you try intermittent fasting to help with weight loss? There doesn't appear to be much downside, and the approach may help you manage your eating habits, according to Dr. Hu. ""For instance, it could help reduce your daily calories, especially if you're a late-night snacker."" Check with your doctor before trying intermittent fasting, especially if you have diabetes, take blood pressure medication, or tend to get dizzy if you stand up too quickly. ""Low blood sugar levels from not eating for so long could cause problems,"" says Dr. Hu. He suggests aiming for a 16/8 schedule, but take a gradual approach. For instance, first try a 12/12 schedule, where you eat during a 12-hour window and fast for 12 hours. ""Follow this for a few days to get used to the schedule, and then extend the time to 14/10,"" says Dr. Hu. ""When you feel ready, move to 16/8."" Intermittent fasting is not a quick weight-loss solution, so don't expect to immediately see or feel changes. ""It can take a while for the practice to translate to lost pounds,"" says Dr. Hu. ""Generally, people tend to lose about half a pound to one pound per week. Still, slow and steady weight loss is more successful and sustainable over the long term."" Dr. Hu adds that while intermittent fasting may help jump-start weight loss, a healthy eating strategy is necessary for success. ""Any benefit you may gain from fasting won't last if you aren't eating healthy foods, controlling portions, and reducing your intake of snacks and processed foods."" Also, be mindful that intermittent fasting takes discipline, and you must stick with it to see any long-term benefits. ""You can't follow it now and then and expect any significant changes,"" says Dr. Hu. ""But if you get off schedule for a day or two, you haven't negated your efforts. Just pick it up again and keep going. Eventually, you may see intermittent fasting become a part of your everyday life."" Image: © MilosBataveljic/Getty Images",3,0.3830864,-0.032265425,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-08-the-pandemic-vaccine-industry-is-desperate.html,The pandemic-vaccine industry is desperate; for the next “pandemic” they want to use police and even NATO to force vaccinations on people,0,"New Zealand has included enforcing vaccination uptake using law enforcement in its latest version of the country’s pandemic plans published on 12 July. (Article by Rhoda Wilson republished from Expose-News.com ) A week earlier, Gates-funded and World Health Organisation favourite Dr. Peter Hotez suggested that Homeland Security and the Justice Department should be enlisted against “anti-vaxxers” in the US. And internationally, Hotez said, NATO should be deployed against those who refuse to get vaccinated. The image below has been widely shared on social media with the claim that it is proof that the New Zealand government is planning to legalise forced vaccination. Some thought it might be fake or exaggerated. But it is confirmed by a document titled ‘ New Zealand Pandemic Plan: A framework for action ’ (”Plan”) published on 12 July by the New Zealand Ministry of Health. It confirms that people will be forced to be isolated or quarantined until they have undergone the “prescribed treatment.” The Plan sets out the government measures to be taken to prepare for and respond to a pandemic. It updates the ‘ New Zealand Influenza Pandemic Plan: A framework for action 2017’ . New Zealand has had an Influenza Pandemic action plan since 2006, and this was updated in 2017 to reflect new legislation and population calculations. On 19 March 2020, before the covid pandemic had been declared by the World Health Organisation (“WHO”), The New Zealand Herald published an article alluding to why they believed the pandemic plan needed updating. The 2017 plan relied on pandemic modelling based on certain assumptions. “Ministry of Health director-general Dr. Ashley Bloomfield said new research out of the Imperial College of London had caused a re-think in how [the phases determined by the model] would be managed,” the outlet said . The Imperial College London modelling, as our readers will recall, was the work of the infamous British physicist Neil “Professor Lockdown” Ferguson who has been involved in several controversies regarding his inaccurate modelling throughout his career. Related: Did Neil Ferguson’s modelling of the covid pandemic prove once and for all that epidemiology is useless? Ferguson is one of a small group of global “scientists” whose job is to control the narrative . The real driving force behind updating pandemic preparedness is WHO. In November 2020, New Zealand’s National Emergency Agency updated the information for civil defence emergency management (“CDEM”) groups relating to the Influenza Pandemic Plan . It stated: “The World Health Organisation is concerned that an avian influenza and a human influenza virus might mix” which could result in an influenza pandemic. “New Zealand is planning for the possibility of a pandemic,” it added. The 2024 update – which has dropped the word “influenza” from its title – was “ completed at pace, is limited in scope ” and is part of a wider review of pandemic preparedness that is taking place in two stages. The Plan has a section on “special powers” given to medical officers of health , public health physicians or doctors who are appointed by the Director General of Health. These powers are not new. They were granted in 2002, if not earlier, but during the covid “pandemic” they were used for the first time – covid was the dummy run. The Plan states: Special powers Special powers are authorised by the Minister of Health or by an epidemic notice or apply where an emergency has been declared under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002. The power to detain, isolate or quarantine allows a medical officer of health to “require persons, places, buildings, ships, vehicles, aircraft, animals, or things to be isolated, quarantined, or disinfected” (section 70(1)(f)). The power to prescribe preventive treatment allows a medical officer of health, in respect of any person who has been isolated or quarantined, to require people to remain where they are isolated or quarantined until they have been medically examined and found to be free from infectious disease, and until they have undergone such preventive treatment as the medical officer of health prescribes (section 70(1)(h)). The power to requisition premises allows a medical officer of health to requisition premises and vehicles for the accommodation, treatment and transport of patients (section 71(1)). The closure of premises such as schools can be required under sections 70(1)(1a) and 70(1)(m). This can be made by way of written order to the person in charge of the premises or order published in a newspaper or broadcast by television or radio and able to be received by most households in the district. If specified in the order, premises operating certain infection control measures may be exempted from closure. Section 71A states that a member of the police may do anything reasonably necessary (including the use of force) to help a medical officer of health or any person authorised by the medical officer of health in the exercise or performance of powers or functions under sections 70 or 71. These special powers were used for the first time during the response to COVID-19 . In general terms, they performed well. However, there were some mis-steps in their application, they lack procedural and human rights safeguards and court judgments have found that while they can be used as a stop-gap measure in emergency situations, they are not suitable for sustained, complex responses. [Emphasis added] New Zealand Pandemic Plan: A framework for action ((Interim update – July 2024 ) , pgs. 125 and 126 Ominously, the Ministry of Health states that : “The updated pandemic plan covers the health system response. It does not cover the all-of-government or wider societal response to a pandemic. It is also only one tool for developing the health system’s preparedness.” It is plain to see from the above that they intend broad-reaching powers to be given to a few medical officers who will be able to shut down sections of New Zealand’s economy and detain people at will – or, in their words, when an epidemic notice is issued or when an emergency has been declared which, as we saw with covid, is not the same as an actual pandemic or epidemic occurring. However, we want to focus on the words “preventative medicine.” What does “preventative medicine” mean? We should read these words in the context of the last paragraph of the excerpt above: “These special powers were used for the first time during the response to COVID-19.” Note the big scary attention-seeking capital letters “COVID” is used when the rest of the world has long moved on to use the more appropriate typography of “Covid” or “covid.” Safe and effective medicines have been discouraged and/or banned since 2020 for treating covid, which was essentially the seasonal flu rebranded. Medicines such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were banned and the use of vitamins D and C, and Zinc were discouraged. The only “medicine” that was allowed was either harmful drugs such as remdesivir and midazolam, and later the so-called vaccines. We can assume then, that because “emergency powers” to coerce people into having the covid injections were used for the first time “during the response to COVID-19,” then the “preventative medicine” they are referring to is so-called vaccines or something as equally ineffective and harmful. Do you still have some doubts that this is the aim? Well, let’s hear what Dr. Peter Hotez – who is linked to Bill “Vaccinate the World” Gates and his sidekick Tedros the Terrorist – has had to say recently. Related: Dr Cover-up: Tedros Adhanom’s controversial journey to the WHO and WHO Director General Tedros Serving Terrorist Group in Contravention of WHO Values At the end of last month, WHO announced a new project to turbo-charge the development and distribution of mRNA vaccines in poorer countries for, they say, a looming bird flu pandemic. “The UN health agency said the project would be rolled out through the mRNA technology transfer program it established with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) in 2021, at the height of the covid-19 crisis,” Medical Press said. A couple of weeks earlier, Dr. Peter Hotez , a prominent vaccine developer and advocate, called for deploying security forces, including police and military, to counter “anti-vaccine aggression” in the United States. He also suggested that the United Nations and NATO deploy security forces against “anti-vaxxers.” Hotez has links to both Bill Gates and WHO. In May 2007, it was reported that Hotez received $52 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and conduct clinical trials in Brazil for his hookworm vaccine. The year before, in 2006, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation published a press release that stated that the Foundation had committed $68.2 million to help fight neglected tropical diseases of which $13.8 million was dedicated to Hotez’s research. However, in 2021, Hotez denied being financed by Bill Gates . In 2022, WHO showcased Hotez in a video to target “anti-vaccine activism” by blasting those who choose not to be vaccinated for supporting “anti-science aggression.” “Anti-vaccine activism, which I actually call anti-science aggression, has now become a major killing force globally."" - @PeterHotez , Professor and Dean @BCM_TropMed , on the devastating impact of #misinformation and disinformation. pic.twitter.com/ZluiMGJ2gX — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) December 14, 2022 Further reading: As the chorus of “Covid vaccines are unsafe” grows, WHO threatens “anti-vaccine activists” and labels unvaccinated a “major killing force” During an interview on 5 July 2024 at the Simposio Internacional de Actualización en Pediatría (International Symposium of Paediatric Updates) in Cartagena, Colombia, Hotez said: What I’ve said to the Biden administration is, the health sector can’t solve this on its own. We’re going to have to bring in Homeland Security, the Commerce Department, Justice Department to help us understand how to do this. I’ve said the same with – I met with Dr. Tedros [director general of the WHO] last month … to say, I don’t know that the World Health Organisation can solve this on our own. We need the other United Nations agencies. NATO. This is a security problem because it’s no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise. Two hundred thousand Americans died because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression. And so, this is now a lethal force … and now I feel as a paediatric vaccine scientist … it’s important, just as important for me to make new vaccines, to save lives. The other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression.

New Zealand is implementing the enforcement of “preventative medicine” using the police. That similar methods of forced vaccination are being spoken about or included in national plans is no coincidence. The question everyone should be asking is why do they feel the need to force vaccinate populations using law enforcement and even the military. It is because their vaccines are unsafe and ineffective. So much so that few are willing to risk their lives by allowing themselves to be injected and will resist in every way they can. The pandemic-vaccine industry knows we will not be tricked by their psychological operations again and our pushback against government vaccination policies will be even stronger the next time around.

Researchers asked more than 84,000 diabetes-free people (average age 62) to wear activity trackers for a week, and then followed their health for more than seven years. People whose sleep duration varied the most (fluctuating by more than an hour from night to night) had a 34% higher risk for diabetes, compared with people whose sleep duration was more consistent. The association was strongest among those who slept more than eight hours per night, on average. ""However, the association was also present among those who slept seven to eight hours per night. This suggests that even for those who get enough sleep each night, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule is still important,"" says Sina Kianersi, the lead author and a researcher at Harvard affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.

Alzheimer's Disease Harvard Health Publishing’s Alzheimer's Disease: A guide to diagnosis, treatment, and caregiving LEARN MORE Decline in mental functioning tends to be more rapid with depression than with Alzheimer's or another type of dementia. Unlike people with Alzheimer's, people with depression are usually not disoriented. People with depression have difficulty concentrating, whereas those affected by Alzheimer's have problems with short-term memory. Writing, speaking, and motor skills aren't usually impaired in depression. Depressed people are more likely to notice and comment on their memory problems, while those with Alzheimer's may seem indifferent to such changes. Since there is no simple test that can reveal whether someone has depression or dementia, treatment is often worth trying. If depression is at the root, treatment can produce dramatic improvement.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/stretching-to-help-arthritis-pain,Stretching to help arthritis pain,1,"If you're experiencing arthritis, you shouldn't let the pain keep you from staying physically active. When arthritis makes movement painful, it's only natural to try to avoid it. Yet if you keep an arthritic joint bent rather than moving through its range of motion, you allow muscles to stiffen in that position. Over time, the muscles actually shorten, curtailing range of motion and causing other problems. That can lead to a host of other problems, including weight gain, difficulty walking, and poor balance. A regular stretching routine can help you avoid this vicious cycle. Doctors and physical therapists often prescribe stretching as part of a treatment plan to help maintain or reclaim abilities and ease discomfort. Stretches can also help improve range of motion in people with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease. If you have arthritis, it's best to talk to your doctor before starting any exercise routine, including a stretching routine. Once you get the okay, try these tips to help you get started: Warm up thoroughly. Take extra time to warm up before you stretch. A hot shower or bath, a heated pool, or even warm compresses or a heating pad can also relax stiff joints before you stretch. Stretch during your least painful time of day. Morning won't work for some people, since that's when their joints are stiffest. You might do your stretches when pain relievers are at their peak effectiveness. Adapt stretches. Use pillows or rolled-up towels to adjust your range of motion in each stretch. Choose seated stretches, if necessary. Expect some discomfort. While you should stretch only to the point of mild tension, not pain, you may experience some discomfort. Try this guideline: if discomfort following stretches or other activities lasts longer than two hours, or is more severe than your usual pain, ease up on your routine. Try holding each stretch for less time. As stretching becomes easier, gradually step it up again.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/vitiligo-managing-and-living-with-this-challenging-skin-condition,Vitiligo: Managing and living with this challenging skin condition,1,"Vitiligo is a chronic condition that affects skin color. Because vitiligo affects physical appearance, living with the condition can be challenging and can affect emotional well-being. What is vitiligo? Vitiligo is a lifelong condition in which patches of skin lose color due to the destruction of melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin. Melanin is the pigment that gives skin its color. Vitiligo can appear on any body part and affects individuals of any age, ethnicity, or gender. Quick facts about vitiligo: About 30% of people with vitiligo have a family history of it. It occurs in about 1% to 2% of the population. About half of people with vitiligo show symptoms before age 20. In one out of every five to 10 people with vitiligo, some or all the pigment eventually returns, causing the white patches to disappear. What causes vitiligo? Vitiligo is believed to be an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly targets and destroys its own cells. In the case of vitiligo, the immune system targets an individual's melanocytes, the cells that produce skin pigment. In addition, the melanocytes in a person with vitiligo may be less capable of managing an imbalance between antioxidants and harmful free radicals in the body. In both cases, the melanocytes are damaged and destroyed, resulting in patches of skin losing pigment or color. Although most individuals with vitiligo are otherwise in good health, there is a link between vitiligo and thyroid disorders, such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. What does vitiligo look like? In vitiligo, patches of skin lose their pigment, resulting in areas that appear milky white or lighter than the surrounding skin. The edges of the patches can look smooth or irregular and may show redness or brownish discoloration. Vitiligo can appear anywhere on a person's skin. The areas most often affected are: the fingers and wrists in the armpits groin and genitals around the mouth and eyes inside the mouth. Vitiligo can also cause loss of pigment in hair on the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, and body hair. Vitiligo can be particularly noticeable on darker skin due to the contrast between affected and unaffected areas. In lighter-skinned individuals, the lack of pigment often becomes more apparent in the summer, when surrounding skin tans while the vitiligo patches do not. Types of vitiligo There are two main types of vitiligo: non-segmental and segmental. Non-segmental vitiligo is the most common type, affecting up to 90% of people with vitiligo. This type progresses slowly, with new patches forming periodically on both sides of the body, often symmetrically, such as on both knees or hands. Segmental vitiligo is less common but is more frequently seen in children. This type is more localized, causing rapid pigment loss on one side or part of the body. Segmental vitiligo usually stabilizes within six to 12 months, after which no new patches develop. In rare instances, vitiligo can spread to cover the entire body, a condition known as universal vitiligo. Diagnosing vitiligo To diagnose vitiligo, your doctor will review your medical history and conduct a thorough skin examination. In some cases, an ultraviolet light called a Wood's lamp is used to highlight areas of depigmentation, which appear chalky and bright under the lamp. Your doctor may perform other tests such as: blood testing to check for other autoimmune diseases an eye exam to detect uveitis, an eye inflammation associated with vitiligo. A skin biopsy, in which a small skin sample is examined in a laboratory, is rarely necessary. It can help confirm the diagnosis if the skin changes suggest other conditions. Treatment options Although there is no cure for vitiligo, there are treatments to help stop disease progression, restore skin color, and prevent new patches. For most people, the whitened skin patches last and grow larger if vitiligo is not treated. Your doctor's recommendations for treatment will depend on your needs, overall health, and vitiligo type. Topical medications. Topical treatments include topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus), and topical vitamin D analogs (such as calcipotriene). These prescription medications are applied directly to the skin. Ruxolitinib (Opzelura) is a newer medication approved by the FDA in 2022 to restore lost skin color in people with vitiligo. This cream is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that is prescribed for individuals ages 12 and older primarily to treat small areas of vitiligo. Clinical trials have shown that ruxolitinib cream can effectively repigment the skin, with results lasting up to two years. Light therapy. This treatment exposes the skin to ultraviolet light, encouraging repigmentation. Ultraviolet light can be provided by a hand-held lightbox for smaller areas of skin, or delivered in a closet-sized lightbox if a larger area of skin is involved. The treatment must be repeated often, usually three times a week for at least six months. Depigmentation. This approach, which involves lightening unaffected skin to match the depigmented areas, is only used for people with severe vitiligo. This treatment is rarely used because the depigmentation is permanent and the skin without pigment is vulnerable to damage from sun exposure. Surgery. Surgical options like skin grafts or melanocyte transplants may be explored in severe cases or those that don't respond to other treatments. Surgery is not suitable for everyone, particularly people prone to scarring. Protecting and caring for your skin if you have vitiligo If you have vitiligo, protecting your skin from the sun is crucial to managing the condition. Vitiligo-affected skin is more susceptible to sunburn and skin cancer. To protect your skin, stay out of the sun, wear sun-protective clothing, and apply sunscreen daily to all exposed skin. Avoid tanning beds and sun lamps, as they can worsen vitiligo. In addition, skin injuries such as cuts, scrapes, and burns can trigger new spots or patches of vitiligo, so you should take care to protect your skin. Living with vitiligo Some people embrace their natural skin with vitiligo. Others may not be comfortable with their appearance and may use makeup, self-tanner, or skin dye to cover light patches. Vitiligo can affect quality of life, leading to stress, sadness, and low self-esteem. If vitiligo is affecting your mental health, seek psychological support and counseling. A mental health professional can provide valuable support for coping with difficult feelings and managing depression. It may also be helpful to connect with others by joining a vitiligo support group or seeking emotional support from family and friends.",0,0.08996655,-0.03745061,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/melanoma-a-to-z,Melanoma,1,"What is melanoma? Melanoma is cancer of the cells (melanocytes) that give skin its color. It develops when these cells change and reproduce aggressively. The number of cases of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is increasing faster than any other cancer. Doctors aren't completely sure why melanoma rates are soaring. It could be from spending too much time in the sun during outdoor activities. It could also be due to global changes, such as the depletion of the ozone, which absorbs many of the sun's harmful rays. Your pattern of sun exposure appears to affect your risk of developing melanoma more than the total amount of sun exposure in your lifetime. Short bursts of intense sun seem most dangerous, especially if you get sunburned. Being out in the sun can cause changes (mutations) in skin cells' genes. The most common type of melanoma spreads on the skin's surface. It is called superficial spreading melanoma. It may stay on the surface or grow down into deeper tissues. Other types of melanoma can start anywhere on or inside the body. Your risk of developing melanoma is higher if you have: red or blond hair green or blue eyes fair skin a history of being in the sun a lot, especially as a child a mother, father, sister or brother with melanoma. If one of these relatives has melanoma, you are eight times more likely to develop it. Features of freckles or moles that raise your risk of melanoma include: a new mole appearing after age 30 a new mole at any age if it is in an area rarely exposed to the sun a change in an existing mole one or more atypical moles — moles that look like a fried egg, or moles that are darker than others or have irregular borders or an irregular shape 20 or more moles larger than 2 millimeters across 5 or more moles larger than 5 millimeters across (larger than a pencil eraser) freckles caused by being in the sun. Symptoms of melanoma Melanoma is usually visible as a single dark skin spot. It may appear anywhere on the body, but it most commonly develops on the back, chest, and legs. Most of the time, melanoma develops on normal-looking skin, but it can grow out of an existing mole. Watch a mole for the A, , C, D and Es of melanoma: Asymmetry (one side doesn't match the other) Border irregularities Colors or shades of skin that are different within the same mole Diameter larger than 6 millimeters (larger than a pencil eraser) Evolving (a newly developing mole). A mole that bleeds, feels numb, or has a crusty surface may also hint at melanoma. Diagnosing melanoma If your doctor thinks a mole may be melanoma, he or she will do a biopsy of the skin or refer you to a specialist for the procedure. Before the biopsy, your doctor will check for enlarged lymph nodes close to the mole. If you have a melanoma, enlarged lymph nodes can mean that the cancer has spread. After a skin biopsy, nearby lymph nodes can swell because the skin incision is healing. In a biopsy, a doctor removes a piece of tissue and examines it in a laboratory. Based on this report, your doctor can then determine the thickness of the melanoma and how deep the cancer has grown below the skin's surface. That's the most important factor in predicting whether it can be cured. Melanomas deeper than 1 millimeter are more likely to have spread to other parts of the body. Your doctor may suggest additional tests including: blood tests imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans and MRIs additional biopsies. If the cancer is advanced, the biopsy sample of your melanoma may be tested to see if it has one of the gene mutations common in melanoma. Some melanoma treatments have been designed to attack specific genetic subtypes of this cancer. Expected duration of melanoma Melanoma can usually be cured if it is removed when the tumor has not gone deep into the skin. More advanced melanoma requires longer treatment. If you have one melanoma, you are at risk of developing another, so have a doctor examine your skin regularly. About 1 out of 20 people who have a melanoma will develop a second melanoma within 20 years. Preventing melanoma To reduce your risk of melanoma, stay out of the sun. A bad sunburn is a major risk factor. Spending a lot of time in the sun as a child may pose the greatest risk. To be safe in the sun, take these steps: Apply plenty of sunscreen and apply it frequently. It should: have a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30provide broad spectrum coverage against both UVA and UVB raysbe water resistant. Wear protective sunglasses, clothing (long sleeves and long pants) and wide-brimmed hats. Stay out of the sun when it is strongest (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.). Ask your doctor if any medications you take could make your skin more likely to be damaged by the sun. Avoid tanning salons. If you want to look tan, use sunless tanning creams. They are available in department and drug stores. Melanoma is often easy to spot early, because it can be seen on your skin. If you are at risk of developing melanoma, ask your doctor to examine your skin. Also ask your doctor how often you should have your skin checked. Your doctor will pay special attention to any atypical looking moles. Because some melanomas can arise from existing moles, your doctor may remove atypical moles. These moles may be more likely to become cancerous. Alternatively, your doctor may take pictures of your moles. He or she can compare the photos to your moles in the future to see if they have changed. Examine your skin regularly, especially if you have risk factors for melanoma. Use a full-length and hand-held mirror. Have someone examine your scalp using a blow dryer to part your hair. That person can also examine your back and other areas that you can't easily see. Watch for new moles and changes in existing ones. Keep an eye on moles that you've had since birth; these moles may be more likely to turn into melanoma. Treating melanoma Major advances have been made in the treatment of melanoma. Surgery is the initial treatment for melanoma that appears in just one spot. The doctor removes the visible tumor along with 1 to 2.5 centimeters of healthy skin around the tumor, depending on the size of the tumor. (Nearby skin can contain microscopic bits of the cancer.) In some cases, the doctor may perform a specialized procedure during which the tumor is shaved away one thin layer at a time. Each layer is examined under the microscope as it is removed. This technique helps the doctor remove as little healthy skin as possible. If the melanoma is more than 1 millimeter deep, your doctor will want to know if the melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes. To do this, he or she may inject a radioactive liquid into the tumor. The liquid flows through the natural drainage pathway that connects the tumor to nearby lymph nodes. The drainage path can be tracked, and the first lymph node along the path is called the sentinel node. This node is removed and examined for cancer cells. If the sentinel node has no cancer, the other nodes are most often cancer-free. If cancer is found in the sentinel node, most often all the lymph nodes in the area will be removed. However, it's not been absolutely proven that removing all lymph nodes improves survival. Although spreading cancer cells might be removed, cells that are fighting the cancer also are removed. When cancer has spread to one or two other sites only, surgical removal similar to what was done the first time can improve survival. Additional therapies can often help people with thicker tumors that have grown deep into the skin and/or spread to more areas of the body. The cancer cells are tested for certain specific markers. The results guide the type of therapy that has the greatest chance of improving quality of life and survival. Most often patients are treated with immunotherapy and/or drugs designed to block major pathways that allow cancers to grow. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are less effective. But they can be used when other therapies don't work or stop working. When to call a professional Early treatment of melanoma is crucial. If you detect any of the ABCDE signs or see any suspicious skin changes, call your doctor right away. If you delay, melanoma can spread. If melanoma runs in your family, of if you have other risk factors, be especially alert. Have your doctor examine your skin regularly. Prognosis Five key factors help to determine how serious melanoma is: tumor thickness — How deep it goes into the skin location — Melanoma on the arms or legs may not be as serious as a tumor somewhere else on the body age — People older than 60 are in more danger gender — Males are more likely to die of the disease spreading of the tumor — Twenty percent of people with melanoma have cancer in lymph nodes when their cancer is diagnosed. The thickness of the tumor is the most important factor in determining whether it can be treated. Tumors on the skin's surface usually can be cured. Deeper cancers are more difficult, sometimes impossible, to treat. If melanoma cells break away and spread to organs such as the lungs, liver or brain, the cancer can be cured in only a small number of patients. If treatment begins when the tumor is less than 0.75 millimeters deep, the chance of a cure is excellent. More than 95% of people with small melanomas are cancer-free as long as 8 years later. However, for deeper melanomas, the survival rate is variable.

In an appearance on CBS News’ “Face The Nation” Sunday, Wen claimed that the Biden administration should takes steps to prepare for a possible animal-to-human outbreak of H5N1 following reports a patient in Louisiana contracted the virus earlier this month. “It’s one more sign that the drum beat of bird flu coming closer to humans is becoming a major threat,” Wen said. “So, we’ve already seen this year that there have been a number of mammalian species close to humans that now have bird flu outbreaks. We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states. 16 states have outbreaks in cattle.” “In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing.” “So, we really don’t know the extent of bird flu that’s out there in humans,” she continued. “But this particular case, it’s someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors.” Wen then said the Biden administration needs to expand rapid testing for the virus have the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) quickly approve the H5N1 for commercial use to prevent another COVID-style pandemic. “I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID that just because we aren’t testing, it doesn’t mean that the virus isn’t there. It just means that we aren’t looking for it,” she said. “We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren’t waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what’s bird flu or not.” Wen stressed that the FDA must approve the H5N1 vaccine so that 5 million doses of it can be quickly administered to the “vulnerable” population before Trump takes office. “And the second very important thing is this is not like the beginning of COVID, where we were dealing with a new virus, we didn’t have a vaccine. There actually is a vaccine developed already against H5N1,” Wen explained. “The Biden administration has contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses of the vaccine. However, they have not asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine. There’s research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out so- and to farm workers and to vulnerable people.” Wen went on to say that Biden needs to move quickly on these efforts because the Trump administration may not want to authorize new vaccines given the massive outcry over the experimental COVID mRNA injections. “I think that’s the right approach, because we don’t know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu,” she said. “If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don’t want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that’s a possibility, and I think the Biden administration in the remaining days should get testing and vaccines widely available so that at least it empowers state and local health officials and clinicians to do the right thing for their patients.” Wen was an outspoken proponent of the harsh COVID measures, including prolonged shutdowns of schools and businesses, vaccine mandates, and punishments for the unvaccinated. Her concerns that the Trump administration may not go along with the rushed distribution of new bird flu vaccines are not unwarranted. Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in June floated the possibility that H5N1, like COVID-19, was engineered in a biological lab. “With so much money on the table, is it conceivable that someone might deliberately release a bioengineered bird flu? When this kind of gain-of-function research is going on, accidental or deliberate leaks are inevitable,” Kennedy wrote in an X article. It looks like the establishment is trying to rush into a new (and lucrative) pandemic hysteria before Trump takes office in just a few weeks.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/insomnia-a-to-z,Insomnia,1,"What is insomnia? Insomnia is difficulty getting enough sleep or trouble sleeping without interruption. You may have difficulty falling asleep, may wake up too early, or may wake up periodically during the night. Insomnia of any kind can keep you from feeling rested and refreshed during the day. Almost all of us have episodes of insomnia at some time, but insomnia is not a short-term problem for everyone. Insomnia is classified as chronic when it happens almost every night for at least one month. Insomnia can be related to a medical or psychiatric illness, can be caused by mental stress or excitement, or can be caused by your daytime and bedtime habits. Your habits and surroundings are the usual causes of short-term insomnia problems. Factors that contribute to insomnia can include: stress or anxiety a change in sleeping environment (being a guest at a hotel or a relative's home) an uncomfortable sleeping environment (too hot, too cold, too bright, too noisy) an uncomfortable mattress pajamas that are too tight having a bed partner who snores or has disruptive sleep patterns watching television, reading a book or problem-solving in your bed, so your brain associates lying down in bed without activities other than sleeping eating a heavy meal before bedtime taking a prescription medication that has insomnia as a side effect drinking alcoholic beverages before bedtime having a high intake of beverages containing caffeine (coffee, tea, cola) during the day cigarette smoking exercising immediately before bedtime not exercising enough during the day, so you have energy to spare taking a hot bath or shower before bed traveling to a different time zone traveling to a much higher altitude shift work. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to insomnia. Women who are pregnant may have insomnia because of hormone changes, heartburn, leg cramps or a need to urinate more frequently. In addition, the unborn baby's increasing size often makes it harder for the mother to find a comfortable sleeping position. Chronic insomnia may be caused by a medical or psychiatric problem. Some common causes of chronic insomnia include: psychiatric illness, especially depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) chronic medical illnesses, especially kidney disease, heart failure or asthma painful illnesses, especially arthritis, neuropathy, acid reflux or cancer hormone imbalance, especially menopause or hyperthyroidism taking a prescription medicine that has insomnia as a side effect restless legs syndrome: this disorder causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs. Symptoms can include twitching of the legs, a habit of repetitive leg movements, and leg cramps. obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a common condition. However, often the people that have this problem don't realize it. Snorers or people who are overweight may have repeated episodes in which breathing stops for 10 seconds to 30 seconds during sleep, just when the person is relaxing into deep sleep. Sleep apnea is caused most often by relaxing the tongue and throat tissues, which can settle into a position that closes your airway. Your body reacts to sleep apnea by releasing adrenaline-like ""alarm"" hormones so you will awaken and resume breathing. These hormones keep you awake for periods of the night. Symptoms of insomnia Symptoms of insomnia can include: difficulty falling asleep waking up periodically during the night waking up in the early morning, but not feeling rested feeling tired and irritable during the day having trouble concentrating. Diagnosing insomnia Your doctor often can determine the cause of your insomnia by asking about your habits and sleep environment, by reviewing your symptoms, and by examining you. Your doctor may suggest that you keep a sleep diary (a log of your sleep patterns) to provide an exact record of how many hours you sleep, whether symptoms may be your trigger for awakenings, and at what times you wake up. If your doctor suspects that a medical illness is causing your insomnia, you may need additional tests. In some patients, an overnight sleep study at a sleep clinic may be necessary. During a sleep study, your brain waves, breathing pattern and oxygen levels can be monitored, and your body movements can be observed. Expected duration of insomnia Insomnia may last only one or two nights, or it may continue for weeks, months or years. How long insomnia lasts depends on its cause, and on the success of lifestyle changes and treatment. Preventing insomnia It helps to have habits that promote healthy sleep: Follow a regular sleep schedule. Have a routine bedtime and wake up at roughly the same hour each morning. Sleep in loose, comfortable clothes in a comfortable bed. Eliminate any sources of noise or bright lights that prevent or disrupt sleep. If noise from outside your bedroom can't be eliminated, it might help if you drown out that noise by creating a monotonous noise of your own. Use a fan, a channel with static noise on your radio, or a recording of ocean waves to make a noise that can lull you to sleep. Maintain a comfortable temperature in your bedroom. Cut down on beverages containing caffeine during the day, since the stimulating effects of caffeine can last for many hours. Avoid heavy meals before bedtime. Eliminate alcohol, since many people experience wakefulness as the effect of the alcohol wears off. Exercise daily, preferably early in the day. If you read before bed, do this in a chair or in another room. Consider sleeping in a separate bed or separate room if your partner keeps you awake. If you have chronic insomnia because of chronic pain, medical illness or psychiatric problems, seek prompt treatment for your health problem. Don't assume that insomnia is an unavoidable part of your illness. Treating insomnia Changes in your bedtime surroundings and habits that can promote sleep are usually the most important way to manage insomnia. Behavioral therapies also may be used to treat some patients with insomnia. These therapies include: Relaxation therapy — Special techniques to quiet the mind and relax the muscles Sleep restriction — A program that at first permits only a few hours of sleep per night, then gradually increases the nightly sleeping time Reconditioning — A program that teaches the patient to associate the bed only with sleeping (and sexual activity) by having the patient go to bed only when sleepy and avoid daytime naps If insomnia is one of the symptoms of a medical disorder, treating the underlying problem may be all that you need. For example, treating restless legs syndrome with specific medication or sleep apnea with a special mask can markedly improve quality of sleep. Your doctor may prescribe sleeping pills for short term or occasional use. Today there are a wide variety of medications to choose from. Some act quickly and are most helpful if you have trouble falling asleep. Others have a longer duration of action when the problem is staying asleep. Many of the medications are available as generics, which tend to be much less expensive. Older people should avoid the longer acting drugs because the sedation can last much longer than eight or nine hours. Melatonin, a dietary supplement, works for some people and not others. It has a good safety profile when used in the doses directed on the label. When to call a professional Call your doctor if you are worried about sleeping problems, especially if insufficient sleep or disturbed sleep is interfering with your ability to function normally during the day. Insomnia is an urgent medical problem if sleep problems are making it unsafe for you to drive a car or to perform potentially dangerous tasks at work. Prognosis In many people with insomnia, normal sleep patterns return within a few days, especially if a lifestyle issue (stress, a habit of heavy meals before bed, a change in time zones) disappears or is modified. In people with chronic insomnia, the outlook depends on the underlying problem. In people with obstructive sleep apnea, most experience relief when they use a nighttime nose mask that provides modest continuous air pressure through the mouth and nose. This mask must be prescribed by a doctor. Additional info National Center on Sleep Disorders Research www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sleep",5,0.30976236,-0.2070811,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-to-help-your-child-get-the-sleep-they-need-202008312264,How to help your child get the sleep they need,1,"It's tempting at this time of year to let summer sleep schedules stay in place or let bedtimes slide, especially when parents feel tired out, too. But it's important that children have a regular routine — and that they are sleeping during the dark hours and awake during the light ones, as our bodies do best that way. That's true for families who are home-schooling, as well: even when the trip to school is just a walk to the kitchen table, allowing for more sleep than those catching an early bus may get, no child should be spending all morning in bed. Sleep is crucial for all of us, and this is particularly true for children. Without enough quality sleep, children are more likely to have health and behavioral problems — and difficulty learning. Here are a few simple things you can do to help your child get the sleep they need. Have a regular schedule Our bodies do best when we go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time every day. Children and teens need eight to 10 hours of sleep. Count back 10 hours from when your child needs to get up in the morning. That's roughly the time they need to be getting ready for bed (for younger children, count back 11 hours). For example, if your teen needs to be up at 7, then they should be getting ready for bed by 9, and in bed by 10 (since most of us don't fall asleep the moment our head hits the pillow). A younger child should start getting ready (bathing, etc.) by around 8. Understand that teens are biologically wired to fall asleep later and wake up later and will naturally have later bedtimes. Unfortunately, most school districts don't accommodate to this, so you are often working against biology. While it's okay to stay up a bit later on weekends, don't let the bedtime vary by more than an hour or so. Turn off the screens before bed The blue light emitted by screens can keep us awake. It's best if the screens can be off two hours before you want your child asleep. Use that time when they start getting ready for bed as the time that the screens go off. The only real way to achieve this is to get all devices out of the bedroom. Teens will fight you on this. If you can, hold firm (and buy them an alarm clock if they say they need their phone for this). At the very least, be sure that the phone is on Do Not Disturb mode overnight. Have an environment that encourages sleep Quiet things down. If you are watching TV, turn the volume down, and in general try to not make much noise after children go to bed. Consider a white noise machine or a fan (or air conditioner if you live somewhere warm). There are also white noise apps for those teens who won't give up their phones. Room-darkening curtains can make a difference for children who tend to wake up at the first light of dawn — or who can't fall asleep if it's not fully dark outside. Know how other factors influence sleep Busy teens often have difficulty getting everything done in time to get enough sleep. Talk with your teen about their daily schedule and look for ways to help them get more shut-eye, such as getting homework done during the school day, or limiting video games or other activities that eat into homework time. Sleep needs to be the priority. Limit caffeine. It's best not to have any, but certainly nothing from mid-afternoon on. Limit naps! For a tired older child naps may seem like a good idea, but they can interfere with nighttime sleep. Naptime is okay through preschool. Make sure your child gets exercise. It's not only important for their health, it helps their sleep. Have calming routines before bed (not exercise!). If your child is having trouble falling asleep, or is waking up at night, talk to your doctor. It's also important to talk to your doctor if your child is snoring or having other breathing problems at night. Don't ever ignore a sleep problem; always ask for help.",5,0.14757381,-0.15124923,True
https://www.infowars.com/posts/record-increase-in-us-homelessness-in-2024,Record Increase in US Homelessness in 2024,0,"Homelessness increased by a record 18% over the last year, says the Department of Housing and Urban Development. A total of 771,480 people, or around 20 in 10,000 in the US, were homeless and living in an emergency shelter, safe haven, transitional housing program, or an unsheltered location, according to new data released on Friday. That amounts to an 18% increase on 2023. The 2023 annual data showed a 12% increase. Over the last year, children under the age of 18 experienced the greatest increase in homelessness. More than 150,000 under-18s were classed as homeless, a 33% rise on 2023. Black people, who represent 12% of the US population, represented just under a third of all homeless people. The Department of Housing and Urban Development attributed the increase to “our worsening national affordable housing crisis, rising inflation, stagnating wages among middle- and lower-income households,” as well as “the persisting effects of systemic racism,” “public health crises,” “natural disasters,” increase immigration to the US and the end of anti-homelessness programs brought in during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2,-0.1183269,-0.12639648,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/gratitude-enhances-health-brings-happiness-and-may-even-lengthen-lives-202409113071,"Gratitude enhances health, brings happiness — and may even lengthen lives",1,"Several evenings a week, as Tyler VanderWeele gathers around the dinner table with his wife and two young kids, the family deliberately pauses during the meal to do something simple but profound. Each member shares several things for which they're grateful — an act that VanderWeele, co-director of the Initiative on Health, Spirituality, and Religion at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, feels changes his family dynamic for the better. ""I do think it makes a difference and can be a very powerful practice,"" he says. ""Even on those bad days where life seems difficult, that effort is worthwhile."" Gratitude, health, and longevity How can the power of gratitude affect our lives? Recent research has pointed to gratitude's myriad positive health effects, including greater emotional and social well-being, better sleep quality, lower depression risks, and favorable markers of cardiovascular health. Now, new data from the long-term Nurses' Health Study shows that it may extend lives. ""Gratitude has been one of the most widely studied activities contributing to well-being, but we couldn't find a single prior study that looked at its effects on mortality and longevity, much to our surprise,"" says VanderWeele, co-author of the new research. What did the study look at? Published July 2024 in JAMA Psychiatry, the new study drew on data from 49,275 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. Their average age was 79. In 2016, participants completed a six-item gratitude questionnaire in which they ranked their agreement with statements such as, ""I have so much in life to be thankful for,"" and ""If I had to list everything I felt grateful for, it would be a very long list."" Four years later, researchers combed through participants' medical records to determine who had died. There were 4,608 deaths from all causes, as well as from specific causes such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory diseases, neurodegenerative disease, infection, and injury. Deaths from cardiovascular disease — a top killer of women and men in the United States — were the most common cause. What did the researchers find? Participants with gratitude scores in the highest third at the study's start had a 9% lower risk of dying over the following four years than participants who scored in the bottom third. This did not change after controlling for physical health, economic circumstances, and other aspects of mental health and well-being. Gratitude seemed to help protect participants from every cause of death studied — including cardiovascular disease. But what does this actually mean? ""A 9% reduction in mortality risk is meaningful, but not huge,"" VanderWeele says. ""But what's remarkable about gratitude is that just about anyone can practice it. Anyone can recognize what's around them and express thanks to others for what's good in their life."" While the study couldn't pinpoint why gratitude is associated with longer life, VanderWeele believes several factors may contribute. ""We know that gratitude makes people feel happier. That in itself has a small effect on mortality risk,"" he says. ""Practicing gratitude may also make someone a bit more motivated to take care of their health. Maybe they're more likely to show up for medical appointments or exercise. It may also help with relationships and social support, which we know contribute to health."" What are the study's limitations and strengths? The study was observational. This means it can't prove that gratitude helps people live longer — only that an association exists. And the particular sample of people analyzed is both the biggest strength and limitation of the research, VanderWeele says. All were older female nurses with high socioeconomic status. The vast majority were white. ""Does the longevity effect extend to men, to those who are younger, and to those with lower socioeconomic resources?"" VanderWeele asks. ""Those are all open questions."" On the plus side, he says, the study sample's large size is one of its biggest strengths. So is the extensive data gathered on potential confounding factors such as participants' physical health, social characteristics, and other aspects of psychological well-being. ""Between the quality of the data and the size of the sample, we were able to provide reasonable evidence for this modest longevity effect,"" he says. Try this: Six questions to evoke gratitude Not feeling especially grateful today? You have the power to change that. Asking yourself certain questions can evoke gratitude, such as What happened today that was good? What am I taking for granted that I can be thankful for? Which people in my life am I grateful for? What is the last book I read or movie, show, or social media clip I saw that I really appreciated, and why? What am I most looking forward to this week, month, and year, and why? What is the kindest thing someone has said or done lately? Similarly, a few simple actions can infuse gratitude into your days. Try VanderWeele's family routine of regularly expressing gratitude around the dinner table. Another well-known practice — that's perhaps becoming forgotten in this digital age — is penning thank-you notes. ""I do think writing a thank-you note or gratitude letter gets your mind to dwell on something positive for a longer period, to think more deeply about it, because you have to put it not just in words, but in writing,"" VanderWeele says. ""It also deepens the relationship and builds that bond."" One less-recognized but valuable gratitude practice is called a ""savoring exercise,"" which builds on aspects of mindfulness. All that's required is ""pausing, looking around you, and taking in and enjoying everything that's good in your current setting,"" VanderWeele says. ""It's not a big leap to go from recognizing the good to expressing gratitude for what you have.""",7,0.2083618,-0.08883622,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/rem-sleep-what-is-it-why-is-it-important-and-how-can-you-get-more-of-it,"REM sleep: What is it, why is it important, and how can you get more of it?",1,"You may not think much about your dreams, other than occasionally wondering what they mean. But dreams are an important part of a sleep stage known as REM sleep. All sleep is important, but REM sleep plays a key role for brain health and function. What is REM sleep? Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is part of your body's normal sleep cycle. Each of your body's sleep cycles lasts about 80 to 100 minutes. Most of us experience four to six sleep cycles per night. Your first REM episode usually lasts for just a few minutes. They lengthen during each subsequent sleep cycle. Toward the end of the night, you may spend up to half an hour in REM sleep. REM sleep is when most of your dreams occur. During REM sleep, your heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, and breathing increase. Your eyes move rapidly, even though they are closed. The muscles in your arms and legs also become temporarily unable to move. This prevents you from acting out your dreams as you experience them. How much REM sleep do you need? Just like your overall slumber patterns, your REM sleep needs shift as you age. Newborns spend about half their snooze time in REM sleep. This starts to decrease by about 6 months, and continues to decline throughout childhood and the teen years. By age 20, most people spend just over 20% of their total shut-eye time in REM sleep. In older adults, time spent in REM sleep decreases slightly, to about 17% by age 80. Benefits of REM sleep Benefits of REM sleep include: Improved learning. During REM sleep, your brain prunes its synapses, the spaces in which brain cells communicate with one another. This appears to improve memory and problem-solving abilities. Mood regulation. REM sleep helps your brain process emotional memories, including ones associated with fear. Brain development. REM sleep is thought to aid in the development of the central nervous system, which includes your brain and spinal cord. That may be one reason why infants, particularly newborns, require so much REM sleep. Protection against dementia. People who get less REM sleep may have a greater risk of developing dementia, according to a study published in the journal Neurology. The researchers found that for every 1% reduction in REM sleep, there was a 9% increase in the risk of dementia. REM sleep is so important that if you don't get enough one night, your body will naturally increase it the next — you'll enter this stage earlier and stay in it for longer. This is known as REM rebound. How to get a good night's sleep Sleep is elusive for many of us — over 14% of American adults experience trouble falling asleep most days of the week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most REM sleep occurs at the end of the night, so getting enough total sleep helps to maximize REM sleep. Here are some tips to help you fall asleep and stay asleep: Stick to a sleep schedule. Set a regular bedtime and wake-up time and stick to it, even on weekends and when you're on vacation. This will help to regulate your sleep/wake cycle and make it easier for you to drift off at night. If you can't fall asleep within 20 to 30 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room, and do something relaxing like reading or knitting until you feel sleepy again. Don't stay in bed and watch the clock, which can make insomnia worse. If you have trouble sleeping one night, try not to sleep later or nap the next day. Doing so will disrupt your routine. You may be more tired that day, but you will sleep better that night. Limit alcohol and caffeine. A nightcap may help you nod off, but it suppresses your REM sleep. Caffeine also interferes with a good night's rest because it blocks brain chemicals that promote sleep. A study published in the Journal of Biological Rhythms found that three 150-milligram servings of caffeine a day — the equivalent of about 4-1/2 cups of coffee — affected REM sleep in young healthy men. Stay active. Exercise itself has been shown to slightly decrease REM sleep. But a 2024 study published in the journal Scientific Reports found that regular physical activity increases the amount of deep, restorative sleep that you get, which in turn boosts mood and energy. Try to exercise outside in the morning, since natural light helps to set your body's sleep/wake cycle. Relax before bed. Try the following calming rituals an hour or two before bedtime: Listen to soft music. Take a warm bath or shower. Stretch. Read. Avoid doing it on your phone or tablet, however, as those devices emit blue light that can interfere with sleep.",5,0.267099,-0.18835893,True

Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-Ting of Taiwan are making headlines for qualifying to compete in this year's Olympics despite last year being disqualified from competing in the Women's World Boxing Championships in New Delhi. A series of DNA tests showed that the two athletes have ""XY chromosomes,"" to quote Umar Kremlev, president of the International Boxing Association (IBA). Kremlev said in a statement that his group ""uncovered athletes who were trying to fool their colleagues and pretend to be women."" For daring to tell the truth and violate the ""transphobia"" creed, the IBA was stripped of being allowed to run Olympic boxing competitions. The IOC has instead decided that it does not matter one's DNA – if you are a male who wants to compete as a ""trans,"" then go for it . After last year's disqualification, the Algerian Olympic Committee accused the IBA of engaging in a ""conspiracy"" to stop Khelif from winning a gold medal. As for Khelif's high testosterone levels, the Algerian Olympic Committee blamed ""medical reasons."" (Related: Women's cycling no longer exists now that biological male ""trans women"" are allowed to compete.) Men fighting women isn't a fair fight Mexico's Brianda Tamara had the displeasure of fighting Khelif before the disqualification. Here is what she wrote on X about what it was like: ""When I fought with her [sic] I felt very out of my depth. Her [sic] blows hurt me a lot, I don't think I had ever felt like that in my 13 years as a boxer, nor in my sparring with men. Thank God that day I got out of the ring safely, and it's good that they finally realized."" There is a possibility that neither Khelif nor Yu-Ting are biological males after all, at least according to the feminist website Reduxx . It could be that Khelif and Yu-Ting are suffering from ""Difference of Sexual Development,"" or DSD, a medical profile where one's genitalia differs from one's chromosomes. Former American Olympian Nancy Hogshead, who won three gold medals for swimming at the 1984 Games, would seem to disagree. She tweeted that ""gender ideology will get women KILLED."" ""Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-Ting of Taiwan are scheduled to compete in women's Olympic boxing – despite being disqualified last year for having XY chromosomes, the male phenotype,"" Hogshead further wrote. ""Let's remind ourselves that males – however they identify – pack a punch that is 162 per cent more powerful than women – THE biggest performance gap between men and women."" A spokesperson from the IOC responded to the controversy by claiming that everything is as it should be. ""All athletes participating in the boxing tournament comply with the competition's eligibility and entry regulations, as well as all applicable medical regulations, in accordance with the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit,"" the spokesperson said. Though they would certainly risk their careers by doing so, real female athletes could simply refuse to participate in fighting or competing against biological males who claim to be ""trans women."" A few have already done just that. ""Apart from the Olympic governing body, everyone else can see that this isn't a level playing field,"" a commenter wrote. ""It's a dangerous decision.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/xylitol-what-to-know-about-this-popular-sugar-substitute,Xylitol: What to know about this popular sugar substitute,1,"The next time you pop a stick of sugar-free chewing gum in your mouth, take a look at the list of ingredients: Chances are you'll see an ingredient called xylitol. This sugar alcohol that tastes as sweet sugar but has fewer calories and negligible effects on blood sugar levels and insulin. For this reason, xylitol is used in many sugar-free gums, candies, baked goods, and diabetes-friendly foods. You'll also find xylitol in toothpaste, mouthwash, and other types of oral-care products. What is xylitol? A naturally occurring sugar alcohol found (in trace amounts) in many fruits and vegetables, xylitol can be processed from certain trees or from a plant fiber called xylan. It tastes about as sweet as regular sugar, but with only about half the calories per serving. Store-bought xylitol is a white, crystalline powder that can be used as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in recipes. What are the health benefits of xylitol? Eating too much sugar has been linked to a host of serious health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and tooth decay, so sugar-free sweeteners like xylitol are a compelling alternative. Xylitol is lower in calories and carbohydrates than sugar Xylitol is an excellent alternative to sugar for people who need to watch their weight, their blood sugar levels, or both. The sugar alcohol contains about 2.4 calories per gram (compared with 4 calories per gram in regular sugar). That makes it a good option for those who want to limit their simple carbohydrate intake, like people with diabetes or related metabolic syndromes. Xylitol doesn't cause blood sugar spikes When measured on the glycemic index (GI), a measure of how quickly food raises blood sugar, xylitol's GI score is 7, while regular sugar has a GI score of about 60. Xylitol's lower GI score correlates to more sustained energy without the spike and plunge associated with a sudden intake of regular sugar. Xylitol is good for your dental health Xylitol may help prevent tooth decay by reducing levels of bad bacteria in your mouth. According to a review published in the Journal of International Society of Preventive & Community Dentistry, consuming 5 to 10 grams per day of xylitol-containing products (like lozenges, candies, chewing gum, toothpaste, or mouth rinse) significantly prevented cavities and tooth decay compared with products that do not contain xylitol. So don't be surprised if your dentist recommends a xylitol-containing chewing gum at your next checkup. Xylitol in everyday products Many sugar-free products contain xylitol, including sugar-free candy, gum, baked goods, mints, cough syrup, chewable vitamins, some nut butters, ice cream, and oral hygiene products like toothpaste and mouthwash. You can also buy xylitol in bulk at most grocery stores or online retailers to use in cooking and baking. Possible side effects Most people can add xylitol to their diets without noticing any side effects. But some people may experience digestive problems like gas, bloating, and diarrhea if they consume too much too quickly. If you notice uncomfortable digestive problems, cut back your xylitol intake and reintroduce it slowly. And if you have other digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), you may want to avoid sugar alcohols entirely. Additionally, an observational study published in the June issue of European Heart Journal found that high levels of xylitol were associated with greater risk of heart attack or stroke in adults years later. While more research is needed (the study was small, and observational versus experimental), it's best to keep your consumption of xylitol in check. Keep xylitol away from your dog Xylitol is highly toxic to dogs, causing dangerously low blood sugar, liver failure, and even death. Keep sugar-free products out of your dog's reach, and always check the ingredient label on ice cream and peanut butter before offering it to your pup.",3,0.32099655,0.05417621,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/mpox-is-back-what-to-know-and-do-202409033067,Mpox is back: What to know and do,1,"Ever heard of mpox? Wondering why it's back in the news? Many of us first learned about mpox (formerly called monkeypox) in 2022, when the largest known outbreak spread to nearly 100,000 people in more than 100 countries. While mpox often circulates in central and western Africa, the 2022 outbreak quickly spread from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to places it had never been detected before. In the US alone, it caused more than 32,000 infections and 58 deaths. Now, a new outbreak of mpox has put it back in the news. What should you know — and do — about this latest international health emergency? What are your risks? Are vaccines available? If you get mpox, how can you avoid spreading it? What's different about the 2024 mpox outbreak? This time, a new strain of the virus (called Clade 1b) is spreading quickly. That's why the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a second mpox global health emergency in August 2024. Already, more than 15,600 cases and 500 deaths have been reported, mostly in the DRC. And mpox has been found in countries that previously hadn't identified any cases, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Recent cases diagnosed in Sweden and Thailand have public health officials bracing for additional international spread, including to Asia, Europe, and the US. 6 things to know about mpox What is mpox and how does it spread? Mpox is a viral infection caused by the same family of viruses as smallpox. In central and western Africa it's common in certain animals, including squirrels and rats. People can become infected after contact with infected animals. Mpox can spread from person to person through close physical contact, including sex. What are the symptoms of mpox? Mpox causes flulike symptoms, fever, headache, enlarged lymph nodes, and a unique rash. The rash usually begins a few days into the illness as small flat spots. The spots evolve over a week or two to become small fluid-filled bumps (vesicles) similar to chickenpox, and then larger pus-filled blisters. Over another week or two, the blisters scab over and heal. Once that happens, a person is no longer contagious. Although the disease is usually mild, some people develop complications. Serious complications include pneumonia, vision loss due to eye infection, and sepsis, a life-threatening infection. What is your risk of getting mpox? Location and activities factor into your risk for developing mpox. Risk increases if you have close physical contact with an infected animal or person have contact with bedding, clothes, or other objects or surfaces touched by an infected person live in or visit a place where the mpox virus is endemic — that means present in the environment, such as in the soil or infected animals or people are a man who has sex with men have many sexual partners. When people get mpox, risk factors for experiencing more severe disease or complications like pneumonia include: pregnancy young age (especially children younger than age 1) having a weakened immune system having eczema (because this weakens the protective skin barrier). Why is the new mpox outbreak so worrisome? The new outbreak of mpox is especially worrisome because the strain of the virus is deadlier than in 2022. The virus is spreading more quickly and reaching places where mpox had not previously been found. In addition, the new outbreak has disproportionately affected kids and teens in resource-poor countries. Many are already suffering with malnutrition, or other infections such as cholera. It's worth noting that the strain of mpox from the 2022 outbreak (Clade 1) is still circulating at a low level in the US. Right now, fewer than 15 people a week are diagnosed with it and treatment is available. Are there mpox vaccines and treatments? There are two vaccines available to prevent mpox in the US: Jynneos is approved to prevent mpox and smallpox. It requires two doses four weeks apart. A vaccine called ACAM2000 is approved for preventing smallpox and is considered effective for mpox. It could be made available if needed, but its potential side effects make it a second choice. Resource-poor countries in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere have had limited access to vaccines. Even in resource-rich countries like Europe and the US, vaccine hesitancy has been an obstacle to containing the outbreak. In one study, only half of a vulnerable population in Illinois received the initial dose of the mpox vaccine, and only a quarter received both recommended doses. An antiviral drug called tecovirimat is approved to treat smallpox. Animal studies suggest it may be effective in treating mpox as well. Now being investigated as an mpox treatment, the drug may be available by enrolling in a study. A 2024 study found tecovirimat did not reduce the length of time adults and children with Clade 1 mpox had symptoms. However, the death rate (1.7%) was half of what was expected. But it's unclear whether the low death rate was actually due to drug treatment. How can someone with mpox avoid spreading it? If you are diagnosed with mpox, it's important to take these measures to avoid infecting others: Avoid close contact with others until your skin lesions have healed. Wear a well-fitting medical mask while near others; those visiting you should wear a mask as well. Stay several feet or more away from others. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom. Clean all surfaces you've touched. Don't share eating utensils, towels, or bedding with others. Increase room ventilation by opening windows or using a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifier. Some experts recommend avoiding contact with pets or other animals because they could become infected and spread the disease to new animal species in new places. The bottom line Will mpox be the next pandemic? That's unlikely. The virus that causes mpox spreads mainly by direct contact — unlike the virus that causes COVID-19, which spreads through small respiratory droplets that are easily breathed in. Also, people with mpox who are contagious typically have obvious symptoms, so they can take steps to avoid spread. Currently, the risk mpox poses to most people in the US appears to be quite low. To help make sure it stays that way and to help countries where mpox is common, US public health officials are working with their counterparts in other countries to contain the outbreak. To be successful, we'll need a robust. well-coordinated international effort, including financial support to resource-poor countries to fund educational programs, vaccination, testing, and treatment.",4,-0.34049347,0.15597267,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-04-parents-serve-jail-time-for-opposing-transgender-mutilations.html,Swiss government “kidnaps” children and threatens parents with jail time for opposing transgender mutilations,0,"A Swiss court recently ruled that the parents of a minor ""stolen"" by the government should provide legal documents to allow the child a gender alteration intervention despite them disagreeing with the procedure. Three years ago, the kid was separated from her parents because they refused to give their daughter puberty blockers. The kid, now 16 years old, wanted to transition into a boy. Now that the parents lost the case, the highest court in the canton of Geneva, the Court of Justice, is now ordering them to hand over the needed documents so they can submit the teenager to the alteration procedure. The father, who had appealed the order, said: ""We are deeply saddened that this nightmare situation continues."" ""Not only has the state separated us from our daughter because we objected to her 'transition,' but we are now being threatened with criminal charges if we do not aid in her 'legal transition' by handing over legal documents,"" he added. He also pointed out that if this injustice can happen to them, it can also happen to other parents. ""We will not give up trying to protect our daughter and will seek to appeal this decision,"" he further vowed. In a viral video shared on X, formerly Twitter, the father recalled how it all started. ""About three years ago, our daughter informed us that she was a boy. We understood that she was going through a difficult period in her life so we agreed to seek medical advice,"" he said. Then, they went to the Geneva hospital where they were instructed that they should start treating the child as a boy because of an assessment that used a 'gender unicorn' diagnostic test performed by one of their nurses. ""We were told she needed puberty blockers,"" the father recalled and added that soon enough, the school also got involved. Then, the teachers, administrators and everyone at school started to call the teenager a male name. ""We were very clear with the school, that we did not believe it was up to the school to socially transition our daughter. We learned that the school psychologist was getting in and was feeding my daughter with materials, putting her in contact with Le Refuge,"" he further said. Le Refuge is a transgender advocacy organization, which has taken their daughter down the path of believing that she’s a boy in a girl's body. The organization also convinced the daughter that her psychotherapist was ""transphobic."" Eventually, the Swiss Child Protection Agency, with the school's support, brought a case against the parents in the Swiss court system. Not only had their daughter been taken by the government they also lost tens of thousands of dollars paying legal fees. And now, they are also threatened with serving jail time. Meanwhile, Big Tech mogul Elon Musk commented on the post sharing the father's interview with: ""Same thing is happening in California."" The said social media entry where Musk commented was shared by the handle Billboard Chris and now has 24.8 million views. Same thing is happening in California https://t.co/8KWF7f27xs — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 1, 2024 Musk's followers were also quick to react, with most of them saying that it is ""sickening that it's spread everywhere across America when it should have never been allowed."" Another one posted a meme with the copy: ""Liberalism is when you think injecting cattle with hormones is evil but injecting kids with hormones to change their gender is just fine."" California Senate bans schools from notifying parents about their kids' gender identity, sexual orientation After more than an hour of debate in which Democratic LGBTQ+ senators lamented about how they delayed coming out to their parents or were outed by someone else, the state Senate approved on August 1 the proposal that bans school districts from requiring teachers to notify parents if their child has found a new pronoun to use at school. The proposal also bars the schools from passing or enforcing policies requiring school staff to disclose the student's gender identity or sexual orientation to their parents without the child's permission. The lawmakers approved the legislation as they argued that gender non-conforming students should be able to come out to their families on their own terms. Meanwhile, Republicans say the state shouldn't dictate whether school districts can enforce so-called parental notification policies and that schools should be transparent with parents. Republican Sen. Kelly Seyarto, who represents Murrieta in Southern California, said schools should increase transparency with parents by notifying them of their child's gender identification change. ""If we include the parents, that's the best way to take something from people being angry and mad to developing a solution that works for everybody,"" he said. Greg Burt, vice president of the conservative Christian advocacy group California Family Council also weighed in saying, ""California officials shouldn't prevent all parents from being notified because of the possibility that some parents may react badly. You don't assume that all parents are unsafe. That shouldn't be the assumption."" The bill now heads to the state Assembly, where it would need to pass in committees and on the floor before it can reach the desk of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose administration is known for fighting school boards over their notification policies.

It's most likely simply because they love you and feel most secure snuggled next to you, but before you work to change the habit, be sure that your child is ready for — and can handle — the change. If your child has been more clingy or irritable than usual, or is having difficult behaviors in any way, touch base with your doctor.

If it's darkness, think night lights and flashlights. If it's noise, think about getting a white-noise machine. Set your child up for success. Please: no TVs or devices in the bedroom. They get in the way of healthy sleep. Have a consistent bedtime. Try not to let your child stay up late — or sleep late — on weekends. This way your child is more likely to be tired when you want them to be tired. Have a consistent, calming, and nurturing bedtime routine. Try to lower the energy level, perhaps with a bath and then some snuggling and reading stories. You want to help them wind down, and also be sure they end the day feeling loved. If your child has a hard time going to bed alone, it's okay to sit in the room and ease yourself out bit by bit after lights are out (you can literally move closer and closer to the door). Try to gradually shorten the time you are in the room. If your child gets out of bed, bring them back to their bed. This is the hard part: your child won't like it, and it can be exhausting for you if they keep creeping out of their bed and into yours. But if you give in and let them stay in your room, they will stay in your room. Every night. Use incentives. Make sure your child gets major kudos for any progress at all — and maybe earns something extra for staying in their own bed all night. Try to steer away from things, if possible, and think more about quality time (an extra story, a fun outing). If nothing is working, or your child is really upset, talk to your doctor. There may be more going on, and the two of you can work together to figure things out and help your child. Both of you deserve a restful night's sleep.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/high-lipoproteina-raises-heart-attack-risk-even-in-healthy-people,High lipoprotein(a) raises heart attack risk even in healthy people,1,"High blood levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a) — a variant of LDL cholesterol — may triple the risk of a heart attack, even among people with no other risks for heart disease, a new study confirms. The study included 6,238 people ages 43 to 65 who had their Lp(a) levels measured. Values in the top 10% — 216 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) or greater — were defined as high, while values in the lower 50% — less than 42 nmol/L — were defined as low. Most had conditions or habits that raised their heart disease risk, known as standard modifiable risk factors (SMuRFs). These include diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, and unfavorable cholesterol levels. While about 4% of the study participants had all four SMuRFs, nearly 24% had none. Over a median follow-up period of nearly nine years, high Lp(a) levels were linked to nearly triple the risk of heart attack, regardless of the presence or number of SMuRFs a person had. Having a high Lp(a) was equivalent to having two SMuRFs. The findings support more widespread Lp(a) testing, according to the authors, whose study was published May 21, 2024, in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-02-female-boxer-quits-fight-biologically-male-opponent.html,Italian female boxer screams injustice as she quits fight against “biologically male” Algerian opponent 46 seconds into their Olympic match,0,"After just 46 seconds into an Olympic female boxing match and receiving two powerful punches in the head, Italy's Angela Carini called the game to end as she threw her helmet onto the mat. She cried injustice from being pitted against a ""biologically male"" Algerian boxer named Imane Khelif. ""This is unjust,"" she yelled. Carini, a 25-year-old police officer, yanked her hand away from the referee and walked off as the official raised Khelif's hand in the air. She also refused to shake hands with her opponent and fell to her knees on the boxing ring's floor, saying she had never felt such strong blows in a contest before. Her competitor Khelif has already been banned by the International Boxing Association from the 2023 world championships after failing testosterone tests to establish gender qualification. ""I've never taken a punch like that, it's impossible to continue. I'm nobody to say it's illegal. I got into the ring to fight. But I didn't feel like it anymore after the first minute. I started to feel a strong pain in my nose. I didn't give up, but a punch hurt too much so I said enough. I'm leaving with my head held high,"" Carini said. ""I am a fighter. My father taught me to be a warrior. When I am in the ring, I use that mindset, the mindset of a warrior, a winning mindset. This time I couldn't make it."" She was later taken away for medical assessment to examine the seriousness of her facial injuries which included a bruised nose. The female boxer said she did not quit the fight as a sign of protest against her rival's inclusion, but that was a decision for the Olympics to consider. ""I am not in the position of saying this is right or wrong. I did my job as a boxer, entering the ring and fighting. I didn't manage to, but I am exiting with my head held high and with a broken heart,"" she said. ""I am a mature woman, the ring is my life. I've always been very instinctive, but when I feel something is not going well, it's not a surrender but having the maturity to stop."" Meanwhile, Khelif said: ""God is willing me to be golden one."" The Algerian Boxing Federation also boasted about the win on Facebook. ""Congratulations to the Algerian boxer Iman Khalif, who responds strongly in the ring and qualifies for the quarterfinals, after defeating the Italian Angelina Carini in less than 46 seconds, effortlessly,"" it said. Controversial boxing match meets backlash from popular personalities, internet community Following the scandalous sporting event, where a ""mismatch"" has been alleged, popular personalities sent in their sentiments via the internet. Riley Gaines, a 12-time All-American and former collegiate swimmer at Kentucky who describes herself as a ""leader defending women's single-sex spaces,"" posted on X that "" Men don't belong in women's sports #IStandWithAngelaCarini."" X CEO Elon Musk immediately concurred with a resounding ""Absolutely!"" to her initial social media entry. In another entry, the swimmer also shared a photo of an emotional Carini on her knees in the ring, calling the moment ""heartbreaking."" ""This photo should haunt the [International Olympic Committee] IOC (but it won't),"" Gaines captioned the post. (Related: Former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines slams SFSU official for lauding violent transgender protesters .) Famous YouTuber-turned-boxer Logan Paul called the Olympic clash ""the purest form of evil unfolding right before your eyes."" ""A man was allowed to beat up a woman on a global stage, crushing her life's dream while fighting for her deceased father. This delusion must end,"" he tweeted. The internet community also blamed the IOC. Former U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss also reacted, saying: ""When will this madness stop? Men cannot become women . Why is the British Government not objecting to this?"" British Olympic hero Sharron Davies chimed in with: ""This is shocking. The IOC is a bloody disgrace. In effect legalizing beating up females. This must stop!!! What the hell's the matter with them?"" Harry Potter author JK Rowling called the match insane and inquired: ""What will it take to end this insanity?

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-does-everything-taste-salty-to-me,Why does everything taste salty to me?,1,"Q. Everything I eat lately tastes like it's been doused in salt, even if I know it hasn't. Why might this happen? A. This phenomenon certainly puts a damper on enjoying your food. But you should know there are many possible reasons food can taste oversalted. Do you have seasonal allergies? Sometimes postnasal drip leads to a salty sensation, as can an allergy to a particular food. Also on the list of potential culprits are gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, certain autoimmune conditions, and vitamin B12 deficiency. Even a chronically dry mouth — which can be a side effect of various medications — can make food taste especially salty. Even if you have one of these conditions, don't just accept living with a salty mouth. It's wise to mention the issue to your primary care doctor. She'll work with you to help improve your symptoms, which may be as easy as changing your medications. Otherwise, she may recommend some simple blood tests to investigate the cause.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/doomscrolling-dangers,Doomscrolling dangers,1,"What was the first thing you did when you woke up this morning? If you reached for your phone and scrolled through the news — scanning headline after headline blaring bad tidings — you're doing something called doomscrolling. And you're definitely not alone. It's an understandable urge: with wars raging across the world, frequent mass shootings, multiple climate disasters, and a polarized populace poised to vote in another presidential election, our newsfeeds are ablaze with distressing information. Many of us scan it hungrily, constantly; we hit refresh, and the stream starts anew. The phenomenon of doomscrolling — one of the Oxford English Dictionary's words of the year in 2020 — rose to prominence during the pandemic when our upended lives prodded us to relentlessly track the latest COVID casualties. But more than four years later, we're still living through tremendous social, political, and economic unrest, and doomscrolling has emerged as an insidious threat to our minds and bodies, Harvard experts say. With the media's propensity to blast mostly bad news (as the saying goes, ""if it bleeds, it leads""), ""we're not getting any messages about hope — it's all negativity,"" says Dr. Richard Mollica, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. ""It has been one onslaught after the other,"" agrees Dr. Aditi Nerurkar, a lecturer in the Division of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""Our brains and bodies are expertly designed to handle short bursts of stress. But over the past several years, the stress just doesn't seem to end. Doomscrolling is our response to that."" Women particularly vulnerable Who's susceptible? Every last one of us. ""If you have a device, it's open season for doomscrolling,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. The behavior is rooted in our brain's limbic system — often referred to as the lizard or reptilian brain — that's dominated by a structure called the amygdala. It promotes self-preservation and drives the fight-or-flight response to danger, fueling us to troll for threats. ""Stress stokes our primary urge to scroll,"" she says. ""We're hypervigilant and scanning for danger. The more you scroll, the more you feel you need to."" But two key groups are especially vulnerable: women and people with a history of trauma, Dr. Mollica says. Women are hit harder by doomscrolling because ""most of violent media is about hurting women and children,"" he says. Meanwhile, people who've lived through violence doomscroll out of fear, says Dr. Mollica, who is also director of the Harvard Program in Refugee Trauma at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""They don't feel safe in the world and want to get a handle on what's going on so they can calm their anxiety. But in these same people, doomscrolling acts as a trigger."" Physical and mental ripple effects Perhaps unsurprisingly, stomach-churning news has a tendency to turn our stomachs. But nausea is far from the only physical effect of doomscrolling. Others can include headaches, muscle tension, neck and shoulder pain, low appetite, difficulty sleeping, and even elevated blood pressure, according to Harvard experts. ""When people doomscroll for hours, they're sedentary for a long time too,"" Dr. Nerurkar notes. ""The ripple effects are vast and problematic."" In the wake of the pandemic, doomscrolling's mental health effects have been examined more extensively. An April 2023 research review published in Applied Research in Quality of Life analyzed three separate studies involving a total of about 1,200 adults, suggesting doomscrolling is linked to worse mental well-being and life satisfaction. An August 2024 study of 800 adults published in Computers in Human Behavior Reports reinforces those findings, suggesting doomscrolling evokes greater levels of existential anxiety — a feeling of dread or panic that arises when we confront the limitations of our existence. Yet another study in Computers in Human Behavior in April 2024 provided additional perspective, suggesting that employees who doomscroll while at work may become less engaged with their professional tasks. On a practical level, Dr. Nerurkar says, doomscrolling can give us ""popcorn brain,"" which happens when we spend too much time online. ""It's the real, biological phenomenon of feeling your brain is popping because you're being overstimulated online,"" she explains. ""Then it's hard to engage with the real world, which moves at a much slower pace."" How to cut back While keeping abreast of current events is essential, doomscrolling provides no extra benefits. ""We need to stay informed, but not at the expense of our mental health,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. ""And cutting back is not about abstinence; it's about decreasing reliance."" How to accomplish this? Strategies mainly revolve around creating ""digital boundaries that can give your brain and body a chance to recalibrate to normal,"" she says. Dr. Nerurkar and Dr. Mollica suggest these approaches: Keep your phone off your nightstand. That doesn't mean it can't be in the bedroom, but keeping your phone out of easy reach means you can't compulsively grab it upon waking. ""It could be the biggest game changer for your stress from doomscrolling,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. ""You're acclimating yourself instead to wake up to the light, look at your bed partner, and go to the bathroom and brush your teeth, creating a buffer to your stress response."" Follow suit in your work space. Similarly, place your phone in a desk drawer or 10 or more feet away from where you're planted during working hours. Don't bring your phone to the dinner table. At mealtime, leave your phone more than an arm's length away, and set it to silent mode. Switch your phone to grayscale. This type of visual boundary makes scrolling less enticing by dialing back the saturation levels of colors on your screen. ""There's some early data that this decreases screen time,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. Opt out of notifications. These types of beeps and dings — which alert us to new headlines, emails, messages, and the like — are self-selected. Opting out is as simple as reviewing your phone's settings. ""This is about re-establishing some boundaries,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. ""Are you using your device, or is your device using you?"" Focus on community news. Local headlines tend to be less doom-and-gloom and more uplifting. ""Stick to the environment you live in,"" Dr. Mollica says. Just say no. Tell people who are sharing depressing or violent stories that you're not interested. ""This puts you in control,"" Dr. Mollica says. ""You're not giving your power to someone else."" Focus on the good. Volunteer at a charity or another altruistic organization such as an animal shelter. Or take part in emotionally freeing activities, like a dance class or nature walks. ""You need to share positive emotional experiences with others,"" Dr. Mollica says. Talk to your doctor. If you find you can't stop doomscrolling or that it makes you extremely upset, it's time to discuss it with a professional. ""A small percentage of people really need professional help, and the best place to start is by talking to your primary care doctor about it,"" Dr. Mollica says. ""Certain problems are very hard to overcome on your own."" Image: © Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty Images",2,-0.23544636,-0.18128073,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-02-uk-high-court-upholds-ban-puberty-blockers.html,U.K. High Court of Justice upholds Downing Street’s ban on PUBERTY BLOCKERS,0,"A high court in the United Kingdom has upheld an earlier ban on puberty blockers put in place by the British government. Justice Beverley Lang of the High Court of Justice in London affirmed the prohibition in a July 29 decision . She cited the Cass Review commissioned by the National Health Service (NHS) to back up her ruling. According to the said study, the evidence supporting so-called ""gender-affirming care"" is weak and that there are unknown risks that come with puberty blockers. TransActual UK, an LGBT activist group, and an unnamed youth challenged the ban by former British Health Secretary Victoria Atkins on prescribing these puberty blockers. Lang upheld the prohibition, preventing the NHS from prescribing these medications outside of clinical trials and also limits their availability from private providers. (Related: Puberty blockers are QUACK medicine backed by nothing... chemical child abuse is now demanded by LGBT pushers conspiring with evil doctors .) The NHS had already ceased prescribing puberty blockers the previous year – citing insufficient evidence regarding their benefits and potential harms. TransActual Healthcare Director Chay Brown expressed concern that the government imposed the ban and subsequently sought justification for it. Brown highlighted the distress of young transgender individuals in the U.K. who feel neglected by the medical community and believe their existence has been politicized. While the ban was initiated by the recently ousted Conservative government, it might become a permanent measure under the new Labor administration. Incumbent British Health Secretary Wes Streeting endorsed the court's decision – emphasizing a cautious approach. Puberty blockers used in America to treat gender dysphoria despite lack of FDA approval Investigative journalist and author Gerry Posner pointed out that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved puberty blockers for treating gender dysphoria . He argues that these drugs can have serious and lasting effects. The U.S. regulator has approved these medications for other uses such as certain infertility issues, treating endometriosis, prostate cancer and a rare genetic condition in children. However, since puberty blockers are not FDA-approved for treating gender dysphoria, doctors prescribe these drugs to minors ""off-label"" for a purpose not officially approved by the FDA. In some U.S. states, teens as young as 15 can receive puberty blockers without parental consent. Supporters of puberty blockers argue that they are largely safe and reversible. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) claims these treatments can be stopped without lasting effects. However, a report from Britain's NHS suggests that these drugs may trap children in a treatment path as 96 to 98 percent of those who start puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones. Despite claims that puberty blockers have been safely used since the late 1980s, significant evidence points to serious long-term side effects. In 2017, the Center for Investigative Reporting disclosed that the FDA had received over 10,000 adverse event reports from women who took ""Lupron"" off-label as children to increase their height. The side effects included bone density loss, cognitive issues, dental issues, fertility problems, fibromyalgia, joint pains, migraines, mood swings, seizures, spinal problems and suicidal thoughts. Recently, the FDA added another warning about the risk of brain swelling and vision loss in children on these medications. The lack of conclusive research demonstrating that the benefits of puberty blockers outweigh the risks has led to increased scrutiny in the U.S. and internationally. Several U.S. states with Republican-majority legislatures have restricted or banned gender-affirming care for minors. Finland, Norway and Sweden have also scaled back the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for minors, citing concerns over side effects. In the U.K., the NHS closed its largest youth gender clinic after numerous clinicians resigned, alleging pressure to over-diagnose vulnerable youth and prescribe inappropriate treatments. Nevertheless, the prevailing medical practice in the U.S. and much of Europe continues to favor ""gender-affirming"" treatments over alternative approaches, like watchful waiting and therapy.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cooling-off-heartburn,Cooling off heartburn,1,"At some point, everyone experiences heartburn — that deep, painful burning sensation in the chest that can be so intense it's mistaken for a heart attack. Heartburn (also known as acid reflux) occurs when stomach acid flows backward into the esophagus, the tube connecting the mouth and stomach. It often happens when you eat too quickly or too much, or after you eat rich, spicy, or acidic foods. Heartburn usually goes away on its own, but sometimes you need an over-the-counter remedy to get relief. For more severe and ongoing heartburn, you might need stronger medication. Which should you use, and when? Here's a breakdown. Occasional heartburn For now-and-then heartburn, use antacids. They quickly neutralize digestive acids in the stomach and esophagus. ""They work well for people with mild, occasional heartburn and provide immediate relief,"" says Dr. Andrew T. Chan, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Liquid antacids provide faster relief, but many people find tablets more convenient. There are three categories of over-the-counter antacids: magnesium-based (Maalox, Mylanta), aluminum-based (Amphojel), and calcium-based (Tums, Rolaids). ""There aren't data to support whether one works better than the others,"" says Dr. Chan. Other products, like Gaviscon, contain both aluminum and magnesium. The combination of ingredients creates a foam layer when ingested, which floats to the top of the stomach to help block acid reflux. Another option is a seltzer (Alka-Seltzer), which has sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) as the active ingredient. ""These are the least powerful antacids,"" says Dr. Chan. They contain high levels of sodium, so do not take them if you are on a salt-restricted diet or have heart failure, high blood pressure, or kidney problems. Recurring heartburn If heartburn strikes many times a week, symptoms become more severe, or antacids don't work, you can try an over-the-counter H2 blocker. These work by blocking histamine, a chemical that signals the stomach to produce acid. ComBrands include famotidine (Pepcid) and cimetidine (Tagamet). H2 blockers are taken twice a day for one to two weeks. People whose heartburn is troublesome only at night often need only a single dose taken in the evening or at bedtime. ""H2 blockers are fine to take in the short term, but check with your doctor if you need to continue taking one after a few weeks,"" says Dr. Chan. ""They can prescribe a stronger H2 blocker if needed."" Also consult your doctor before taking an H2 blocker if you take a blood thinner, antidepressant, or blood pressure medication. Making changes If you take medication to manage recurring or persistent heartburn, you also should focus on adopting healthy lifestyle habits. They help reduce your dependence on drugs, and may even make it possible for you to stop taking them. For example: Weight loss and exercise. Losing excess weight and engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise daily can prevent flare-ups and reduce symptoms. Avoid trigger foods. Keep a daily food diary in which you list the foods and beverages that coincide with heartburn symptoms. Choose one and remove it from your diet for two weeks. Then add it back and note whether symptoms return. Repeat the process as needed until you find your trigger foods and drinks. Eat smaller meals. A large meal can remain in the stomach for several hours, increasing the risk of acid reflux. Eat frequent smaller meals a day instead of three large ones. Persistent heartburn If symptoms become intense or linger longer than two to three weeks despite taking an H2 blocker, you should consult your doctor. ""Persistent heartburn is caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD,"" says Dr. Chan. If you are diagnosed with GERD, your doctor will probably recommend a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), the strongest stomach acid inhibitor medication. PPIs — such as omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and esomeprazole (Nexium) — inhibit certain cells from ""pumping"" acid into the stomach, which lowers acid levels and reduces heartburn pain. PPIs are available over the counter or by prescription and are usually taken once daily. ""While both nonprescription and prescription PPIs work basically the same, your doctor will advise you on which one you need,"" says Dr. Chan. Long-term treatment with a PPI is often necessary, as heartburn usually returns when treatment ends. However, once your heartburn is under control, you may continue with a lower-dose PPI or switch to an H2 blocker. Image: © decade3d/Getty Images",1,0.3000572,-0.03742884,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/music-as-medicine,Music as medicine,1,"Just a few gentle strums of ukelele music can immediately transport us to a place of calm. This mysterious effect is one reason board-certified music therapist Lorrie Kubicek helps many patients take up the easy-to-play instrument after they're diagnosed with cancer or another major health condition — transforming a fraught situation into a constructive one. ""Instead of saying 'I have to go to the hospital for my chemo,' patients start saying, 'I have to go to the hospital for my ukelele lesson,'"" says Kubicek, co-director of the Katherine A. Gallagher Integrated Therapies Program at Harvard-affiliated Mass General Cancer Center. But music therapy is far more than a pleasant diversion, exemplifying how the art and science of medicine can work in tandem. With ancient roots — the Chinese character for medicine includes the character for music — the approach also helped rehabilitate World War II veterans' minds, bodies, and spirits. Characterized by personally tailored music interventions such as singing, songwriting, playing an instrument, listening to music, or moving to the beat, music therapy strikes a chord in many areas of medicine. Evidence increasingly suggests it helps people better manage disease symptoms and treatment side effects by curbing stress, soothing pain, promoting sleep, and boosting focus. ""Music connects you to a part of yourself that's well, and that's true no matter what patient population we're working with,"" Kubicek says. ""Music remains, no matter the challenges a person is facing."" Personalized approach Music therapy isn't the same thing as music medicine, in which patients simply wear headphones and listen to their favorite music for relaxation or distraction while undergoing medical treatment. It also doesn't require any musical background or experience to participate or benefit. The therapy begins with a one-on-one assessment with a music therapist to explore how each person relates to music and what problems they may face. ""We combine this information with evidence-based interventions to help patients feel, deal, or heal as quickly as possible,"" Kubicek says. ""We figure out how music can help you move toward your goals in a way that sets you up for success."" Building on decades of research, recent studies indicate this type of intervention can provide important relief by reducing anxiety during medical treatment, according to a 2021 research review published in Psychiatry Research. ""We see this all the time,"" she says. ""Because of music's connection to the limbic system in the brain, it can help you access the relaxation response and calm your nervous system, slowing down your breathing. It really helps shift your mind from what it's stuck on or worried about and helps you land in the moment you're in."" People with Alzheimer's disease were the focus of a research review published online in March 2023 by Alzheimer's Research and Therapy, which suggested that music therapy improved memory, attention, and orientation in these patients. And for people with psychiatric illnesses such as depression, Kubicek says, music therapy can ""bring energy and joy back at a very dark time in people's lives. It's also really beautiful to see how music can connect people of different ages and stages, cognitive abilities, and cultures."" Stretching the benefits Regardless of diagnosis, music therapy can hit the right notes as long as you feel a connection to music. ""You don't need to be a musician. You just need to love music and have something you want to develop or nurture,"" she says. You also don't need to wait for your doctor to offer music therapy. Ask her — or your local hospital or clinic — to refer you to a program. ""If you do have a specific diagnosis, you can always ask your health care team,"" Kubicek says. You can also find a music therapist near you through the American Music Therapy Association. To maximize the therapy's benefits, find a balance between taking risks and staying in your comfort zone, Kubicek advises. ""When we're exploring music, often we're trying something new for the first time,"" she says. ""Find that 'stretch zone,' because you don't know the full effect of what music can do for you until you try."" Image: © Aflo Images/Getty Images",8,0.039489813,-0.037394732,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/drinks-on-a-plane-consider-saying-no,Drinks on a plane: Consider saying no,1,"Some people enjoy having a bit of bubbly when jetting off to a new locale, perhaps as a way to toast the start of an adventure. But drinking champagne or any other alcoholic beverage on an airplane might pose risks ranging from falls to heart attacks. This is particularly true if you intend to sleep on the flight, such as on a long-haul overnight flight. So it might be time to rethink your drink order. Your body on a plane Before you even take a sip of alcohol, your body experiences physiological effects of being high above sea level: there's less atmospheric pressure to force oxygen into red blood cells for delivery throughout your body, and blood oxygen drops from normal levels of 96%–100% to about 90%, or even below 90%. Your body has a way to compensate for that. You breathe faster to take in more oxygen. Your heart rate increases to move blood through your system faster. However, reduced blood oxygen levels and increased heart rates can be dangerous for people with a heart condition. Complicating factors Small dips in blood oxygen can become more pronounced on a plane when you add other factors into the mix, and drinking alcohol is one of them. ""Some studies suggest that alcohol impairs the ability of red blood cells to take up oxygen by altering hemoglobin, the molecule that actually carries the oxygen,"" says Dr. Matthew Mosquera, medical director of the Alcohol, Drugs, and Addiction Inpatient Program at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. The following factors can also lead to lower blood oxygen: Aging: Our ability to adapt to changes in blood oxygen levels declines as we age. Sleeping: Breathing normally slows during sleep, even on an airplane. Underlying conditions: Less oxygen gets to your lungs if you have lung disease, sleep apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep), or heart problems. What's the risk? The more contributors to low blood oxygen you have, the harder it becomes for your body to compensate, especially on a plane. That was illustrated in a study published online June 3, 2024, by Thorax. Researchers wanted to know more about the combined effects of alcohol consumption and airplane cabin pressure during sleep on a plane. They randomly assigned 48 healthy people (ages 18 to 40) to spend two nights sleeping at normal air pressure or at the equivalent of airplane cabin pressure. Participants drank alcohol (the equivalent of two beers or two glasses of wine) before one of the nights and were sober for the other. They also wore devices measuring their blood oxygen and heart rate. Compared to sleeping in normal air pressure, sleeping in airplane cabin pressure made blood oxygen levels lower and heart rates higher. Combining drinking and sleeping when in airplane cabin pressure made oxygen levels even lower and heart rate even higher. ""Drinking and sleeping on a plane puts a big strain on your body, especially your cardiovascular system,"" Dr. Mosquera says. ""And there's even more strain if you have heart or lung disease. It places you at a higher risk for a heart attack or stroke."" Other alcohol risks on a plane Drinking alcohol on a plane poses additional health risks.

What you should do Is it best to pass on alcohol when the drink cart approaches? That depends. ""If you're healthy, drinking in moderation might be okay,"" Dr. Mosquera says. However, he urges you to consider the following: Think twice about drinking alcohol and taking certain medications. Alcohol can worsen drowsiness from drugs that make you sleepy. Drink extra water. This will help your body flush out the alcohol, and prevent dehydration caused by alcohol. Be mindful of your balance. Take your time going from a sitting position to standing, to avoid falls. And if you have heart or lung disease, sleep apnea, or chronic lung disease, or if you've had a stroke in the past — especially if you plan to sleep on the flight — it may be wisest not to drink alcohol.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/protect-your-skin-during-heat-waves-heres-how-202408143066,Protect your skin during heat waves — here's how,1,"Global average temperatures have soared in 2024, surpassing records set just last year. Extreme heat poses numerous health risks, some of which are visible on our skin. Understanding how heat affects your skin can help you take measures to prevent or ease heat rash, eczema, rosacea, the discoloration of melasma, and many other skin conditions sparked or worsened by high temperatures. How does heat affect your skin? Heat waves can provoke or worsen several skin conditions. Heat rash (miliaria) occurs due to obstruction of sweat ducts on the skin, which are responsible for helping the body maintain a normal temperature by releasing water to the surface of the skin. As these sweat glands get blocked with excessive sweat on an extremely hot day, they do not function properly and red itchy bumps develop. Grover disease, a rash of small, red, itchy bumps on the chest and back, can also be triggered or worsened by excessive heat and sweating. Often this clears up within a few weeks or months. Less often symptoms may persist for years, with flares during the summer months. Eczema is a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, itchy plaques that affects millions of people in the United States. Increased sweating during heat waves can lead to skin irritation and inflammation, aggravating eczema symptoms. Dehydration caused by fluid loss through sweating can make the skin more susceptible to eczema flare-ups. Rosacea, which causes facial redness, visible blood vessels, and acne-like bumps, is also heat-sensitive. Heat causes blood vessels to dilate as the body attempts to cool itself, resulting in visible redness and flushing. High temperatures, especially combined with sun exposure, can cause flare ups. Melasma. Hyperpigmentation disorders like melasma also worsen with heat. Melasma is characterized by irregular dark patches on the face and is often triggered by UV exposure from the sun. Heat can increase the activity of melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment, making these patches more pronounced. Additionally, the combined effects of heat and UV radiation accelerate collagen and elastin degradation, leading to premature aging and loss of skin elasticity. Skin cancer risk rises with increased exposure to UV radiation. Heat waves — now beginning earlier, ending later, and lasting longer — contribute to UV exposure, particularly among people who work outdoors. And preliminary research suggests prolonged exposure to high temperatures may further boost skin cancer risk. This could be of particular concern for firefighters, who face extended exposure to extreme heat. Heat waves, air pollution, and skin During heat waves, levels of environmental pollutants like ozone and particulate matter can rise. And reactions between these pollutants, heat, and UV radiation spawn secondary pollutants such as peroxyacetyl nitrates (PANs). Pollutants like these can irritate the skin and contribute to inflammation through oxidative stress and DNA damage, so inflammatory conditions such as eczema and rosacea may worsen. Can heat affect medications? High temperatures compromise the effectiveness of certain medications. For instance, EpiPens, which are crucial for managing life-threatening allergic reactions, can lose their potency when exposed to high temperatures. Check the instructions on all of your medicines to see which ones should be stored in a cool, dry place or refrigerated. If you're not sure which medicines might be affected by heat, talk to your pharmacist or doctor. Retinoids in skin care products, antibiotics taken for acne, and immunomodulators for autoimmune diseases can make skin more susceptible to sun damage. This can lead to severe sunburns or rashes known as photodermatoses. If you experience this, contact your health care team for advice. Protect your skin when temperatures climb Keep skin cool Wear light, breathable clothing. Choose natural fibers like cotton and linen to help regulate body temperature and prevent sweat-induced skin issues. Avoid synthetic fabrics, which can trap heat and moisture. Take cool baths or showers. Use cool or tepid water to bathe. Avoid hot showers, which can strip the skin of natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation. Find cool spaces. If your home is not air-conditioned, seek out cooler places and ways to cool off during heat waves. Keep skin hydrated Drink ample water and eat water-rich foods. Foods like watermelon and cucumbers can provide additional hydration. Moisturize your skin. Apply light, non-comedogenic moisturizers immediately after bathing. Look for ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin, which are beneficial for enhancing skin hydration. Limit exposure to sun and pollution Use protective clothing. Wear wide-brimmed hats, UV-blocking sunglasses, and long-sleeved shirts to shield the skin from harmful radiation. Wear sunscreen. Apply broad-spectrum mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, or iron oxide to protect against UV radiation and pollutants. Use topical antioxidants. Use products like vitamin C in your morning skin care routine to mitigate oxidative stress. Wash up. Cleansing face and body at the end of the day may help you limit skin exposure to pollutants while also rinsing off any sunscreen residue.",0,0.033576608,-0.12676722,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/lifestyle-strategies-to-help-prevent-natural-age-related-decline-in-testosterone,Lifestyle strategies to help prevent natural age-related decline in testosterone,1,"As men get older, their testosterone levels naturally decrease, which can cause undesirable symptoms for some. However, adopting healthy lifestyle habits can help improve or maintain testosterone levels. What is testosterone and what does it do? Testosterone is a hormone primarily produced in the testes. It plays a crucial role in male development and characteristics, influencing muscle mass, bone density, and sex drive. It's also important for regulating mood and cognitive function. Testosterone levels change throughout life: they are low before puberty, increase sharply during puberty, and then gradually decrease by about 1% each year, although there are some exceptions. What can cause levels of testosterone to drop? Signals from the brain to the pituitary gland regulate testosterone production in men. The pituitary gland, which is found at the base of the brain, sends messages to the testes to produce testosterone. A ""feedback loop"" carefully monitors levels of this hormone in the blood. Anything that affects this system can contribute to declining testosterone levels. Aging is the most common cause, but other genetic and acquired conditions can also lead to drops in testosterone. These include: obesity chronic diseases, such as kidney disease, diabetes, lung disease, and cirrhosis critical illness, such as a heart attack, surgery, or head trauma certain medications, such as glucocorticoids (steroids) and opioids congenital disorders, such as Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome stress sleep apnea tumors. What are the symptoms of low testosterone? Many men with low testosterone never have symptoms. When symptoms do occur, low testosterone can cause a range of effects. Some symptoms are general, such as fatigue, poor concentration, and mood changes. Others are more specific, such as: reduced sex drive erectile dysfunction infertility physical changes including decreased muscle mass, increased body fat, and thinning hair. If you have any of these symptoms, ask your doctor if it might be related to low testosterone. He or she can order a blood test to check the level. Because blood testosterone levels can fluctuate, it's important to do the test in the morning before 10 a.m. In general, a normal total testosterone level is 300 ng/dL or higher. Natural ways to help maintain testosterone levels Certain lifestyle habits can help slow the natural testosterone decline that comes with age. Doctors often recommend a trial of intense lifestyle changes for men with low testosterone before considering medications. Here are some natural ways to maintain and improve testosterone levels as you age. Maintain a healthy weight and lose weight if needed Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for testosterone levels. Excess body fat, particularly around the abdomen, can contribute to lower testosterone. Losing weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise can help boost testosterone production up to 30%, according to some research. Exercise Regular physical activity is one of the best ways to maintain healthy testosterone levels. Both resistance training like weightlifting, and cardiovascular exercises such as running or swimming, can increase testosterone. The largest improvements are seen with moderate- or high-intensity resistance exercises involving large muscle groups, such as squats and bench presses. Other lifestyle changes Other factors that can affect testosterone levels include: Diet. Well-rounded diets full of healthy fats, proteins, and nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables support healthy testosterone production. Foods that have been linked to increased testosterone include onions, oysters, fatty fish (which contains healthy omega-3 fats), and extra virgin olive oil. Alcohol. Excessive alcohol consumption can lower testosterone levels, impair sexual function, and reduce sperm count due to hormone disruption. Reduce or avoid alcohol, or at least limit your intake to no more than one drink per day. Smoking. Nicotine found in cigarettes and chewing tobacco has been linked to lower testosterone levels, though some studies suggest smoking may not affect or could even increase these levels. However, smoking can negatively affect male reproductive health, including sperm count, motility, and morphology. Quitting smoking may help some men restore a normal testosterone level. Environmental toxins. Chemicals found in certain plastics, including bisphenol A or BPA, disrupt hormone-producing glands and have been associated with decreased testosterone levels and reduced sperm count. Try to avoid BPA-containing products such as plastic bottles, containers, and certain canned foods. Instead, look for ""BPA-free"" labels. The role of sleep in testosterone production Adequate sleep is essential for maintaining testosterone levels. Most testosterone release occurs during sleep, particularly during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage. Sleep apnea, a condition in which you stop breathing for short periods while you are asleep, can negatively affect hormone levels, including testosterone. Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night to support healthy hormone production. If you have sleep apnea or are concerned you may have symptoms of this condition, talk with your doctor about treatment options. Manage stress to help libido Chronic stress can also negatively impact testosterone levels and libido. High stress increases cortisol, a hormone that can interfere with testosterone production. Stress affects not only the body but also the mind. It can cause mental distractions and make it hard to focus on or enjoy sex. Additionally, stress can impact your mood, potentially leading to anxiety and depression, both of which can reduce your interest in sex. Enhancing mental well-being through relaxation techniques and mindfulness, and adopting a healthier lifestyle to minimize the negative effects of stress, are important for maintaining testosterone levels and healthy libido.",7,0.2995645,-0.08379846,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-01-cdc-facebook-colluded-censor-covid-vaccine-questions.html,"CDC, Facebook colluded to CENSOR COVID-19 vaccine safety FAQs, emails reveal",0,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborated with Facebook to censor questions about the safety of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) injections , according to emails recently made public. The emails were part of the latest set of documents obtained by America First Legal (AFL) via litigation against the public health agency. These documents reveal further evidence of collusion between the CDC and social media companies to stiffen free speech under the government’s label of ""misinformation"" and twist and shape the public narratives. The documents released by AFL shows how the CDC worked with the social media platform, referencing in particular an email chain between the agency and Facebook. The platform owned by Mark Zuckerberg sent draft content to the CDC for approval. (Related: The censorship boomerang .) In the exchange, Facebook's Genelle Adrien emailed CDC Digital Media Director Carol Crawford asking for approval of an ""FAQ Content"" section on Facebook's ""COVID-19 Information Center. The information centered on the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. ""Of concern to Adrien was particularly what the platform's users should be allowed to say about the vaccine's side effects. And CDC provided that guidance – some words were replaced, and other sentences were removed,"" LifeSiteNews wrote. Crawford responded by making a few changes to the content. The ""joint pain"" originally listed as a side effect was gone, replaced with ""nausea."" She also asked to remove a line that stated, ""More serious side effects are extremely rare. A person is far more likely to be seriously harmed by a disease than by its vaccine."" According to the CDC official, the public health agency didn't have ""any cleared language to support"" the statements. Biden admin still encouraging people to get injected According to the pro-life news outlet, ""trying to refute collusive practices involving major social media companies is probably not high on the agenda of the U.S. government right this moment. Nevertheless, the evidence of the highly controversial practice keeps rolling in."" The CDC thereby appears to have admitted that in May 2021, months after the vaccine had already been rolled out, they could not confirm that the vaccine was safer than contracting COVID-19 itself and developing natural immunity. Nonetheless, the CDC continued to push the American people to take the vaccine . There are various ways to interpret this decision, but one is that the CDC by proxy, as Facebook’s guidance adviser, may have wished to avoid the risk of getting sued. Alas, it did get sued by AFL – but for colluding with Facebook. Even though the original language was fairly ""soft"" – if anything, the social platform looked keen to minimize any serious side effects, and promote the vaccines – it was too much for CDC to stand behind. Despite this admission, the Biden administration continued to urge people to get injected with the COVID-19 vaccine throughout the year. Even President Joe Biden himself joined in the calls, warning that unvaccinated people would ""soon overwhelm hospitals” with “a winter of severe illness and death"" up ahead. ""For [the] unvaccinated, we are looking at a winter of severe illness and death – if you’re unvaccinated – for themselves, their families, and the hospitals they’ll soon overwhelm,"" the chief executive said at the time.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-01-big-pharma-admits-mrna-vaccine-causes-cancer.html,Big Pharma admits mRNA vaccine causes CANCER,0,"Pharmaceutical giants have finally admitted that the experimental mRNA vaccine can cause cancer . The revelation that DNA contamination can lead to birth defects or cancer surfaced when Dr. Robert Malone, the biochemist who helped invent the mRNA vaccine, made an appearance at House of Representatives hearing led by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). According to Malone, Moderna has a patent that acknowledges RNA is preferable to DNA in vaccines due to risks of insertional mutagenesis, which might activate oncogenes or inhibit tumor suppressor genes. ""Moderna has a patent on the use of RNA for vaccines,"" Malone stated. ""And in that, Moderna explicitly acknowledges that RNA is superior to DNA for vaccine purposes because problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis that could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes."" ""FDA [ Food and Drug Administration ] says they're not aware of any concerns, but Moderna, in its patent, lays out the same concerns about DNA in insertional mutagenesis and genotoxicity,"" Malone continued. He added that Moderna knew DNA was a contaminant but was left in because of how they make it. ""They use DNA to make RNA, and then they degrade the DNA and then they have to purify the degraded DNA away from the RNA and the process they are using is not that good,"" he said. Another Big Pharma company also eventually acknowledged that its jabs, which were meant to ""cure"" COVID-19, are also contaminated with cancer-causing DNA fragments. In the documentation to regulatory bodies, Pfizer omitted information about the presence of Simian Virus 40 sequences in its vaccine. The documentation suggests that there are certain DNA sequences present in the vials that are normally not allowed in anything that is going to go into humans, ""not the least of which is an antibiotic resistance gene,"" Malone explained. “They include these sequences from SV 40 – not the whole virus, but highly active promoter sequences – which is exactly the thing that the FDA in their older regulations said must be avoided because it confers even more risk for insertional mutagenesis.” He added that the FDA did not take the raw DNA sequences, reconstruct those plasmid maps and look at them themselves. Instead, they took for granted what Pfizer had given them. “And now this is all coming out because of what these researchers found,” he further said. Malone warned that the potential consequences for jab recipients are ""anything that is associated with DNA damage, i.e., birth defects and cancer being the most notable ones."" (Related: Moderna’s mRNA COVID jab 30% more deadly than Pfizer’s, VAERS data shows .) Get ready for the ""updated COVID-19 vaccines"" Despite the recent admission, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s updated vaccine is expected to be available in either August or September. According to public health officials, they preferred the term ""updated vaccines"" in line with the need to formulate a new vaccine every year to match circulating variants like what they did for the flu shot. ""Historically, when we're talking about COVID vaccines, we're talking about boosters that would happen at some time post your previous vaccine,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, the chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital. ""Now we're targeting annual vaccines for COVID-19 that are similar to flu. It's a reformulation based on what's circulating, and this is why we're talking about an annual campaign rather than a booster."" The updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccines will target the JN.1 lineage of the virus, which is claimed to be an offshoot of the omicron variant. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be available for six-month-old babies and adults while the Novavax vaccine will be available for those aged 12 and older. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Americans receive the updated 2024-25 vaccine when it becomes available. ""CDC recommends everyone ages six months and older receive an updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the potentially serious outcomes of COVID-19 this fall and winter whether or not they have ever previously been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine,"" the CDC website indicated. The updated jab is not considered a booster. ""We have to remember that this virus is constantly changing and that your protection from previous infection or previous vaccines declines over time,"" Brownstein said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heart-palpitations-identifying-possible-causes-and-managing-triggers,Heart palpitations: Identifying possible causes and managing triggers,1,"Do you occasionally feel your heart doing flip-flops when you're stressed or nervous — for example, right before you give a big presentation? These are called heart palpitations. They are very common, but they can feel scary. Here's a closer look at what heart palpitations are, what they feel like, causes, and, when you might need to worry. What are heart palpitations? Have you ever noticed your heart seeming to beat more forcefully or faster than usual? This is known as heart palpitations. They happen to a lot of people — in fact, they are one of the top reasons people see their primary care provider or even a cardiologist. Heart palpitations may feel uncomfortable, but most of the time they're harmless. They should always be checked out by your doctor, however, in case they're being triggered by an underlying medical condition. What do heart palpitations feel like? If you have heart palpitations, you may feel like your heart is pounding or racing. You may also feel it not just in your chest, but in your neck. Some people describe a sensation of ""flip-flopping"" in their chest, where their heart seems to skip a beat. Some people experience heart palpitations all day. Others just notice heart palpitations at night, during exercise, or in times of stress. What causes heart palpitations? There are many different causes of heart palpitations. These include: Physical stress or strong emotions. Heart palpitations can be brought on by physical stress, such as intense exercise, or a fever. They can be triggered by strong emotions as well. When you are upset, your body releases stress hormones that can affect your heart rate. Heart conditions. Sometimes heart palpitations are due to an electrical misfire in your heart that causes it to beat quickly or erratically. One of the most common causes is atrial fibrillation, a rapid, irregular heartbeat. Hormonal changes. Up to 42% of perimenopausal women and 54% of postmenopausal women report that they experience heart palpitations. Certain substances. Caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine can all trigger heart palpitations. Metabolic changes. Low blood sugar can lead to heart palpitations. You may also experience them if your body produces too much thyroid hormone, a condition known as hyperthyroidism. Do you need to worry about heart palpitations? See your doctor if you have heart palpitations; most of the time, they can find the trigger. The evaluation usually involves a test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical signals of your heart. If you have heart palpitations but a normal ECG, your doctor may ask you to wear a heart monitor for a couple of weeks. You push a button on the portable device when you feel a heart palpitation, and that information is sent to your doctor. It can help to pinpoint a cause. Sometimes, heart palpitations can indicate a heart attack or stroke if they occur along with other symptoms. Call 911 if you also experience: shortness of breath chest pain or pressure — it may be constant, or it may come and go chest discomfort that radiates into your arms, back, stomach, neck, or jaw sweating, nausea, or lightheadedness. Lifestyle changes to prevent heart palpitations If your heart palpitations aren't due to an underlying medical condition, the following lifestyle changes may help to prevent them or reduce their frequency. Try vagal maneuvers. These are physical movements you can do to stimulate your vagus nerve, which helps to control your heart rate. Your doctor may recommend that you: cough hold your breath and bear down, like you are having a bowel movement place an ice-cold towel over your face. Steer clear of certain substances. Limit caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, certain soft drinks, and even chocolate. Don't have more than one alcoholic beverage per day. More than that can promote palpitations in some people, and it increases the risk of atrial fibrillation. In addition, don't smoke or consume nicotine-containing products. Tweak your medications. Certain drugs can trigger heart palpitations. These include asthma inhalers and some over-the-counter cough and cold medications. Your doctor may be able to suggest alternatives. Manage stress. If you are depressed or anxious, your body releases stress hormones that can impact your heart rate. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to help you manage your emotions, such as regular exercise, talk therapy, and relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga. Medical treatment for heart palpitations If your palpitations are due to an underlying medical condition such as atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, or hyperthyroidism, your doctor can recommend medication to get that condition under control.",0,0.22204137,-0.15697947,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/weighing-in-on-weight-gain-from-antidepressants-202408023063,Weighing in on weight gain from antidepressants,1,"If you're struggling with depression, the most important question about taking an antidepressant is whether it will work. But another question on your mind may be whether it will fuel weight gain. A new study provides some context by suggesting how much weight, on average, people taking one of eight commonly used antidepressants might expect to gain. This insight is valuable, since people with depression often stop taking antidepressants because they don't like the effect on their weight, a Harvard expert says. ""It's important to acknowledge that weight gain is a key reason that some people decide to stop antidepressants, even if they're otherwise working well,"" says Dr. Roy Perlis, associate chief of psychiatric research at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""It's also a reason people may be reluctant to start them in the first place, even if they're quite depressed or anxious."" What did the study look at? Published July 2024 in Annals of Internal Medicine, the new study drew on data from more than 183,000 people between ages 20 and 80. Their average age was 48, and 65% were women. Most were overweight or obese at the study's start. The researchers analyzed participants' electronic health records and body mass index. They gauged weight gain or loss at regular intervals — six, 12, and 24 months — after people began taking an antidepressant for the first time. The study compared the weight-related effects of sertraline (Zoloft) to seven other antidepressant medications: escitalopram (Lexapro) paroxetine (Paxil) duloxetine (Cymbalta) citalopram (Celexa) fluoxetine (Prozac) venlafaxine (Effexor) bupropion (Wellbutrin). What did the research find? The antidepressants led to the following average weight gain: sertraline: Nearly 0.5 pounds at six months; 3.2 pounds at 24 months escitalopram: 1.4 pounds at six months; 3.6 pounds at 24 months paroxetine: 1.4 pounds at six months; 2.9 pounds at 24 months duloxetine: 1.2 pounds at six months; 1.7 pounds at 24 months. Citalopram, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine didn't confer lower or higher odds of weight gain than Zoloft, the study found. And only bupropion was associated with a small amount of weight loss — 0.25-pounds — at six months. But that trend reversed at 24 months, when bupropion led to an average weight gain of 1.2 pounds. What does the study tell us? ""Weight gain is common among antidepressant users, even if the amounts gained on average are modest,"" says Dr. Perlis, who was not involved in this new study. It underscores similar findings from other studies of antidepressants, including research he published with colleagues a decade ago. ""While differences in weight gain for specific antidepressants tend to be small, there are certainly some — like bupropion — that tend to cause less weight gain,"" he notes. It's crucial to keep in mind that the study points out average weight gain. Many people taking antidepressants won't gain any weight and others could gain more. ""Still, having average values to work with — and seeing that these averages line up well with prior studies — at least lets us give people a sense of what they might expect,"" he says. ""One caution is that some people lose weight as a result of depression, which can impact appetite,"" he adds, ""so some of what we're seeing may be people regaining weight they'd lost as their depression or anxiety improves."" What additional limitations did the study have? Other limitations may have shaped the findings. The study was observational, meaning it cannot prove that antidepressants cause weight changes, only that they were linked with them. It wasn't a randomized, controlled trial — considered the gold standard in research — and the participants taking antidepressants weren't compared to a control group not taking the medications. Additionally, only about one in three participants was still taking their initially prescribed medication six months after the study started. That makes it difficult to link any later weight changes with a specific medication. ""As with any study that's not randomized, we don't know if the differences between medicines could reflect other differences in who gets prescribed these medicines,"" Dr. Perlis says. ""But, for circumstances where a randomized trial is unrealistic, health records can be a helpful way of trying to study side effects and at least generate a partial answer to these important questions."" What else should you consider? Another thing to consider, if you're taking an antidepressant, is what types of side effects you're willing to tolerate in pursuit of its mood-smoothing benefits. ""The best way to manage side effects is to anticipate them — to have an open conversation with your doctor about the potential risks and how we'll manage them if they occur,"" Dr. Perlis says. What can you discuss with your doctor? If weight gain is a particular concern for you, you may also wish to consider nondrug treatments for depression. They include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy that teaches people to become aware of their thought patterns and adjust them during stressful moments to reframe their thinking. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a brain stimulation therapy that is noninvasive. It uses an electromagnetic coil placed on the scalp to deliver magnetic pulses that stimulate nerve cells to brain regions involved in depression. ""We know that certain kinds of talk therapies, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, can be very effective for treating depression and anxiety disorders,"" Dr. Perlis says. ""Whether people choose talk therapy or antidepressant medications can depend on their preference. It's important to have multiple options.""",8,0.23774664,0.08645521,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/top-5-ways-to-reduce-crippling-hand-pain,Top 5 ways to reduce crippling hand pain,1,"Hand pain is more than just annoying. The stiffness and swelling that go along with hand pain can sap strength and diminish the ability to carry out routine functions, like buttoning clothes. One common cause of hand pain is osteoarthritis—when the shock-absorbing cartilage between bones in the finger joints and at the base of the thumb becomes worn or damaged. Hand pain can also result from nerve conditions, like the pain and tingling you feel when there is pressure on the median nerve in the wrist (the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome) or the ulnar nerve near the elbow. Sometimes hand pain results from tendinitis, an inflammation of the tissue that attaches muscles to the bones. Here are five methods to help manage hand pain, retain hand function, and avoid surgery. 1. Splinting A splint stabilizes the position of your fingers, thumb, or wrist. You can wear a splint for a few weeks if arthritis flares, so the inflammation can settle down. 2. Injections An injection of a corticosteroid into a joint can reduce inflammation. The relief it provides can last for many months. For some people the amount of relief diminishes with subsequent injections. 3. NSAIDs A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) helps relieve hand pain by blocking enzymes that produce pain and swelling, but it's not effective for carpal tunnel syndrome. Long-term use of oral NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are linked to ulcers, stomach bleeding, liver damage, and increased risk of heart attacks. Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac (Voltaren), pose less risk. 4. Heat and cold Heat can loosen hand stiffness. Even a hot shower will do the job. Cold is effective for hand pain that results from activity, such as playing golf. Apply it in the form of flexible gel pads you keep in the freezer, or even bags of frozen peas or corn, which conform well to the three-dimensional complexities of the hand. 5. Exercises and stretches These focus on your hand's tendons and muscles. A physical therapist or occupational therapist can guide you through exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles, which can help absorb the stress on joints in the hand and reduce pain.

For example, you might need to help a loved one with bathing, dressing, eating, and getting in and out of a car. It takes physical strength and stamina. Caregiving also puts you through an emotional wringer. It's common to feel frustration with the unpredictability of your loved one's behavior: one day they understand and recognize you, but the next day they don't. You might feel helpless if you don't know how to communicate with a loved one or how to cope with dementia-specific behaviors such as sundowning (meltdowns at the end of each day). You might feel anguish that they might not be getting adequate care. Above all, you probably feel grief at gradually losing the individual you once knew. ""Caregivers might also experience anger from the demands of nonstop caregiving. Then, recognizing their anger, caregivers might immediately feel guilty about resenting the loved one or having a desire to take time for themselves,"" says Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. The combination of stressors puts caregivers at high risk for burnout, high blood pressure, sleep problems, depression, isolation, weight changes, and even premature death. What you can do Resolving caregiving challenges is an ongoing process. Here are some ways to get started. For logistical challenges: Talk to your loved one's doctors about whether you can consolidate numerous appointments on the same days or do some visits as a video or phone call. For help finding services: Your local Area Agency on Aging can provide a free comprehensive list of services tailored to your loved one's needs and connect you to the people who provide them. The agency can also guide you to groups in your area that might help pay for services such as respite care or transportation. Alternatively, ask your local health care system if it has a comprehensive dementia care program that provides similar help. Many systems are ramping up dementia care navigation services as a result of a new initiative from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services called Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE). It pays providers to offer caregiver training, help lines, care navigators, and individual care plans. You can also turn to the ARCH National Respite Network and Resource Center, a national resource program to direct you to respite services in your area. For help coping emotionally: Join a free caregiver support group — either online, such as those offered by the Family Caregiver Alliance, or in person (if time permits) at a senior center or local hospital. Or work with a therapist online (it's covered by your own Medicare). ""For example, if you feel guilty about negative emotions, a therapist might acknowledge your struggle with guilt and help you understand that perfection is impossible. You'll be guided to establish realistic goals,"" Dr. Collier says. To avoid burnout: ""Caregiving often requires a team, so don't feel bad asking for help from friends and family or hiring health aides at home,"" Dr. Collier says. ""The assistance can give you a much-needed break. And taking time for yourself is not just okay, it's recommended. You need to exercise, get enough sleep, see your doctors, and take part in pleasurable activities, such as spending time with friends or reading a book. Caregiving is a marathon, with endless things to do, but you must set the priority to recharge regularly.""

https://www.infowars.com/posts/euthanasia-now-responsible-for-1-in-20-deaths-in-canada,Euthanasia Now Responsible for 1 in 20 Deaths in Canada,0,"One in 20 people who die in Canada are being euthanised, according to new statistics. Voluntary euthanasia led to the deaths of over 15,000 people in Canada last year. The average age of euthanasia subjects was 77. Around 95% had “reasonably foreseeable” deaths in their near future due to conditions like cancer. Nearly 40% of the deaths came in Quebec, which accounts for around 20% of the Canadian population. The Canadian government legalised euthanasia in 2016, joining the ranks of Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Austria and the Netherlands. There has been significant controversy over the introduction and expansion of the “medically assisted dying” or MAiD program; although polling suggests that there is widespread support for the program. In October, an expert committee reported that patients were asking to be killed for social reasons such as isolation and homelessness, rather than having a terminal illness or unmanageable pain. Data suggest that those asking to be killed in Ontario are far more likely to require disability support and be socially isolated. Trudo Lemmens, a professor at the University of Toronto, said medical professional bodies and judicial authorities in Canada appeared to be “unwilling to curtail practices that appear ethically problematic.” “Either the law is too broad, or the professional guidance not precise enough,” Lemmens said. “Or it is simply not seen as a priority to protect some of our most vulnerable citizens.” The British House of Commons recently passed a euthanasia bill. The bill still needs to pass the Lords in order to become law.",9,-0.09882864,0.07945229,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-i-use-a-continuous-glucose-monitor,Should I use a continuous glucose monitor?,1,"Q. I'm overweight, but don't have diabetes yet. Should I use a continuous glucose monitor, like people with diabetes do? A. Increasingly, new technologies are allowing us to monitor how our body is functioning. Smart watches and specialized rings monitor the number of steps we take and flights we climb, our heart and breathing rates, and our blood oxygen levels. People with diabetes need to monitor their level of blood sugar, often multiple times a day, to make sure it doesn't get either too high or too low. When I was beginning my medical career, measuring blood sugar levels required a venipuncture (using a needle to take a blood sample). That was not something a patient could do, so instead we asked patients to collect several urine samples a day and use a kit to measure the level of sugar in it. That gave a crude indication of when blood sugars were too high, but didn't help determine when sugars were too low. Then, new technology allowed people to prick a fingertip, collect a drop of blood on a special test strip, and use a machine to measure the blood sugar level. This was more accurate than the urine testing and much more feasible than multiple venipunctures each day, but people didn't much like pricking their fingertips. Neither did their fingers. Then came continuous glucose monitoring technology. A small device sticks to the skin, and a tiny sensor on the underside of the device painlessly pushes into the skin. The sensor continuously monitors the level of sugar and sends that information wirelessly to another device (such as a smartphone) where a person can easily see their sugar level. With some devices, an alarm goes off when the sugar is too high or too low. Continuous glucose monitors can be expensive and are not always covered by insurance. You ask if you should use a continuous glucose monitor, even though you do not have diabetes. There are relatively few studies of that question. At this time, there is no solid evidence of the value of these monitors in people who do not have diabetes. What will future studies show? I'm much better at predicting the past than predicting the future, but here goes: my bet is that these devices will have no value in people who have no risk factors for diabetes. On the other hand, they may prove to have value in some people who have risk factors for diabetes — such as people who are overweight (like you), people with prediabetes whose blood sugar levels are somewhat high, and people for whom diabetes runs in the family. But this will need to be scientifically established before it's worth using such monitors. Or before insurance is likely to pay for them.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/rethinking-hdl-cholesterol,Rethinking HDL cholesterol,1,"Cholesterol, a waxy, pale yellow fat, travels through the bloodstream in tiny, protein-covered particles called lipoproteins that mix easily with blood. You need cholesterol to create cell membranes, make hormones, and synthesize vitamin D, among other things. But if you're trying to avoid heart disease, you should keep tabs on your blood cholesterol values — especially your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol. Too much LDL in the bloodstream helps to create artery-clogging plaque, raising your risk of a heart attack. Your cholesterol report (also called a lipid profile or lipid panel) also includes your high-density lipoprotein (HDL); see the table below for recommended values. HDL has long been referred to as ""good"" cholesterol, based on observational studies dating back decades showing that people with high HDL levels are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease. However, the scientific understanding of HDL has evolved in the ensuing years, and many cardiologists now believe that HDL may be more of a bystander rather than a ""good guy"" that helps lower heart disease risk. ""Higher HDL levels are closely linked with behaviors like eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise,"" says Dr. Stephen Wiviott, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Talking trash about HDL Researchers have also discovered that the way HDL functions and its role in the body are more complex that once believed. ""The analogy that's often used to describe HDL is a garbage truck, because it picks up extra cholesterol, or garbage, from the bloodstream and the arteries and then transports it to the liver, where it's recycled or disposed,"" says Dr. Wiviott. That was the rationale behind the creation of experimental drugs that raised HDL levels dramatically — between 60% and 100%. Over the past decade, large clinical trials tested five of these drugs (known as CEPT inhibitors) in people with low HDL levels. But while the drugs reliably raised HDL levels, they didn't achieve the most important goal: preventing heart attacks, strokes, and other complications from clogged arteries. Maybe, the thinking went, it wasn't the number of garbage trucks that mattered but how good they were at picking up trash. That is, maybe the drugs increased the wrong kind of HDL cholesterol. It turns out that HDL comes in different shapes and sizes. Some types are spherical, while others are doughnut-shaped. Some types of HDL are great at plucking excess cholesterol from LDL and artery walls (a process referred to as reverse cholesterol transport), while some are not. Lipid lowdown: What numbers are best? The desirable values are for people without known heart disease. LEVEL CATEGORY TOTAL CHOLESTEROL Less than 200 mg/dL Desirable 200–239 mg/Dl Borderline high 240 mg/dL and above High LDL CHOLESTEROL Less than 100 mg/dL Optimal 100–129 mg/dL Near optimal/above optimal 130–159 mg/dL Borderline high 160–189 mg/dL High 190 mg/dL and above Very high HDL CHOLESTEROL Less than 40 mg/dL Low 60 mg/dL and above High TRIGLYCERIDES Less than 150 mg/dL Normal 150–199 mg/dL Borderline high 200–499 mg/dL High 500 mg/dL and above Very high Source: Adapted from the National Cholesterol Education Program. A better garbage truck? What if you had an HDL-based drug specifically designed to improve reverse cholesterol transport? Think of it as an empty garbage truck with a better trash compactor. But when investigators tested four weekly infusions of this type of experimental drug on more than 18,200 recent heart attack survivors, it was no better than a placebo in preventing heart attack, stroke, or death, as detailed in a study published May 2, 2024, in The New England Journal of Medicine. ""It's yet another point of reference to suggest that targeting HDL with medications may not be helpful,"" says Dr. Wiviott. But these findings shouldn't distract you from focusing on the factors you can control — namely, making sure your LDL is below 100 milligrams per deciliter, or even lower if you have heart disease (see advice about LDL-lowering strategies). That's true even if you have a high HDL level, which shouldn't be considered overly reassuring or a reason to ignore an elevated LDL value, says Dr. Wiviott.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tips-to-change-your-night-owl-lifestyle,Tips to change your night-owl lifestyle,1,"Do you naturally stay up until the wee hours and sleep late in the morning? Do you feel more creative, productive, or focused in the afternoon or evening than you do in the morning? If so, you're probably a ""night owl."" That's the opposite of a ""morning lark,"" someone who wakes with the sun and goes to sleep early. For a long time, doctors believed there were no health differences between night owls and morning larks as long as you got the optimal seven to nine hours of sleep per night. But that thinking is changing. So it might be time to consider if you should try to shift your sleep pattern. Night owl risks A growing amount of evidence suggests that being a night owl may increase the risk of developing many health problems. For example, a 2023 Harvard-led study of about 64,000 healthy middle-aged women, followed for eight years, found that those who said they were night owls were 72% more likely to develop diabetes than morning larks. The night owls were also more likely than morning larks to be overweight and have an unhealthy life-style — drinking a lot of alcohol, smoking, eating a poor diet, and getting too little sleep. Even after scientists calculated the impact of those lifestyle factors on health, the night owls were still 19% more likely to develop diabetes than morning larks. In addition, a 2021 study of almost 137,000 middle-aged and older adults suggested that having a bedtime past 10 p.m. was tied to a 20% greater risk of having obesity or a dangerously large waistline (35 or more inches for women, 40 or more for men), compared with people who went to bed between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The risk for obesity was even higher (35% to 38%) among people who went to bed between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Night owls in this study also slept fewer hours (six or seven hours per night) than morning larks (eight or nine hours per night). The risks of little sleep The fact that night owls sometimes sleep less than morning larks only adds to the risk. Sleep is the time when the brain flushes out toxins and consolidates memories and new bits of information. It's when our muscles and cells rebuild. Getting an inadequate amount of good-quality sleep is linked to poor concentration; increased risks of falls, broken bones, and car crashes; a weakened immune system; and many diseases, such as dementia, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, stroke, obesity, and depression. The power of darkness The typical human sleep-wake cycle makes the desire for sleep strongest between midnight and dawn, when it's dark outside. ""We sleep best, with the highest-quality sleep, when the sun is down. That's just how we're wired,"" says Dr. Kenneth Sassower, a pediatric and adult sleep neurologist at Harvard-­affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""If you're a night owl and you don't go to sleep until the middle of the night, you're not maximizing the number of hours you can sleep in darkness. The sun comes up soon after your bedtime, which might lead to poor-quality or interrupted sleep."" Tips for success Give yourself the best chance of successfully shifting your sleep-wake cycle by following good sleep hygiene. Exercise daily, but not too close to bedtime. Avoid alcohol and spicy food close to bedtime. Create a sleep ritual an hour before bed: turn down the lights, turn off the TV and computer screens, and do a quiet activity (like reading). Sleep in a cool, dark room, and make sure your bed and bedding are comfortable. Changing your sleep schedule It's not that the evidence is so strong that night owls should definitely go to sleep and awaken earlier. But the evidence is convincing enough that it's worth a try, particularly if you're not sleeping long enough or if the bulk of your sleep isn't occurring when it's dark outside. Is it possible to shift your sleep-wake cycle, even if you're not wired to go to bed earlier? ""Yes, but it's a slow process,"" Dr. Sassower says. He recommends the following steps. Set a bedtime goal. Dr. Sassower suggests aiming for a bedtime between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., so you'll get at least five hours of sleep in darkness. Gradually go to bed earlier. ""You can't just start going to sleep hours earlier and expect to make a lasting change to your sleep-wake cycle. Your brain won't comply,"" Dr. Sassower says. He advises rolling back your bedtime by 20 minutes every five days, until you reach your desired bedtime. For example, if you currently go to sleep at 1 a.m. each night and would prefer a bedtime of about 11:30 p.m., go to sleep at 12:40 a.m. for five nights then 12:20 a.m. for five nights then midnight for five nights then 11:40 p.m. for five nights then 11:20 p.m. indefinitely. Use medication. Until you reach your bedtime goal, it might help to take melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle. If you use an over-the-counter supplement, you should take it two hours before bedtime. It would be more effective, Dr. Sassower says, if you take a more potent prescription version of melatonin, a drug called ramelteon (Rozerem), at bedtime. You'll have to talk to your doctor about that. Set a wake time. ""Don't get up late,"" Dr. Sassower says. ""You need a consistent wake time to train the brain. Don't make it any later than 9 a.m."" Be patient. Once you've reached your bedtime goal, it will take about 90 days to officially establish the new sleep schedule and make it stick. ""I'm not saying it's easy,"" Dr. Sassower says, ""but it can be done. And you'll probably sleep better, feel the difference, and improve your health.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-you-reduce-your-cholesterol-without-taking-a-drug,Can you reduce your cholesterol without taking a drug?,1,"It's one of the most common questions people ask their doctors: How do I lower my cholesterol? Many of them hope to avoid taking drugs, while others are interested in natural cholesterol-lowering medications, like the Heart Letter reader who wrote to us recently. She's an active, slender 76-year-old who follows a heart-friendly diet (mostly organic fruits and vegetables, grains, and lean meats, but no red meat and no alcohol). Her blood pressure and blood sugar levels are normal, but her LDL (""bad"") cholesterol is 157 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), which is considered borderline high. In general, there are three main ways to lower LDL to the recommended 100 mg/dL or lower: diet, a dietary supplement, or a prescription medication, such as a statin. Here's how Heart Letter editor in chief Dr. Christopher Cannon counsels patients on this topic. Dietary changes What many people don't realize is that only about 20% of the cholesterol in your bloodstream comes from your diet — your liver and intestines make the rest. For most people, the cholesterol present in food doesn't have that much of an effect. However, most of the cholesterol in the average person's diet comes from animal-based foods such as meat and dairy, which are also high in saturated fat. Saturated fat clearly raises LDL cholesterol and should be consumed in limited amounts. The rest of your diet matters, too. Swap saturated fat for unsaturated fats (such as those found in vegetable oils, avocados, and fatty fish). Eat plenty of plant foods (like vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains — especially oats) that are rich in fiber, which helps lower your cholesterol by making dietary cholesterol harder to absorb from your gut. If you eat cheeseburgers and ice cream regularly but then gradually transition to a healthier diet, you're likely to see your LDL level fall. If your diet is already quite healthy (like the reader described above), further tweaks might not make that much of a difference. ""I often tell patients that while some people see modest reductions in their LDL after changing their diet, some do not,"" says Dr. Cannon. Still, a healthy diet has other cardiovascular benefits, even if your LDL doesn't drop very much, he adds. For example, many of the compounds found in whole, unprocessed plant foods help dampen inflammation, discouraging plaque buildup. Supplements Many dietary supplements sold in the United States claim to benefit heart health. But only three may help drive down LDL cholesterol, and only by a modest amount. Psyllium husk. Derived from the seeds of the Plantago ovata plant, this fiber supplement is best known as a treatment for constipation (Metamucil is one familiar brand). The powder is mixed with a liquid to make a thick gel. Psyllium husk or powder is also available in wafers, bars, and capsules. It's thought to absorb bile acids and cholesterol, which are then eliminated from the body during bowel movements. The suggested daily dose is 5 to 10 grams. An April 2024 review article in the journal Nutrients found that taking psyllium daily for a month or two can lower LDL by about 6 points, on average. Plant sterols. Found naturally in the cell membranes of plants like nuts, soybeans, peas, and rapeseed (the source of canola oil), these compounds (also call phytosterols) have a structure similar to cholesterol. Eating them helps limit the amount of cholesterol your body can absorb. Manufacturers offer many types of foods with added plant sterols, including margarine (such as Benecol), mayonnaise, bread, breakfast and snack bars, milk, and juice. Phytosterols are also available in capsule form. Some studies show that consuming 2 grams of plant sterols per day for at least eight weeks can lower LDL by up to 10%. However, a recent, carefully controlled four-week trial — the Supplements, Placebo, or Rosuvastatin Trial, or SPORT — found only a 4.4% LDL reduction from plant sterols. Red yeast rice. Made by steaming white rice with the yeast Monascus purpureus, this red-hued extract contains monacolin K, the same active ingredient in the prescription cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin. Some studies suggest that supplements containing 4 milligrams (mg) to 10 mg of monacolin K can lower LDL between 20% and 25%. But SPORT reported a mere 6.6% LDL reduction from red yeast rice. ""I have several patients who've been able to lower their LDL a little bit with psyllium, which is a safe, inexpensive product,"" says Dr. Cannon. The problem with the plant sterols and red yeast rice is the same as with all dietary supplements: the amount of active ingredient is not regulated and may vary from batch to batch. If you want to try these products, do so only under a doctor's supervision and use brands tested and vetted by ConsumerLab.com, an independent testing company. Statins Unlike dietary supplements, drugs in the class known as statins contain a known amount of the active ingredient — a compound that both decreases the amount of cholesterol the body makes and boosts the liver's ability to clear cholesterol from the blood. These drugs can lower LDL between 25% and 55%. Note that simply having elevated LDL cholesterol doesn't necessarily mean you should be taking a statin, Dr. Cannon notes. The ultimate goal is to lower your risk of heart disease, and other factors (like your age and other health conditions) affect your risk. He recommends using the American College of Cardiology's risk calculator. The calculator provides treatment advice about managing your LDL and other heart disease risk factors, which you can then discuss with your physician. For our reader, a moderate-intensity statin may be reasonable, according to the calculator's recommendation. When people are reluctant to start taking a statin, a coronary calcium score can help them make a more informed decision. Our reader's calcium score is 116, which suggests she has a small amount of plaque in her coronary arteries (see ""Should I get a calcium score?"" in the April 2023 Heart Letter for information about this test). ""But any number above zero means that the person has coronary artery disease,"" Dr. Cannon explains. Anyone with that diagnosis should get their LDL down to 70 or lower, which will prevent additional plaque buildup, he says. For someone with an LDL of 157, a statin is the most effective means to reach that goal. Image: © fcafotodigital/Getty Images",3,0.3848168,0.1642781,True

The organizers have claimed that the performance reflected their “values and principles.” (Article republished from RT.com ) The ceremony, which took place in central Paris on Friday night, concluded with a troupe of drag queens, homosexuals, and transsexuals posing at a table, as Jesus Christ and his apostles appeared in Leonardo Da Vinci’s ‘The Last Supper’. A giant serving dish was then wheeled out in front of the table, from which emerged a mostly naked man made up to resemble Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and festivity. Throughout the performance, a male dancer’s exposed testicles could be seen behind the table. “This ceremony unfortunately included scenes in which Christianity was mocked and ridiculed, which we deeply regret,” the Bishops’ Conference said in a statement on Saturday. “We thank the members of other religious denominations who have expressed their solidarity with us,” the statement continued. “This morning we think of all Christians on all continents who have been hurt by the exaggeration and provocation of some scenes.” The ceremony was condemned by Christians and conservatives around the world. Bishop Robert Barron of Minnesota called the performance a “gross mockery of the Last Supper,” while Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini declared that “opening the Olympics by insulting billions of Christians across the world was a really bad start” for France. SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk described the spectacle as “extremely disrespectful to Christians,” while tech entrepreneur Dr. Eli David wrote that “even as a Jew,” he was “infuriated by this outrageous insult to Jesus and Christianity.” Olympic organizers have defended the opening show. “We imagined a ceremony to show our values and our principles so we gave a very committed message,” Paris 2024 President Tony Estanguet told reporters on Saturday. “The idea was to really trigger a reflection. We wanted to have a message as strong as possible.” “Our idea was inclusion,” added Thomas Jolly, the ceremony’s artistic director. “We wanted to talk about diversity. Diversity means being together. We wanted to include everybody.” Read more at: RT.com",9,-0.023438592,-0.368362,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-31-hotez-calls-for-police-military-antivaccine-aggression.html,"Vaccine advocate Peter Hotez calls for use of police, military against ‘anti-vaccine aggression’",0,"Vaccine advocate and pharmaceutical industry insider Dr. Peter Hotez , long a proponent of the COVID-19 vaccine, said he favors deploying police and military powers against “anti-vaxers,” whom he blamed for causing hundreds of thousands of deaths during the pandemic. (Article by Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. republished from ChildrenHealthDefense.org ) During an interview July 5 at the Simposio Internacional de Actualización en Pediatría (International Symposium of Pediatric Updates) in Cartagena, Colombia, Hotez suggested organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and NATO should target “anti-vaccine aggression.” Hotez said: “What I’ve said to the Biden administration is, the health sector can’t solve this on its own. We’re going to have to bring in Homeland Security , the Commerce Department, Justice Department to help us understand how to do this. I’ve said the same with — I met with Dr. Tedros [director general of the WHO] last month … to say, I don’t know that the World Health Organization can solve this on our own. We need the other United Nations agencies. NATO. This is a security problem because it’s no longer a theoretical construct or some arcane academic exercise. Two hundred thousand Americans died because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression. “And so, this is now a lethal force … and now I feel as a pediatric vaccine scientist … it’s important, just as important for me to make new vaccines, to save lives. The other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression.” Send in all the militaries to ensure uptake of the sacred vaccines. https://t.co/eRneDbw3eQ — Paul D. Thacker (@thackerpd) July 24, 2024 The full interview was available on YouTube until Wednesday evening, when it was removed. The Defender obtained a video recording of the full interview. Hotez is dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor University College of Medicine and director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital , one of the sponsors of the symposium, which was organized by the Colombian Pediatric Society . Aside from being a vaccine proponent and developer — he helped develop the Corbevax COVID-19 vaccine which was administered in India and has received at least $30 million in vaccine development grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation — Hotez has crusaded against so-called “misinformation” about vaccines. In March, The Hill reported that Hotez has found a “‘parallel career’ fighting misinformation .” Hotez “finds his efforts to combat misinformation to be ‘meaningful,’” and says “pushing back on the anti-vaccine movement is just as important as developing vaccines,” The Hill wrote. Hotez also holds six patents on the hookworm (helminth) vaccine , and has several listed patent applications as well, including those for SARS-CoV2 vaccines. “Peter has cashed in significantly on the COVID-19 pandemic and gets a lot of money when shots go into arms,” said Brian Hooker, Chief Scientific Officer for Children’s Health Defense (CHD). In his July 5 interview, Hotez called for more stringent action against “anti-vaxers,” whom he connected to entities such as the Russian government, and called for medical schools to educate new doctors about anti-vaccine sentiment. “‘Anti-science’ and ‘anti-vaxxer’ are propaganda terms Hotez uses to establish a power dynamic over anyone who disagrees with him,” said cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough . “Now Hotez is calling for a security state to enforce his propaganda instead of engaging in much needed dialogue over vaccine safety with a critical appraisal of short- and long-term side effects from the routine childhood vaccine schedule , including the COVID-19 shots,” McCullough added. According to Harvey Risch, M.D., Ph.D. , professor emeritus and senior research scientist in epidemiology (chronic diseases) at the Yale School of Public Health: “Hotez has spent his entire career developing vaccines which have not achieved success in commercial use. His demands to impose public health martial law are reminiscent of the ‘Comité de salut public’ — ‘ Committee of Public Safety ’ — that Robespierre used to murder his political opponents [during the French Revolution].” For Francis Boyle, J.D., Ph.D. , professor of international law at the University of Illinois, Hotez’s suggestions are a call to violate established international human rights law. “Coercing vaccines upon human beings without their informed and voluntary consent violates the Nuremberg Code on Medical Experimentation , which is a crime against humanity,” Boyle said. “What we see at work here with Hotez is the Nazi mentality that pervades so many vaccinologists like him. Hotez is revealing his true colors.” Independent journalist Paul D. Thacker has investigated Hotez for his site, The Disinformation Chronicle . He said, “This crackpot idea that we should deploy military forces to deal with moms worried about vaccine side effects and children … doesn’t that speak for itself?” Dr. Sukharit Bhakdi , a microbiologist, questioned Hotez’s scientific credentials: “Simple fact: Hotez is not a real scientist. He has never published any research article based on true scientific research. His publications transmit his personal opinions and beliefs. He has not conducted a single valid vaccine trial and has zero data to back his claims. “He has been on the globalist team together with [Dr. Anthony] Fauci et al. and is now turning to violence to silence all dissenters. This very fact disqualifies him as a physician.” “His evolution over the course of the pandemic is curious as he has become more and more shrill as time goes on,” Hooker said. “It seems he is trying to extend his 15 minutes of fame by ‘jumping the shark’ and inciting gestapo-like measures against ‘anti-vaxers’ and ‘science deniers.’ His definition of science is very ‘Fauci-esque’ indeed.” Claim that unvaccinated caused ‘hundreds of thousands’ of deaths ‘an obvious untruth’ During his July 5 interview, Hotez asserted that the unvaccinated were responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said: “There’s anti-vaccine activity in every country, and each has its own unique national flavor. But the part that I’m worried about now is something very dark and accelerating in the United States. “And the most dramatic evidence for that is what happened during the COVID pandemic … My estimate is 200,000 Americans died needlessly because they refused COVID vaccines in 2021, 2022.” Hotez did not provide evidence supporting this figure, but it was similar to claims made by Dr. Anthony Fauci during Congressional testimony last month. Without citing evidence, Fauci said the unvaccinated are “probably responsible for an additional 200,000-300,000 deaths” in the U.S.” Risch called this claim “an obvious untruth.” “In the face of repeated major empirical CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] evidence and CDC’s public acknowledgement that the mRNA vaccines largely failed to reduce COVID transmission, Hotez absurdly claims that people choosing not to vaccinate themselves have contributed more to deaths from COVID than all of the large-scale breakthrough infections among vaccinated people,” Risch said. McCullough said, “Hotez presumes COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective as any vaccinologist would dream. Sadly, his fantasy was over before it started. The COVID-19 vaccines were unsafe and failed to reduce hospitalization and death in prospective randomized trials or in valid observational studies. They never stopped transmission.” “All experts, including Hotez, agreed theoretical protection from COVID-19 vaccines was just a few months, requiring frequent boosters,” McCullough added. Hotez calls parents who choose not to vaccinate their children ‘victims’ In his interview, Hotez called for action — including more censorship — to counter what he called a “dark and accelerating” and “dangerous” anti-vaccine movement in the U.S. and globally that is “expanding and extending to childhood immunizations in the United States.” “My worry is that this anti-vaccine movement, and it’s not misinformation or [an] infodemic, as many call it, it’s organized, it’s deliberate, it’s well-financed and it’s politically motivated … I worry that’s now globalizing to other countries on the African continent, in Asia and even Latin America,” he added. On the topic of childhood vaccinations, Hotez said, “Parents who choose not to vaccinate their kids are victims” of this campaign, and called for medical schools to train doctors on how to respond to parents who oppose vaccinations. “Pediatricians need to understand what the anti-vaccine ecosystem is, how it’s organized, how it operates, and to get educated about it,” he said. “I think that’s a first step … in our medical schools, in our pediatric residency training, in our conferences like this, being able to describe what this anti-vaccine monster looks like.” But for journalist Rodney Palmer , formerly of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the increasing reluctance of parents to vaccinate their children is due to mounting concerns about vaccine safety. He said: “The rising movement questioning the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines appears to be based on mounting evidence from government health data collection agencies and the life insurance industry . “The fraud and cover-up of ivermectin as an effective prevention and treatment of COVID-19 caused a segment of the population to question the official guidance around vaccines — more so once they were mandated.” Hotez blamed legacy and traditional media, as well as foreign governments, for fueling anti-vaccine sentiments. “Fox News is now a source of anti-vaccine disinformation,” Hotez said. “If the parents are watching Fox News every night … They are going to be coming into your practice believing disinformation.” Turning to social media, Hotez said, “Twitter, since Elon Musk has taken it over , has become an anti-vaccine site dominated by anti-vaccine groups and individuals who are monetizing the internet. They’re selling fake autism cures because they say vaccines cause autism , which they don’t.” Hotez continues to be active on Twitter — now known as X. Adversarial foreign governments are also to blame for propagating anti-vaccine rhetoric, according to Hotez. “For instance, the Russian government, the Putin government, is spreading anti-vaccine propaganda. The goal of this is to destabilize society and to have caused people to question authority,” he said. Hotez did not provide any information to support this claim. Russia produces the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine , under the auspices of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and The Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology — an arm of the Russian federal government . Hotez calls ‘anti-vaccine movement’ a tool of the ‘far-right’ Hotez also used the interview as an opportunity to plug his upcoming book, “ The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science : A Scientist’s Warning.” He said the book “describes [the anti-vaccine] ecosystem and its political leanings in detail.” According to the book’s publisher, Johns Hopkins University Press, Hotez “explains how anti-science became a major societal and lethal force” and how “the anti-vaccine movement became a tool of far-right political figures around the world.” In 2022, Hotez fiercely criticized looming Congressional hearings into a possible lab-leak origin of COVID-19 and whether the National Institutes of Health (NIH) prematurely discredited the hypothesis, dismissing this as an “ outlandish conspiracy .” However, Hotez’s own 2012 to 2017 NIH grant — totaling $6.1 million — for the development of a SARS vaccine had the aim of responding to any “ accidental release from a laboratory ,” in addition to a possible zoonotic (or natural) spillover of the virus. In a June 2023 interview with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., CHD’s chairman on leave, podcaster Joe Rogan offered to donate $100,000 to a charity of Hotez’s choice if he agreed to debate Kennedy . Hotez — with the support of several legacy news media outlets and the American Medical Association — refused Rogan’s offer. He later claimed on social media that a “couple of anti-vaxers” “stalked” and “taunted” him outside his home after he declined the offer to debate Kennedy.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/increasing-energy-levels-for-sex,Increasing energy levels for sex,1,"Men want plenty of energy to fully enjoy sex. Yet as men age, many factors can diminish their energy levels and lower their libido and sexual stamina. For instance, muscle mass naturally declines, and the body becomes less efficient at producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy-carrying molecules found in cells. Testosterone levels also diminish, and sleep problems are common, leading to fatigue. ""Addressing these issues also can increase energy levels and keep you more active and mentally alert,"" says Dr. Martin Kathrins, director of the Men's Health Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Here's a look at these energy blockers and how to overcome them. ATP and muscle mass The best ways to increase ATP and muscle mass are with diet and strength training. Foods that contain polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and protein can boost ATP. Favoring plant-based foods, as with the DASH or Mediterranean diet can increase your intake of foods rich in these fatty acids, like fatty fish (salmon), avocados, olive oil, and nuts (almonds, walnuts). High-quality protein sources include beans, nuts, soy (soy milk, tofu), and poultry. Another protein source is protein powder from plants (soybeans, peas, rice, or hemp) or milk (casein or whey protein). The powder can be added to a smoothie, stirred into oatmeal, or mixed with water or milk (regular, soy, or almond). Strength training helps build muscle mass, which spurs your body to produce more ATP. More muscle mass also increases your basal metabolic rate, the amount of energy your body uses at rest. Like other kinds of physical activity, strength training boosts levels of energy-promoting neurotransmitters in the brain. Low testosterone Fatigue is a common side effect of male hypogonadism, a condition in which the testicles don't produce enough testosterone, the male sex hormone. On average, testosterone levels drop about 1% each year beginning in a man's late 30s and could fall by as much as 50% by age 70. (A blood test from your doctor can determine if you have low testosterone.) Testosterone replacement therapy, which is given via absorbable pellet implants, topical gels, patches, or injections, can often help spark energy and improve libido in men with low levels. Speak with your doctor about whether you should get your testosterone level checked and whether testosterone therapy is appropriate. Sleep Sleep is divided into two phases: REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep. Non-REM sleep involves three stages. Sleep experts believe that the last non-REM stage (known as deep sleep) plays the greatest role in energy, as it helps the body make ATP. Older adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. However, many older adults have trouble falling or staying asleep, which means less time spent in deep sleep and leads to daytime fatigue. Poor sleep also can increase stress levels and interfere with how your body and brain store and use energy. Specific problems can interfere with sleep, such as insomnia, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and nocturia (the need to urinate during the night). ""If you have problems sleeping through the night, consult your doctor to determine if you have any of these conditions,"" says Dr. Kathrins. Otherwise, practicing good sleep hygiene can help you get a good night's rest. For example, go to bed and get up at the same time every day, including weekends, to keep your sleep/wake cycle synchronized with your circadian rhythms. Establish a bedtime ritual where you give yourself an hour before sleep to bathe, brush your teeth, and relax. Use the bed only for sleeping or sex (no TV or electronic devices), and keep your bedroom dark and cool. If you take afternoon naps, keep them under 20 minutes, and don't nap later in the afternoon or within several hours of your regular bedtime.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-vacation-habits-to-continue-all-year,Healthy vacation habits to continue all year,1,"Picnics, beach outings, dozing in the shade: there's a reason many of us feel our best during summer getaways. But we tend to snap back into our everyday, task-oriented mindset soon after — at the expense of our bodies and minds. What if we could keep the best parts of our vacation routines and use them to fuel better health all year long? There are solid reasons to embrace a shift. More than four in 10 cancers are linked to lifestyle choices we can change, such as poor diet and physical inactivity. These risk factors are also among the top contributors to heart disease. They're also habits we tend to improve when we're away from the grind, says Dr. Kathryn Corelli, a primary care doctor and women's health specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Vacation is when people take a step back and really give themselves permission and time to focus on what's important to them,"" Dr. Corelli says. ""But when they come back, suddenly those habits sort of snap back too. You lose a lot of those gains, the reasons you felt good."" Habits to foster Healthy activities we embrace on vacation and neglect the rest of the year tend to fall into two camps — doing more of some things and less of others. More time outdoors. Mounting evidence suggests that spending time in nature can improve a wide range of health factors, including blood pressure, by lowering stress and promoting exercise, according to a March 2023 paper in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine. ""Many of my patients spend a lot of time indoors during the year and they feel cooped up, anxious, and stressed,"" Dr. Corelli says. ""When they get outside, they always benefit."" More movement. Speaking of exercise, walking, swimming, biking, and hiking can seem far less of a chore when you're doing it for fun. ""Continuing some of those habits — whether going on walks or parking farther away from your destination — can be really powerful in the long term,"" she says. Less time online. We gain perspective when we pull back from virtual pursuits, a shift that pays big dividends for mental health. ""We spend a lot of time on screens. But that time takes away from something else, such as sleep or connecting with our kids,"" she says. ""Also, there are a lot of data supporting the idea that comparing ourselves to people online can be bad for anxiety."" More varied diet. Vacation food is sometimes overly rich and caloric — think of cruise ship buffets — but can also deviate gloriously from the humdrum by incorporating a wider array of mouth-watering fruits and vegetables and fewer processed foods. ""There's no perfect way to eat,"" Dr. Corelli says, ""but try to eat relatively healthy, unprocessed foods 80% of the time."" More dining with others. It's easier to munch more mindfully — which also helps you avoid overeating — when you're enjoying leisurely meals with family and friends instead of dashing off to the next commitment. ""We connect as humans over food; that's been in our cultural DNA for a long time,"" she says. ""People feel closer to family and friends after vacation, and we know socializing can help prevent cognitive decline."" More sleep. A significant part of revitalizing simply comes from getting better shuteye, without alarms or insomnia-inducing deadlines. But while those stressors may return, we can be more diligent about practicing good sleep hygiene when vacation ends by avoiding screens for an hour before bed and keeping consistent bed and wake times. ""Those things are really important for continuing the relaxation you've fostered on vacation,"" Dr. Corelli says. Novel brain engagement. There's a reason booksellers hawk ""beach reads"" in the summer months: people typically spend more time reading on vacation. Or maybe you while away the afternoons playing board games or completing sudoku or crossword puzzles. ""Think of it like stretching your brain — it's not on autopilot,"" she says. ""Doing this can help protect us from dementia in the long run."" Adjustment advice Before you plunge back into your everyday routine, Dr. Corelli advocates doing a bit of reflection. This could include devising a list of pros and cons for the things you did on vacation that you'd like to continue. ""This can be motivating,"" she says. ""Finding your own reasons for continuing or not continuing a behavior and thinking them through can get lost during our fast-paced everyday life,"" she says.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-30-olympics-apology-outrage-woke-last-supper-parody.html,Paris Olympics officials issue half-hearted apology after worldwide outrage over woke Last Supper parody,0,"Paris Olympics organizers have finally issued an apology for a highly offensive act in their opening ceremony that used drag queens to parody the Last Supper. The segment, which appeared to mimic Leonardo da Vinci’s famous depiction of the last supper, featured a number of drag queens, along with a transgender model and a nude singer who wore makeup that called to mind the Greek god of wine, Dionysus. Held on the Seine River in France, the opening ceremony attracted millions of viewers from around the world, and while there were numerous gaffes, such as the South Korean team of athletes being introduced as North Koreans, the drag queen controversy has been dominating the conversation. The event immediately drew criticism from the Conference of French Bishops, who said in a statement: “This ceremony has unfortunately included scenes of derision and mockery of Christianity, which we very deeply deplore.” U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson called out the act on social media, writing: “Last night’s mockery of the Last Supper was shocking and insulting to Christian people around the world who watched the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.” At least one company has withdrawn its support for the games , with tech firm C Spire announcing it will be pulling its Olympic advertising in response to the controversial act. The Olympics have been accused of trying to curb criticism of the ceremony via a censorship campaign, with numerous social media users who posted videos or screenshots of the controversial scene being hit with Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) complaints, which can lead to account suspensions . Officials are trying to convince the public they had no idea people would be offended Officials finally issued a half-hearted apology in response to the outrage. A spokeswoman for Paris 2024 stated: ""There was never an intention to show disrespect to a religious group. If people have taken any offense, we are, of course, really sorry."" It’s hard to believe that it never occurred to them that deriding the religious beliefs of billions of people around the world on a global stage wouldn’t go over well. After recreating a famous scene in the Bible involving Jesus’s final dinner with his apostles before being crucified using drag queens and a transgender model, what kind of response did they think they would get? A spokesperson for the Holy See, Bishop Emmanuel Gobillard, told NBC News : “The fact that our religion should be mocked is usual and we are used to blasphemy in France, but the context isn’t the same. In an event that brings together all or part of the population, I found this staging hurtful and out of place.” Artistic director Thomas Jolly made a laughable statement, telling the media that it was really about diversity and inclusion. “ We wanted to talk about diversity . Diversity means being together. We wanted to include everyone, as simple as that,” he said, with the world’s 2.4 billion Christians apparently not falling under his definition of “everyone.” Imagine the response they would have received if they had instead tried to mock something related to Islamic beliefs. Considering how much time and money is put into planning the Olympics many years in advance, no one is buying their claim that it never occurred to anyone involved that this would somehow be upsetting to a significant number of people. It was surely rehearsed multiple times in the presence of Olympic officials. They knew, but they apparently didn’t care. Aren’t the Olympics supposed to be about sports?",2,-0.12632321,-0.3040081,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/recognizing-and-easing-the-physical-symptoms-of-anxiety,Recognizing and easing the physical symptoms of anxiety,1,"Simple strategies can reduce the headaches, upset stomach, and shortness of breath that may be triggered by emotional stress. You've had headaches on and off, or possibly nausea, or muscle pain. It could be emotions, rather than a physical illness, driving your symptoms. Blame your autonomic nervous system. This is a system in your body that you don't consciously control, but that regulates things like your heart rate, breathing, urination, and sexual function. It's also the system that reacts when you are under a physical threat. The autonomic nervous system produces your fight-or-flight response, which is designed to help you defend yourself or run away from danger. When you are under stress or anxious, this system kicks into action, and physical symptoms can appear — headaches, nausea, shortness of breath, shakiness, or stomach pain. Doctors see it all the time — patients with real pain or other symptoms, but nothing is physically wrong with them. In today's world, many people may be noticing new physical symptoms without realizing what's causing them. For some people, this situation is the start of a vicious cycle. Anxiety and stress themselves produce these physical symptoms, and on top of that your reaction to those symptoms can make them worse. The more you focus on them, the more alarmed you become, and the more intense your symptoms become. It can get really out of control and become so uncomfortable that you might not be able to do much more than sit and worry. Identifying and easing anxiety It's possible to become so fixated on the physical effects from your anxious state that you don't even realize you were anxious to begin with. So, how do you know if anxiety is causing your symptoms? And if it is, how can you feel better? Here are some tips to help you interrupt this cycle. Stop and assess. The first step is to pause for a second and observe what's going on with your body. Think about what you are experiencing and whether it relates to a feeling of emotional upset or a reaction to something alarming or stressful. If your symptoms followed a stressful event or period of time, it's possible these emotions triggered your symptoms. Also, be alert to signs that you are tensing your muscles, which can also indicate a stress reaction. Distract yourself. If you suspect anxiety is at the root of your physical symptoms, distraction can be a helpful tool. It's good to build a repertoire of things that can distract you from your focus on your body. Look at a photo album. Do the laundry. Even something as simple as watering the plants or putting together a jigsaw puzzle can help. This can fairly reliably get you out of a cycle of increased anxiety and increased physical symptoms. Very often, once you move on to another activity and take your mind off your symptoms, you'll start to feel better. Distractions are different for each person. Try different activities to figure out what takes your mind to a calm place. Relax your body — or work it. To relieve stress, try some deep breathing or relaxation exercises. There are numerous online resources and smartphone apps that can help guide you through relaxation techniques. Physical activity can also help you relieve tension. Try to squeeze in a daily walk or a run. Reassure yourself. If you believe your symptoms are being caused by anxiety, reassure yourself that what you are experiencing is not harmful or fatal. They're not serious, and they don't signal an impending medical disaster. The symptoms will pass when the anxiety eases. Get checked. There is a difference between anxiety that triggers physical symptoms and physical symptoms that trigger anxiety. For example, people who are having an asthma attack and therefore having trouble breathing will likely feel anxious. But anxiety is not causing their shortness of breath. If you have a physical problem that does not resolve with relaxation or other techniques, contact your doctor to have it checked out. Know when to seek help. Simple anxiety sometimes crosses the line and becomes an anxiety disorder. Signs that you might have a problem include shying away from activities because you are fearful, or being so preoccupied with worry that it affects your ability to function. If this sounds like you, it's time to seek some help. Anxiety disorders are very treatable using a variety of different approaches.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/parenting-isnt-easy-two-important-skills-can-help-202407243060,Parenting isn't easy: Two important skills can help,1,"They say that parenting is the greatest — and the most challenging — job that many of us will ever land. Life can be tough for kids too, especially when they go through emotionally trying times. What can parents do to help their kids manage episodes of anger, sadness, or anxiety triggered by school, siblings, and daily living? Whether you are a parent to an elementary-age child, a tweener ages 8 to 12, or a teenager, practicing two skills can help both you and your child: validation and coping. Practicing validation Validation teaches your children that feeling and expressing their emotions is okay. ""When parents use validation, they are affirming to their child that it's fine to feel emotions and they should not be suppressed,"" says Dr. Chase Samsel with the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Harvard-affiliated Boston Children's Hospital. ""It shows them you understand their feelings and point of view, and it establishes trust. This, in turn, can help a child feel supported and open to discussing solutions."" Start with acknowledgement Acknowledge their emotions with comments like, ""It sounds like you are frustrated or angry,"" or ""I can see that you've had a tough day at school."" But which emotion — or emotions — is your child feeling? ""It can be difficult for parents to recognize the genuine emotion their child is battling,"" says Dr. Samsel. ""Many times, kids have an emotional reaction but can't explain what's going on, or don't want to, or express various emotions at once."" Other times, different emotions lie underneath the one being shown. This is especially common among teenagers where they display anger, but often the real emotion is fear, anxiety, or sadness. ""In these incidences, just recognizing they are going through something difficult is enough,"" says Dr. Samsel. Practice validation often A child may not respond to validation at first — they may not want to talk about their emotions or may ignore your interest. But consistent validation will eventually pay off. ""By repeating validation when emotional crises arise, the child soon will become more comfortable expressing their emotion,"" says Dr. Samsel. ""Once they recognize that their parents welcome this and will not be reprimanded, they will be open to sharing details."" Building a coping skills toolbox Coping skills are ways parents can teach their children to manage emotional problems when they arise. Try a breathing exercise together Breathing exercises are a popular strategy, as they are easy to learn and quick to use. Dr. Samsel recommends any of the following: three-part breathing, ujjayi breathing, and belly breathing. Other coping skills include guided meditation, visualization, squeezing a ball for stress relief, taking a walk or playing outside, and reading together (ideal for preschool and elementary-age children). ""Sometimes just giving children alone time in their room or ""taking space"" works well,"" says Dr. Samsel. Tap into coping skills yourself It's also vital for parents to adopt these strategies when dealing with their own emotions, says Dr. Samsel. Not only will this help you feel calmer, but it's a great way to model that coping skills help everyone — adults, too! For example, try telling your kids when you feel upset or frustrated about something that happens during your day. Announce that you plan to take a walk to de-stress or do a breathing exercise. Later, share your strategies for problem-solving. ""Kids watch what their parents do and will often mimic their behavior,"" says Dr. Samsel. ""If they see you constructively working through your emotions, they will be more open to doing the same."" Be flexible Never insist on having older kids use a coping mechanism, even when situations call for it. That could feel like punishment and trigger an automatic resistance. Instead, Dr. Samsel suggests parents expose their children to different types of coping skills and then let them decide which ones they want to try. ""They may need to experiment to find techniques they can easily follow and that work for them,"" says Dr. Samsel.",9,0.06360624,-0.2778771,True

""Fortunately, I have to give you a very long I don't know the answer to your question answer because it is very complicated,"" Hotez said.

Two-hundred thousand Americans died because of anti-vaccine aggression, anti-science aggression."" It is not simply a matter of health freedom for Americans to have a choice over whether or not to take a government-imposed vaccine. Hotez feels as though nobody should have a choice, and that those who believe they do have a choice should be dealt with like enemy combatants. ""And so, this is now a lethal force that, and now I feel as a pediatric vaccine scientist, it's just as, it's just as, though it's important, just as it's important for me to make new vaccines to save lives, the other side of saving lives is countering this anti-vaccine aggression,"" Hotez bumbled in trying to make his point. Simply put, Hotez believes that the federal government and even international bodies like NATO should intervene to put an end to everyone who opposes vaccines and vaccine ""science,"" which just so happens to be Hotez's career bread and butter.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fish-oil-friend-or-foe-201307126467,Fish oil: friend or foe?,1,"The answer is more friend than foe when the fish oil comes from food sources rather than supplements. Omega-3s in balance What's so special about fish oil? It's loaded with omega-3 fatty acids. These must come from food, since our bodies can't make them. The two-key omega-3 fatty acids are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are rich in these omega-3s. Some plants are rich in another type of omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid, which the body can convert to DHA and EPA. Good sources of these are flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and canola oil. Omega-3 fatty acids play important roles in brain function, normal growth and development, and inflammation. Deficiencies have been linked to a variety of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, some cancers, mood disorders, arthritis, and more. But that doesn't mean taking high doses translates to better health and disease prevention. Fish oil supplements have been promoted as easy way to protect the heart, ease inflammation, improve mental health, and lengthen life. Such claims are one reason why Americans spend more than $1 billion a year on over-the-counter fish oil. And food companies are adding it to milk, yogurt, cereal, chocolate, cookies, juice, and hundreds of other foods. But the evidence for improving heart health is mixed. In November 2018, a study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine found that omega-3 fatty acid supplements did nothing to reduce heart attacks, strokes, or deaths from heart disease in middle-age men and women without any known risk factors for heart disease. Earlier research reported in the same journal in 2013 also reported no benefit in people with risk factors for heart disease. However, when researchers looked at subgroups of people who don't eat any fish, the results suggested they may reduce their cardiovascular risk by taking a fish oil supplement. Evidence linking fish oil and cancer has been all over the map. Most research, including the 2018 study cited above, has not shown any decreased risk of cancer. However, some earlier research suggested diets high in fatty fish or fish oil supplements might reduce the risk of certain cancers. Take home message How food, and its component molecules, affect the body is largely a mystery. That makes the use of supplements for anything other than treating a deficiency questionable. Despite this one study, you should still consider eating fish and other seafood as a healthy strategy. If we could absolutely, positively say that the benefits of eating seafood comes entirely from omega-3 fats, then downing fish oil pills would be an alternative to eating fish. But it's more than likely that you need the entire orchestra of fish fats, vitamins, minerals, and supporting molecules, rather than the lone notes of EPA and DHA. The same holds true of other foods. Taking even a handful of supplements is no substitute for wealth of nutrients you get from eating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. What should you do if you currently take fish oil? If your doctor prescribed them—they are an approved and effective treatment for people with high blood triglyceride levels—follow his or her instructions until you can have a conversation about fish oil. If you are taking them on your own because you believe they are good for you, it's time to rethink that strategy. If you don't eat fish or other seafood, you might benefit from a fish oil supplement.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side,Blue light has a dark side,1,"What is blue light? The effect blue light has on your sleep and more. Although it is environmentally friendly, blue light can affect your sleep and potentially cause disease. Until the advent of artificial lighting, the sun was the major source of lighting, and people spent their evenings in (relative) darkness. Now, in much of the world, evenings are illuminated, and we take our easy access to all those lumens pretty much for granted. But we may be paying a price for basking in all that light. At night, light throws the body's biological clock—the circadian rhythm—out of whack. Sleep suffers. Worse, research shows that it may contribute to the causation of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. What is blue light? Not all colors of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths—which are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost attention, reaction times, and mood—seem to be the most disruptive at night. And the proliferation of electronics with screens, as well as energy-efficient lighting, is increasing our exposure to blue wavelengths, especially after sundown. Light and sleep Everyone has slightly different circadian rhythms, but the average length is 24 and one-quarter hours. The circadian rhythm of people who stay up late is slightly longer, while the rhythms of earlier birds fall short of 24 hours. Dr. Charles Czeisler of Harvard Medical School showed, in 1981, that daylight keeps a person's internal clock aligned with the environment. Is nighttime light exposure bad? Some studies suggest a link between exposure to light at night, such as working the night shift, to diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. That's not proof that nighttime light exposure causes these conditions; nor is it clear why it could be bad for us. Exposure to light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences circadian rhythms. Even dim light can interfere with a person's circadian rhythm and melatonin secretion. A mere eight lux—a level of brightness exceeded by most table lamps and about twice that of a night light—has an effect. Light at night is part of the reason so many people don't get enough sleep, and researchers have linked short sleep to increased risk for depression, as well as diabetes and cardiovascular problems. Effects of blue light and sleep While light of any kind can suppress the secretion of melatonin, blue light at night does so more powerfully. Harvard researchers and their colleagues conducted an experiment comparing the effects of 6.5 hours of exposure to blue light to exposure to green light of comparable brightness. The blue light suppressed melatonin for about twice as long as the green light and shifted circadian rhythms by twice as much (3 hours vs. 1.5 hours). In another study of blue light, researchers at the University of Toronto compared the melatonin levels of people exposed to bright indoor light who were wearing blue-light–blocking goggles to people exposed to regular dim light without wearing goggles. The fact that the levels of the hormone were about the same in the two groups strengthens the hypothesis that blue light is a potent suppressor of melatonin. It also suggests that shift workers and night owls could perhaps protect themselves if they wore eyewear that blocks blue light. Inexpensive sunglasses with orange-tinted lenses block blue light, but they also block other colors, so they're not suitable for use indoors at night. Glasses that block out only blue light can cost up to $80. LED blue light exposure If blue light does have adverse health effects, then environmental concerns, and the quest for energy-efficient lighting, could be at odds with personal health. Those curlicue compact fluorescent lightbulbs and LED lights are much more energy-efficient than the old-fashioned incandescent lightbulbs we grew up with. But they also tend to produce more blue light. The physics of fluorescent lights can't be changed, but coatings inside the bulbs can be so they produce a warmer, less blue light. LED lights are more efficient than fluorescent lights, but they also produce a fair amount of light in the blue spectrum. Richard Hansler, a light researcher at John Carroll University in Cleveland, notes that ordinary incandescent lights also produce some blue light, although less than most fluorescent lightbulbs. Protect yourself from blue light at night Use dim red lights for night lights. Red light is less likely to shift circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin. Avoid looking at bright screens beginning two to three hours before bed. If you work a night shift or use a lot of electronic devices at night, consider wearing blue-blocking glasses or installing an app that filters the blue/green wavelength at night. Expose yourself to lots of bright light during the day, which will boost your ability to sleep at night, as well as your mood and alertness during daylight. image: © Innovatedcaptures | Dreamstime.com",5,0.22548854,-0.06531468,True

Jim Jones, deputy commissioner for human foods at the agency, told a Senate meeting that the FDA is in the process of deciding a ban, in response to a petition. “With Red 3, we have a petition in front of us to revoke the authorization board, and we’re hopeful that in the next few weeks we’ll be acting on that petition,” Jones said. Red 3 is a colouring derived from petroleum that is widely used in foods and drinks, although it has been banned in cosmetics since 1990 after studies suggested it caused cancer in lab animals. “There is simply no reason for this chemical to be in our food except to entice and mislead consumers by changing the color of their food so it looks more appealing,” said Rep. Frank Pallone in a statement, in response to the news. “With the holiday season in full swing where sweet treats are abundant, it is frightening that this chemical remains hidden in these foods that we and our children are eating.” Red 3 has been a target of Robert F.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/is-extra-virgin-olive-oil-extra-healthy,Is extra-virgin olive oil extra healthy?,1,"Q. I know olive oil is part of a heart-healthy diet, but is extra-virgin olive oil healthier than regular olive oil? A. Many studies continue to confirm the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, which cuts the risk of heart disease and stroke. The diet's nutritional benefits probably come from various sources, but the generous use of olive oil appears to be a key contributor. Regardless of the type, olive oil is high in monounsaturated fatty acids, containing about 75% by volume. When substituted for saturated fat, monounsaturated fats help lower your ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. The health benefits of olive oil have been attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In fact, observational studies have shown a link between lower risks of cardiovascular disease, some cancers, and even dementia in people who consume higher amounts of olive oil than those who use little or none. Still, extra-virgin olive oil does offer something extra that regular olive oil does not. Extra-virgin olive oil is pressed mechanically from ripe olives and processed without high heat or chemical solvents. This protects chemicals in the oil called phenols. In contrast, regular, highly processed olive oils lose these chemicals. Small laboratory-based experiments suggest that higher concentrations of phenols may provide extra antioxidant effects. Even so, there are no definitive studies that show extra-virgin olive oil has a greater ability than refined oil to prevent heart problems, cancer or other diseases. Keep in mind that olive oil is not the sole healthy ingredient in a Mediterranean diet. Think of it as just one aspect of the Mediterranean style of eating, which includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and nuts; whole grains; and limited amounts of red meat.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/does-exercising-at-night-affect-sleep,Does exercising at night affect sleep?,1,"On call Q. I have heard that you should not exercise at night because it can cause sleep problems. Is this true? A. Traditionally, experts have recommended not exercising at night as part of good sleep hygiene. However, a small study, published in Sports Medicine suggests that some people can exercise in the evening as long as they avoid vigorous activity for at least one hour before bedtime. The researchers examined 23 studies that evaluated sleep onset and quality in healthy adults who performed a single session of evening exercise compared with similar adults who did not. They found that not only did evening exercise not affect sleep, it seemed to help people fall asleep faster and spend more time in deep sleep. However, those who did high-intensity exercise — such as interval training — less than one hour before bedtime took longer to fall asleep and had poorer sleep quality. Despite the findings in this particular study, I generally recommend against strenuous physical activity for at least two hours before getting into bed. In addition to regular exercise, you can help achieving quality sleep by doing the following: Set a regular bedtime and adopt a relaxing bedtime routine. Turn off devices that give off light, such as the TV, computer, and phone, at least 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Be sure your bed is comfortable and your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Don't take long naps during the day. If you need a nap, restrict it to 20 to 30 minutes in the early afternoon. If you can't fall asleep after 15 to 20 minutes, go to another room. Read quietly with a dim light until you feel sleepy. — by Howard LeWine, M.D. Editor in Chief, Harvard Men's Health Watch Image: © Wavebreakmedia/Getty Images",5,0.34491658,-0.1365839,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/exposure-therapy-what-is-it-and-how-can-it-help,Exposure therapy: What is it and how can it help?,1,"Exposure therapy is a way to help people conquer their fears, stress, or anxiety. Exposure therapy has been scientifically proven to be a safe and effective treatment for a variety of psychological issues. What is exposure therapy? Exposure therapy is a type of psychological therapy used to help people overcome problems such as phobias, panic attacks, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It involves exposing a person, in a safe environment, to the object, activity, or situation that they fear or struggle with. When people are afraid of something, they tend to avoid it. While this may work in the short term, over time the fear may become worse and negatively impact a person's life. Exposure therapy is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. It can help break the cycle of avoidance and fear. Who might benefit from exposure therapy? Exposure therapy has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for people of all ages, including children and teenagers, in helping them overcome their fears. Examples of people who may benefit from exposure therapy are veterans with combat-related PTSD, adults with anxiety disorders including specific phobias, and children who have experienced traumatic events. What to expect from exposure therapy Exposure therapy starts with a provider learning more about you and what you are afraid of. You'll typically meet with the therapist once a week for several weeks to a few months, usually averaging between eight and 12 sessions. There are several different types of exposure therapy that can be used, based on your need and circumstances. Real exposure involves directly facing the object, situation, or activity that you are afraid of. The exposure starts gradually and is slowly increased. For example, someone with a fear of spiders may be shown a live spider across the room, then asked to observe it up close, and eventually may be encouraged to handle it. Imagined exposure involves imagining the object, situation, or activity that you fear. For example, a veteran may be asked to remember and describe the sights and sounds of being in combat. Simulation exposure involves using virtual reality technology to simulate what you are afraid of. It's used when real exposure is not possible, such as for people with a fear of flying on planes. Sensation awareness, also called interoceptive exposure, involves creating physical sensations that are harmless but feared. For example, the provider may ask someone who gets panic attacks to run on a treadmill to make their heart rate go up, to show them that this sensation is not dangerous. Prolonged exposure is therapy that is provided more slowly, over a period of several months, so that a person has time to accept the exposure and sufficiently process the experience. This type of exposure therapy is often used to treat PTSD. It is not typically used for other anxiety disorders. Exposure therapy is sometimes combined with relaxation exercises, to help associate a feared object or situation with relaxation. Benefits of exposure therapy Untreated fear, stress, or anxiety can have a profound impact on your quality of life. Exposure therapy can help in several ways. Over time, it can help weaken the negative association you previously had with something you feared. Exposure therapy can also show that you are capable of confronting your fears and managing your anxiety. It can restore a feeling of power and control that comes from facing and overcoming your fears or negative circumstances. Exposure therapy can result in significant symptom reduction, with benefits continuing for years after treatment. Which mental health professionals practice exposure therapy? Not all therapists or counselors are trained in, or provide, exposure therapy. Licensed psychologists (PhD or PsyD), licensed professional counselors (LPC), or licensed clinical social workers (LCSW) can all deliver exposure therapy.",7,-0.028060142,-0.004706919,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/do-tattoos-cause-lymphoma-202407193059,Do tattoos cause lymphoma?,1,"Not so long ago, a friend texted me from a coffee shop. He said, ""I can't believe it. I'm the only one here without a tattoo!"" That might not seem surprising: a quick glance around practically anywhere people gather shows that tattoos are widely popular. Nearly one-third of adults in the US have a tattoo, according to a Pew Research Center survey, including more than half of women ages 18 to 49. These numbers have increased dramatically over the last 20 years: around 21% of US adults in 2012 and 16% of adults in 2003 reported having at least one tattoo. If you're among them, some recent headlines may have you worried: Study Finds That Tattoos Can Increase Your Risk of Lymphoma (OnlyMyHealth) Getting a Tattoo Puts You At Higher Risk of Cancer, Claims Study (NDTV) Inky waters: Tattoos increase risk of lymphoma by over 20%, study says (Local12.com) Shocking study reveals tattoos may increase risk of lymphoma by 20% (Fox News) What study are they talking about? And how concerned should you be? Let's go through it together. One thing is clear: there's much more to this story than the headlines. Why are researchers studying a possible link between tattoos and lymphoma? Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system, a network of vessels and lymph nodes that twines throughout the body. With about 90,000 newly diagnosed cases a year, lymphoma is one of the most common types of cancer. Risk factors for it include: advancing age certain infections (such as Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, and hepatitis C) exposure to certain chemicals (such as benzene, or possibly pesticides) family history of lymphoma exposure to radiation (such as nuclear reactor accidents or after radiation therapy) having an impaired immune system certain immune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's disease, or celiac disease). Tattoos are not known to be a cause or risk factor for lymphoma. But there are several reasons to wonder if there might be a connection: Ink injected under the skin to create a tattoo contains several chemicals classified as carcinogenic (cancer causing). Pigment from tattoo ink can be found in enlarged lymph nodes within weeks of getting a tattoo. Immune cells in the skin can react to the chemicals in tattoo ink and travel to nearby lymph nodes, triggering a bodywide immune reaction. Other triggers of lymphoma, such as pesticides, have a similar effect on immune cells in lymph nodes. Is there a connection between tattoos and lymphoma? Any potential connection between tattoos and lymphoma has not been well studied. I could find only two published studies exploring the possibility, and neither found evidence of a compelling link. The first study compared 737 people with the most common type of lymphoma (called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) with otherwise similar people who did not have lymphoma. The researchers found no significant difference in the frequency of tattoos between the two groups. A study published in May 2024 — the one that triggered the scary headlines above — was larger. It compared 1,398 people ages 20 to 60 who had lymphoma with 4,193 people who did not have lymphoma but who were otherwise similar. The study found that lymphoma was 21% more common among those with tattoos lymphoma risk varied depending on how much time had passed since getting the tattoo: within two years, lymphoma risk was 81% higher between three and 10 years, no definite increased lymphoma risk was detected 11 or more years after getting a tattoo, lymphoma risk was 19% There was no correlation between the size or number of tattoos and lymphoma risk. What else should you know about the study? Importantly, nearly all of the differences in rates of lymphoma between people with and without tattoos were not statistically significant. That means the reported link between lymphoma and tattoos is questionable — and quite possibly observed by chance. In fact, some of the other findings argue against a connection, such as the lack of a link between size or number of tattoos and lymphoma risk. In addition, if tattoos significantly increase a person's risk of developing lymphoma, we might expect lymphoma rates in the US to be rising along with the popularity of tattoos. Yet that's not the case. Finally, a study like this one (called an association study) cannot prove that a potential trigger of disease (in this case, tattoos) actually caused the disease (lymphoma). There may be other factors (called confounders) that are more common among people who have tattoos, and those factors might account for the higher lymphoma risk. Do tattoos come with other health risks? While complication rates from reputable and appropriately certified tattooists are low, there are health risks associated with tattoos: infection, including bacterial skin infections or viral hepatitis allergic reactions to the ink scarring rarely, skin cancer (melanoma and other types of skin cancer). The bottom line Despite headlines suggesting a link between tattoos and the risk of lymphoma, there's no convincing evidence it's true. We'll need significantly more research to say much more than that. In the meantime, there are more important health concerns to worry about and much better ways for all of us to reduce cancer risk.",7,-0.04381379,0.061027616,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/improving-your-mobility,Improving your mobility,1,"It can't be emphasized enough: engaging in physical activity is the single most important thing you can do to maintain mobility and independence, no matter your age or your health status. Health benefits of exercise Being physically active can help you control your weight, keep your muscles and bones strong, your joints working properly, your heart healthy, your mood lifted, and your metabolism revved. The more you move, the better your strength and balance will be, and the less likely you will be to fall or lose the ability to perform basic daily functions. In addition, you reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. How much exercise do you need? For healthy adults, the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommend 150 to 300 minutes of moderate exercise a week, with activity every day. The guidelines also recommend twice-weekly strength training sessions, and balance exercises for older adults at risk of falling. Besides targeted exercises for muscle strength and flexibility, joint health, and balance, you should strive to increase routine daily physical activities that aren't formal exercises, such as climbing stairs. Exercising with a chronic condition The guidelines state: ""When older adults cannot do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week because of chronic conditions, they should be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow."" Even modest efforts count. ""Move more and sit less throughout the day,"" the guidelines advise. ""Some activity is better than none."" The key is finding activities you can do and enjoy. If your joints are the problem, don't try to ""pace"" your joints — let your joints pace you. For example, don't make yourself go jogging. Instead, pick low-impact activities such as swimming or water aerobics. Try cycling on a stationary bike at the gym or at home. Yoga, tai chi, and qigong are other good alternatives. Even a gentle walking program that ramps up slowly will help. In other words, there's a lot of flexibility in the kinds of activities you do and when. Don't feel guilty if you can't do the same kinds of activities you used to. The important thing is not to let joint pain keep you from being physically active. If you're in pain, all this activity may seem impossible. But in many cases, exercise actually helps reduce the pain. If you have osteoarthritis, for example, regular exercise not only helps maintain joint function, but also helps relieve stiffness and diminishes pain and fatigue. Maintaining muscle strength can also help dampen stresses on joints. Be sure to talk to your doctor about whether it's safe to exercise if any of the following apply: You've had hip or knee surgery. You've been experiencing pain in your hip, knee, foot and ankle, or back. You have a chronic or unstable health condition such as heart disease, or you have a respiratory ailment, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, diabetes, or several risk factors for heart disease.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/dreaming-of-a-good-nights-rest,Dreaming of a good night's rest,1,"Sleep problems are an all-too-common reality for most older adults. Maybe they have trouble falling asleep, or wake up several times during the night, or have to take naps during the day to fight fatigue. Some of these sleep issues are age-related. For example, older adults often sleep less deeply than younger people and are more easily awakened. They also may take specific medication that have sleep-disrupting side effects. Older adults also are more likely to suffer from conditions that affect sleep, like sleep apnea (where you experience short pauses in your breathing many times during the night) and restless legs syndrome (an uncontrollable urge to move the legs). Rest and renew Proper sleep is as important as diet and exercise for optimal health. When you sleep, your body's cells repair and recharge themselves, so you feel energized the next day. Sleep also clears toxins from the brain, which keeps your brain sharp. The amount of sleep people need does not change as they age, according to Dr. Salma Batool-Anwar, who specializes in sleep disorders at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Older adults still require seven to nine hours of sleep per night, just like when they were younger,"" he says. Healthy sleep also means uninterrupted sleep. A good night's rest consists of completing four to five continuous sleep cycles. Each cycle includes periods of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, when you dream, and non-REM sleep, when you have deep, dreamless slumber. ""If your sleep gets disrupted or becomes fragmented, you could lose a chunk of either non-REM or REM sleep,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Healthy sleep leads to a healthier brain Fragmented sleep can lead to a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. A study published by Current Biology measured sleep quality of adults in their 60s and 70s in a lab over an eight-hour night of sleep and periodically measured beta-amyloid protein in their brains with a PET scan over several years. (Beta-amyloid buildup is linked with Alzheimer's disease.) People with poor sleep quality also had higher amounts of beta-amyloid. Those with more restorative sleep had lower levels. Pillow talk See your doctor if you feel you suffer from a sleep-related disorder. Otherwise, the following strategies can help keep your sleep cycle running smoothly. Review your medications. Diuretics (water pills) used to control blood pressure can make you wake up to use the bathroom. Some antidepressants cause daytime drowsiness and make it hard to fall asleep at night. ""Consult your doctor about possibly changing medication, lowering the dose, or taking it at different times, like at night rather than in the morning,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Watch your naps. Regular naps reduce fatigue and increase alertness and mood. But they also can interfere with your sleep cycle if you take them later in the day. ""Schedule them during a specific time of day, like in the early to late afternoon,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Keep naps to 15 to 20 minutes (set a timer to make sure you don't oversleep). Sleeping longer can make you feel groggy. Set stimuli cutoffs. For example, don't watch TV or use a computer at least an hour before bedtime. If your bladder often wakes you up, don't drink any liquids at least two hours beforehand. Also, avoid caffeine at least three hours before bedtime; caffeine reaches a peak level in your body within an hour after consumption, but it takes three to five hours for half of it to be eliminated. While regular exercise can help with sleep quality, working out within three hours of bedtime may lead to fragmented sleep. Create a sleep routine. Go to bed around the same time, and give yourself about an hour beforehand for bedtime rituals like bathing, brushing your teeth, and putting on comfortable pajamas. ""The structure teaches your body and mind how to properly wind down, which makes falling and staying asleep easier,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Prepare a soothing sleep setting. Make sure the bedroom is dark and cool. Listen to a relaxing sound machine. Or wear eyeshades or earplugs if you are sensitive to light or noise. Buy new sheets and pillows. Also, don't keep any stimulating electronics in the bedroom like a TV, computer, or phone. Establish a time limit. If you don't fall asleep within about 20 minutes, don't lie in bed awake. ""This can make insomnia even worse,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Go to another room and read or listen to soothing music. ""But don't watch TV or a computer or anything stimulating,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. When you feel relaxed, try to sleep again. Image: © adamkaz/Getty Images",5,0.40989015,-0.029693544,True

But a large study published online April 2, 2024, by JAMA Network Open suggests that abnormal levels of those biomarkers might also signal a risk for developing chronic stress, anxiety, or depression years later. Researchers at facilities around the world, including Harvard, analyzed the health information of more than 211,000 people in Sweden. At the start of the study, participants were middle-aged (42 on average) and free of chronic stress or mood disorders. Each person was tested for levels of blood sugar and fats, such as triglycerides and HDL (good) cholesterol. After 21 years, people who'd had high blood sugar and high triglycerides at the start of the study were more likely to have developed chronic stress or mood disorders by age 60, compared with people who'd had low or normal blood sugar levels and triglycerides. On the flip side, people who'd had high levels of HDL were less likely to develop chronic stress or mood disorders compared with people who'd had low levels of HDL. This study doesn't answer the question of whether abnormal levels of sugar and fats lead to chronic stress, anxiety, or depression, or if the connection is more complicated or involves other factors. However, we know for sure that it's important to keep levels of sugar and fats normal to reduce the risk for many diseases. Image: © Westend61/Getty Images",7,0.32145357,0.24910615,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-intermittent-fasting-improve-heart-health,Can intermittent fasting improve heart health?,1,"Fasting — or purposely not eating food — dates back to ancient times when people fasted in hopes of curing a disease or for religious reasons. Today, different forms of fasting remain popular for their possible health benefits, including weight loss and improvements in heart-related risks. A recent review article suggests some potential benefits (see ""Intermittent fasting: The latest evidence""). But timing isn't everything — you still need to pay attention to the overall quality and quantity of the food you eat. Intermittent fasting includes a range of strategies to limit the timing and frequency of meals. One variation, time-restricted eating, involves eating only during a certain time window (usually eight hours) over a single day. For example, you would have food only during the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and then eat nothing during the other 16 hours. Another approach, alternate-day fasting, involves fasting or significantly limiting calories for a full day. You choose certain days during the week when you eat nothing or limit yourself to just 400 to 600 calories per day. On the other days of the week, you follow your normal eating pattern. In one popular version, the 5:2 diet, you eat normally on five days, but restrict your calories on two nonconsecutive days. With alternate-day fasting, you eat a calorie-restricted diet every other day. Intermittent fasting: The latest evidence One way to assess the effect of a diet or other therapy is to pool the results from many different randomized trials, creating what's known as a meta-analysis. Another version — called an umbrella review — goes one step further by combining results from many different meta-analyses and other review articles. That's what a team of researchers did with intermittent fasting. Their umbrella review, in the April 2024 issue of eClinical Medicine, combined results from 23 meta-analyses and reviews of intermittent fasting studies, which included mostly people classed as overweight or obese and also some with diabetes or metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that raise the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes). The control groups varied but included people on calorie-restricted diets, typical diets for specific cultures, and habitual diets (what participants normally ate). Researchers found good evidence that intermittent fasting can lower waist circumference fat mass triglycerides LDL and total cholesterol fasting insulin (the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels) systolic blood pressure (the first number in a blood pressure reading). Pros and cons for fasting ""Generally speaking, intermittent fasting has a good safety profile,"" says Dr. Armen Yerevanian, an endocrinologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. People with diabetes who rely on insulin and certain medications to lower their blood sugar levels need to be cautious, however. For them, fasting isn't dangerous, but it requires careful planning with their doctor to minimize the risk of low blood sugar. Intermittent fasting probably helps improve cholesterol levels and other heart risk factors because the practice promotes weight loss. Because of the time restrictions, you naturally tend to eat fewer calories, especially if you shut down a habit of late-night binge eating. Plus, when you don't eat for extended periods of time, your body switches fuels away from carbohydrates and starts burning stored fat. Challenging to maintain ""The biggest issue with intermittent fasting is that it can be challenging to maintain over the long run,"" says Dr. Yerevanian. Most studies of the practice have lasted just 12 to 16 weeks, although some have gone up to six months. It's easier to stick to a diet when you're being closely watched as part of a study, he says. But in the real world, it's often hard to follow a strict eating schedule when you're also juggling various work, family, and social commitments. ""The times that I've seen time-restricted eating be most successful is when people are ready to make a broad set of lifestyle changes to improve their health,"" says Dr. Yerevanian. Rather than relying solely on intermittent fasting, they use it as a tool to change other aspects of their lifestyle that are affecting their weight and heart risks. Combined with a healthy, plant-focused diet, along with regular aerobic and strength-building exercise and routine preventive care, intermittent fasting can be a safe and effective tool to improve your cardiovascular health.

Researchers recruited more than 1,000 adults who were at an elevated risk for a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years. Participants used a fitness tracker for two weeks to establish a baseline number of daily steps. Everyone then set a goal to increase their average daily steps by 33%, 40%, 50%, or any number greater than 1,500 steps. After setting their goals, participants were randomly divided into four groups. Three groups were offered incentives to reach their goals. One received game-like rewards, another financial rewards, and the third a combination of both. A control group wore fitness trackers but didn't receive incentives. The game and financial rewards consisted of people earning or losing points or money depending on whether they met their daily step goal. The control group received a daily text telling them if they met their goal. Over a year, participants in the fitness tracker control group increased their daily step count by an average of 1,500 steps. In contrast, people in all the incentive groups improved their daily steps by 2,000 to 2,400 steps. This amount of increase would be expected to correlate with a 10% reduced risk of death from heart attack or stroke.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/reaching-the-climax,Reaching the climax,1,"Regular orgasms offer numerous health benefits for men, such as lowering stress, boosting mood, and improving sleep quality. Some research has suggested that they may help reduce the risk of heart disease and prostate cancer. However, as they age, men can face obstacles to achieving orgasms. They may be unable to have an orgasm during sex (a condition known as anorgasmia), or it may take a frustratingly long time to climax (what's called delayed orgasm). Men also may have trouble maintaining an erection long enough to have sex. Sometimes, lack of arousal can prevent them from reaching an orgasm. ""Men don't have to achieve an orgasm every time during sex to have a satisfying experience with their partner,"" says Dr. Sharon Bober, director of the Sexual Health Program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""But if men are unable to have regular orgasms during sex, there are ways to help."" Many issues can contribute to problems having orgasm, such as low testosterone levels, medication side effects, and psychological problems like anxiety and stress, so first check with your doctor. Still, sometimes men only need extra stimulation or sexual excitement to reach orgasm. Or they may require help maintaining an erection (and don't want to rely on erectile dysfunction medication). In these cases, Dr. Bober suggests trying the following strategies. Masturbate more Masturbating alongside your partner or enlisting their help can increase excitement. ""Masturbation helps reduce the stress of performance or climaxing within a certain period, since you can take your time and go at your own pace,"" says Dr. Bober. Men also may benefit from frequent solo masturbation. ""Men know what arouses them, and masturbating more by themselves can help them focus on their own pleasure,"" says Dr. Bober. ""This may help lower expectations with partner sex because they don't have to view having an orgasm as the ultimate goal of their satisfaction. Instead, they can focus on the experience of connecting with their partner, which can increase arousal."" Get erotic Reading erotic literature together can stimulate sexual desire through storytelling, imagery, fantasy, and language. ""Reading and listening stimulate your largest sexual organ: your brain,"" says Dr. Bober. There are now many erotic novels and short story anthologies that cater specifically to older adults. (You can find a wide selection with an Internet search and via websites for publishing houses and booksellers.) Play with toys Many kinds of sex toys and devices help increase stimulation and help maintain erections. For instance, the penile vibratory device is placed around the penis and vibrates to stimulate the nerves in the base of the penis to encourage an orgasm. It's used before sex and can be incorporated into foreplay. To help maintain an erection, men could try a penile band, also known as an ED ring. It fastens around the base of an erect penis to keep blood from escaping. Bands are made of rubber, plastic, or silicone and can be bought online. Another helpful device is a vacuum pump. You place your penis into an airtight plastic cylinder that's attached to a handheld pump. Air is pumped out of the cylinder to create a vacuum, which increases blood flow to the penis. It takes about five minutes to get an erection. You then remove your penis from the cylinder and fit a penile band around its base to prevent blood from draining. The erection lasts until the band is removed. Some pumps are manual, while others operate on a battery. You can find them in many pharmacies and online. Go exploring Devote more time to the excitement of hugging, kissing, and exploring each other's bodies, and experiment with different foreplay like giving each other a massage or giving and receiving oral sex. Also, talk with your partner about what they are interested in trying. This could include fantasies, role playing, or different sexual positions. ""Many times, just having the conversation can boost arousal for both people,"" says Dr. Bober. Image: © yacobchuk/Getty Images",5,0.24251607,-0.08233531,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-you-missing-this-simple-treatment-for-restless-legs,Are you missing this simple treatment for restless legs?,1,"Image: © AlexRaths/Getty Images People with restless legs syndrome (RLS) experience an overwhelming need to move the legs, particularly at night or as they fall asleep. But a simple treatment that may help reduce RLS symptoms is often overlooked as a potential first line of defense. The concern is that people are being started on medications first when iron might be a valuable treatment. It's simple, with relatively few side effects. Understanding RLS An estimated 2.5% of Americans — more women than men — have frequent and bothersome RLS. Symptoms include tingling, crawling, aching, pulling, or painful sensations that can be relieved only by moving the leg (or, sometimes, arm) in which it occurs. Some people have RLS symptoms only when immobile on long plane or car rides. Four out of five people who have RLS also have another condition called periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), which causes involuntary jerking or twitching movements in the legs during sleep. Movements occur every 20 to 40 seconds for a few minutes or a few hours at a time, leading to disrupted sleep, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue for both the person who has PLMS and his or her bed partner. RLS causes The exact cause of RLS is unclear. People with iron deficiency (see ""The importance of iron"") are much more likely to experience the disorder, but might not be tested for it. This is particularly in men, in whom iron deficiency is uncommon. The link between RLS and iron does not just depend on low blood iron levels. Instead, RLS may be caused by low levels of iron in the brain. It's possible to have a low brain level of iron but a normal blood level of iron. The two levels can be different. Diagnosing low brain iron Brain iron deficiency should be one of the first considerations when looking for a cause of RLS. But diagnosing low brain iron is tricky. Doctors don't have a way of assessing brain iron outside of specialized brain imaging. So doctors need to infer it from blood levels. A low blood iron level and symptoms of RLS make it very likely that the person has low brain iron levels as well. Doctors use several tests to measure iron in the blood. One test measures iron levels directly. But the best way to diagnose iron deficiency is a blood test measuring ferritin, the primary form of stored iron in the body. The ferritin level also provides guidance as to which type of iron therapy should be recommended. Treating RLS with food Dietary iron may sometimes be enough to treat RLS if your ferritin level is at or below 50 micrograms per liter (mcg/L). Red meat is really the best way. However, consuming excessive amounts of red meat, especially cured meats like ham or salami, is associated with an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, diverticulitis, and some types of cancer. Legumes are a healthier iron source, but absorption of iron from them is less efficient. The importance of iron Iron is an essential mineral that we get from our diet, in foods such as red meat, cooked soybeans, cooked lentils, ground turkey, and fortified bread and breakfast cereals. We need only a small amount of dietary iron each day: 8 milligrams per day for adult men and for women starting at age 50 (or whenever menstruation ends). You may have low iron levels if your diet does not include iron-rich foods or if you have an underlying condition — such as cancer of the stomach, colon, bladder, or kidney — that causes blood to be lost from the body. Women who are menstruating often have low iron levels. The vast majority of dietary iron we absorb helps us make hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying chemical in the body's red blood cells). Iron is also essential for making myoglobin (a protein in muscle cells); activating certain enzymes; and making amino acids, collagen, neurotransmitters, and hormones. Low iron levels can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. In this condition, there are too few red blood cells, and the red blood cells are too small. The low levels of hemoglobin make it harder for the blood to carry oxygen to organs. In menstruating women, iron deficiency is most often due to menstrual blood loss. In men and in women who are not menstruating, it's important to find out what may be causing low iron levels and treat potential causes. Treating RLS with oral iron The more reliable treatment is oral iron. Experts recommend treating RLS with a pill form of iron when the ferritin level is 50 mcg/L or lower. It relieves RLS symptoms substantially in about half of the cases in people with ferritin at these levels. The dose: The usual starting dose is one tablet of 325 milligrams of ferrous sulfate once per day. It's best absorbed when your stomach is acidic, so take it on an empty stomach or take it with vitamin C. Oral iron can cause stomach upset and constipation. Taking one tablet every other day rather than daily can often be enough to replete iron stores and reduce RLS symptoms. Treating RLS with IV iron infusion Absorbing iron orally may not be possible if blood iron levels are not low. Sometimes the gut absorbs iron poorly. In those cases, and in cases in which people are unable to tolerate the digestive effects of oral iron, doctors bypass the gut and prescribe an intravenous (IV) infusion of iron to treat RLS. How often would you need an infusion to treat RLS? That depends on how your ferritin level is to start, why you're losing iron and how quickly your levels are dropping over time. Other strategies It may take a month before iron levels increase and RLS symptoms decline. During that period, if RLS is intolerable, your doctor can prescribe the usual drugs to treat it. Medication may also be recommended for RLS if you are not deficient in iron. Some drugs for RLS, like pramipexole (Mirapex) and ropinirole (Requip), are also used to treat Parkinson's disease but the doses used for RLS are lower. Other options are gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), or gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant), which are also used to treat nerve pain. Pill-free strategies may help ease RLS, too: massage or stretch the legs before bed, exercise daily, and avoid alcohol. Like taking iron, pill-free approaches offer a simple way to help relieve RLS and shouldn't be overlooked.",5,0.24567008,-0.19230342,False

Published online April 8, 2024, by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, the study included 1,196 adults who used the app, which is based on current guidelines for statin use. Their average LDL (bad) cholesterol level was about 140 mg/dL. In general, LDL levels should be 100 or lower and even less (below 70 or even 55) for people with heart disease. Nearly 91% of the participants correctly determined whether they should or shouldn't take a statin, as compared with a doctor's assessment. Most continued on to the six-month treatment phase, and 98% correctly used the recommended drug (a 5-milligram dose of rosuvastatin [Crestor]), achieving a 35% drop in their LDL levels.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/meditation-a-heartfelt-habit,Meditation: A heartfelt habit?,1,"Meditating sounds so simple: Just sit comfortably and quiet your mind. Yet even seasoned practitioners will tell you that settling into a meditative state isn't easy, especially when you're anxious, worried, or stressed. But meditation may benefit people prone to cardiovascular disease, so it's worth giving this mind-calming technique a try (see ""How meditation may help your heart""). ""When you start any new activity, coaching or guidance can really help, and that's also true when learning to meditate,"" says Dr. Darshan Mehta, medical director of the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Many communities have meditation centers where you can take classes in person. But online courses, which are more convenient and accessible, can be just as effective, he says. Another option is to try a smartphone app that offers guided meditations; popular ones include Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer, and 10% Happier. How meditation may help your heart An article published Feb. 15, 2024, in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews looked at the potential cardiovascular benefits from two forms of meditation: mindfulness-based practices and Transcendental Meditation. The authors analyzed 81 randomized controlled trials involving a total of nearly 7,000 people. Over all, the findings were mixed, which may reflect some of the inherent challenges of studying meditation. For one thing, creating an appropriate placebo or control group for meditation is tricky. Often, the controls are either people on a waiting list to receive meditation training (inactive controls) or those who do crossword puzzles or attend education sessions (active controls). For another, the people most likely to volunteer for a meditation study are often already sold on meditation's benefits and may differ from those who aren't interested in the practice. Still, the review found that mindfulness-based interventions probably reduce stress and may also lower anxiety, depression, and blood pressure. Transcendental meditation may also reduce blood pressure. According to the authors, some of meditation's effect may be indirect: when people feel calmer, that may help them avoid unhealthy ways of coping with stress, such as drinking alcohol or making poor food choices. Attention and awareness Meditative practices fall into two broad categories: focused attention and open monitoring. With focused attention, you concentrate on one thing: counting, a mantra (a word or phrase such as ""peace"" or ""may I be well""), or an object (a candle, a tree, or prayer beads, for example). One well-known form, Transcendental Meditation, uses mantras. With open monitoring, you open your awareness to everything you're experiencing, including thoughts, feelings, sounds, and bodily sensations. Mindfulness meditation, which has become popular in recent decades, incorporates both attention and awareness. Other forms of meditation include samatha (calming and concentration) meditation, vipassana (insight) meditation, and metta (loving-kindness) meditation. Cultivating a meditation practice These tips may help you foster a regular meditation practice: Practice when it's practical. For some people, mornings are most convenient. Others prefer to meditate at the end of the day. Stick with it. Make it a habit once you've found your ideal time of day to meditate. Don't have high expectations. You won't emerge from your first session as a changed human being. Meditation is a process. Give it time, and you'll see improvements gradually. Take your practice with you. Meditate wherever you can find quiet moments alone — in your bedroom, at work, or while walking in the park. Accessorize. To focus your mind, use something meaningful to you, such as a candle, a piece of art, or a photo of a loved one. Be prepared to be uncomfortable. Stilling your thoughts is harder than it sounds. It could take a while for you to feel comfortable in the practice. Don't fight the feeling. Relax into the practice. Let your thoughts drift away. Ease into your breath. Even if you feel slightly uncomfortable, try to give in to the feeling and not push back against it. Be kind to yourself. If you don't get the hang of meditation right away, forgive yourself and try again. You will eventually get it. Check in with yourself. After each session, pause and take stock of your feelings.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-is-leaky-gut-syndrome,What is leaky gut syndrome?,1,"Q. I've been gassy and bloated in recent months, and my sister suggested that I may have leaky gut syndrome. What's that? A. For starters, anyone who's been dealing with chronic intestinal symptoms like yours should see a doctor. There are many reasons for gas and bloating to persist, and a medical evaluation will help get to the bottom of things. Beyond that, while leaky gut syndrome isn't a clinical diagnosis, it may be one possible contributor to your symptoms. A ""leaky gut"" happens when the barrier between the gut and bloodstream breaks down due to inflammation in the small intestine. The resulting bacteria and toxins that seep through the gut lining can trigger a variety of intestinal problems, including bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or gastroparesis (which prevents proper stomach emptying). To determine what's causing your distress, your doctor will likely ask what foods, supplements, and medications you consume. She may also perform blood tests or endoscopic exams of the digestive tract to detect any infections or structural reasons for your symptoms. Sometimes, a simple change of diet — such as cutting out certain foods or adding others — does the trick. But getting properly assessed is your next step.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/guidelines-for-healthy-eating-with-diabetes,Guidelines for healthy eating with diabetes,1,"""What can I eat?"" is one of the most common questions that people with diabetes ask. The American Diabetes Association no longer makes specific recommendations about proportions of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Instead, its guidelines focus on developing healthy eating patterns, with the help of your doctor and a registered dietitian who has experience working with people who have diabetes. The guidelines include the following recommendations: Reduce overall carbohydrates. When you do eat carbs, they should come from nutrient-rich sources, such as vegetables (particularly non-starchy ones), whole grains, fruits, legumes, and dairy products, rather than from processed foods with added fat, sugar, and sodium. Limit your intake of saturated fat (found mainly in animal products).Even good fats such as olive oil should be eaten in moderation. Replace sugar-sweetened beverages (including those sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup or sucrose) with water. Reduce sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day, or lower if you have high blood pressure. Drink alcohol in moderation only if you can account for the calories in your daily meal plan. Moderate drinking is defined as one standard drink a day for women and up to two a day for men. You must be cautious, however. Alcohol can worsen low blood sugar reactions in people who take insulin or certain other diabetes medications. And because some effects of alcohol (such as drowsiness or slurred speech) resemble those of hypoglycemia, it can be hard to recognize a true diabetic emergency if you have one.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/exercise-can-ease-rheumatoid-arthritis-pain,Exercise can ease rheumatoid arthritis pain,1,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can cause pain and stiffness that makes moving the last thing you want to do. But staying active is important. Not only is it beneficial for your general health — it's also a way to strengthen the muscles around your joints, improve your range of motion, and give you the opportunity to take part in the activities you enjoy. For people with RA, it's best to take a cautious and strategic approach when starting an exercise program. An individualized program — ideally developed with the help of a physical therapist — can help you protect vulnerable joints while strengthening surrounding muscles. A well-rounded exercise program should include each of these elements: Aerobic conditioning. Exercise that increases your heart rate and breathing rate has many benefits, including lowering your chances of developing conditions such as diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. When choosing aerobic activities, people with RA should consider low-impact exercises such as swimming, bicycle riding, and walking. Resistance training. Weak muscles, whether related to inactivity or side effects of medications like steroids, can diminish your stamina and leave joints less stable. Isometric exercises — exercises that involve muscle contractions with no movement, such as clasping your hands and pressing your arms together — can be a great way to start resistance training. When pain is under control, free weights or weight machines are good options for building muscle and increasing strength. Stretching and flexibility exercises. Joints damaged by RA don't move with the same ease or to the same degree (also called range of motion) as healthy joints. That makes activities that lengthen and strengthen the muscles surrounding your joints, such as stretching exercises, tai chi, and yoga, especially important for people with RA. Balance exercises. Having RA can cause problems with gait and balance, leaving you more vulnerable to stumbles and falls. A physical therapist can recommend individualized balance-training exercises. These may include practicing standing on one leg or exercises to strengthen core muscles.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/4-ways-to-eat-your-way-to-lower-cholesterol,4 ways to eat your way to lower cholesterol,1,"Many people can lower their cholesterol levels simply by changing what they eat. For example, eating less meat (and leaner cuts) and more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains can potentially lower your total cholesterol by 25% or more. Here are four steps for lowering your cholesterol through diet. Stick with unsaturated fats and avoid saturated and trans fats. Most vegetable fats (oils) are made up of ""healthy"" unsaturated fats that are good for your heart. Foods that contain healthy fats include oily fish, nuts, seeds, and some vegetables. At the same time, try to limit your intake of foods high in saturated fat, such as many meat and dairy products. Get more soluble fiber. Eating more soluble fiber, such as that found in oatmeal and fruits, can lower blood cholesterol levels when eaten as part of a healthy-fat diet. Include plant sterols and stanols in your diet. These naturally occurring plant compounds are similar in structure to cholesterol, so when you eat them, they help limit the amount of cholesterol your body can absorb. Plant sterols and stanols are found in an increasing number of food products such as spreads, juices, and yogurts. Find a diet that works for you. When a friend or relative tells you how much his or her cholesterol level dropped after trying a particular diet, you may be tempted to try it yourself. If you do, and after a few months you discover that you're not getting the same benefits, you may need to chalk it up to genetic and physiological differences. There is no one-size-fits-all diet for cholesterol control. You may need to try several approaches to find one that works for you. Although diet can be a simple and powerful way to improve cholesterol levels, it plays a bigger role for some people than for others. Don't be discouraged if you have followed a diet but haven't reached your goal blood level. Keep it up. Even if you do end up needing medication to keep your cholesterol in check, you likely will need less than if you didn't make any dietary changes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/omega-3-foods-incorporating-healthy-fats-into-your-diet,Omega-3 foods: Incorporating healthy fats into your diet,1,"Found in foods such as fish and nuts, omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat that your body can't make on its own. Learn why these healthy fats are important to your health, and how to get them. Health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids Don't let the name ""fatty acid"" fool you. Omega-3 fatty acids are good for your body. These healthy fats may help keep your heart healthy, protect against stroke, and offer other benefits for your health. In fact, the American Heart Association (AHA) has recommended omega-3s from fish and fish oil for the past 20 years to reduce cardiovascular events, such as heart attack or stroke, in people who already have cardiovascular disease. Research shows that omega-3s are good for your health in several ways. Heart health. Omega-3s benefit the heart and blood vessels by reducing triglycerides, lowering the risk of arrhythmias, slowing plaque buildup in arteries, and slightly lowering blood pressure. Arthritis. Omega-3s may help alleviate symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Brain and eye development. Research shows that omega-3 fatty acids, particularly a type of omega-3 known as DHA, are important for the development of brain and visual functions. Disease prevention. Studies suggest that people who consume more omega-3s may have a lower risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. Research has been mixed on whether omega-3s reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Increase your omega-3 intake through diet You can get omega-3s from the foods you eat, especially fatty fish and some plant foods. The three forms of omega-3s are: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA is found mainly in plant oils such as canola oil and flaxseed oil, while seafood is the best source of EPA and DHA. Some foods, such as eggs, yogurt, and milk, may be fortified with omega-3s. Your body can convert small amounts of ALA into EPA and DHA, but not enough to support your body's needs. The best approach to getting omega-3s in your diet is to include nuts, seeds, and healthy oils in your diet, along with fish and other omega-3 fortified foods. This approach can help you get a variety of healthy fats. Fatty fish: The ultimate source of omega-3s EPA- and DHA-rich fatty fish is an excellent source of omega-3s. The AHA advises eating at least two servings of fatty fish, or fish rich in omega-3s, per week. Each serving should be about 3 ounces. Examples of fatty fish include: salmon mackerel trout sardines sea bass. Plant-based omega-3 foods ALA-rich foods include plant-based oils, seeds, and nuts such as: flaxseeds and flaxseed oil chia seeds walnuts canola oil soybean oil. Among plant-based foods, ground flaxseeds and flaxseed oil have the highest amounts of ALA. An easy way to boost your intake of ALA-rich foods is to sprinkle ground flaxseeds on granola, snack on nuts during the day, or try chia pudding as a snack. Omega-3 supplements: What to consider Omega-3 supplements may be derived from: fish oil fish liver oil (such as cod liver oil) algal oils (vegetarian). Side effects of omega-3 supplements are typically mild but may include unpleasant breath, bad-smelling sweat, headache, heartburn, nausea, and diarrhea. The FDA recommends limiting total EPA and DHA from supplements to no more than 5 grams per day. Omega-3 supplements can have an anticoagulant effect, which means they decrease the ability of your blood to clot. This effect can compound the effect of an anticoagulant medication like warfarin (Coumadin) or apixaban (Eliquis). Anyone taking an anticoagulant medication should check with their doctor first before taking an omega-3 supplement. Most health experts agree whole foods, which contain a range of nutrients, are the best source of omega-3s.",3,0.36461478,0.18657948,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-rid-of-bloating-tips-for-relief,How to get rid of bloating: Tips for relief,1,"Why am I so bloated? Chances are, you've thought this at some point. Bloating is very common: nearly one in seven Americans reported experiencing it over the course of a week, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. That tight, full feeling of bloating can be uncomfortable. And it's often accompanied by distension, in which the abdomen swells in size. The good news is there's a lot you can do with lifestyle, including diet and exercise, to relieve symptoms. Understanding bloating: Causes and triggers Bloating results when too much gas builds up in the abdomen. Here's a quick look at some of the most common reasons for excess gas buildup and bloating. Swallowing too much air. You swallow air every time you eat or drink. But if you consume food or fluid very quickly, you may gulp down extra air every time you swallow. Certain foods. Fruits, veggies, whole grains, and beans are all good for you, but they are harder for your gastrointestinal (GI) tract to digest. Vegetables like cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli, for example, all contain the carbohydrate raffinose. Your body can't break this substance down until it reaches your colon, where the bacteria who devour it release gas. Food intolerance. Some people are lactose intolerant, which means they have trouble digesting the milk sugar lactose. As a result, they may notice bloating after they eat or drink dairy products. Others have fructose intolerance, which means they develop GI symptoms after they eat foods high in fructose, a sugar naturally found in fruits and honey as well as table sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup. A slowing system. As you get older, your digestive system tends to slow down. This can cause gas to build up in your GI tract and trigger bloating. SIBO. Some people have too many bacteria in their small intestine, a condition known as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO can lead to an imbalance of bacteria that support digestion, leading to symptoms like bloating as well as constipation and diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Bloating is a common symptoms of IBS, a condition characterized by chronic belly pain and altered bowel habits. Most people get bloated occasionally. But if it happens a lot, or if you have other symptoms like stomach pain, unexplained weight loss, or bloody stools, see your doctor. They'll want to check for a more serious condition like inflammatory bowel disease or even colon cancer. Dietary changes to reduce bloating The following dietary tweaks can help to reduce bloating. Keep a diary. For a few weeks, note what you ate, when you ate, and when you felt especially bloated. This may help you and your doctor identify foods that are problematic. Remove or decrease quantities of key culprits. Some of the top offenders for bloating include: carbonated beverages like soda and beer dairy products: you can switch to lactose-free milks (Lactaid, others) or plant-based milks like almond milk instead sugar-free gum and candies — they contain artificial sweeteners that can cause bloating beans fruits high in fructose such as apples, apricots, bananas, peaches, pears, and dried fruit cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower. Consider a low-FODMAP diet. If the above steps don't help, you may want to consider this eating pattern, which avoids certain types of carbohydrates that are hard to digest. Since this diet can be very restrictive, it's best to do it under the guidance of a nutritionist. Mindful eating practices to prevent bloating If you gobble down your meals, you may find that you're bloated afterwards. When you eat fast, you swallow air. You may also overeat. Both contribute to bloating. One way to help prevent this is to practice mindful eating. That means you focus on your food rather than your phone, TV, or another distraction. Some ways to eat mindfully include: Eat with chopsticks, or with your non-dominant hand (so if you're a righty, eat with your left hand). Chew your food 30 times per bite. Eat in a screen-free zone — that means no smartphone, computer, or TV. Plate your food rather than eating it straight from a container or serving dish. Eat sitting down. Make your meal last at least 20 minutes. Physical activities to keep bloating at bay Staying active is good for your brain, heart, and even your gut. According to a 2023 review published in the Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine, exercise — whether it's walking, running, biking, swimming, or doing yoga — appears to help relieve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, which include bloating. It may also help relieve stress, which has also been linked to worsening of bloating. If you can't fit in a regular workout, at least try to take a stroll after meals. People who took a 10-to-15-minute walk after they ate reported less bloating, according to a 2021 study. Home remedies for bloating relief There are a lot of products out there claiming to cure bloating. While there's no magic way to instantly relieve gas, here are a few things you can try at home. Cook with anise. This herb has also been shown to reduce bloating in people with IBS and dyspepsia. Try over-the-counter medications. The most popular one is simethicone, found in products like Gas-X or Maalox Anti-Gas. Simethicone helps to break up gas bubbles. Other products, like CharcoCaps, contain activated charcoal. These products may help with occasional bloating, but there's no good evidence any work. Consider alpha-d-galactosidase. Also known as Beano, this over-the-counter product helps to break down certain difficult-to-digest carbohydrates found in beans and some vegetables.",1,0.3674166,-0.090902105,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/are-you-getting-essential-nutrients-from-your-diet,Probiotics and prebiotics: what's really important,1,"Probiotics and prebiotics are a hot topic these days. You've likely seen many ads on television and online for supplements and foods that promise to deliver helpful bacteria and their benefits. Here's what you need to know before purchasing these products. Your large intestine contains 100 trillion ""good"" bacteria that are essential to health. Called the microbiome, these beneficial microbes help maintain healthy bowel function, and may even help with conditions like inflammatory bowel disease. Research suggests they may even play a role in regulating weight and mood. Everyone starts with their own unique microbiome at birth. We add to these through the foods we eat. Here are some of the best ways to add healthful bacteria to your microbiome: Yogurt and kefir. Be sure to look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label to make sure you are getting live cultures. Fermented foods. Beneficial microbes are the ""cooks"" for some familiar foods. For example, they turn cabbage into sauerkraut, cucumbers into sour pickles, soybeans into miso, and sweetened tea into kombucha. When the products have been pasteurized — as most packaged fermented foods are — the microbes will be dead. The best solution is to buy from delis where they do the pickling themselves, or natural food stores that carry fermented foods. Or make your own; you can find clear and easy instructions in books and online. There are also probiotic supplements on the market, of course. But none have proven medical indications. It's best to stick with dietary sources rich in pre- and probiotics. You can help your body produce healthy gut bacteria. Here's how: Include plenty of foods rich in insoluble fiber, which tend to contain the most prebiotics. You'll find them whole-grain products such as oatmeal and whole-grain breads, as well as in vegetables like asparagus, leeks, onions, and garlic, and starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes and corn. Beans, lentils, and peas are also good sources. Limit sugar, saturated fat, and processed foods. These can deplete the good bacteria in the gut. As always, try to stick with whole, unprocessed foods.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/how-to-silence-snoring,How to silence snoring,1,"Snoring is generally harmless, but it can be annoying, especially for your bed partner. Fortunately, you can take steps to alleviate the problem. Start by making lifestyle changes and trying simple home remedies. You can also try one of the many products marketed as stop-snoring aids. But if you snore and you also wake up gasping for air or frequently feel sleepy or tired during the day, you likely have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea can cause hypertension and more serious medical problems. Consult a doctor if your snoring affects the quality of your sleep. Lifestyle changes and home remedies You can try these do-it-yourself suggestions to help keep your airway open during sleep: Avoid alcohol — or don't drink alcohol within three hours of bedtime. This will help prevent your airway muscles from becoming slack while you sleep. Lose weight if you are overweight or obese. Extra fat tissue in the neck and throat can narrow the airways. Losing some weight could help to open the airways for someone who is overweight or obese, although many people who are lean also snore. Try home remedies for nasal obstruction issues. If your nose is stuffy due to mucus, try rinsing your sinuses with saline. If you have allergies, reduce dust mites and pet dander in your bedroom or use an allergy medication. If swollen nasal tissues are the problem, a humidifier or medication may reduce swelling. If you smoke, quit. In addition to smoking's many other negative health effects, people who smoke are also more likely to snore. Possible reasons include nightly nicotine withdrawal, which can disrupt sleep, as well as increased swelling and irritation in the upper airway. In fact, even secondhand smoke from another member of your household may increase your risk of snoring. Sleep on your side or elevate your head. When you sleep flat on your back, your tongue falls back and presses against the top of your airway, so sleeping on your side may help. To help you stay on your side, try pressing a long, oversized body pillow against your back. You can also wear a small fanny pack filled with tennis balls, or tape a tennis ball or rolled-up pair of socks to the back of your pajamas. This makes lying on your back uncomfortable. Or you can try elevating your head by using an extra pillow or a wedge pillow, or by propping up the head of your bed using blocks of wood under the top of the bed frame. These lifestyle changes and home remedies may help with simple snoring. However, if you have periods of gasping during sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness as well as snoring, it could be sleep apnea and let your doctor know.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-you-become-a-super-ager,"Can you become a ""super-ager""?",1,"The 2024 presidential election, in which the two leading candidates will turn 78 and 82 during the year, has raised the issue about cognitive health as people age. But individuals known as ""super-agers"" have shown that for some, age really is only a number. ""Super-agers are known to maintain peak mental prowess well into their 90s and avoid Alzheimer's disease and other dementias,"" says Dr. Daniel Daneshvar, chief of the Division of Brain Injury Rehabilitation at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. ""While the general thinking is that memory declines and brain functions slow as we age no matter what, studies on super-agers suggest this is not inevitable, and there may be ways to maintain high levels of cognitive function for much longer in life."" The aging brain The average brain declines in volume and weight by about 5% per decade after age 40, with a steeper decline after age 70. Brain shrinkage particularly affects the brain regions involved with learning and memory, like the frontal lobe and hippocampus. A smaller brain volume is also linked to less robust communication between brain regions, which leads to slower processing speed and can impair other cognitive functions. ""These usual age-related brain changes can affect thinking and make it harder to recall words and names, focus on tasks, and process new information,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. The brains of super-agers, however, shrink at about half the average rate, and their memory and cognitive skills stay on par with younger brains. What goes on inside super-ager brains that accounts for this? Harvard investigators, publishing in the November 2021 issue of Cerebral Cortex, offer a clue. They recruited 40 older adults who were identified as super-agers. The super-agers took a memory test while their brains were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which shows the activity of different brain areas. For comparison, the researchers also carried out the memory test and fMRI scan on 41 young adults (average age 25). The super-agers performed similarly to the younger people on the memory tests. The fMRI also showed that activity in the super-agers' visual cortex, the brain area that processes visual input, was similar to that in the younger brains. What's super about super-agers? Studies have found that genetics is the greatest component in the state of aging brains. ""Science has identified about 100 genes common among super-agers, although it's unclear which ones in particular are linked with neurological benefits,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. ""If you win the lottery and are born with those genes, you have a good chance of becoming a super-ager."" But what if your genetic scratch-off is a bust? Can you still be a winner with super-aging? ""Super-agers also tend to follow a healthy lifestyle, and many reach their 90s free of problems like heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Here's a look at the healthy daily habits of many super-agers and how they may help protect your brain. Eat more ""superfoods."" Many super-agers follow diets rich in foods high in antioxidants, polyphenols, and omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients have been shown to fight inflammation and help protect the body from disease-causing cell damage. Examples include berries, whole grains (oatmeal, quinoa), fatty fish (salmon, trout), nuts (walnuts, almonds), olive oil, cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower), avocados, and green tea. Unsurprisingly, these foods are staples in many plant-based diets associated with brain and heart health, like the MIND, DASH, and Mediterranean diets. It's not certain which of the foods or amounts are ideal, so focus on meals that contain a variety of them. Be more active. Super-agers tend to engage in more physical activity. Regular exercise has been found to help maintain brain volume and cognitive function, even if you begin later in life. Exercise sparks physiological changes in the body, such as the production of growth factors — chemicals that enhance brain cell function and survival and can actually stimulate formation of new brain cells. Many studies have suggested that the parts of the brain that control thinking and memory are larger in volume in people who exercise than in people who don't. It doesn't matter what type of exercise you do. Research has found that walking, swimming, other aerobic activity (especially high-intensity interval training, or HIIT), strength training, tai chi, and yoga are all associated with improved memory. But consistency is key. ""Being active on a regular basis leads to greater brain benefits,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Be more social. Super-agers tend to have more social interactions. Studies have shown that regular social engagement is associated with healthier brains. The opposite is also true: social isolation is linked to lower volume of gray matter in brain regions related to cognition. Challenge yourself. Super-agers challenge their brains, and studies have shown that learning new things as you age aids memory. For instance, study a second language, learn a musical instrument, or adopt a new hobby. Get good sleep. Super-agers also prioritize sleep. (Guidelines suggest seven to nine hours nightly.) ""During sleep, the brain clears away metabolic waste that builds up early in the development of Alzheimer's disease,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. A study in the November 2022 issue of the journal Sleep found that trouble falling or staying asleep three or more nights per week for three months boosted the risk for worsening memory in older adults.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-low-should-ldl-cholesterol-go,How low should LDL cholesterol go?,1,"When it comes to reducing ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, how low should you go? ""People who are at high risk for cardiovascular diseases can benefit from driving LDL levels as low as possible to help reduce their risk for heart attacks and strokes,"" says cardiologist Dr. Christopher Cannon, editor in chief of the Harvard Heart Letter. ""Across many large clinical trials, for LDL, the lower the better."" The good and the bad Cholesterol is a fatty substance that occurs naturally in the body. The body uses it to make cell membranes and certain hormones. The fat you consume from food is absorbed in the intestine and transported to the liver, which converts it into cholesterol and then releases it into the bloodstream. Eating high-cholesterol foods often has only a modest impact on cholesterol in the blood, but many such foods are also high in saturated fats, which have a greater effect on cholesterol levels. ""Most of your cholesterol level is determined genetically,"" says Dr. Cannon. There are two main types of cholesterol: LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). LDL is called ""bad"" because excess amounts in the bloodstream can lodge inside artery walls. These deposits, called plaques, can rupture and trigger clotting that blocks blood flow to the heart or brain, causing a heart attack or stroke. By comparison, HDL has in the past been considered ""good"" because some forms of HDL collect excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and artery walls. Still, notes Dr. Cannon, ""many clinical trials have found that raising blood levels of HDL does not lower the risk of heart attack or stroke, so the focus is on lowering LDL."" By the numbers Current guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology set optimal LDL levels for the general population at below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL); 100 to 159 mg/dL is deemed high, and 160 mg/dL and higher is considered dangerous. People with known cardiovascular disease should aim for LDL levels below 70 mg/dL. ""Thus, across the spectrum of patients, the higher risk ones have a lower goal for LDL,"" says Dr. Cannon. Besides high LDL levels, having one or more other factors also can contribute to your cardiovascular risk, such as a family history of premature heart disease (a father or brother who was diagnosed at 55 or younger, or a mother or sister diagnosed before age 65) smoking obesity diabetes high blood pressure low levels of HDL (below 40 mg/dL). Why the focus on 70 mg/dL? ""Studies have shown that when LDL falls below this number, plaques in arteries get smaller and they stabilize, which lowers the risk for heart attacks and stroke,"" says Dr. Cannon. But how far below 70 mg/dL should you go? Clinical trials have shown and European guidelines recommend that people with cardiovascular disease at the highest risk should aim for LDL levels below 55 mg/dL. Dr. Cannon notes that the U.S. guidelines have not been updated since 2018, and believes they will eventually follow Europe's lead and make 55 mg/dL the new target for high-risk individuals. What about people who are not at high risk? In most people in this group, LDL levels between 100 and 130 mg/dL may be acceptable. ""However, we still generally aim for LDL levels below 100, since benefits have been seen in trials that look at ways to prevent cardiovascular disease,"" says Dr. Cannon. ""Ultimately, your doctor can suggest the ideal target LDL based on your cardiac risk factors and history."" Lifestyle and medications The first step to lowering high LDL levels is making dietary changes — cutting down on saturated fat by adopting a heart-healthy diet like the Mediterranean, DASH, or other similar plant-based diets — losing weight, and increasing exercise. But often medication is needed to help drive down very high LDL levels and keep them low. This usually begins with a type of drug called a statin. Statins work to lower LDL by blocking an enzyme in the liver that helps make cholesterol. The drugs also have anti-inflammatory properties, and inflammation is a known contributor to plaque buildup. Another benefit: statins help prevent plaques from breaking open and releasing chemicals that stimulate blood clot formation, which leads to heart artery blockage and a heart attack. Depending on your LDL level, your doctor will recommend the best statin and dosage for your situation. The downside to statins is the possible side effects. The most common are achy muscles. If this happens to you, your doctor can temporarily lower the dose or switch to a different statin. While statins are the first-line drug choice, three other classes of medications also can help reduce LDL — ezetimibe (Zetia), bempedoic acid (Nexletol), and PCSK9 inhibitors (Repatha, Praluent, or Leqvio). ""Any of the three can be added to or substituted for statin therapy if people have not reached their LDL goal, or if they cannot tolerate statin side effects,"" says Dr. Cannon. Ezetimibe blocks cholesterol absorption in the intestine. Bempedoic acid and PCSK9 inhibitors work on liver cell receptors to increase the uptake and destruction of LDL cholesterol, thereby lowering LDL blood levels. Can your LDL be too low? Not really, says Dr. Cannon. ""Driving down LDL to really low levels might increase the risk of medication side effects, but there are no problems directly related to very low LDL levels.""

Aim for at least an hour of exercise per week,1,"Regular exercise promotes better sleep quality and reduces the risk for insomnia. But how much exercise does it take to get sleep benefits? A study published online March 26, 2024, by BMJ Open suggests an answer. Researchers evaluated the sleep questionnaire responses of about 4,400 people (ages 39 to 67) in Europe. Participants reported on their overall health and various aspects of their physical activity and sleep habits (including how long they usually slept each night and any insomnia symptoms they had, such as difficulty falling asleep, nighttime awakenings, or daytime sleepiness). Answers were collected at two points in time, 10 years apart. People who said that they exercised at least twice a week (for a total of at least an hour a week) for the entire 10 years were much less likely to report sleeping difficulties compared with people who reported that they were either inactive or less active during the study period. The study is observational and can't prove conclusively that exercising an hour or more per week will improve sleep. But we know that any amount of exercise is beneficial for health. This study provides an additional incentive to get more active. Image: © kali9/Getty Images",5,0.32960567,0.02998297,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/more-evidence-that-ultra-processed-foods-harm-health,More evidence that ultra-processed foods harm health,1,"Need more reasons to stop eating ultra-processed food? How about 32 of them? That's the number of health problems noted in the largest-ever review of studies about the dangers of diets high in ultra-processed foods. The findings, published online Feb. 28, 2024, by The BMJ, come from a review of 45 analyses published in the last three years, involving about 10 million people in total. When scientists graded the evidence, they found the most convincing or highly suggestive evidence linked diets rich in ultra-processed foods with increased risks for premature death, cardiovascular disease, mental health disorders, diabetes, obesity, and sleep problems. Associations between ultra-processed foods and asthma, gastrointestinal disease, some cancers, and other health issues were limited, the authors say, and need further investigation. What, exactly, are ultra-processed foods? They're ready-to-eat products such as deli meat, microwaveable dinners, or chips. They typically have long ingredients lists, with lots of additives such as preservatives, oil, sugar, salt, coloring, and flavoring. You'll do yourself a favor if you can cut them out of your diet as much as possible and replace them with less-processed options or (best of all) whole foods.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/is-niacin-safe-for-the-heart,Is niacin safe for the heart?,1,"Q. I've been taking a product called Niagen (nicotinamide riboside) as an anti-aging supplement. But I recently read that niacin may increase the risk of heart disease. Could that be a concern with Niagen as well? A. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is a water-soluble vitamin that helps your body convert food into energy. Niacin is the generic name for nicotinic acid and nicotinamide (also called niacinamide) and related derivatives such as nicotinamide riboside, the product you take. Niacin occurs naturally in many foods, including poultry, nuts, beans, and grains. It's also found in multivitamin supplements, B complex supplements, and supplements containing only niacin. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are the two main forms found in supplements. High-dose nicotinic acid is also available as a prescription medication for improving blood lipid levels. Niacin can lower triglycerides and raise high-density lipoprotein levels, usually requiring 1,500 to 2,000 milligrams (mg) a day to achieve this. However, prescription niacin has not been shown to lower the risk of death, heart attack, or stroke. A large study of more than 25,000 patients tested niacin in combination with cholesterol-lowering statin drugs found little additional benefit when compared with statins alone. What's more, high-dose niacin was associated with many worrisome side effects, including a higher risk of new-onset diabetes, worsening control of diabetes in those already had it, and a higher risk of serious gastrointestinal symptoms requiring hospitalization. As a result, in 2016, the FDA withdrew its approval of niacin for use in combination with statins or other lipid-lowering agents. Since then, niacin use in people with heart disease has fallen. The recent news about niacin you're referring to comes from a study of about 1,100 people with heart disease who were followed for three years. Researchers found that higher blood levels of two breakdown products of excess niacin were linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. However, they had no information about the participant's dietary niacin intake, and because this wasn't a clinical trial, the results cannot prove that niacin is to blame for this observation. In addition, we know that the amount of niacin found in multivitamins is not harmful. According to the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, the daily upper limit (the largest daily intake of a nutrient considered safe for most people) for niacin from dietary supplements is 35 mg for adults. Nicotinamide has fewer side effects than nicotinic acid. But at high doses — 500 mg per day or more — nicotinamide can cause diarrhea and easy bruising and can increase bleeding from wounds. So that's something to keep in mind when taking nicotinamide supplements. Also, based on the scientific evidence to date, this supplement appears to have little benefit for people.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/interval-training-a-shorter-more-enjoyable-workout,"Interval training: A shorter, more enjoyable workout?",1,"As one of the most popular exercise trends for more than a decade, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) clearly provides some perks. These workouts aren't just a time-efficient way to boost your fitness. Research shows that HIIT can improve key measures of cardiovascular health for all sorts of people, including those recovering from heart attacks or heart surgery. Another advantage: high-intensity effort, even for just brief bursts, may trigger the release of mood-boosting brain chemicals. As its name implies, HIIT features high-intensity (vigorous) activity done in intervals (short time periods) with brief periods of either rest or lower-intensity activity in between. During the bursts of vigorous exercise, your heart rate rises higher, and then it remains higher than it would normally be in between those high-intensity bouts. Compared to 20 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, a 20-minute HIIT session will burn more calories, strengthen your heart more, and help your body use oxygen more efficiently. ""If your goal is to improve your fitness, doing moderate-intensity exercise certainly works. But HIIT workouts may raise your fitness level faster in a shorter period of time,"" says Dr. Sawalla Guseh, director of the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. As he points out, if you do mostly vigorous exercise, you can meet the federal exercise guidelines in just 75 minutes per week, where-as doing mostly moderate exercise takes twice as long (150 minutes per week). Happier with HIIT? If long sessions of vigorous exercise feel too challenging, adding some HIIT workouts to your exercise regimen can be a happy medium. Even short stints of high-intensity exercise appear to trigger the release of endorphins — the brain's ""feel good"" chemicals. ""In our clinic, we certainly see patients who say that HIIT workouts bring them the most joy,"" Dr. Guseh says. In addition, endorphins can counteract pain, which may mitigate some of the discomfort that can occur during HIIT workouts, so people perceive them as more pleasant than expected. Still, the most important thing is to find a form of exercise that you enjoy and can do consistently over the long haul, Dr. Guseh says. Steady, moderate-intensity exercise is also a great way to keep your cardiovascular system healthy. Getting started with HIIT If you have heart disease or are at increased risk for it, be sure to check with your doctor before adding high-intensity effort to your routine. People at increased risk include those with two or more of the following: diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or a family history of heart disease. Reaching the right intensity Traditionally, HIIT features 30 to 90 seconds of high-intensity effort followed by an equal or longer period of lower-intensity activity or rest. High-intensity is often defined as reaching 85% of your maximum heart rate (see ""All about your heart rate"" in the June 2023 Heart Letter). A simpler option is to aim for an ""8"" on your personal perceived exertion scale (where 1 is very easy and 10 is as hard as you can possibly go). When you're first starting out, alternate a few short intervals of high-intensity exercise with longer periods of moderate or easy exercise. Say you usually walk for 30 minutes at a stretch. Start by walking for five minutes. Then walk as fast as you can, or jog, for one minute. Go back to your usual pace, or even a bit slower, for three minutes. Repeat the fast walking–slower walking cycle five more times. Once you become more fit (or if you are in fairly good shape), you can spend more time walking faster or jogging and less time ambling or resting. You can turn any cardio workout — cycling, swimming, elliptical, stationary bike, treadmill, stair climber, rowing machine, and even dancing — into an interval session. The easiest way is to simply speed up and slow down. Outdoors, add hills to a running or cycling route to create greater intensity. Indoors, you might add some stair climbing or jumping. For variety, try other HIIT variations (see ""Internationally inspired interval training""). Harvard Health Publishing's report Interval Trainingfeatures five sample workouts, including warmups and stretches. Internationally inspired interval training Try one of these HIIT variations to add fun and challenge to your workout. Fartlek. Swedish for ""speed play,"" fartlek is a more relaxed, fun way of doing intervals. You don't have to worry about distance, time, or heart rate. Instead, you push yourself as long as you can based on how you're feeling or until you reach a target like a tree, light pole, house, or someone ahead of you. Then you recover for as long you need. Your intervals don't have to be identical. When you feel ready, pick another target and go. While the intervals are informal, they can still be challenging. Tabata. Named after the Japanese researcher who created it, Tabata workouts feature 20-second work intervals and 10-second recovery intervals that are done eight times in a four-minute series. Try it with any type of aerobic exercise, like walking, running, or cycling. Tabata classes often include multiple rounds of different exercises, such as jumping jacks, knee pulls, or mountain climbers, designed to work all the major muscle groups. Instructors combine different variations of the four-minute series to create workouts that last a half-hour to an hour. Image: © Creative Credit/Getty Images",5,0.31095406,1.6391277e-06,False

Former CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield made this admission during a July 12 hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. The committee's hearing centered on government oversight of taxpayer-funded high-risk virus research. ""I do think one of the greatest mistakes that was made, of course, was mandating these vaccines,"" he told senators. ""They should have never been mandated. It should have been open to personal choice."" Redfield, who led the CDC from 2018 to 2021, also admitted that the spike protein produced by mRNA vaccines is ""toxic to the body"" and triggers ""a very strong pro-inflammatory response."" According to the former Trump administration official, he doesn't administer mRNA vaccines in his clinical practice – preferring ""killed protein vaccines"" instead. He also declared biosecurity as America's ""greatest national security threat."" Moreover, Redfield called for a pause on gain-of-function research. (Related: COVID jabs induce 723x more brain clots than flu shots, shocking study finds. ) ""I'm not aware of any advanced therapeutic or vaccine that has come to pass because of gain-of-function research. I do think there has to be a very aggressive debate of whether there's any benefit from that research,"" he remarked.

The Defender noted in a July 12 piece about the former CDC head's testimony: ""Redfield's statements stand in stark contrast to the CDC's official stance during his tenure, which strongly promoted mRNA vaccine uptake as safe and effective. The late admission of vaccine injuries underscores the failure of public health agencies and the medical establishment to provide informed consent to the billions of vaccine recipients worldwide."" Redfield calls on FDA to release all safety data it has During the same hearing, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) pressed Redfield on the issue of health agencies suppressing data about the COVID-19 vaccines . He highlighted concerning data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System that showed over 37,000 deaths reported after COVID-19 vaccination. Of this total, 24 percent of vaccine deaths occurred within two days of injection. In response, Redfield acknowledged that there was ""no appropriate transparency from the beginning about the potential side effects of these vaccines."" He criticized attempts to ""under-report any side effects because they argued that would make the public less likely to get vaccinated."" The former official also expressed disappointment toward the Food and Drug Administration 's (FDA) handling of vaccine safety information. ""The FDA should release all of the safety data they have. I was very disappointed to hear that they were planning to hold on to that until 2026. That really creates a sense of total lack of trust in our public health agencies toward vaccination,"" said Redfield. Johnson displayed a chart comparing adverse event reports for various drugs, including ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, to those for COVID-19 vaccines. The stark contrast in reported deaths from these therapeutics – with COVID-19 vaccines showing significantly higher numbers – fueled Johnson's demand for more transparency. ""As important as the cover-up of the origin story is, there's a lot more that’s being covered up,"" Johnson asserted. ""The public has a right to know. We pay for these agencies.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/salmonella-is-sneaky-watch-out-202405293044,Salmonella is sneaky: Watch out,1,"Pop quiz: what is Salmonella? If you've ever had a run-in with this bacteria, you know it can cause a food-borne illness called salmonellosis, a form of food poisoning. But you may not know that Salmonella bacteria sicken an estimated 1.35 million people and hospitalize 26,500 every year in the United States. What's more, it kills more total people than any other type of food poisoning. And Salmonella bacteria can be sneaky — not only by triggering unusual complications, but infecting people in startling ways, says Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital. One patient she treated showed up with an abdominal aortic aneurysm — a dangerous bulge in the lower section of the body's largest artery — that looked infected. Testing revealed a culprit some would find surprising: Salmonella. ""It's just an interesting organism and it can be kind of scary,"" she says. How do people get infected by Salmonella? Many of the foods Salmonella bacteria lurk in are raw or undercooked. Breaded raw chicken products like nuggets and chicken Kiev are one way it may reach your table. But a variety of foods have been implicated — including organic basil, cantaloupes, ground beef, nut butters, raw cookie dough, eggs, raw or unpasteurized milk, and flour. Even small pets such as turtles and frogs, along with dog food, have contributed to Salmonella outbreaks in recent years. You can also become infected by handling contaminated food and spreading the bacteria from your hands to your mouth. Additionally, you can spread it to others on your hands or even on your clothes without becoming sick yourself. ""It's a bug that's carried in stool and animal feces and is also present in the environment,"" Dr. Hohmann says. ""So it can set up shop in lots of different inanimate objects, soils, and machinery, especially in moist environments."" What symptoms can Salmonella cause? Most of the time, Salmonella infection leads to gastroenteritis, usually causing just an upset stomach, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. These symptoms can start as soon as six hours after ingesting the bacteria. Typically, symptoms resolve on their own within two to three days. Some people have such mild symptoms they're barely noticeable. ""The classic case might be a college student who eats a burrito from a sketchy place, gets sick for a couple of days, gets better, and doesn't think anything of it,"" says Dr. Hohmann. Sometimes symptoms are more serious, such as severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea, or unexplained high fever and marked fatigue. These symptoms require a call to your doctor. How is salmonellosis treated? Most people will get better on their own without any medicines. Replacing lost fluids by sipping water or electrolyte drinks to avoid dehydration will help. Call a doctor if you have diarrhea and a fever higher than 102° F diarrhea that doesn't improve after three days bloody stools vomiting so severe it prevents you from keeping liquids down. Treating the infection with medicine comes with an annoying paradox, Dr. Hohmann says. If doctors decide to prescribe antibiotics, the person taking the medicine may shed the organism for longer than if they were never treated. ""Then that person may have the opportunity — either through poor personal hygiene, sex, or working as a food worker — to spread it to others,"" she explains. ""It's challenging."" What complications can Salmonella lead to? Some people get sicker with salmonellosis than others, with seemingly no rhyme or reason. But certain folks are especially vulnerable to serious infection, including: adults 65 and older pregnant women children under 5 people whose immune systems are weakened by diseases (such as cancer) or treatments (such as immunosuppressing drugs). A small percentage of those infected can have Salmonella in their blood, which can spread the infection to other parts of the body such as the urinary tract, bones, joints, or central nervous system (brain and spinal fluid). And, like Dr. Hohmann's patient with the abdominal aortic aneurysm, on rare occasions Salmonella can lead to unusual blood vessel complications in people who already have atherosclerosis, blockage of the arteries caused by plaque buildup. ""It's not that common,"" she says. ""Many physicians are aware of it, so they take special care if Salmonella is found in a person with vascular disease."" What steps can you take to avoid Salmonella? While new USDA rules that take effect in 2025 may help fuel recalls of certain foods, we all can take steps to avoid the food poisoning, illness, and hospitalizations that Salmonella exposure can cause. Dr. Hohmann and the CDC suggest these strategies: Using hot water and soap, wash cutting boards or plates on which you cut into raw foods — including vegetables and fruit — before using those surfaces for other purposes. If possible, use separate cutting boards for produce, meat, and fish. Refrigerate or freeze foods that are perishable, prepared, or left over within two hours to thwart salmonella growth. Always wash hands well with soap and water before preparing food and after contact with animals, using the toilet, or changing diapers. If you have a sick pet, take extra care handling its feces and wash your hands thoroughly afterward. Take additional steps to help more vulnerable people stay healthy: Don't let young children touch high-risk animals, such as turtles, frogs, chickens, or ducks. ""And if you're taking young children to a petting zoo, they should not be petting animals unless you can disinfect their hands immediately afterward,"" she says. Older adults and those with compromised immune systems should take extra care to wash and cook foods thoroughly. People who have had a transplant (such as a kidney transplant) should not keep reptiles or amphibians as pets. ""You hate to make people paranoid, so that we're washing our lettuce leaves with soap, but it's worth thinking about these things, particularly if you have people in your household who are susceptible — which is an increasing number of people,"" Dr. Hohmann says.",1,-0.016616415,0.08536483,True

Kennedy Jr. has apologized after his son posted a video recording of a recent phone call with his Republican challenger, Donald Trump. During the call, Trump sought RFK Jr.’s endorsement and said that he shared the independent’s concerns about vaccinating children. (Article republished from RT.com ) An excerpt of the call, which took place on Sunday, was briefly posted to X on Tuesday by Bobby Kennedy III. It was deleted shortly afterwards. According to screenshots, the younger Kennedy posted the video as he felt “these sorts of conversations should be had in public.” In the video, Trump told the elder Kennedy that “clearly something’s wrong” with the US’ childhood vaccination program. “I said I want to do small doses,” Trump told Kennedy Jr. Children are given a “vaccination that’s like 38 different vaccines, and it looks like it’s meant for a horse, not a ten-pound or twenty-pound baby. And then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change…and then you hear that doesn’t have an impact,” he complained. “You and I talked about that a long time ago,” Trump added.

I am mortified that this was posted. I apologize to the president.” Kennedy Jr. did not speak during the section of the call posted online. After laying out his views on vaccines, Trump appeared to ask for the independent candidate’s endorsement, telling him “it would be so good for you.” Trump met with Kennedy Jr. the day after the phone call to discuss his possibly suspending his bid for the White House and joining the Republican’s campaign, Politico reported on Monday. The Kennedy campaign acknowledged that the meeting took place but said that the two discussed “national unity,” and that Kennedy Jr. would remain in the race. Recent polls show Kennedy Jr. winning around 10% of the national vote in a hypothetical race that includes the Green Party’s Jill Stein and the Justice for All Party’s Cornel West. These same polls show Trump leading President Joe Biden by between one and six points. Read more at: RT.com",6,-0.4064993,-0.09498914,False

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/prebiotics-understanding-their-role-in-gut-health,Prebiotics: Understanding their role in gut health,1,"Our gastrointestinal tracts contain about 100 trillion microorganisms, mainly bacteria. These organisms are collectively known as the gut microbiome. The vast majority of bacteria in our microbiome are good. Good bacteria's primary role is to counterbalance the bad kind to keep your gut healthy. They offer other health benefits as well. But sometimes the balance between good and bad bacteria gets disturbed. That's where probiotics come in. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts. They replenish your gut with more good bacteria to restore the balance between good and bad bacteria. Lesser known, but also important to maintaining a balanced microbiome, are prebiotics. What are prebiotics? Prebiotics are ingredients in certain foods that your intestines can't fully digest. Examples of prebiotics include some starches, oligosaccharides, inulin, and pectin. They tend to be most plentiful in high-fiber foods. Prebiotics work in tandem with probiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms that maintain or improve the balance of good to bad bacteria in your digestive system. Some examples of foods that contain probiotcs are yogurt, kimchi, many cheeses, pickles, kombucha, and sauerkraut. Prebiotics, on the other hand, act as nutrition for gut bacteria, helping them to flourish. When bacteria are fed what they need to stay healthy, they keep our bodies healthy in return. Potential health benefits of prebiotics Prebiotic foods can improve your gut microbiome and enhance your health. Experts are still learning more about the benefits of prebiotics. But research has found a link between higher prebiotic intake and improved intestinal absorption of dietary calcium better blood sugar control a well-functioning immune system a reduce risk of colorectal cancer. The role of prebiotics may extend beyond being a food source within your microbiome, too. One recent study showed that people who consumed 30 grams daily for two weeks of foods high in a plant-based prebiotic called inulin were more likely to select medium- to low-calorie foods over high-calorie ones. Furthermore, their MRIs showed less activation in their brain's reward network when shown high-calorie foods. The study suggests that eating prebiotic foods might help people make healthier dietary choices. Prebiotic foods to add to your diet Prebiotics are found in a variety of high-fiber grains, vegetables, and fruits. Some of the best prebiotic foods include: garlic onions bananas Jerusalem artichokes soybeans asparagus wheat and whole-grain products such as cereals and breads. Eating more prebiotic food is not a good idea for everyone. For example, some people with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may find a diet heavy in prebiotics worsens their symptoms. On the other hand, people who struggle with constipation may find improved bowel function with prebiotics. Finding the right balance of prebiotic food that works for you is key. Starting slowly and gradually increasing prebiotic foods can help avoid possible digestive discomfort.",1,0.26888132,-0.035478577,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-17-mandating-covid-shots-one-of-greatest-mistakes.html,"Mandating COVID shots ‘one of the greatest mistakes,’ former CDC chief says",0,"Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield confirmed the dangers of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in a U.S. Senate hearing Thursday, calling them “ toxic ” and saying they should never have been mandated. (Article by John-Michael Dumais repulished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org ) Redfield’s admissions came during a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on government oversight of taxpayer-funded high-risk virus research. The late admission of vaccine injuries underscores the failure of public health agencies and the medical establishment to provide informed consent to the billions of vaccine recipients worldwide. “It’s important that he is telling the truth now,” vaccine researcher Jessica Rose, Ph.D. , told The Defender . “Adverse events were hidden and still are being hidden to prevent injection hesitancy.” Redfield, who led the CDC from 2018 to 2021, didn’t stop there. He declared biosecurity “our nation’s greatest national security threat,” calling for a halt to gain-of-function research pending further debate. The hearing, which featured contentious exchanges between senators and witnesses, also touched on controversial topics such as the COVID-19 origins lab-leak theory and allegations that health agencies suppressed data. mRNA vax ‘should have been open to personal choice’ During the hearing Redfield, who oversaw the CDC during the crucial early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, elaborated on his recent statements about mRNA vaccine safety. “I do think one of the greatest mistakes that was made, of course, was mandating these vaccines ,” Redfield said. “They should have never been mandated. It should have been open to personal choice.” Redfield went further, admitting that the spike protein produced by mRNA vaccines is “toxic to the body” and triggers “a very strong pro-inflammatory response.” He noted that in his own medical practice, he doesn’t administer mRNA vaccines, preferring “ killed protein vaccines ” instead. Redfield’s statements stand in stark contrast to the CDC’s official stance during his tenure, which strongly promoted mRNA vaccine uptake as safe and effective. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) pressed Redfield on the issue, highlighting concerning data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ). Johnson presented figures showing over 37,000 deaths reported following COVID-19 vaccination , with 24% occurring within two days of injection. Redfield acknowledged there was “not appropriate transparency from the beginning about the potential side effects of these vaccines .” He criticized attempts to “underreport any side effects because they argued that would make the public less likely to get vaccinated.” I truly appreciated Dr. Redfield’s honesty at the hearing today. pic.twitter.com/X06znrxe12 — Senator Ron Johnson (@SenRonJohnson) July 12, 2024 ‘FDA should release all of the safety data’ Redfield’s criticism of data withholding extended beyond vaccine side effects. He expressed disappointment in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ‘s (FDA) handling of vaccine safety information. “The FDA should release all of the safety data they have,” Redfield said. “I was very disappointed to hear that they were planning to hold on to that until 2026. That really creates a sense of total lack of trust in our public health agencies towards vaccination.” Johnson echoed these concerns, revealing his frustration with the lack of follow-through by health agencies and the committee itself. “I’m not getting cooperation out of the chairman of the permanent subcommittee investigation to issue subpoenas to get this,” Johnson said, referring to unreleased data and documents. The senator displayed a chart comparing adverse event reports for various drugs, including ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine , to those for COVID-19 vaccines. The stark contrast in reported deaths from these therapeutics — with COVID-19 vaccines showing significantly higher numbers — fueled Johnson’s demand for more transparency. “As important as the cover-up of the origin story is, there’s a lot more that’s being covered up,” Johnson asserted. “The public has a right to know. We pay for these agencies. We pay their salaries. We fund these studies.” Redfield agreed with Johnson’s assessment, stating that withholding the information is “counterproductive.” Redfield doubtful of ‘any benefit from [gain-of-function] research’ Redfield’s testimony took another controversial turn when he called for a pause on gain-of-function research, experiments that involve making pathogens more infectious or deadly. “I’m not aware of any advanced therapeutic or vaccine that has come to pass because of gain-of-function research,” Redfield said. “I do think there has to be a very aggressive debate of whether there’s any benefit from that research.” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) seized on this point, introducing his Risky Research Review Act . The bill aims to establish an independent board within the executive branch to oversee federal funding for high-risk life sciences research. “If the Risky Research Review Act had been in place, it might have prevented the COVID-19 pandemic,” Paul said, citing Redfield’s endorsement. MIT’s Kevin Esvelt, Ph.D. , inventor of a technique for rapidly evolving proteins and other biomolecules who was also instrumental in developing CRISPR gene-editing technology, reinforced these concerns. Highlighting gaps in current oversight, he described an experiment where his team — with FBI approval — successfully ordered DNA fragments of the 1918 influenza virus from 36 of 38 providers. “Everything that we did and the companies did was entirely legal,” Esvelt said, underscoring the potential for misuse. “There are no laws regulating DNA synthesis, even though the industry group, the International Gene Synthesis Consortium , has requested congressional regulation.” The hearing revealed a growing consensus among witnesses for stricter oversight of potentially dangerous research, with Redfield suggesting such studies should be “highly regulated” to protect national security. Redfield reaffirms COVID lab-leak theory The hearing reignited debate over the origins of COVID-19, with Redfield reaffirming his belief in the lab-leak theory . “Based on my initial analysis, I believe then, and I still believe today, that the COVID infections were the direct result of a biomedical research experiment and subsequent lab leak,” Redfield stated. This assertion led to a heated exchange between Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Carrie Wolinetz, Ph.D. , former chief of staff to then-director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Francis Collins . Hawley accused NIH officials of deliberately suppressing the lab-leak theory. “Your office, Dr. [Anthony] Fauci and others tried to actively censor them,” Hawley said. “There was a propaganda effort that this paper was the center of, and now everybody says, ‘Oh, well, we just weren’t sure at the time.’” Hawley referred to the 2020 “ Proximal Origin ” paper that argued against the lab-leak hypothesis. Wolinetz defended the NIH’s actions. “I do not believe censorship took place, sir.” She maintained that discussions about the virus’s origins were part of normal scientific discourse. Redfield, however, criticized the lack of thorough investigation into both natural origin and lab-leak hypotheses. “Unfortunately, this didn’t happen,” he said, adding that four years later, he believes there’s no meaningful evidence supporting a natural origin. The former CDC director also revealed that he did not learn about concerning biodistribution studies of the vaccine’s lipid nanoparticles until as late as the summer of 2021, suggesting a delay in critical information reaching top health officials. ‘Biosecurity is our nation’s greatest national security threat’ Redfield emphasized the critical importance of biosecurity in national defense. “In 2024, 2025, biosecurity is our nation’s greatest national security threat,” Redfield stated. “You need to think of it the same way we thought about the verge of nuclear atomic [sic] in the late 40s, 50s, and 60s.” He called for a proportional response to the threat, suggesting the creation of a dedicated agency within the U.S. Department of Energy to address biosecurity concerns. “We have a $900 billion Defense Department for the threat of China, North Korea and Russia,” Redfield noted. “We don’t have really any systematic agency or network of private sector contractors to help us with the biosecurity threat.” Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) echoed this sentiment. “In my humble mind, a viral biosecurity issue is a bigger issue than China’s military threat to us.” Gerald Parker, DVM, Ph.D. , associate dean for Global One Health at Texas A&M University, supported the call for enhanced oversight, recommending “an independent authority to consolidate secure functions in a single entity with a dedicated mission.” The hearing also touched on the potential for future pandemics, with Redfield repeating his warnings about the potential spread of H5N1 bird flu . As the hearing concluded, senators from both parties expressed concern over the lack of transparency and oversight in high-risk research. Paul summarized the sentiment: “We cannot stand idly by. We must demand accountability, strive for transparency and ensure the safety of our citizens is never again compromised by negligence or deceit.” Watch the July 11 hearing: ‘Risky Research’: Read more at: ChildrensHealthDefense.org",6,-0.52389497,0.17381547,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/what-is-the-carnivore-diet,What is the carnivore diet?,1,"Question: What is the carnivore diet, and is it safe? Answer: The carnivore diet meal plan only allows consumption of meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, fish, some dairy products, and water. You need to exclude all vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, seeds, and nuts. That's why it is sometimes referred to as the ""zero carb"" diet. The carnivore diet is a type of ""keto,"" or ketogenic, diet. Keto diets work like this: The contents of a keto diet do not provide enough calories from glucose and other forms of sugar. To compensate, the body burns fat that creates ketones as an energy source. Ketones are released into the bloodstream, which lowers the normal acid-base balance in blood to make it more acidic, a state known as ketosis. A typical keto diet plan suggests approximately 70% to 75% of daily calories come from fat, 20% from protein, and no more than 10% from carbohydrates. A carnivore diet is the most ketogenic diet because it allows for almost no carbs. Fat content is not specified; it's whatever fat is contained in or consumed along with the meat, fish, poultry, and dairy. What are the risks of a carnivore diet? While some keto diets can emphasize the intake of healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, that's not the case with carnivore diets. Animal fat is mostly saturated fat, which is the unhealthiest type of fat because it raises levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol. The disadvantage of all keto diets is they tend to raise LDL cholesterol levels in both the short and long term. Other longer-term concerns about keto diets, especially the carnivore diet, include the increased risk of kidney stones, gout, and osteoporosis. Also, the very high protein intake associated with the carnivore diet can lead to impaired kidney function. Because keto diets induce the body to burn fat, all keto diets can jump-start a weight-loss program. But I would never recommend a carnivore diet for this purpose.",3,0.30751774,-0.017132625,False

An official brochure for the event, which will take place from October 2 to 4, says that it will focus on “a highly virulent strain"" of the virus that has the ability to infect humans. The H5N1 strain of bird flu has been getting increasing air time in the media lately, with some sources claiming it could have a death rate of between 25 and 50 percent. The CDC recently confirmed a fourth human case of the virus in the U.S. linked to a multistate outbreak involving dairy cows. However, all of the cases so far have involved people who work on dairy farms with infected cows. The person in the latest case only experienced eye symptoms and made a full recovery. However, while the CDC believes the current risk to the public is low, the summit seeks to capitalize on fears that this is the start of the next pandemic. The informational brochure notes: “With the emergence of a highly virulent strain of bird flu affecting both cattle and humans, it is imperative that we come together to discuss preparedness, response strategies, and the future implications of this evolving situation.” One of the “breakout sessions” planned will focus on the topic of “Mass Fatality Management Planning,” while another session, “Global Influenza Surveillance Networks & Delivery of Vaccine & Antiviral Medication” will discuss “vaccine optimization” and “equitable access,” among other subjects.

Another worrying topic they intend to address is “Surveillance and Data Management.” The organizers note in the description that the session on this subject will “Discuss strategies for enhancing surveillance systems, early warning mechanisms, and rapid response protocols,” which sounds a lot like the digital health passports that were used to keep unvaccinated people out of all manner of stores and venues during the COVID-19 pandemic. The conference’s website identifies several groups under the category of “who should attend,” including public health officials, epidemiologists, government representatives, policy makers, NGOs, and those in the pharmaceutical industry. Independent journalist Leo Hohmann believes this convention could be meant to influence people ahead of the election, noting: “The scare mongering is ratcheting up quickly, just as we approach the November presidential election. Whether this next pandemic will be timed for November or sometime in 2025, it’s not a good sign that the elites have scheduled this tabletop exercise.” Vaccine programs already underway for bird flu Finland has already started to vaccinate vulnerable populations, such as farm workers, against bird flu from its stock of 10,000 two-dose vaccine series that it obtained in a deal between the EU and vaccine maker CSL Seqirus that will provide 15 nations with 40 million vaccines. The American government has given Moderna a $176 million contract to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine, completely ignoring the numerous failures of the mRNA vaccines they came up with for COVID-19. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that dozens of cows with bird flu have died or been slaughtered in Texas, South Carolina, Ohio, Colorado and Michigan, something that Forbes notes is “unusual” because cows are expensive to slaughter and 90 percent of them typically make a full recovery. The World Health Organization notes that bird flu does not “transmit easily from person-to-person” and that in the rare cases in which it has affected humans, the individuals involved had close contact with infected poultry. Nevertheless, they note that human-to-human spread of bird flu has “pandemic potential.”",4,-0.41033888,0.16697095,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/sleeping-apart-good-for-your-sex-life,Sleeping apart: Good for your sex life?,1,"A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that one-third of respondents reported occasionally or regularly sleeping in separate rooms to accommodate a bed partner. This may seem like a sign of a troubled relationship, but the practice is quite common and can lead to couples being happier and closer, according to Sharon Bober, associate professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and founding director of the Sexual Health Program at Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""Just because you don't always sleep in the same bed doesn't mean that you feel separated as a couple,"" she says. Contributing issues The main motivation behind separate sleeping is not about lack of physical desire or emotional intimacy, but simply the need for both people to get a good night's rest. ""Sharing a bed means you share the other person's sleep behavior,"" says Bober. ""If a person snores, grinds their teeth, thrashes and twitches, or gets up repeatedly at night, this can disrupt their partner's sleep, making partners more tired and irritable, which can strain the relationship."" Other issues that could contribute to sleeping apart include environmental factors (one partner needs the bedroom to be cooler or warmer) and sleeping schedules (one might like to stay up later reading or watching TV, or might need to get up early). ""Getting restful sleep is essential for good health and a good sex life,"" says Bober. ""Sometimes sleeping in separate rooms, both people can sleep better and feel rested. Instead of resulting in something negative, this might allow for both partners to have more energy, better mood, and consequently more desire for sex."" Pillow talk Sometimes just one person expresses the desire to sleep separately, which can make their partner feel rejected and worry about their relationship. ""If either partner feels concerned about not sleeping in the same bed, the couple needs to talk about what might feel worrisome,"" says Bober. ""The conversation might reveal an issue not related to intimacy that has been lingering for a while."" Before sleeping apart, another option may be to consider compromises that address the issues of disrupted sleep and are acceptable to both people. For example, if your partner's snoring wakes you up, wear earplugs, use a bedside sound machine, or wear earbuds and listen to a podcast as you fall asleep. The snoring partner could try sleeping on their side or see a doctor to find out whether there's an underlying health problem, like sleep apnea. Even when a couple agrees to a new sleeping arrangement, Bober suggests several strategies to enhance and maintain connection while also making the transition smoother for both partners: Set a schedule. At first, agree to sleep apart during the week or on specific days when partners need the most rest, but choose to sleep together on the weekends and make adjustments as needed. Make both sleeping spaces cozy. ""You both need a comfortable sleeping environment,"" says Bober. ""Make sure both people are happy with their sleeping space."" Have a snuggle time. Before bedtime, spend time together in bed to snuggle, talk, read together, or have some romantic time; then, when it's time for sleep, move to your separate beds. You can also do the reverse: get in bed together in the morning and connect with coffee and conversation. ""This kind of flexibility can help couples continue to associate the bed with closeness, pleasure, and intimacy,"" says Bober. Make a date for sex. Not sleeping together can interfere with spontaneous sex. If you and your partner are concerned about a declining sex life, schedule time for intimacy. ""This can create a sense of excitement and allow for anticipation,"" says Bober. To enhance the experience, tie your get-together to a date night or a romantic evening at home. Nap together. Another idea is napping together during the day. ""Even a short nap together can help maintain the bedroom bonding and is something couples can do either on occasion or more regularly,"" says Bober. Assess the arrangement regularly. Check in with each other every day to see what's working and what isn't. It's not good enough if sleeping separately feels helpful only for one person in the relationship. You can always go back to the drawing board and come up with a revised plan. Sleeping apart, either once in a while or more regularly, can be beneficial, if both partners are happy with the setup, sleep well, and continue to feel connected as a couple.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/10-habits-for-good-health,10 habits for good health,1,"The foundation of a healthy lifestyle consists of lasting habits like eating right, watching your weight, exercising regularly, managing your mental health, and getting routine medical exams. But even daily, small steps toward these goals also can have a significant impact. Here are some practices that can help support your ongoing health journey. While you might find it unrealistic to follow them all the time, try to include them in your daily life as much as possible. 1. Do a morning stretch Stretching before getting out of bed wakes up the body, improves circulation, and promotes relaxation, helping to set the day's tone. While you're still lying in bed, move the covers aside, then flex and release your lower limbs several times. Bend your knees and lift your legs into the air. With your legs still elevated, flex your feet up and down and rotate them side to side. Next, sit up and slowly look left and then right. Roll your shoulders several times. Flex your wrists up and down, and open and close your hands repeatedly. 2. Stay hydrated Proper hydration supports digestion, improves brain performance, and increases energy, among other health benefits. Drink a big glass of water after you wake up and a glass with every meal. 3. Floss Maintaining good oral health includes daily flossing, but make sure you do it right. First, wrap the floss around your middle fingers, which helps you reach the back teeth. Then loop the floss around one side of a tooth, so it makes a C shape. Beginning at the gum line, slide it up and down the tooth several times. (Don't move the floss back and forth in a sawing motion. You miss cleaning the entire tooth, and the friction can irritate the gum.) Repeat on the other side of the tooth, and then the other teeth. 4. Apply sunscreen Sunscreen is the best defense against skin-damaging rays. After washing your face in the morning, apply a facial moisturizer that contains sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Or blend equal parts sunscreen and a regular moisturizer. Use one or two nickel-sized dollops to cover your entire face, neck, ears, and any bald or thinning spots on your head. 5. Go nuts When you crave a snack, reach for unsalted nuts and seeds like almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and cashews. They contain many beneficial nutrients and help prevent cravings for highly processed foods. Nuts are high in calories, so keep to a palm-sized portion. 6. Nap Afternoon naps can recharge a weary body and may boost cognitive function. A study published online on Jan. 25, 2021, by General Psychiatry found that nappers scored higher on cognitive tests than non-nappers. The researchers found that shorter and less frequent naps — lasting less than 30 minutes, no more than four times a week — were associated with the most benefit. Schedule naps for the early afternoon, and use a timer so you don't oversleep. 7. Bust some moves Break up bouts of sitting with small bursts of movement. For example, dance across a room instead of walking. When you brush your teeth, suck in your lower gut for 30 seconds, which activates your abdominal muscles. Do 10 air squats or push-ups (on the ground or against the kitchen counter). Make it a habit to stand up ""twice"" each time you stand up — that is, get up, sit back down, and then get back up. 8. Take a breather Alternate-nostril breathing, in which you breathe through one nostril at a time, is believed to help reduce stress by slowing your breathing rhythm and forcing you to take deep, full breaths. Using a finger or thumb, close one nostril and slowly breathe in and out through the open nostril. After about five to 10 breaths, switch and close the other nostril and repeat the breathing pattern. For a variation, try inhaling through one nostril with the other closed, changing finger/thumb positions, and exhaling through the previously closed nostril. Then, inhale through that one, close it, and exhale through the other nostril. Go back and forth like this for a few minutes. 9. Enjoy a hobby A study published online Sept. 11, 2023, by Nature Medicine suggests that having a hobby is good for people's overall health and mood. Hobbies involve creativity, sensory engagement, self-expression, relaxation, and cognitive stimulation. One way to pick up a new hobby is with a project kit designed to teach you a skill like gardening, building a model, carving wood, or making beer, soap, hot sauce, or jewelry. The kits come with instructions and all the materials you need to start. You can find kits at local bookstores or hobby stores, or go online: just type ""how-to kits"" or ""project kits"" into a search engine. 10. Be social Social interactions can stave off loneliness and protect against depression and cognitive decline. Strive to have some kind of social engagement every day: make a phone call, send an email, or chat with a neighbor. Another option is to create your own social pod — a small, intimate group that you interact with regularly, like meeting for coffee or conversing over a Zoom call. Casual conversations are also helpful; for example, chat with a grocery store employee or interact with a stranger on the street. Image: © andreswd/Getty Images",5,0.41526946,-0.09584566,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/keto-diet-is-not-healthy-and-may-harm-the-heart,Keto diet is not healthy and may harm the heart,1,"The ketogenic (keto) diet — which is high in fat and protein and low in carbohydrates — doesn't meet standards for a healthy diet and may not be safe for some people with heart disease, according to a review in the March 2024 issue of Current Problems in Cardiology. The review summarized the current evidence on how keto diets may raise heart disease risk. While the diet may dramatically reduce fat mass and weight over the short term, there is scarce evidence for any long-term benefit. Ketogenic diets appear to lower blood levels of triglycerides but raise levels of artery-clogging LDL cholesterol. With respect to lowering blood sugar and blood pressure, the observed short-term benefits fade over time. The diet's extreme carbohydrate restrictions may lead people to shun most vegetables and fruits and consume large amounts of leafy greens. But the vitamin K in these foods may interfere with the anti-clotting drug warfarin taken by some heart patients. And drugs known as SGLT-2 inhibitors, which are used to treat diabetes and heart failure, may be incompatible with a keto diet, according to the review.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-16-former-cdc-director-calls-out-fdas-vaccines.html,Former CDC Director calls out FDA’s under-reporting of COVID-19 vaccine side effects in congressional hearing,0,"In a dramatic testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Dr. Robert Redfield, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), issued serious accusations against the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding their non-reporting of adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccines. Redfield, who served as CDC director and Federal Coronavirus Task Force advisor under the Trump administration, asserted that the FDA had deliberately under-reported vaccine side effects in order to maintain a narrative of ""safety and efficacy."" The COVID-19 vaccine mandates, censorship and deception were NOT well-intentioned Dr. Robert Redfield emphasized that the government’s strategy, though potentially well-intentioned, undermined transparency and public trust in vaccination efforts. ""The mRNA shots never should have been mandated,"" Redfield asserted, highlighting what he described as a crucial misstep by the Biden administration. He argued for personal choice in vaccination, citing concerns over side effects and questioning the vaccines' efficacy in preventing infections. While Redfield’s admissions are a step in the right direction, there was nothing “well-intentioned” about the experimental COVID-19 vaccines, the suppression of early treatments or the unlawful medical mandates that manipulated a majority of the population to give up their common sense, their dignity and their livelihood -- and some even lost their lives. This entire period in world history was not about a “pandemic.” Everything about the stripping of people’s rights, the deception behind poisoning the world’s population and manipulating people into further participation with medical tyranny reeks of communism and spells out a plan for depopulation and erecting systems of surveillance and population control. Human knowledge is under attack! Governments and powerful corporations are using censorship to wipe out humanity's knowledge base about nutrition, herbs, self-reliance, natural immunity, food production, preparedness and much more.

Dr. Robert Redfield laments vaccine mandates (that he participated in) During the Senate hearing titled ""Risky Research: Oversight of U.S. Taxpayer Funded High-Risk Virus Research,"" was chaired by Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis). Senator Johnson expressed frustration over the FDA's handling of safety data, pointing out delays in releasing comprehensive information to the public. ""They're saying [vaccine side effects] are rare and they're mild,"" Johnson remarked at the hearing. Ron Johnson held congressional hearings throughout the launch of the COVID-19 vaccine and listened to victims and expert testimony regarding the devastation wrought by COVID-19 vaccines. However, Dr. Robert Redfield’s advice on vaccine safety is four years too late. He was part of a malicious government operation that kept Americans in the dark about an experiment that was designed to reprogram people at the cellular level and cause numerous health problems. The tiny shred of transparency that is taking place now is no substitute for accountability and the destructive decisions made by Pence, Redfield, Birx, Fauci et al. from the very beginning. Where was Dr. Robert Redfield’s voice when the public health dictatorship demanded that Americans lock down in their homes, quarantine into isolation, selectively close schools and small businesses? Where was Dr. Robert Redfield in the beginning of this medical tyranny, which sought to confine people and manipulate them into taking COVID-19 vaccines in order to get their freedoms back? Redfield stood unified with the Federal Coronavirus Task Force as they lied to the American public about the origins of COVID-19, the science of the innate immune system and the availability of early treatments. He had no voice when the “14 days to slow the spread” propaganda unleashed mass bio-terror and germaphobia that destroyed the social and moral fabric of society. Anyone who spoke out about unlawful vaccine mandates was maligned as spreading misinformation and causing “vaccine hesitancy.” These cult-like psychological manipulation tactics DIVIDED Americans in a hostile way – segregating, terminating employment and discriminating those who spoke the truth about the COVID-19 vaccines. With targets on their backs, the unvaccinated stood true, watching as their neighbors, families and friends succumbed to the false virtue of COVID-19 vaccination and the spiritually disabling grand acquiesce to unlawful mandates and false authorities. Now many of the vaccinated are struggling with blood clots, heart problems, chronic diseases, turbo cancers and other acute health issues that were directly caused by this heinous experiment. The hearing exposed the devastation caused by vaccine mandates , the lack of transparency in public health data and the failure of government agencies in managing public health crises, and will help push lawmakers one step closer to holding government officials accountable on these matters of importance.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/caregiving-crisis,Caregiving crisis,1,"If a traditional caregiving scenario were captured on time-lapse video, Katherine Lyman contends that early scenes would depict an adult daughter accompanying her aging parent to a doctor's appointment looking ""put together"" and on top of things. Just a few years later, however, the daughter would appear drastically different — ""really disheveled, because she isn't taking care of herself."" ""I cannot tell you how many times I've leaned forward, looked the daughter in the eyes, and asked, 'How are you coping with all of this? What are you doing to let off steam? It's great that you're keeping all these plates spinning, but it comes at a cost,'"" recounts Lyman, a geriatric nurse practitioner at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Increasingly, that cost is caregivers' own health and well-being. Indeed, the story of caregiving in the United States is becoming something of a cautionary tale as troubling forces collide. More caregivers are on tap than ever, with 43 million Americans providing unpaid assistance to a family member or another loved one. Nearly three-quarters are 50 or older themselves, while more than 75% are women, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance. Meanwhile, an estimated 73 million Americans will be 65 or older by 2030, potentially fueling the need for additional caregivers. Longevity is perhaps the biggest contributor to the brewing storm, Harvard experts say. ""A lot of us are living into our late years and living very well and independently, but not all of us,"" Lyman says. ""Those years may come with increased infirmity or cognitive impairment, or both."" Spectrum of responsibilities As people age, several core issues tend to prompt the need for spouses, adult children, or others to step in to help. Let's dub the problem areas the three M's: mobility, memory, and medications. Yet caregiving is far from a one-size-fits-all proposition, with duties falling on a spectrum from occasional to relentless and minor to suffocating. ""It runs the gamut from actually living with the person to living in a different state and putting cameras in different rooms to check on them,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, clinical chief of gerontology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""Some caregivers come periodically, fill pill boxes, take people to doctor's appointments, or take them shopping. But caregiving can also be financial: paying the bills, organizing the taxes, or taking over as power of attorney."" Whether they're popping in a few times a week or handling daily bathing, dressing, and toileting — or something in between — caregivers often wear many hats, Lyman notes. ""You become not just their caregiver, but their confidante, psychiatrist, chef, grocery shopper, laundress, chauffeur, and pharmacist,"" she says. Health fallout Such comprehensive responsibilities can exact an underappreciated physical and mental toll — especially if your loved one's deterioration is prolonged — and create a downward spiral that affects both caregiver and recipient. Six in 10 caregivers work part or full-time, spreading themselves even thinner. Copious research has focused on the mental health fallout. Between 40% and 70% of caregivers deal with significant symptoms of depression. And those who are women fare worse than men who take on such duties, reporting higher levels of depression and anxiety. Similarly, a wide range of studies point to caregiving's physical consequences, especially pain. Caregivers are prone to headaches and often suffer back injuries or cope with arthritis, Dr. Salamon says. A Sept. 1, 2023, study published by The Gerontologist that gathered data from nearly 2,000 caregivers (average age 62) showed just over half suffered pain of some kind. About 30% said their pain limited the ways they could provide care. Caregivers also face an increased risk of heart disease, and women caring for a spouse are more likely to report having high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance. ""Many caregivers in their 50s, 60s, and 70s have their own health issues,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""It gets more stressful as time goes on and the patient and caregiver both get older."" About 10% of caregivers acknowledge their own health has suffered as a result of their responsibilities. But that doesn't mean they're vigilantly attending to it. Nearly three-quarters reported not having gone to a doctor as often as they should, while more than half had missed medical appointments, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance. ""People start losing weight, not eating properly, and not paying attention to themselves,"" Lyman says. ""Their health takes a back seat, and so do their interests."" How to rally the troops Even in large families, the lion's share of caregiving responsibilities often falls to one sibling when Mom or Dad is declining. But family members should recognize that the caregiver isn't a hero—and shouldn't be expected to perform like one. ""I don't think a lot of family members realize how stressful caregiving is, and they don't offer to help,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, clinical chief of gerontology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""They leave it to the caregiver to ask them, and that's not right. They need to wholeheartedly offer."" To smooth that process—and the sometimes-fraught dynamic between caregiver and other relatives—Harvard experts offer these tips: Call a family meeting. This can be held in person or over Zoom, ideally including the patient's doctor or a geriatric care manager. The best result: everyone gets on the same page about day-to-day problems and caregiving responsibilities that require attention. Create a schedule. This might include setting up a shared online calendar for family members to sign up for tasks and time periods to chip in. Rotate care. ""Set up a schedule so every day 'belongs' to a different child,"" Dr. Salamon suggests. Match people's tasks to their abilities. If your sister is a finance whiz, she's probably the right one to handle Dad's taxes. Your brother is a lawyer? Ask him to sort out the legal nuances of Mom's property sale. Be specific. If you're the caregiver, you may want two hours to go to a social event or appointment. Say so. ""It's very important to make your requests concrete, tell others exactly what you need, and do it in spite of any guilt,"" Dr. Salamon says. Ask how you can help. If you're not the main caregiver, can you take over one evening each week or stay for a weekend? Or perhaps you can coordinate services such as housecleaning, yard work, or transportation to medical appointments. Be explicit about what you can provide. ""Say, 'I can take Mom to the hairdresser on Wednesday afternoon,' or, 'I'm coming on Wednesday for two hours—why don't you take some time off?'"" Dr. Salamon says. Finding help Even as they feel the strain, caregivers are often loath to seek support. ""They're good at giving help, but lousy at asking for it,"" Lyman says. Still, it's crucial to make that leap. Harvard experts offer these strategies for caregivers to preserve body and soul: Look into respite care. Some assisted living or nursing facilities provide temporary care so family members can take a vacation. Adult day programs can provide a daily break. ""Sometimes they only run from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., but that can be huge,"" Lyman says. ""And some provide transportation."" Call your local Agency on Aging. Some offer housekeeping services to eligible older adults, while others coordinate volunteers who can pinch-hit and ""stay for a few hours so the caregiver can get out and be free for a little while,"" Dr. Salamon says. Sniff out informal help. ""Ask friends who drive if they can pick Mom up and bring her to the senior center or to her hair appointment,"" Lyman suggests. Explore houses of worship. Local religious groups may have cadres of helpers. ""Some have volunteers who pick up people who want to go to their service and take them home afterward,"" Lyman says. Consider therapy. Nearly four in 10 caregivers describe their responsibilities as emotionally stressful. Talking to a therapist can bring relief. Tap into telehealth. Schedule virtual visits with doctors or therapists to get the care you need. ""You don't have to leave Mom unattended,"" Lyman says. ""You can go into the next room and shut the door for a half-hour or hour."" Image: © laflor/Getty Images",9,-0.06408262,-0.15174015,True

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-the-difference-between-age-spots-and-sun-spots,What's the difference between age spots and sun spots?,1,"Q. I have a couple of brown skin patches that look like age spots. But my friend says they might be sun spots, which can develop into skin cancer. How can I tell the difference? A. It's an important question, since distinguishing sun spots from age spots — or ""liver"" spots, as our grandmothers called them — can help us determine when to seek a doctor's evaluation. Both spots tend to appear on areas that get a lot of sun exposure, such as the face, hands, arms, and shoulders. The color of age spots ranges from pink to tan to brown. They're bigger than freckles and usually oval-shaped. They're often found in clusters. Age spots can be unsightly, but they are harmless. Sun spots, known medically as actinic keratoses, come in a variety of colors. The biggest difference between harmless age spots and sun spots (actinic keratoses) is the texture. Age spots are smooth and flat, but potentially dangerous actinic keratoses usually feel rough and scaly. Actinic keratoses can develop into skin cancer, so it's vital that you show any such spots to your doctor. And if you're in doubt about any type of skin changes, it's also wise to point those out.

But a small randomized trial published online Feb. 9, 2024, by JAMA Network Open found that tai chi was better at lowering blood pressure than aerobic activity (the kind that works your heart and lungs). Researchers divided about 340 people with elevated blood pressure — a precursor stage to high blood pressure — into two groups. One group practiced tai chi for an hour four times a week. The other group did an hour of aerobic exercise (stair climbing, jogging, brisk walking, or cycling) four times a week. After one year, systolic blood pressure (the top number in a measurement) had dropped by an average of seven points for people in the tai chi group, compared with about four points in the aerobics group. The researchers speculate that tai chi might have the edge because it triggers the body's relaxation response, which helps lower blood pressure. But don't give up aerobic exercise; it's still crucial for many aspects of health. Just think of tai chi as another helpful tool. Image: © Westend61/Getty Images",5,0.3191081,-0.010890946,False
https://www.infowars.com/posts/the-shape-of-things-to-come-2,The Shape of Things To Come,0,"We’re finally getting an idea of what Make America Healthy Again might actually look like. On Saturday, Donald Trump’s health czar Robert F. Kennedy revealed that a first-day priority of the new Trump administration would be to end municipal water fluoridation. “On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,” Kennedy Tweeted. “Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease. President ​@realDonaldTrump and First Lady @MELANIATRUMP want to Make America Healthy Again.” In a second Tweet, Kennedy drew attention to a recent federal court ruling, in which an Obama-appointed judge, after reviewing a huge number of scientific studies and hours of expert testimony, ruled that the EPA had “improperly approved this dangerous neurotoxin.” If you’ve been following the news, or my writing for Infowars, you’ll know the exact ruling Kennedy is referring to. Back in September, Judge Edward Chen, in the Northern District of California, found that fluoride in drinking water poses an “unreasonable risk” of reduced IQ in children. “In all, there is substantial and scientifically credible evidence establishing that fluoride poses a risk to human health; it is associated with a reduction in the IQ of children and is hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,” Chen wrote in his judgment. “EPA’s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level,” he added, citing a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) which “concluded that fluoride is indeed associated with reduced IQ in children, at least at exposure levels at or above 1.5 mg/L.” American towns have already started removing fluoride from their water supplies after Judge Chen’s ruling. Yorktown and Somers, both in New York State, have announced an end to municipal fluoridation, on the sensible basis that residents can choose to supplement their diets with fluoride if they wish through toothpaste and other products, but nobody should have to consume fluoride if they don’t want to. So that’s one MAHA initiative: an end to fluoridation. Yesterday Trump said, in an interview with NBC, that idea “sounds okay to me.” Let’s assume he really is on board. What else? In the same interview, Trump was asked directly if he would consider banning certain vaccines. “Well, I’m going to talk to [RFK Jr.] and talk to other people, and I’ll make a decision, but he’s a very talented guy and has strong views,” Trump replied. That’s definitely not a refusal. It would make sense, of course. Trump has Tweeted in the past about vaccines causing autism—”Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn’t feel good and changes – AUTISM. Many such cases!”—and vaccines are an RFK Jr. special subject. Kennedy has spent decades campaigning to highlight the harmful, even deadly, side effects of vaccines and the double tragedy of families having a child injured by a vaccine only to hit a wall of denials and smears in their quest for justice. Oh yes—and there was that leaked phone call between Trump and RFK Jr. in which the former president expressed, in the words of CNN, “vaccine scepticism.” Which vaccines might be targeted, isn’t clear yet. Since 2020, one of Kennedy’s main targets has been the COVID-19 vaccines, and especially the new experimental mRNA vaccines (or gene therapy, if you prefer), but that may be a touchy subject with Trump. Trump was responsible, after all, for Operation Warp Speed and probably doesn’t want to admit that it was a mistake—even if it was an honest mistake, and I think it was. So far Trump has avoided any suggestion that he regrets Warp Speed and the mass rollout of the vaccines, but he has apologised to military personnel and government employees who were forced out of their jobs for refusing to take the shot. In August, he said at a town hall that he would rehire servicemen and -women and give them backdated pay as compensation for their hardships. Then there’s JD Vance’s recent appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, in which Vance freely spoke about the unpleasant side effects he experienced when he took a COVID vaccine. So maybe the COVID shots might be on the table. It’s more likely that other vaccines, and the absurd childhood vaccination schedule, will be on the chopping block. In Trump’s leaked phone call with Kennedy, he spoke about the dangers of giving children too many vaccines all at once. “When you feed a baby, Bobby, a vaccination that is, like, 38 different vaccines and it looks like it’s been for a horse, Not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby… And then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically. I’ve seen it too many times.” Okay. So now we have two specific targets: the water supply and the vaccines. Kennedy has already spoken at length during the campaign about endocrine disruptors—ubiquitous toxic chemicals that disrupt our body’s hormonal balance, with devastating effects for health across the board—and ultra-processed food, which Americans like the rest of the Developed World are consuming in unholy quantities, again with devastating effects. Kennedy believes that these are two of the principal causes of the chronic-disease nightmare America faces today, from obesity to neurological diseases and everything in between. He’s right. That’s two more targets. Institutional capture has been another topic of focus for RFK Jr. across the decades, and he’s spoken recently, as we’d expect, about the need for root and branch reform of the FDA and the USDA and the EPA and so on. All of these institutions are supposed to protect Americans and ensure corporate interests are held to account, but instead they’ve been hopelessly captured by the very corporations they’re supposed to police. So we’ve got at least five clear targets now: the water supply; the vaccines; the pollution; the food; and the regulators. If that doesn’t sound like an agenda for a full four-year term—and probably beyond—I don’t know what does. Trump still hasn’t announced a specific role for Kennedy, but Kennedy himself has told his supporters that he could be given powers over a number of different public health agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture. A floating position could very well be a strength for Kennedy—as a kind of “minister without portfolio” who can move around with relative ease from department to department and from organization to organization, navigating the intricate tangle of interests that determine the health and well-being of Americans, without getting caught up in them. Yeah, I like that idea a lot. But this is all to come. In the meantime, get out there and vote if you haven’t already. We can’t Make America Healthy Again if Trump isn’t elected.",2,-0.19641481,-0.07778237,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/surprising-symptoms-of-chronic-heartburn,Surprising symptoms of chronic heartburn,1,"With a name like heartburn, it's easy to assume that the condition always shows up as a fiery feeling in your chest or stomach. While that's certainly the classic symptom, chronic heartburn can also make its presence known in other ways, such as a tingling feeling in the nose, chest pressure, a bitter or metallic taste, a hoarse voice, tooth damage, or a dry cough. What's the link between these symptoms and that spicy spaghetti you had for dinner? Stomach acid. It can leak up into the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. Chronic leakage is a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is responsible for symptoms that you might mistake for other conditions. Heart symptoms Sometimes acid reflux irritates the upper part of the stomach or the esophagus, which can cause chest pain or pressure, mimicking pain from a partial blockage in a heart artery or even a heart attack. What you should do. If you're worried about sudden pain in your chest, don't try to figure out if it's heartburn. ""This is especially true for people with heart disease risk factors,"" says Dr. Christopher Cannon, a cardiologist and editor in chief of the Harvard Heart Letter. But discerning the difference between heartburn and heart problems is complicated, and it's best to talk to a doctor about it. ""Chest pain can come from many causes, like acid reflux, but also stress, lung irritation, or muscle aches,"" Dr. Cannon says. ""We have to consider your heart disease risk factors. For example, do you have high blood pressure or diabetes? Does the pain come with exercise? Those could all point to heart trouble, and we might order tests. If the pain comes when you lie down after eating a heavy meal, and taking an antacid makes it better, then it's likely heartburn."" Lifestyle strategies to combat heartburn Lifestyle habits are an important part of thwarting heartburn. Try as many of the following as possible: Avoid foods and drinks that seem to trigger heartburn symptoms, such as anything spicy, fatty, fried, greasy, or acidic (like tomato sauces or citrus); foods with onions or garlic; alcohol; soda; and anything with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or chocolate. Eat smaller meals. Stay upright for at least two hours after meals. Avoid late-night eating or drinking (especially alcohol). Sleep on a wedge pillow. Quit smoking. Lose weight if you need to. Nose or throat symptoms In GERD, stomach acid can get up high in the throat and even the area behind the nose, triggering a number of potential symptoms. ""The upper airway isn't built to have the same protections as the stomach or esophagus, so when reflux comes up, it causes injury, almost like a low-level chemical burn. It can cause a dry cough, a sore throat, a hoarse voice, a feeling like there's a lump or mucus plug in the back of the throat, or a tingling feeling in the nose,"" says Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya, an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ENT) at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Because these symptoms overlap with many other conditions, such as a cold or allergies, it can be a long time before you recognize that you have GERD. What you should do: If you suspect GERD might be causing your symptoms, talk to your primary care provider or an ENT. ""We usually recommend that someone go on a four-week trial of heartburn medications, such as over-the-counter omeprazole, and make temporary lifestyle changes to avoid heartburn triggers,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. (See ""Lifestyle strategies to combat heartburn."") ""If symptoms improve after four weeks, it's a good indicator that you probably have reflux disease,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. Mouth or dental symptoms For some people, GERD symptoms might seem more like mouth or dental problems. ""If the acid reaches your mouth, you might develop mouth sores or ulcers, erosion or wear on your teeth, or cavities. The cavities could be due to the acid, sugary heartburn medications, your diet, poor oral hygiene, or a combination of those factors,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, a prosthodontist in the Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Acid reflux can also create a bitter or metallic taste in the mouth. What you should do. If you suspect that acid reflux is reaching your mouth, rinse frequently with water to neutralize it and protect your gums, soft tissues, and teeth. ""Wait 30 minutes after meals or after detecting reflux to brush your teeth. This allows your saliva — and water that you rinse with or drink — to neutralize the mouth's acidity,"" Dr. Jiang says. ""Just before brushing, rinse with water to eliminate the acid first, so you don't accidentally brush the acid against your teeth and cause more extensive wear. And get your teeth cleaned at least twice a year."" Image: © ljubaphoto/Getty Images",1,0.3244335,-0.15708445,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/trending-now-home-sleep-tests,Trending now: Home sleep tests,1,"Want to find out if the snoring, gasping, or choking sounds you're making during sleep are actually signs of obstructive sleep apnea? Until recently, you would have had to go to a sleep lab, get hooked up to dozens of sensors, and spend the night. Now, thanks to the miniaturization of sophisticated technology, you can conduct a basic sleep test in your own bed. ""Home sleep tests are often the preferred approach to detect sleep apnea, not just by doctors, but also by insurance companies. Many are no longer covering in-lab studies, which cost thousands of dollars. A home sleep test costs a few hundred dollars, and it's usually covered,"" says Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. However, she cautions that you can't always rely on results from a home test. What's involved? You need a prescription for a home sleep test. You can talk to your primary care physician or a sleep specialist about it. Or you can order a home sleep test online from any number of companies. You visit a company's website, purchase the test, and talk to a company-affiliated doctor via telemedicine. The doctor can prescribe the test if it's right for you. You might also be interested in...

Applying the latest results from nutrition science, Harvard experts take you by the hand and guide you to create an eating plan to improve heart health, longevity, energy, and vitality. LEARN MORE Dr. Javaheri has reservations about arranging a test online. ""You won't know if it's the best-quality sleep test or the best interpretation of the results. A lot of those companies just send a standardized blurb about the results,"" she says. Taking the test Either you will pick up your test from your doctor's office or the test will be delivered to you. It involves wearing a few small sensors overnight, typically a nasal cannula, a loop of thin tubing worn under the nose to measure your breathing patterns a pulse oximeter, a small gadget placed on the finger to measure oxygen levels in your blood a chest strap, an adjustable belt that measures the effort or movement your body is making to breathe. Each of those sensors plugs into a small data monitor, which is worn on the chest strap. A newer type of home sleep test has even less equipment. The data recorder is worn on the wrist, like a watch. It connects to a pulse oximeter and a small chest sensor. The chest sensor measures breathing effort and snoring sounds. Test results While it's not as detailed or as accurate as an in-lab sleep study, a high-quality home sleep test yields fairly reliable results. ""You have an 80% chance that the test will be right,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""But we compare the results with your symptoms to help make sure the results are accurate and to determine the best treatment options."" If the test results don't match your symptoms—for example, if you have sleep apnea symptoms and a negative test result — your doctor will have to investigate further. ""We'll look at the context of the results and the circumstances of the test. It could be that you had nasal congestion on the night of the test, you were breathing through your mouth, and the nasal sensor didn't pick that up,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""If we have strong suspicions that you have sleep apnea, we'll need to schedule an in-lab study."" What is obstructive sleep apnea? Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition marked by 10- to 30-second pauses in breathing during sleep. Those pauses are called apneas and can occur hundreds of times per night. The breathing disruptions occur when the airway in your nose or throat becomes partially or completely blocked by large tonsils, a large tongue, or too much tissue in the airway. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, daytime sleepiness, and car accidents. Image: © Blueastro/Getty Images Should you consider a home test? The tests aren't for everyone. People with a serious chronic condition, such as heart failure or a breathing disorder, may need additional data from an in-lab study to help determine treatment. For people who don't have serious chronic conditions, a home sleep test can be a game changer. ""If you have a straightforward case, it's the best way to go,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""It's cost-effective, and it's more comfortable than an in-lab study. And since you are doing the test at home, it is more likely to capture your natural sleep habits.""

https://www.infowars.com/posts/kennedy-trump-white-house-will-remove-fluoride-from-drinking-water,Kennedy: Trump White House Will Remove Fluoride from Drinking Water,0,"A new Trump administration will make removing fluoride from US public water one of its priorities, according to RFK Jr. On Saturday, Trump’s health czar told Twitter that, on the day of the inauguration, the White House will issue general advice to stop adding fluoride to water. “On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,” Kennedy Tweeted. “Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease. President ​@realDonaldTrump and First Lady @MELANIATRUMP want to Make America Healthy Again.” In a second Tweet, Kennedy drew attention to a recent federal court ruling, in which an Obama-appointed judge, after reviewing a huge number of scientific studies and hours of expert testimony, ruled that the EPA had “improperly approved this dangerous neurotoxin.” Judge Edward Chen, in the Northern District of California, ruled that fluoride in drinking water poses an “unreasonable risk” of reduced IQ in children. “In all, there is substantial and scientifically credible evidence establishing that fluoride poses a risk to human health; it is associated with a reduction in the IQ of children and is hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,” Chen wrote. “EPA’s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level,” he added, citing a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) which “concluded that fluoride is indeed associated with reduced IQ in children, at least at exposure levels at or above 1.5 mg/L.” American towns have already started removing fluoride from their water supplies after Judge Chen’s ruling. Yorktown and Somers, both in New York State, have both announced an end to municipal fluoridation. Somers Supervisor Robert Scorrano said that the town’s decision to stop fluoridating the municipal water supply would “give residents the freedom to choose their own sources of fluoride, ensuring personal control over their health decisions. Additionally, concerns about potential long-term health risks from fluoride exposure support reevaluating its use in public water systems.” In addition to the potential risks to health and IQ, a new report has also shown that the dental benefits of fluoridation are limited. The new report, published by the Cochrane Review, says that any benefits for tooth decay are now minimal, because people have a much higher baseline level of dental health than they did 50 years ago.",8,-0.19106866,-0.0412253,True
https://www.infowars.com/posts/house-floats-law-to-make-colleges-that-mandated-covid-shots-pay-for-vaccine-injuries,House Floats Law to Make Colleges That Mandated Covid Shots Pay for Vaccine Injuries,0,"Colleges that mandated the COVID-19 vaccine would be liable for medical expenses for students who experienced adverse events from the shot, under a bill introduced Tuesday in the U.S. House of Representatives. The University Forced Vaccination Student Injury Mitigation Act of 2024 would require higher education institutions to cover medical costs for students who were — or still are — required to get a COVID-19 shot for class attendance and who experienced an injury. The bill — introduced by Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) — stipulates colleges must cover the medical costs or risk losing all federal funding from the U.S. Department of Education. “If you are not prepared to face the consequences, you should have never committed the act,” said Rosendale in a press release. “Colleges and universities forced students to inject themselves with an experimental vaccine knowing it was not going to prevent COVID-19 while potentially simultaneously causing life-threatening health defects like Guillain-Barré Syndrome and myocarditis.” “It is now time,” Rosendale added, “for schools to be held accountable for their brazen disregard for students’ health and pay for the issues they are responsible for causing.” Reps. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) and Bill Posey (R-Fla.) co-sponsored the bill. Dr. Joseph Marine, professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, explained in the press release why he supports the bill: “COVID-19 vaccine mandates for college students were flawed policies that did not alter the course of the pandemic and were not needed to keep college campuses ‘safe.’ I had to make efforts to prevent my own high school and college-age children from receiving COVID-19 booster shots that they did not want or need. “It seems reasonable to me that institutions that implemented such policies without a sound medical or scientific rationale should take responsibility for any proven medical harm that they caused.” If passed, the bill would allow students to submit a formal request for reimbursement, the Washington Examiner reported. The request would have to include a record of COVID-19 vaccination, certification from a medical provider that the vaccine caused some kind of disease and a detailed account of related medical expenses. Diseases covered by the legislation include myocarditis, pericarditis, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome and any other diseases that the U.S. Secretary of Education determines to be linked to COVID-19 vaccination. After the student’s request is vetted to ensure it’s valid and contains sufficient evidence, the college would have to pay the medical costs within 30 days. It is unclear when a vote on the bill will take place. CHD took college mandate challenge to U.S. Supreme Court Rutgers University was the first college or university in the U.S. to mandate the vaccines, threatening to disenroll noncompliant students in the fall 2021 semester. In August 2021, Children’s Health Defense (CHD) sued the university in an attempt to block the mandate. The case was dismissed in January 2023. After losing on appeal in February, CHD in May asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, but the court declined. Meanwhile, a month earlier, Rutgers abruptly ended the mandate. Meanwhile, a federal appeals court this summer ruled that employees in the Los Angeles Unified School District can sue the district over its COVID-19 vaccine mandate because the shots don’t prevent transmission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges that myocarditis and pericarditismay occur after COVID-19 vaccination. And research shows that adolescents and young adults are particularly at risk of vaccine-induced myocarditis. As of Sept. 27, there were 1,604,710 Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports of injury or death following a COVID-19 vaccination. VAERS is the primary mechanism for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before confirming the reported adverse event was caused by the vaccine. VAERS has historically been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events. Meanwhile, citing concerns about the shots’ efficacy and safety, Idaho’s Southwest District Health last week voted to no longer offer COVID-19 vaccines at all 30 locations where it provides healthcare services. 17 colleges still have COVID vaccine mandates By late May 2021, more than 400 U.S. colleges and universities required students to be vaccinated against COVID-19, The New York Times reported. As of Oct. 19, 17 of those institutions still have a COVID-19 vaccination requirement for students to be able to enroll or live on campus, according to No College Mandates, a “group of concerned parents, doctors, nurses, professors, students and other college stakeholders working towards the common goal of ending COVID-19 vaccine mandates.” Lucia Sinatra, co-founder of No College Mandates, said in the press release: “College students were never at risk of severe injury or death from any variant of the COVID-19 virus and institutions of higher education had this data well in advance of mandating COVID-19 vaccines.” According to the CDC, age is the “strongest risk factor” for severe outcomes from COVID-19 — meaning that the older a person is, the greater their risk for severe symptoms and death. The CDC said its National Center for Health Statistics shows that “compared with ages 18–29 years, the risk of death is 25 times higher in those ages 50–64 years, 60 times higher in those ages 65–74 years, 140 times higher in those ages 75–84 years, and 340 times higher in those ages 85+ years.” In other words, the typical college student — ages 18-22 — isn’t usually at risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19 when compared with older age groups. Nonetheless, Sinatra said, many colleges imposed “some of the most coercive and restrictive vaccination policies” on college students, stripping them of their “fundamental right to bodily autonomy and informed consent.”",6,-0.3639107,0.24619429,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/taming-high-triglycerides,Taming high triglycerides,1,"When you get a cholesterol test (also known as a lipid panel or lipid profile), the most important value is your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, sometimes called ""bad"" cholesterol. High LDL levels track closely with the artery-clogging process at the root of most heart disease. But a lipid panel also reveals your blood level of triglycerides, which are the most common form of fat both in food and in your bloodstream. Because levels rise after you eat, triglycerides need to be measured after at least eight hours of fasting to get an accurate reading for treatment decisions. When and why should you pay attention to your triglyceride value? For healthy adults, a normal level is less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), but 25% to 30% of Americans have values that exceed that level. Values of 151 to 200 mg/dL are borderline high; those 201 to 499 are high, and those 500 and higher are very high. When does risk start to rise? Many studies have linked high triglycerides to a heightened risk of heart disease. ""But when you adjust for having related problems, such as obesity or type 2 diabetes, the association isn't quite as strong,"" says Dr. Nicholas Marston, a preventive cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Still, a recent study found that the risk of heart-related problems starts to rise at triglyceride levels greater than 89 mg/dL — far lower than the 150 mg/dL value long considered to be normal. The study, published Feb. 6, 2024, in the Journal of the American Heart Association, included more than 14,000 Italian adults who were followed for an average of just over 11 years.

LEARN MORE ""If people with high triglycerides eat a healthier diet, exercise regularly, and lose weight, they can lower their levels by more than 50%,"" says Dr. Marston. These tips can help: Choose carbs wisely. Cut back on easily digested carbohydrates like white bread, white rice, chips, sugar-laden breakfast cereals, and anything else — including beverages — with a lot of added sugar. Watch fats. Cut back on saturated fats from meat and butter, which can elevate triglycerides. Try to eat more unsaturated fats from plants, oils, and fish, which bring down triglycerides. Avoid excess alcohol. Moderate drinking (one drink per day for women, two for men) may be reasonable. But less is better if your triglycerides are high. Get moving. Regular exercise lowers triglycerides. You might also be interested in... Workout Workbook The numbers are shocking. Just three out of 10 American adults are active enough to stay healthy and fit, and nearly four out of 10 admit they aren’t active at all, despite reams of research proving that exercise is a powerful preventive, and sometimes an antidote, for disability and illness. Which side of this divide are you standing on — and why? Maybe you’re not sure what blend of exercise is best. Or perhaps you know exactly what you need to do, but your workouts have become so humdrum that it’s harder than ever to dig up the energy to do them. Do you want to jump-start your sputtering exercise program? Or are you stuck on a plateau and wishing you could kick it up to the next level? LEARN MORE Aim for a healthy weight. If you qualify as obese or overweight, reaching a healthy body weight can drive your triglycerides down to a normal range. Dropping even just 5% to 10% of your weight can help. Medication for high triglycerides Anyone with a triglyceride level of 150 to 499 should be checked and treated for any underlying health problems that might be to blame, including diabetes, obesity, a low thyroid level (hypothyroidism), and liver or kidney disease. But when triglycerides remain high after addressing these issues and making lifestyle changes, medication may be a good idea, especially for people at risk for cardiovascular disease. Many people in this category are already taking a cholesterol-lowering statin, which lowers triglycerides by about 30%. Drugs known as fibrates, including fenofibrate (Antara, TriCor, others) and gemfibrozil (Lopid) lower triglyceride levels by about 50%, but they do not lower the risk of heart attack or stroke when added to a statin. Icosapent ethyl (Vascepa), which contains a highly purified form of a specific fat in fish oil, lowers triglycerides by about 30%. And when people with diabetes or heart disease take icosapent ethyl with a statin, it lowers their risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from cardiac causes by about 25%. On the horizon Very high triglyceride levels (500 mg/dL and above) sometimes have a genetic component. An extreme example is familial hyperchylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), which affects just one to two in a million people. These people — whose blood appears milky from the high fat levels — are prone to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Serious cases can be life-threatening. Two investigational drugs, plozasiran and olezarsen, are RNA-targeted therapies that put the brakes on a protein that controls triglyceride metabolism. Both drugs lower triglyceride levels dramatically and eliminate the risk of pancreatitis, says Dr. Marston. These drugs may also prove helpful for treating people with moderately elevated triglycerides levels, he adds. Image: © jarun011/Getty Images",7,0.31880003,0.21480821,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sleep-and-brain-health-whats-the-connection,Sleep and brain health: What's the connection?,1,"Asleep shortfall doesn't just make you feel groggy and grumpy the next day. Over time, insufficient sleep can harm your cardiovascular health. The evidence is so compelling that the American Heart Association (AHA) added healthy sleep duration to its ""Life's Essential 8"" recommendations to lower heart attack and stroke risk. Adults should strive for seven to nine hours of sleep each night. But the quality of your sleep is also important, says Dr. Susan Redline, the Peter C. Farrell professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School. Various sleep problems can cause disrupted or fragmented sleep (see ""What's sabotaging your sleep?""). ""Even if you sleep for at least seven hours, sleep disruptions can prevent you from getting enough deep sleep and may also cause unhealthy blood pressure surges,"" says Dr. Redline. Those problems may increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease and cognitive issues, according to a scientific statement by the AHA published in the March 2024 issue of the journal Stroke. Cerebro­vascular disease includes conditions that affect the brain's blood vessels, including ""silent"" strokes, which go unrecognized. What's sabotaging your sleep? These disorders can affect not only the duration but also the depth and continuity of sleep. Insomnia refers to the inability to fall or stay asleep, which is commonly linked to stress or anxiety. Other possible sleep disrupters include painful medical conditions; caffeine or alcohol use; and environmental factors such as light, noise, an uncomfortable bed, or a room that's too hot or cold. Obstructive sleep apnea is marked by repeated pauses in breathing caused by narrowing of the throat during sleep, which can lead to drops in oxygen levels and to multiple awakenings throughout the night. Periodic limb movement disorder is characterized by involuntary jerking or twitching movements in the legs during sleep. For more information, see Harvard Health Publishing's Special Health Report Improving Sleep. Why deep sleep is vital Over the course of the night, people cycle through different phases of sleep, spending about a quarter of the time in deep (slow-wave) sleep — a phase that's vital to restoring energy and supporting memory, says Dr. Redline, who co-authored the AHA statement. Blood pressure and heart rate are at their lowest point during deep sleep. Meanwhile, the brain's housekeeping system — a series of channels called the glymphatic system, which drains cerebrospinal fluid — flushes away toxins, including beta-amyloid and other proteins linked to Alzheimer's disease. When people don't get sufficient amounts of deep sleep, blood pressure may not decline as it should. This can trigger activity in cells in blood vessel walls and activate damaging inflammation. The glymphatic system, whose function depends on healthy brain blood vessels, may falter. Foiled by fragmented sleep? Brief awakenings during the night, especially those caused by sleep apnea, can cause surges in the hormone epinephrine and raise blood pressure, a problem known as nocturnal hypertension. ""These blood pressure elevations can leave people at risk for cerebrovascular problems,"" says Dr. Redline. Small blood vessels deep in the brain may be damaged by tiny clots or microbleeds, causing so-called silent strokes, which cause no noticeable symptoms. But a series of such strokes over time can lead to a condition known as multi-infarct dementia. What you can do If you don't feel rested and refreshed when you wake up in the morning despite getting at least seven hours of sleep, you might have a sleep disorder. Talk to your doctor for help identifying and addressing the problem, Dr. Redline advises. If your bed partner or family member says you snore loudly, see ""Should you be tested for sleep apnea?"" in the May 2023 Heart Letter. Even if you don't think you have insomnia, you might be experiencing frequent, brief awakenings without noticing them. Wearable devices (monitors worn on the wrist or finger) feature apps that measure sleep efficiency. The data may provide clues about brief awakenings as well as limb movements during sleep, says Dr. Redline. Make an effort to follow all the steps in Life's Essential 8, which are closely interrelated. ""Think of sleep as one of the vital habits that helps reinforce all the other healthy practices,"" says Dr. Redline. Image: © Filmstax/Getty Images",5,0.28263596,0.036592662,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-and-why-to-fit-more-fiber-and-fermented-food-into-your-meals-202404263036,How — and why — to fit more fiber and fermented food into your meals,1,"An F may mean failure in school, but the letter earns high marks in your diet. The two biggest dietary Fs — fiber and fermented foods — are top priorities to help maintain healthy digestion, and they potentially offer much more. How can you fit these nutrients into meals? Can this help your overall health as well as gut health? Fiber, fermented foods, and the gut microbiome The gut microbiome is a composed of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms living in the colon (large intestine). What you eat, the air you breathe, where you live, and many other factors affect the makeup of the gut microbiome. Some experts think of it as a hidden organ because it has a role in many important functions of the body — for example, helping the immune system function optimally, reducing chronic inflammation, keeping intestinal cells healthy, and providing some essential micronutrients that may not be included in a regular diet. Your gut communicates with your brain through pathways in the gut-brain axis. Changes in the gut microbiome have been linked with mood and mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. However, it's not yet clear that these changes directly cause these types of problems. We do know that a healthy diet low in processed foods is key to a healthy gut microbiome. And increasing evidence suggests that fiber and fermented foods can play important parts here. Fiber 101 Fiber's main job is to make digestion smoother by softening and adding bulk to stool, making it pass quickly through the intestines. But fiber has other benefits for your microbiome and overall health. A high-fiber diet helps keep body weight under control and lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Research has found that eating enough fiber reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. What to know about fiber There are two types of fiber: insoluble (which helps you feel full and encourages regular bowel movements) and soluble (which helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar). However, recent research suggests people should focus on the total amount of fiber in their diet, rather than type of fiber. If you're trying to add more foods with fiber to your diet, make sure you ease into new fiber-rich habits and drink plenty of water. Your digestive system must adapt slowly to avoid gas, bloating, diarrhea, and stomach cramps caused by eating too much too soon. Your body will gradually adjust to increasing fiber after a week or so. How much fiber do you need? The fiber formula is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories consumed. Your specific calorie intake can vary depending on your activity levels. ""But instead of tracking daily fiber, focus on adding more servings of fiber-rich foods to your diet,"" says Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Which foods are high in fiber? Fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are all high in fiber. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans has a comprehensive list of fiber-rich foods and their calorie counts. What about over-the-counter fiber supplements that come in capsules, powders that you mix with water, and chewable tablets? ""If you have trouble eating enough fiber-rich foods, then these occasionally can be used, and there is no evidence they are harmful,"" says Rimm. ""But they should not serve as your primary source of dietary fiber."" Fermented foods 101 Fermented foods contain both prebiotics — ingredients that create healthy changes in the microbiome — and beneficial live bacteria called probiotics. Both prebiotics and probiotics help maintain a healthy gut microbiome. What to know about fermented foods Besides helping with digestion and absorbing vital nutrients from food, a healthy gut supports your immune system to help fight infections and protect against inflammation. Some research suggests that certain probiotics help relieve symptoms of gut-related conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, though not all experts agree with this. Many foods that are fermented undergo lacto-fermentation, in which natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food, creating lactic acid. Not only does this process remove simple sugars, it creates various species of good bacteria, such as Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium. (Keep in mind that some foods undergo steps that remove probiotics and other healthful microbes, as with beer or wine, or make them inactive, like baking and canning.) The exact amounts and specific strains of bacteria in fermented foods vary depending on how they are made. In addition to probiotics, fermented foods may contain other valuable nutrients like enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids. How often should you eat fermented foods? There is no recommended daily allowance for prebiotics or probiotics, so it is impossible to know precisely which fermented foods or quantities are best. The general guideline is to add more to your daily diet. Which fermented foods should you choose? Fermented foods have a range of tastes and textures because of the particular bacteria they produce during fermentation or that are added to foods. Yogurt is one of the most popular fermented foods (look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label). Still, many options are available if you are not a yogurt fan or want to expand your fermented choices. Kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, and pickles are a few examples. As with fiber, probiotics are also marketed as over-the-counter supplements. However, like all dietary supplements, they do not require FDA approval, so there is no guarantee that the types of bacteria listed on a label can provide the promised benefits — or are even in the bottle. ""Therefore, it is best to get your probiotics from fermented foods,"" says Rimm.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-blood-sugar-monitoring-without-diabetes-worthwhile-202106112473,Is blood sugar monitoring without diabetes worthwhile?,1,"Here's an ad you haven't seen, but it could be coming soon: A man jogs along a dirt path meandering through idyllic countryside. He pauses at an overlook and glances down at his cellphone. The phone screen flashes a number, telling him his blood sugar is normal. He smiles and resumes his run. What's different about this ad, you wonder? The jogger doesn't have diabetes. So, how does his phone know his blood sugar? And why, in the middle of a run, does he want to know the result? Read on. If you don't have diabetes, should you monitor your blood sugar? Several companies are working hard to make this sort of ad a reality, as they begin marketing implantable blood sugar measuring devices to people without diabetes. Called continuous glucose monitoring systems, or CGMs, they are often used by people with diabetes. These companies could reap enormous profits by convincing healthy people without diabetes (or other blood sugar problems) to start monitoring blood sugar. CGMs use tiny sensor wires, or filaments, that pierce the skin to frequently and easily assess blood sugar levels. The filaments remain in place, usually on the upper arm or abdomen, protected by an adhesive patch. Results are displayed on a receiver or transmitted to the user's phone. While CGMs have required a prescription in the past, recent FDA clearance of over-the-counter CGMs may tempt healthy people to begin using these systems without a specific medical reason to do so. Where's the health benefit in this? Already, many of us monitor our weight, heart rate, or steps per day — so why not monitor blood sugar? And, is there any evidence of benefit for healthy people without diabetes to continuously monitor their blood sugar levels with CGMs? There's little published research to help answer these questions. The best study I could find found nothing particularly surprising: among 153 people who didn't have diabetes, about 96% of the time blood sugar levels were normal or nearly so. In fact, many of the abnormal levels were considered implausible or a mistake. Another small study looked at sedentary individuals without diabetes who were overweight or obese. Participants completed a counseling session about the effects of physical activity on blood sugar and used a CGM device and an activity tracker for 10 days. Afterward, they reported feeling more motivated to exercise. Yet another analysis of CGM use for rare conditions causing low blood sugar among children found no evidence of health benefit. But I could find no published study suggesting that monitoring translates into improved health for healthy people without diabetes or other blood sugar problems. So, until more studies prove the value of CGM for people without diabetes, we won't know whether the cost and time it takes to implant one of these systems is accomplishing anything or is just the latest health monitoring fad wasting effort and money. Speaking of cost, CGMs aren't cheap: they can cost several thousand dollars a year. And it's unlikely that health insurers will cover CGMs for people without diabetes, at least until there is compelling evidence that they're actually helpful. Blood sugar monitoring for people with diabetes offers undeniable health benefits For people with diabetes, a major goal of therapy is to keep the blood sugar close to the normal range. This helps to prevent symptoms and complications, prolong life, and improve quality of life. The development of CGM devices that can frequently and easily monitor blood sugar levels without finger sticks has revolutionized care for millions of people with diabetes. Besides providing results of blood sugar levels, some devices have alarm settings that alert the user, or other people, if blood sugar becomes dangerously low or high. And some systems can transmit results directly to the user's doctor, if desired. If knowledge is power, why not monitor your blood sugar? So, why would a person who doesn't have diabetes want to monitor their blood sugar? Possible reasons include Detecting prediabetes. In prediabetes blood sugar is slightly high, but not high enough to meet the definition of diabetes. For healthy people, blood sugar testing is typically recommended every three years or so; if prediabetes is diagnosed, repeat testing is recommended more often, at least yearly. CGM might allow earlier diagnosis of prediabetes or diabetes. This could be particularly helpful for people at higher risk for diabetes due to family history or other factors, and people taking medicines that can raise blood sugar. The notion of ""optimizing"" blood sugar for peak mental or physical performance. Not surprisingly, some CGM makers suggest knowing your blood sugar can help you make changes to keep it in an ""ideal range"" that will help you perform your best, prevent diabetes, or improve health in some other way. For example, you might change what or when you eat. None of these marketing notions has been proven, or even well studied. And guess what — even the ideal blood sugar range for a person who isn't diabetic is uncertain. A sense of control. Having more information about your body may provide you with a feeling of control over your health, even if you take no immediate action. Curiosity. Let's face it, it's tempting to gather information about our bodies that might be interesting (even when we're not sure what to do with it). But truly, knowledge that is useless, redundant, or inaccurate doesn't make you powerful! It may even be harmful. For example, if biologically insignificant drops in blood sugar lead you to snack more (""to avoid hypoglycemia""), you could gain weight and actually increase your risk of developing diabetes. If the monitoring system sometimes provides inaccurate information or false alarms, unnecessary anxiety, calls or visits to the doctor, visits to an emergency room, and even inappropriate treatment may follow. The bottom line Unfortunately, some makers of CGM systems aren't waiting for solid research results to market these devices to healthy people. So, consumers and marketing professionals — not researchers or doctors — may wind up driving demand for the product. For any new technology there's a scientific learning curve to figure out when to use it. In my view, we're at the very beginning of the learning curve for home monitoring of blood sugar in people without diabetes. Before buying into what may be the next fad in health monitoring, I think we need to learn a lot more. There is wisdom in the teachings of one of my favorite professors in medical school: ""Just because you can measure something doesn't mean you should.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/high-protein-snacks-to-build-muscle-and-keep-hunger-at-bay,High-protein snacks to build muscle and keep hunger at bay,1,"Getting enough protein in your diet is essential for building bones, muscles, and skin, and for proper functioning of all our body's organs. In our youth we need it for growth and development, and throughout life to repair cells and tissues. As we grow older, adequate protein and regular exercise are the key ingredients that help offset sarcopenia, the natural age-related tendency to lose muscle mass and power. Dietary protein also can aid in weight control by helping you feel fuller for longer. How much protein do you need? The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (that's 0.36 grams per pound). To determine your RDA for protein, multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36, or use the USDA's online tool to calculate your needs. Note that your individual protein needs may vary based on your age, activity levels, and other factors such as whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Research suggests that our bodies can only process about 20 to 40 grams of protein at a time. That means you shouldn't plan on getting a day's worth of protein in one or two meals. Rather, try to get some protein at every meal. And supplement with healthy snacks that contain at least five grams of protein. Focus on getting protein from high-quality food sources like lean meats, fish, dairy, soy, legumes, nuts, and whole grains. What can high-protein snacks do for you? Muscles need protein in order to increase and maintain muscle mass. If you're trying to maximize muscle growth and boost muscle recovery, eat a high-protein snack within 30 to 60 minutes of a strength-training session. If you're trying to lose or maintain weight, a low-calorie, high-protein snack can help slow digestion and stabilize blood sugar, making you feel fuller for longer — and preventing you from overeating at your next meal. These 12 snacks are high in protein and easy to pack to help power you through your day. Savory high-protein snacks Chickpeas Also known as garbanzo beans, chickpeas provide 7 grams of protein per 1/2-cup serving. Toss chickpeas with cucumber, tomato, red onion, feta, olives, and Greek dressing to make a hearty chopped salad. Dry rinsed chickpeas before tossing with extra virgin olive oil, a pinch of salt, and your favorite spices. Roast at 350° for about 45 minutes. Jerky Beef jerky provides 10 grams of protein per ounce. While beef jerky is the easiest to find at grocery stores and gas stations, salmon jerky provides even more protein per ounce — 12 grams — while chicken jerky has 10 grams per ounce. Just keep an eye on sodium levels. Cheese Cheese sticks are a lunchbox staple — and they're also a convenient way to get 5 to 7 grams of protein per one-ounce stick. If you don't have pre-packaged cheese sticks on hand, an ounce of cheddar cheese is about the size of two standard six-sided dice. Nuts All nuts contain protein, but peanuts, almonds, and pistachios have the most. An ounce of shelled peanuts (that's about a handful) provides 7 grams of protein, while almonds and pistachios both provide 6 grams of protein per ounce. Eat nuts out of hand or mix them into a trail mix with other seeds, nuts, or dried fruit. Sprinkle sliced nuts over Greek yogurt and berries. Edamame A popular appetizer at sushi restaurants, 1 cup of edamame provides 18 grams of protein. And, unlike many plant-based sources of protein, edamame provides all the essential amino acids your body needs. Steam or boil fresh or frozen edamame for five to 10 minutes, then season with sea salt and red pepper flakes to taste. Tuna Three ounces (about half a can) of tuna provides 25.5 grams of protein. Swap out mayonnaise for the same amount of plain Greek yogurt in your tuna salad and you'll add a few more grams of protein to your snack. Combine tuna, yogurt, diced celery, chopped chives, a little extra virgin olive oil, and a dash of lemon and Dijon mustard to make a spread for crackers or a dip for vegetables. Eggs One large hardboiled egg provides 6.3 grams of protein. Eat your eggs with a yogurt curry dip for an extra boost of protein. To make the dip, combine 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt with 1 teaspoon curry powder, a sprinkle of lemon juice, and a small squeeze of honey. Sweet high-protein snacks Greek yogurt A 3/4-cup serving of Greek yogurt provides 17 grams of protein — more than twice the amount of protein found in regular yogurt. Make a packable parfait by layering plain Greek yogurt, berries, and a nut-filled granola in a mason jar with a lid. Add a drizzle of honey or maple syrup if desired. Cottage cheese A 3/4-cup serving of cottage cheese has 12 grams of protein. You can turn cottage cheese into a sweet and packable snack by mixing it with honey and frozen or fresh raspberries, then topping it with toasted almonds. Add chia seeds for more protein and a little extra crunch. Chia seeds Chia seeds contain all nine essential amino acids. Two tablespoons of chia seeds provide 5 grams of protein. To make chia pudding, combine 2 tablespoons chia seeds with 1/2 cup of milk in a mason jar. Close the lid tightly and shake. After 10 minutes, shake again to dissolve any clumps. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes (or overnight) to allow the pudding to thicken. Add fresh or frozen berries, nuts, cinnamon, and a touch of maple or honey. Peanut butter Two tablespoons of peanut butter provide 7 grams of protein (but also fat and calories, so go easy on serving sizes). Spread peanut butter on toast and top with thin slices of apple and a sprinkling of cinnamon. Pumpkin seeds An ounce of shelled pumpkin seeds (also known as pepitas) provide 8 grams of protein. Add toasted and salted pepitas to salads or butternut squash soup. Toss raw pumpkin seeds with oil, salt, and pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon. Preheat oven to 325° and bake on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet for 20 to 30 minutes.",3,0.29495698,0.06551598,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-importance-of-stretching,The importance of stretching,1,"You may think of stretching as something performed only by runners or gymnasts. But we all need to stretch in order to protect our mobility and independence. A lot of people don't understand that stretching has to happen on a regular basis. Ideally, it should be daily. Why stretching is important Stretching keeps the muscles flexible and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion in the joints. Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight. Then, when you call on the muscles for activity, they are unable to extend all the way. That puts you at risk for joint pain, strains, and muscle damage. For example, sitting in a chair all day results in tight hamstrings in the back of the thigh. That can make it harder to extend your leg or straighten your knee all the way, which inhibits walking. Likewise, when tight muscles are suddenly called on for a strenuous activity that stretches them, such as playing tennis, they may become damaged from suddenly being stretched. Injured muscles may not be strong enough to support the joints, which can lead to joint injury. Regular stretching keeps muscles long, lean, and flexible, and this means that exertion won't put too much force on the muscle itself. Healthy muscles also help a person with balance problems avoid falls. Where to start With a body full of muscles, the idea of daily stretching may seem overwhelming. It's most important to focus on the body areas needed for critical for mobility: your lower extremities: your calves, your hamstrings, your hip flexors in the pelvis and quadriceps in the front of the thigh. Stretching your shoulders, neck, and lower back is also beneficial. Aim for a program of daily stretches, or at least three or four times per week. Find a physical therapist (your local Y is a good place to start) who can assess your muscle strength and tailor a stretching program to fit your needs. Proper execution Stretching the muscles before they're warmed up can actually hurt them. When everything is cold, the fibers aren't prepared and may be damaged. If you exercise first, you'll get blood flow to the area, and that makes the tissue more pliable and amenable to change. All it takes to warm up the muscles before stretching is five to 10 minutes of light activity, such as a quick walk. You can also stretch after an aerobic or weight-training workout. Hold a stretch for 30 seconds. Don't bounce, which can cause injury. You'll feel tension during a stretch, but you should not feel pain. If you do, there may be an injury or damage in the tissue. Stop stretching that muscle and talk to your doctor. Try a hamstring stretch A hamstring stretch will keep the muscles in the back of your thigh flexible. Sit on the floor with your legs in front of you. Slide your hands down your legs until you feel a burning sensation. Hold for 30 seconds, then slowly return to a sitting position. The cumulative effect of stretching Stretching once today won't magically give you perfect flexibility. You'll need to do it over time and remain committed to the process. It may have taken you many months to get tight muscles, so you're not going to be perfectly flexible after only a few sessions. It takes weeks to months to get flexible, and you'll have to continue working on it to maintain it. Image: kali9/Getty Images; bottom image: zdenkam/Getty Images",5,0.29728818,-0.21654531,True

And from now on, all of them are required to undergo ""diversity, equity and inclusion"" (DEI) propaganda courses showcasing LGBTQ+ perversion in order to remain employed. Elizabeth Jones, an employee for the California Department of State Hospitals (DSH), wrote an article for LifeSiteNews that explains what the forced indoctrination classes entail. DSH employs about 13,000 people whose job it is to provide mental health services to around 6,500 patients at five state-run hospitals: Atascadero, Coalinga, Metropolitan (in Los Angeles County), Napa and Patton. Jones spent about two hours clicking through a mandatory course within DSH called ""DSH LGBTQ+ Training 2024"" that instructs employees about what so-called ""LGBTQ affirming care is, how to deliver it and why it matters."" The beginning of the course features a psychologist and social worker at Napa State Hospital breaking down the difference between ""sexual orientation"" and ""gender identity."" ""I was informed that 'sexual orientations' include 'heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual and pansexual,'"" Jones writes. ""Pansexual, according to my notes, 'means that the person's sexual behavior and attraction is rooted in connection with the other person, rather than the gender the other person chooses to adopt' – denying our bodily reality."" ""'Gender identities,' on the other hand, describe 'the labels we put on ourselves regardless of our sexual orientation' and include woman, man, 'trans-man, trans-woman, cisgender, transgender, gender non-binary, gender fluid and gender queer,'"" added Jones.

LGBTQ+ is evil through and through From there, the course delves into the so-called ""gender unicorn"" as presented by a social worker named David. The purpose of the unicorn is to illustrate even more made-up differences between concepts like ""gender identity,"" ""gender expression,"" ""sex assigned at birth,"" and ""sexual and romantic orientation."" For far leftists, everything is seen through the lens of sexual activity. All forms of love from familial to brotherly to the charity spoken of in the Bible that applies generally have been reduced by the Cult of LGBTQ+ into perverse sexual deviancy. As such, DSH created an entire course that effectively destroys all innocence and true love by brainwashing California mental health employees and the patients they see into perverting it all into some form of sexual deviancy and abuse. The course features an additional layer of forced brainwashing in the form of quizzes that force employees to answer hypothetical questions and scenarios in the ""correct"" way as defined by the Cult of LGBTQ+. ""The patient's legal name is Genisse Plant and records indicate that the patient was once in a sexual relationship with someone by the name of Patrick Gonzalez,"" one quiz question begins. ""What do we truly know about this person?"" The ""correct answer"" according to the Cult of LGBTQ+ is as follows: ""We do not have enough information about Genisse's gender identity or sexual orientation."" The rest of the course includes an array of additional brainwashing concepts such as ""social and systemic oppression of the LGBTQ+ community"" and the ""unrelenting stress"" that LGBTQ+s feel whenever someone does not fully embrace and promote their mental illness. In the comments, someone quoted the following from the great Russian writer and dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who warned long in advance of all this that: ""The greatest mistake that Western societies make is in thinking that communism will never come to their shores.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-eggs-risky-for-heart-health,Are eggs risky for heart health?,1,"For most people, an egg a day does not increase your risk of a heart attack, a stroke, or any other type of cardiovascular disease. In the past, it seemed logical to think eggs would be bad for your heart health. We knew that the cholesterol in eggs came from the egg yolks, and we knew that high levels of cholesterol, especially LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood increased the risk of cardiovascular disease. So, it seemed logical that avoiding cholesterol in the diet made sense. Since then, however, research has shown that most of the cholesterol in our body is made by our liver — it doesn't come from cholesterol we eat. The liver is stimulated to make cholesterol primarily by saturated fat and trans fat in our diet, not dietary cholesterol. But a large egg contains little saturated fat — about 1.5 grams (g). And research has confirmed that eggs also contain many healthy nutrients: lutein and zeaxanthin, which are good for the eyes; choline, which is good for the brain and nerves; and various vitamins (A, B, and D). In fact, just one large egg contains 270 international units (IU) of vitamin A and 41 IU of vitamin D. One large egg also contains about 6 g of protein and 72 calories. The evidence that cholesterol in one egg a day is safe for most people comes from huge studies — many conducted here at Harvard Medical School — that have followed hundreds of thousands of people over decades. They regularly report what they eat and all of the medical conditions that they develop. It is those studies that do not find higher rates of heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular diseases in people who eat up to one egg per day. Of course, it matters greatly what you eat with your eggs. The saturated fat in butter, cheese, bacon, sausage, muffins, or scones, for example, raises your blood cholesterol much more than the cholesterol in your egg. And the highly refined ""bad carbs"" in white toast, pastries, home fries, and hash browns may also increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/proton-pump-inhibitors,Proton-pump inhibitors: What you need to know,1,"Stomach acid is natural, a valuable chemical contributor to orderly digestion. But in excess or in the wrong place, it's a menace, inflaming and irritating the esophagus, typically causing heartburn and sometimes contributing to the development of ulcers in the stomach and the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. People have dealt with stomach acid–related woes in a variety of ways, proven and otherwise, for eons, but it wasn't until the mid-1970s and the introduction of cimetidine (Tagamet) that a treatment targeted the production of stomach acid itself. Cimetidine was a huge commercial success; by some accounts, it was the first blockbuster drug. Other drugs in the same class, known as H2 blockers, quickly followed suit. Now the proton-pump inhibitor drugs (PPIs) have eclipsed the H2 blockers as the most commonly prescribed agents to reduce stomach acid. Examples of PPIs include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (AcipHex), and esomeprazole (Nexium). They are prescribed to both prevent and treat ulcers in the duodenum (where most ulcers develop) and the stomach. They also counter the various problems that occur when stomach acid escapes into the esophagus, which — if it happens on a regular basis — is a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In most head-to-head trials, the PPIs have proved to be superior to the H2 blockers. Reducing stomach acid levels isn't one of medicine's glamour jobs, but it's yeoman's work, so PPIs are generally considered quite a success story: safe (more on that just below), effective medications that target the source of a lot of gastrointestinal distress. What is a PPI? Many people take PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). By lowering stomach acid levels, they reduce acid reflux into the esophagus and the resulting heartburn symptoms. Appropriate use of proton pump inhibitors Taking a PPI makes sense if you have a chronic problem with stomach acid or the prospect of one developing. But the occasional case of mild heartburn does not need to be treated with a PPI. For that kind of spot duty, the old standbys of antacid medicine like Tums, Rolaids, and Maalox will most likely work just as well, as will any of the H2 blockers. In fact, it takes several days for PPIs to have their full effect on acid secretion, so an H2 blocker may be more effective for a mild, short-term problem with stomach acid. Yet people often take PPIs under the mistaken assumption that they are the better medication in all circumstances. If heartburn is the problem, there are also changes you can make that may help that don't involve taking anything. The commercials are right: gobbling down a large meal can give you heartburn, so eating smaller meals can help tame the problem. And if you're heavy, GERD and heartburn are on that very long list of problems that ease up and may even go away if you lose some weight. PPIs are the most potent inhibitors of stomach acid available, and they're a welcome addition to the medical armamentarium. But every pill — indeed, every medical intervention — is a risk-benefit balancing act. You don't need to take a PPI for the incidental case of heartburn. If you have a prescription, the reasons for it should be reviewed periodically to make sure they're still valid; it's common for people to take medications far longer than is necessary, and that is particularly true of the PPIs. For most people who need to take a PPI, it should be for the lowest dose and shortest amount of time as possible. However, there are conditions that indicate long-term and sometimes indefinite use of a PPI, such as in people with esophagitis due to GERD. There are differences in the chemical properties of the different PPIs and how they are metabolized. But comparative studies haven't yielded any clear-cut winners, so the less expensive PPIs are the best choice for most people. Side effects Initially, there was some worry that PPIs might increase the risk of developing stomach cancer. Those concerns were unfounded, but others have taken their place, partly because people often take PPIs on a daily basis for years, so the total exposure to the drug ends up being quite significant. Here's a rundown of the some of the side effects that are causing concern: Fracture risk. Some studies have shown an association between PPIs and the risk of fracture — particularly hip fracture — while others have not. Calcium is absorbed in the small intestine, not the stomach. But low stomach acid levels can have downstream effects, especially in the duodenum, and some research shows that one of them could be reduced absorption of calcium, which could lead to osteoporosis, weaker bones, and, consequently, a greater chance of breaking a bone. The fracture risk is probably pretty small, but it's another reason for not taking a PPI unless necessary. Pneumonia risk. Several studies have shown that people taking PPIs seem to be more likely to get pneumonia than those who aren't. The association has been documented among people living in the community and hospital patients alike. Normally, stomach acid creates a fairly inhospitable environment for bacteria, but if acid levels are reduced by PPIs, the bacteria count can go up. The thinking is that in people with GERD who take PPIs, bacteria-laden stomach contents may travel up the esophagus and then get inhaled into the windpipe and lungs, where the bacteria cause pneumonia. C. difficile risk. People typically develop Clostridium difficile infections in the hospital after taking antibiotics that have disrupted the natural bacterial ecology of the large intestine. The infections cause diarrhea but can also become a lot more serious, even life-threatening. Studies have shown a fairly strong statistical correlation between PPI use and C. difficile infection, although it's still just a correlation and not proof of direct cause and effect. Some experimental evidence suggests that PPIs may change conditions in the gut to be more favorable to C. difficile bacteria. Iron and B12 deficiency. Stomach acid helps render the iron and vitamin B12 from food into forms that are readily absorbed. So, there is worry that an unintended consequence of long-term use of PPIs might cause deficiencies of this vitamin and mineral because of lower stomach acid levels. Your doctor can periodically blood tests to make sure B12 and iron levels are in the normal range. Image: dragana991/Getty Images",1,0.156082,0.060340658,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cannabidiol-cbd-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-2018082414476,Cannabidiol (CBD): What we know and what we don't,1,"Cannabidiol (CBD) is often covered in the media, and you may see it touted as an add-in booster to your post-workout smoothie or morning coffee. You can even buy a CBD-infused sports bra. But what exactly is CBD? And why is it so popular? How is cannabidiol different from marijuana, cannabis, and hemp? CBD, or cannabidiol, is the second most prevalent active ingredient in cannabis (marijuana). While CBD is an essential component of medical marijuana, it is derived directly from the hemp plant, a cousin of marijuana, or manufactured in a laboratory. One of hundreds of components in marijuana, CBD does not cause a high by itself. According to a report from the World Health Organization, ""In humans, CBD exhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or dependence potential…. To date, there is no evidence of public health related problems associated with the use of pure CBD."" A recent study in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology concluded that ""acute CBD alone is unlikely to significantly impair daily functioning or workplace performance."" Is cannabidiol legal? CBD is readily obtainable in most parts of the United States, though its exact legal status has been in flux. All 50 states have laws legalizing CBD with varying degrees of restriction. In December 2015, the FDA eased the regulatory requirements to allow researchers to conduct CBD trials. In 2018, the Farm Bill made hemp legal in the United States, making it virtually impossible to keep CBD illegal — that would be like making oranges legal, but keeping orange juice illegal. The Farm Bill removed all hemp-derived products, including CBD, from the Controlled Substances Act, which criminalizes the possession of drugs. In essence, this means that CBD is legal if it comes from hemp, but not if it comes from cannabis (marijuana) — even though it is the exact same molecule. Currently, many people obtain CBD online without a medical marijuana license, which is legal in most states. The evidence for cannabidiol health benefits CBD has been touted for a wide variety of health issues, but the strongest scientific evidence is for its effectiveness in treating some of the cruelest childhood epilepsy syndromes, such as Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), which typically don't respond well to antiseizure medications. In numerous studies, CBD was able to reduce the number of seizures, and, in some cases, stop them altogether. Epidiolex, which primarily consists of CBD, is the first cannabis-derived medicine approved by the FDA for these conditions. Animal studies, and self-reports or research in humans, suggest CBD may also help with: Anxiety: Studies and clinical trials are exploring the common report that CBD can reduce anxiety. Insomnia: Studies suggest that CBD may help with both falling asleep and staying asleep, in part by helping address chronic pain and anxiety. Chronic pain: Increasingly, human studies are substantiating the claims that CBD helps control pain. One animal study from the European Journal of Pain suggests CBD could help lower pain and inflammation due to arthritis when applied to skin. Other research identifies how CBD may inhibit inflammatory and neuropathic pain, which are difficult to treat. Addiction: CBD can help lower cravings for tobacco and heroin under certain conditions, according to some research in humans. Animal models of addiction suggest it may also help lessen cravings for other addictive substances such as alcohol, cannabis, opiates, and stimulants. Is CBD safe? Side effects of CBD could include nausea, fatigue, and irritability. CBD can increase the level of blood thinning and other medicines in your blood by competing for the liver enzymes that break down these drugs. Grapefruit has a similar effect with certain medicines. This interaction is particularly important if you are taking a blood thinner, an anti-epileptic, or an immunosuppressant medication, all of which need to have stable levels in your blood. People taking high doses of CBD may show abnormalities in liver-related blood tests. Many nonprescription drugs, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), have this same effect. You should let your doctor know if you are regularly using CBD so that he or she can check your liver enzymes periodically. A significant safety concern with CBD is that it is primarily marketed and sold as a supplement, not a medication. Currently, the FDA does not regulate the safety and purity of dietary supplements, and no one, really, is regulating the CBD market. So you cannot be sure that the product you buy has active ingredients at the dose listed on the label. In addition, the product may contain other unknown elements. If you buy CBD, it is safest to make sure that there is independent laboratory testing as attested to by a COA (certificate of analysis) that should accompany every CBD product. How can CBD be taken? CBD comes in many forms, including oils, tinctures, capsules, patches, vapes, and topical preparations for use on skin. If you're hoping to reduce inflammation and relieve muscle and joint pain, a topical CBD-infused oil, lotion or cream — or even a bath bomb — may be the best option. Alternatively, a CBC patch or a tincture or spray designed to be placed under the tongue allows CBD to directly enter the bloodstream. Dcotors don't recommend smoking anything, including CBD. Outside of the US, the prescription drug Sativex, which uses CBD as an active ingredient, is approved for muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis and for cancer pain. Within the US, Epidiolex is approved for certain types of epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis. The bottom line on cannabidiol Some CBD manufacturers have come under government scrutiny for wild, indefensible claims, such that CBD is a cure-all for cancer or COVID-19, which it is not. We need more research, but CBD is proving to be a helpful, relatively non-toxic option for managing anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain. Without sufficient high-quality evidence in human studies, we can't pinpoint effective doses, and because CBD currently is typically available as an unregulated supplement, it can be difficult to know exactly what you are getting, or to conduct studies. If you decide to try CBD, make sure you are getting it from a reputable source. Again, please discuss your use of CBD or any other supplements with your doctor to make sure that it won't affect any other medicines you take.",8,0.18861589,0.0073447227,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/9-tips-to-boost-your-energy-naturally,9 tips to boost your energy — naturally,1,"Most of us feel we need more energy. In fact, 14% of Americans said they did not have the energy they needed to get things done in one Gallup survey. Fortunately, there are things you can do to enhance your own natural energy levels. Here are nine tips: 1. Control stress Stress-induced emotions consume huge amounts of energy. Talking with a friend or relative, joining a support group, or seeing a psychotherapist can all help diffuse stress. Relaxation therapies like meditation, self-hypnosis, yoga, and tai chi are also effective tools for reducing stress. 2. Lighten your load One of the main reasons for fatigue is overwork. Overwork can include professional, family, and social obligations. Try to streamline your list of ""must-do"" activities. Set your priorities in terms of the most important tasks. Pare down those that are less important. Consider asking for extra help at work, if necessary. 3. Exercise Exercise almost guarantees that you'll sleep more soundly. It also gives your cells more energy to burn and circulates oxygen. And exercising can lead to higher brain dopamine levels, which helps elevate mood. When walking, pick up the pace periodically to get extra health benefits. 4. Avoid smoking Smoking siphons off your energy by causing insomnia. The nicotine in tobacco is a stimulant, so it speeds the heart rate, raises blood pressure, and stimulates brain-wave activity associated with wakefulness, making it harder to fall asleep. And once you do fall asleep, its addictive power can kick in and awaken you with cravings. 5. Restrict your sleep If you think you may be sleep-deprived, try getting less sleep. This advice may sound odd but determining how much sleep you actually need can reduce the time you spend in bed not sleeping. This process makes it easier to fall asleep and promotes more restful sleep in the long run. Here's how to do it: Avoid napping during the day. The first night, go to bed later than normal and get just four hours of sleep. If you feel that you slept well during that four-hour period, add another 15–30 minutes of sleep the next night. As long as you're sleeping soundly the entire time you're in bed, slowly keep adding sleep on successive nights. 6. Eat for energy Eating foods with a low glycemic index — whose sugars are absorbed slowly — may help you avoid the lag in energy that typically occurs after eating quickly absorbed sugars or refined starches. Foods with a low glycemic index include whole grains, high-fiber vegetables, nuts, and healthy oils such as olive oil. In general, high-carbohydrate foods have the highest glycemic indexes. Proteins and fats have glycemic indexes that are close to zero. 7. Use caffeine to your advantage Caffeine does help increase alertness, so having a cup of coffee can help sharpen your mind. But to get the energizing effects of caffeine, you have to use it judiciously. It can cause insomnia, especially when consumed in large amounts or after 2 p.m. 8. Limit alcohol One of the best hedges against the midafternoon slump is to avoid drinking alcohol at lunch. The sedative effect of alcohol is especially strong at midday. Similarly, avoid a five o'clock cocktail if you want to have energy in the evening. If you're going to drink, do so in moderation at a time when you don't mind having your energy wind down. 9. Drink water What's the only nutrient that has been shown to enhance performance for all but the most demanding endurance activities? It's not some pricey sports drink. It's water. If your body is short of fluids, one of the first signs is a feeling of fatigue.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response,Understanding the stress response,1,"A stressful situation — whether something environmental, such as a looming work deadline, or psychological, such as persistent worry about losing a job — can trigger a cascade of stress hormones that produce well-orchestrated physiological changes. A stressful incident can make the heart pound and breathing quicken. Muscles tense and beads of sweat appear. This combination of reactions to stress is also known as the ""fight-or-flight"" response because it evolved as a survival mechanism, enabling people and other mammals to react quickly to life-threatening situations. The carefully orchestrated yet near-instantaneous sequence of hormonal changes and physiological responses helps someone to fight the threat off or flee to safety. Unfortunately, the body can also overreact to stressors that are not life-threatening, such as traffic jams, work pressure, and family difficulties. Over the years, researchers have learned not only how and why these reactions occur, but have also gained insight into the long-term effects chronic stress has on physical and psychological health. Over time, repeated activation of the stress response takes a toll on the body. Research suggests that chronic stress contributes to high blood pressure, promotes the formation of artery-clogging deposits, and causes brain changes that may contribute to anxiety, depression, and addiction. More preliminary research suggests that chronic stress may also contribute to obesity, both through direct mechanisms (causing people to eat more) or indirectly (decreasing sleep and exercise). Sounding the alarm The stress response begins in the brain (see illustration). When someone confronts an oncoming car or other danger, the eyes or ears (or both) send the information to the amygdala, an area of the brain that contributes to emotional processing. The amygdala interprets the images and sounds. When it perceives danger, it instantly sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus. Command center When someone experiences a stressful event, the amygdala, an area of the brain that contributes to emotional processing, sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus. This area of the brain functions like a command center, communicating with the rest of the body through the nervous system so that the person has the energy to fight or flee. The hypothalamus is a bit like a command center. This area of the brain communicates with the rest of the body through the autonomic nervous system, which controls such involuntary body functions as breathing, blood pressure, heartbeat, and the dilation or constriction of key blood vessels and small airways in the lungs called bronchioles. The autonomic nervous system has two components, the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system functions like a gas pedal in a car. It triggers the fight-or-flight response, providing the body with a burst of energy so that it can respond to perceived dangers. The parasympathetic nervous system acts like a brake. It promotes the ""rest and digest"" response that calms the body down after the danger has passed. After the amygdala sends a distress signal, the hypothalamus activates the sympathetic nervous system by sending signals through the autonomic nerves to the adrenal glands. These glands respond by pumping the hormone epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) into the bloodstream. As epinephrine circulates through the body, it brings on a number of physiological changes. The heart beats faster than normal, pushing blood to the muscles, heart, and other vital organs. Pulse rate and blood pressure go up. The person undergoing these changes also starts to breathe more rapidly. Small airways in the lungs open wide. This way, the lungs can take in as much oxygen as possible with each breath. Extra oxygen is sent to the brain, increasing alertness. Sight, hearing, and other senses become sharper. Meanwhile, epinephrine triggers the release of blood sugar (glucose) and fats from temporary storage sites in the body. These nutrients flood into the bloodstream, supplying energy to all parts of the body. All of these changes happen so quickly that people aren't aware of them. In fact, the wiring is so efficient that the amygdala and hypothalamus start this cascade even before the brain's visual centers have had a chance to fully process what is happening. That's why people are able to jump out of the path of an oncoming car even before they think about what they are doing. As the initial surge of epinephrine subsides, the hypothalamus activates the second component of the stress response system — known as the HPA axis. This network consists of the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the adrenal glands. The HPA axis relies on a series of hormonal signals to keep the sympathetic nervous system — the ""gas pedal"" — pressed down. If the brain continues to perceive something as dangerous, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which travels to the pituitary gland, triggering the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This hormone travels to the adrenal glands, prompting them to release cortisol. The body thus stays revved up and on high alert. When the threat passes, cortisol levels fall. The parasympathetic nervous system — the ""brake"" — then dampens the stress response. Techniques to counter chronic stress Many people are unable to find a way to put the brakes on stress. Chronic low-level stress keeps the HPA axis activated, much like a motor that is idling too high for too long. After a while, this has an effect on the body that contributes to the health problems associated with chronic stress. Persistent epinephrine surges can damage blood vessels and arteries, increasing blood pressure and raising risk of heart attacks or strokes. Elevated cortisol levels create physiological changes that help to replenish the body's energy stores that are depleted during the stress response. But they inadvertently contribute to the buildup of fat tissue and to weight gain. For example, cortisol increases appetite, so that people will want to eat more to obtain extra energy. It also increases storage of unused nutrients as fat. Fortunately, people can learn techniques to counter the stress response. Relaxation response. At the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital people learn how to counter the stress response by using a combination of approaches that elicit the relaxation response. These include deep abdominal breathing, focus on a soothing word (such as peace or calm), visualization of tranquil scenes, repetitive prayer, yoga, and tai chi. Most of the early research evaluated how effective the relaxation response is at countering chronic stress in people with hypertension and other forms of cardiovascular disease. Those results suggest the technique may be worth trying — although for most people it is not a cure-all. For example, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 122 patients with hypertension, ages 55 and older, in which half were assigned to relaxation response training and the other half to a control group that received information about blood pressure control. After eight weeks, 34 of the people who practiced the relaxation response — a little more than half — had achieved a systolic blood pressure reduction of more than 5 mm Hg, and were therefore eligible for the next phase of the study, in which they could reduce levels of blood pressure medication they were taking. Physical activity. People can use exercise to stifle the buildup of stress in several ways. Exercise, such as taking a brisk walk shortly after feeling stressed, not only deepens breathing but also helps relieve muscle tension. Movement therapies such as yoga, tai chi, and qi gong combine fluid movements with deep breathing and mental focus, all of which can induce calm. Social support. Confidants, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, relatives, spouses, and companions all provide a life-enhancing social net — and may increase longevity. It's not clear why, but the buffering theory holds that people who enjoy close relationships with family and friends receive emotional support that indirectly helps to sustain them at times of chronic stress and crisis.",7,0.26274592,-0.064906515,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/weighing-the-dangers-of-extra-weight,Weighing the dangers of extra weight,1,"An estimated 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI), a calculation that takes into account both height and weight. Standard definitions consider a healthy BMI as between 18.5 and 24.9, overweight as 25 to 29.9, and obese as 30 and higher. (Calculate your BMI using this online tool.) While far from perfect, BMI offers a simple gauge of whether someone's weight might pose a problem. Studies have found that a BMI higher than 25 increases your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and some types of cancer. But what if you have put on only a little extra weight in recent years — say, five pounds or so — and your BMI doesn't fall into the category of overweight? Is that still cause for concern? ""Any excess weight can pose a health risk and affect one's daily life,"" says Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""When you carry extra pounds, you also are more susceptible to joint pain, low energy, and problems sleeping."" Yet the greatest threat is the potential for gaining even more weight. ""It's easy for five pounds to quickly turn into 10 pounds and then 15 pounds, and as the weight increases, so do the health risks,"" says Dr. Willett. Why do you gain weight? It's common for men to gain some weight with age. Metabolism naturally slows, and lean muscle mass steadily declines, both of which cause the body to burn calories at a slower rate. In addition, most men consume more daily calories than they need."" When you take in extra calories and don't burn them off, they will be stored as fat,"" says Dr. Willett. But where you accumulate that extra fat is the real issue with weight gain. Based on its location, fat can be described as either subcutaneous or visceral. Subcutaneous fat is located just under the skin. Visceral fat lies deep within the abdominal cavity and pads the spaces between your abdominal organs. Of the two, visceral fat is more dangerous, as high amounts are linked with heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and high cholesterol levels. Do you have too much visceral fat? Check your waist size. ""For men, a waist of 40 inches or more is considered a sign of excess visceral fat,"" says Dr. Willett. ""But even a small change in your clothing, like pants that now feel snug or having to change notches in your belt, are signs of increasing visceral fat."" What is your ideal weight? There's no one-size-fits-all number for a person's ideal weight. The number depends on age, genetics, body frame, medical history, and average weight as a young adult. ""Your BMI can offer a clue about whether you need to lose excess weight, but consulting with your doctor can help determine your ideal healthy weight range,"" says Dr. Willett. Still, you should not ignore even small weight changes. ""A little weight gain may seem normal for many men, but that doesn't mean they should accept it and not do anything about it,"" says Dr. Willett. ""It's easier to make modest adjustments now than to wait until you gain a lot more weight."" You can turn back those extra pounds with a combination of aerobic exercise, strength training, and a healthy diet. Experts recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (for example, brisk walking, running, swimming, or cycling) most days of the week, plus at least two weekly weight or resistance training sessions to maintain muscle mass and strength. To avoid putting on more pounds, stick with a diet that prioritizes plant-based foods, like the Mediterranean or DASH diet. Image: © Tetra Images/Getty Images",3,0.28451014,0.08868985,True

Completed in 2016, the LOOK AHEAD trial followed more than 5,000 people for 12 years. It showed that a portion-controlled diet combined with exercise could help people with diabetes lose weight. Over all, however, their risk of heart disease did not decrease. Published in the March 2024 issue of Diabetologia, the new study looked specifically at LOOK AHEAD participants (about 18% of the total) who showed some evidence of diabetes remission, defined as needing no diabetes medications and a close-to-normal blood sugar value at some point in time. Those who achieved remission had a 40% lower rate of cardiovascular disease and a 33% lower rate of chronic kidney disease compared with those who didn't achieved remission. The authors say the benefits likely stemmed from improvement in the participants' weight, fitness, blood sugar, and LDL (bad) cholesterol.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-07-10-covid-vaccines-723x-brain-clots-flu-shots.html,"COVID jabs induce 723x more brain clots than flu shots, shocking study finds",0,"A new pre-print study from Dr. Peter McCullough and several colleagues reveals that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""vaccines"" are far more dangerous than seasonal flu shots when it comes to inducing cerebral thrombotic syndromes, also known as brain clots. The population-based retrospective cohort study, which is not yet peer reviewed, looked at rates of adverse events involving cerebral thromboembolism (CTE) following injection for COVID. It includes data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database, which is managed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), between Jan. 1, 1990, and Dec. 31, 2023. Dr. McCullough and his colleagues compared CTE rates after COVID jabbing to CTE rates after flu shot jabbing, which led them to the discovery that COVID jabs are far riskier than flu shots. In the three years after COVID jabs were unleashed through Operation Warp Speed, there have been 5,137 reported cases of CTE. Comparatively, flu shots over the past 34 years have only caused 52 cases of CTE. Note that over the past 34 years, all vaccines combined have only caused 282 CTEs compared to 5,137 CTE cases caused by COVID injections over the course of just three years. This just goes to show how profoundly dangerous COVID jabs are compared to all other pharmaceutical injections in terms of clotting people's brains.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/update-on-atrial-fibrillation,Update on atrial fibrillation,1,"Atrial fibrillation causes a rapid, chaotic heartbeat that usually comes and goes without warning. Commonly known as afib, it's caused by electrical misfires in the heart's upper chambers (atria). While some people don't notice any symptoms, others feel a fluttering, pounding sensation in their chest and may become lightheaded, dizzy, and breathless during a bout of afib. But the real danger is a heightened risk of serious strokes (see ""Atrial fibrillation and stroke""). An estimated one in 11 people ages 65 and older have afib, which becomes more common with age. ""There are many things you can do to both lower your risk and prevent the progression of afib,"" says Dr. Moussa Mansour, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of the Atrial Fibrillation Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. In fact, lifestyle modifications are now a prominent focus of the latest guidelines for managing afib, he says. Here's a summary of the updated recommendations, published Jan. 2, 2024, in the journal Circulation. Atrial fibrillation and stroke During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (atria) quiver rapidly instead of contracting forcefully. Blood pools along the walls of the left atrium, eventually forming clots that may break free to travel through the left ventricle (lower chamber) to the aorta (the large vessel carrying blood out of the heart). If the clot lodges in an artery to the brain, it may block blood flow and cause an ischemic stroke. Illustration: © Rujirat Boonyong/Getty Images Alcohol and caffeine advice ""The most important advice is about alcohol use, which is one of the first things my patients ask about,"" says Dr. Mansour. Strong evidence from multiple studies shows that drinking alcohol raises the risk of afib. There's no magic number of drinks considered safe or risky, although the guidelines suggest no more than one per day. But it's clear that the less alcohol you drink, the better, he says. People also wonder if they should avoid coffee. In some people, caffeine seems to trigger palpitations — the sensation of a skipped, missed, or strong heartbeat. Still, observational studies haven't shown any increased risk of afib among coffee drinkers. In fact, one found that people who drink one to three cups of coffee daily are less likely to have afib than people who drink lower or higher amounts. ""Caffeine doesn't seem to be something people need to worry about,"" says Dr. Mansour. Weight Excess weight, on the other hand, is an issue for many people. Obesity, which is defined as a body mass index or BMI of 30 or higher, promotes afib on several fronts. First, it can worsen high blood pressure, and second, it makes people more prone to obstructive sleep apnea. ""In addition, clinical studies show that obesity increases fat around the heart,"" says Dr. Mansour. This promotes inflammation of the heart muscle, which may lead to changes in the structure of the atria, spurring the onset and progression of afib, he adds. The guidelines recommend that people strive for a BMI of 27 or lower. Research suggests that even modest weight loss (about 10% of your body weight) can help keep your heart rhythm more stable and is linked to better outcomes following treatment for afib. Exercise Exercise not only supports weight loss, it can also lower afib burden, which refers to both the duration and frequency of afib. The afib guidelines suggest 210 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, which may also help reduce afib symptoms. But Dr. Mansour keeps the advice to his patients simple: ""Aim for three to four hours of exercise every week, at a level of effort that's more than a casual walk, but nothing too crazy,"" he says. However, dedicated exercise buffs who work out far more than the average person can still develop afib. ""If you trained for marathons in your 30s and keep up that level of intensity into your 60s, the recommendation is to do less exercise if you develop afib,"" says Dr. Mansour. But if exercise is a big deal for you and important for your mental health, there's no hard-and-fast rule about dialing back, he says. Sleep Dr. Mansour recommends that anyone with afib who snores should be tested for sleep apnea, a condition marked by brief pauses in breathing that often triggers loud snoring, grunts, and gasps. More than one in five people with afib have sleep apnea, and treating the problem may lessen afib recurrence. Image: © patrickheagney/Getty Images",7,0.26781484,0.114386156,True

The fentanyl crisis in the United States has reached unprecedented levels, posing a severe threat to public health and safety. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is up to 100 times more potent than morphine, has become a leading cause of overdose deaths across the country. Law enforcement agencies are seizing massive quantities of this deadly substance, with recent seizures alone containing enough fentanyl to kill the combined populations of California, Texas, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania. The alarming increase in fentanyl trafficking and consumption highlights the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to combat this epidemic and protect communities nationwide. (Related: In just one month, U.S. authorities confiscate enough fentanyl to kill combined populations of California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas .) In 2023, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized over 80 million fake pills laced with fentanyl and nearly 12,000 pounds of fentanyl powder. This surpassed 2022's total of 58 million pills. These seizures amounted to more than 381 million lethal doses. So far this year, the DEA has already seized nearly 28 million fentanyl pills and over 4,000 pounds of fentanyl powder, amounting to nearly 200 million deadly doses of fentanyl . Here are three states where the most fentanyl has been seized. Utah Following a major bust, the DEA expects Utah to set a record for the number of fentanyl pills seized this year. As reported by Kyle Dunphey for Utah News Dispatch on July 4, the DEA's Rocky Mountain Field Division seized around 170,000 fentanyl pills in Utah within two weeks in June. This is about a quarter of the total pills seized in 2023, which was a record-breaking 664,000 pills . Human knowledge is under attack!

In total, the Rocky Mountain Field Division, which covers Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana, confiscated about 3.4 million fentanyl pills in 2023. According to Jonathan Pullen, the special agent in charge of the division, these seizures indicate the presence of Mexican criminal groups operating in Utah. "" The drug cartels in Mexico are not slowing down their production and distribution of this deadly poison. Fentanyl pills and powder are widespread, and the cartels targeting Utah do not care if you are on summer vacation. We urge you to discuss the dangers of fentanyl with your family, friends and community,"" Pullen said. The investigations into these seizures are ongoing and further details are not currently available. However, a warrant filed in Utah’s Fourth District Court in March mentioned an unnamed drug trafficking group from Sinaloa, Mexico, under investigation since 2016 for its operations in Utah. This investigation has led to the arrest of dozens of group members and the seizure of hundreds of pounds of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and over $2 million in cash and assets. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control show that around 105,000 Americans died from drug overdoses last year , with about 70 percent of those deaths involving fentanyl, according to the DEA. ""The recent seizures of 170,000 fentanyl pills in Utah likely saved lives across the state,"" said Dustin Gillespie, the special agent in charge of the Salt Lake City DEA office. California As of June 27, nearly seven million fentanyl pills and 3,725 pounds of fentanyl powder have been seized in California since January 2024. This massive haul, reported by ABC7 in the Bay Area, includes drugs intercepted at the southern border by the California National Guard's Counterdrug Task Force. In May alone, the task force confiscated over one million fentanyl pills and nearly 1,000 pounds of fentanyl powder. ""The California National Guard's Counterdrug Task Force continues to play an important role in the fight against fentanyl. We are proud to support our local, state, federal, and tribal law enforcement partners with critical resources,"" said Maj. Gen. Matthew Beevers, the California National Guard's adjutant general. Gov. Gavin Newsom has doubled the deployment of CalGuard service members to tackle fentanyl smuggling . The state also launched opioids.ca.gov for opioid prevention and treatment information and to highlight efforts to hold pharmacies and drug traffickers accountable. As part of the fight against the fentanyl crisis, over-the-counter naloxone, branded as CalRx, is becoming available across California.

Colorado On May 20, Lindsey Toomer of Colorado Newsline reported that Colorado set a record for fentanyl pill seizures in 2023 and 2024 is already on track to surpass that. According to a new report from New York University 's Langone Health, Colorado and New Mexico tied for the second-highest number of fentanyl pill seizures in the U.S. in 2023, with 1,353 each. This led to 5.1 million pills being confiscated across Colorado. Most of the fentanyl seized in Colorado in 2023 was in pill form. The DEA's Rocky Mountain Field Division seized a record 2.6 million pills in Colorado alone. This division saw a total of 3.4 million pills seized across all four states in 2023, highlighting Colorado's significant share. For comparison, the division seized 565,200 pills in 2021 and 1.9 million pills in 2022. ""It's an alarming increase. In the first three months of 2024, we were almost at half of last year's total. Unfortunately, it looks like we'll break that record again,"" said David Olesky, the division's acting special agent in charge. Olesky noted that Colorado is seeing seizure numbers similar to those of border states in previous years. What used to be considered a large haul is now becoming more common. For instance, a single seizure in Trinidad earlier this year netted over 300,000 pills, pushing the state past last year's halfway mark of 1.3 million pills by March.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/night-owls-may-face-higher-diabetes-risks,Night owls may face higher diabetes risks,1,"Women who are night owls have a higher risk of developing diabetes and are more likely to practice unhealthful lifestyle habits compared with early birds, a new analysis suggests. In the Harvard-led study, published online Sept. 12, 2023, by Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers tracked nearly 64,000 female nurses ages 45 to 62 over eight years. The women had no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. Participants reported lifestyle behaviors that included diet quality, physical activity, alcohol use, body mass index, smoking, and sleep habits. They also reported whether they were diagnosed with diabetes. Women who fit an ""evening chronotype"" — preferring to stay up and wake up later — were 19% more likely to develop diabetes than those with a ""morning chronotype,"" who prefer to go to bed and wake up earlier. Additionally, night owls were 54% more likely than early birds to report unhealthy lifestyle behaviors such as smoking and poor sleep habits. Earlier research has also suggested that shorter or irregular sleep is linked with a higher risk of diabetes, the study authors noted. They theorized that ""circadian misalignment""—being a night owl, for example, but also working early morning shifts, which is common in nursing—could disrupt the body's ability to properly process sugar.

Steer clear of low-quality carbohydrates and starchy vegetables such as peas, corn, and potatoes, a new Harvard-led study suggests. The study, published online Sept. 27, 2023, by The BMJ, evaluated weight changes in 136,432 adults 65 or younger (average age 50, 83.5% women) who were tracked for up to 28 years. Although participants gained an average of more than three pounds every four years, the quality of carbohydrates they ate appeared to play a role in weight control. A daily increase of 3.5 ounces of low-quality carbohydrates — such as sugar-sweetened drinks, refined grains, and starchy vegetables — was associated with gaining up to three pounds over a four-year period. But an increase of just one-third of an ounce of fiber in participants' daily diets was linked with gaining 1.7 fewer pounds over four years. The associations were especially strong in women and in people with excess body weight. While consuming too much sugar is unhealthy, refined carbohydrates such as white pasta, white bread, white rice, and chips appeared more problematic, contributing even more to middle-age weight gain, study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/toothbrushing-tied-to-lower-pneumonia-rates-in-hospitalized-patients,Toothbrushing tied to lower pneumonia rates in hospitalized patients,1,"Seriously ill hospitalized patients whose teeth are brushed at least twice daily are far less likely to develop pneumonia, the most common hospital-acquired infection, a new analysis suggests. The study, published online Dec. 18, 2023, by JAMA Internal Medicine, reviewed 15 earlier analyses involving a total of nearly 2,800 patients. Fourteen studies were conducted in hospital intensive care units (ICUs), while 13 involved patients on ventilators. Patients whose teeth were brushed twice or more daily were 33% less likely to develop hospital-acquired pneumonia than those without a toothbrushing regimen. Patients whose teeth were brushed also needed ventilators for less time, were able to leave the ICU more quickly, and were less likely to die in the ICU than those without a toothbrushing regimen. Since hospital-acquired pneumonia — which kills more people than any other health care–associated infection — is largely due to inhaling germs from the mouth and throat, toothbrushing may reduce its incidence by eradicating some of those germs, study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/two-workout-strategies-that-reduce-cardiovascular-disease-risk,Two workout strategies that reduce cardiovascular disease risk,1,"Doing regular aerobic exercise — the kind that works your heart and lungs — is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. Now, findings published online Jan. 17, 2024, by the European Heart Journal suggest that doing a combination of aerobics and strength training might reduce cardiovascular risk factors just as effectively. The study involved about 400 people (ages 35 to 70) classified as overweight or obese who also had high blood pressure. They were randomly assigned to one of four exercise programs: a 60-minute aerobic workout three times a week, a 60-minute strength training workout three times a week, a 60-minute combination of aerobics and strength training (30 minutes of each) three times a week, or no exercise at all. After one year, people in both the aerobics-only group and the combination exercise group (but not the strength-training-only group) had a significant reduction in a combined measure of cardiovascular risk factors, compared with people who didn't exercise. These risk factors included blood pressure, LDL (bad) cholesterol, blood sugar, and body fat. People doing the combined workouts also improved their muscle strength. What this means: it might be equally healthful to replace half of your aerobic workout with strength training, without adding additional exercise time.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/is-that-dental-pain-an-emergency,Is that dental pain an emergency?,1,"Agonizing tooth pain, sharp jaw discomfort, a dull ache in your gums — each one is a sign of dental trouble or something even more serious. Unfortunately, many people put off a call to the dentist — a potentially risky move, since dental problems can be more advanced than you realize. ""As we age, we can feel less pain in our teeth because the nerves inside them shrink, and dentin — a porous material beneath tooth enamel — builds up. So something can fester for a long time and turn into a bigger, more complex problem,"" says Dr. Lisa Thompson, a geriatric dentistry specialist at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Here's more on what causes dental pain, how to identify it, and when you should call your dentist or even 911. Tooth pain Tooth pain can stem from several problems. Perhaps the most common is a cavity, a tiny hole in the tooth. Plaque — a sticky mix of food particles and bacteria covering the outer layer of a tooth, the enamel — creates chemicals that break down the enamel. The deeper the cavity, the more likely the nerve in the tooth will be exposed, resulting in sharp pain and sensitivity to hot or cold foods. Those symptoms can also come from a cracked tooth or a cracked or loose filling, which can expose the nerve. Tooth pain might also be due to trauma, such as accidentally biting down on a fork. That can bruise the ligament holding your tooth in the jaw, generating an initially sharp and then dull ache in the tooth. If you experience tooth pressure when you bite down on food, have sinus pressure without nasal congestion, or a have a bad (acidic) taste in your mouth, it could be that a cavity or cracked tooth has led to a painful infection at the root of the tooth, creating a small pocket of pus called an abscess. Gum pain Gum pain tends to be an achy soreness rather than a sharp pain. It has many potential causes. It might be as simple as having sensitive gums, brushing your teeth too vigorously, or having irritation from a bit of food (such as a piece of popcorn) stuck in your teeth or in the space between your gum and teeth. Gum pain can also come from a cut if something poked you (such as a corn chip), irritation from toothpaste that contains sodium laurel sulfate, or canker sores (aphthous ulcers). Pain in the gums can also be due to dentures or partials that don't fit well or aren't cleaned regularly. ""You might see red bumps on the irritated area or have a burning sensation from a fungal infection,"" Dr. Thompson says. Another possibility: plaque buildup at the bottom of teeth is irritating the gums and causing gingivitis, an early stage of gum disease marked by swollen, bleeding gums. Untreated gingivitis can progress below the gum line (becoming periodontal disease). It can destroy the ligament holding the tooth in place as well as the bone, leading to gum pain, abscesses, and tooth loss. Signs of an abscess caused by gum disease include a pimple of pus on the gum or facial swelling. Jaw pain Jaw pain can be sudden and sharp, or a chronic tenderness that gradually increases over time. Dull, chronic jaw pain usually comes from a problem with the temporomandibular joint, where the jaw bone meets the skull on either side of your head. Trouble related to this joint is called a temporomandibular disorder, or TMD. ""You can get TMD from injury such as joint dislocation or from problems related to muscles, stress, arthritis, and even behaviors you aren't even aware of. Maybe you grind your teeth at night, chew gum, or bite on a pen,"" Dr. Thompson says. Be especially vigilant about a pain that suddenly affects your neck and lower jaw. That can be a form of the pain called angina caused by narrowed heart arteries — or it could even be a symptom of a heart attack. Heart-related jaw pain can occur without the more common heart attack symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath. What you should do Sudden neck and lower jaw pain can signal an emergency. Call 911, especially if you have known heart problems. All other tooth, gum, and jaw pain should trigger a call to your dentist — as soon as possible if you suspect a cracked filling or tooth, gum disease, or an abscess. ""Bacteria from the abscess can get into the bloodstream, and can travel to other spaces in your body, such as your brain or heart. It can be life-threatening. If your dentist can't see you immediately, go to an emergency department, although there's not much they can do but give you antibiotics until you can get to a dentist,"" Dr. Thompson says. ""And if you suspect that your diet, behavior, or brushing habits might be causing pain, go ahead and experiment: get a soft toothbrush, use a Waterpik, switch toothpastes. And keep brushing and flossing your teeth every day."" Image: © vitapix/Getty Images",0,0.25685233,-0.08998332,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/green-poop-what-stool-color-can-indicate-about-health,Green poop: What stool color can indicate about health,1,"Question: My poop sometimes turns green. What can cause green poop? What do changes in stool color mean about your health? Answer: Temporary changes in stool color from the usual brown most often do not indicate a serious medical problem. But certain color changes may require medical attention, especially if you have other symptoms. Green poop Intermittent green stool in someone who otherwise feels fine is usually related to eating dark green vegetables, such as spinach and kale. Another reason for green poop is the rapid passage of green bile from the small intestine when a person has diarrhea. Medications, including bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol), iron supplements, and some antibiotics, may also result in greenish colored stool. Very pale brown stool Pale stools can be a sign of liver or gallbladder conditions. If insufficient bile is produced by the liver or there is a blockage of the bile duct, the bile salts that aid digestion can be greatly reduced. Examples of conditions that can lead to pale stools include hepatitis, cirrhosis, and gallstones. People with pale stools due to one of these problems often have jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) and cola-colored urine. Yellow stool Excess fat in poop can give stool a yellow color. An extremely high-fat diet might cause the color change. However, if stool is yellow, greasy, floats in the toilet bowl, and smells bad, that probably means there is a problem with fat absorption. This can occur from liver disease, pancreatitis, a bile or pancreatic duct blockage, or a small intestine condition such as celiac disease. Some infections such as giardiasis can also cause yellowish stool. Red poop Red poop always raises the possibility of blood in the stool. Small amounts of blood in the toilet bowl or on toilet paper are most often from hemorrhoids. Larger amounts of bright red blood should always prompt an immediate call for medical advice. If a person also has lightheadedness, then emergency evaluation is needed. Anyone with persistent or recurrent rectal bleeding, even in minimal amounts, should make an appointment with their doctor. Some red foods such as beets and tomatoes and red food dyes can also cause red poop. Black stool Tarry, foul-smelling black stool can indicate bleeding from the stomach or upper small intestine. Stomach acid and digestive enzymes convert blood from a red color to black. This always requires immediate medical attention. Iron supplements, bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol), and activated charcoal may blacken stool. Blood sausage, blueberries, and black licorice are also possible causes.",1,0.23575503,-0.14162971,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/managing-intrusive-thoughts,Managing intrusive thoughts,1,"It seems to come out of nowhere — a strange, disturbing thought or a troubling image that pops into your mind. It might be violent or sexual, or a recurring fear that you'll do something inappropriate or embarrassing. Whatever the content, it's often unsettling and may bring on feelings of worry or shame. The more you try to push the thought from your mind, the more it persists. Intrusive thoughts, as these are called, are thought to affect some six million Americans, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. Sometimes intrusive thoughts are associated with a mental health disorder, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, where thoughts become so bothersome that they prompt repetitive behaviors or compulsions to try to prevent them from occurring. They are also common in post-traumatic stress disorder, which can be triggered by a life-threatening or extremely stressful event, such as an accident or violent attack. But many people who experience these thoughts don't have a mental health disorder. Intrusive thoughts are often triggered by stress or anxiety. They may also be a short-term problem brought on by biological factors, such as hormone shifts. For example, a woman might experience an uptick in intrusive thoughts after the birth of a child. Any life stressor, if big enough, can increase your risk of having intrusive thoughts. While intrusive thoughts may be disturbing, they aren't harmful or mean that you have a secret desire to do the things that popped into your mind. Identifying intrusive thoughts So, how can you tell if you are experiencing intrusive thoughts? There are some signs to look for. The thought is unusual for you. An intrusive thought is usually very different from your typical thoughts. For example, it might be uncharacteristically violent. The thought is bothersome. If a thought is disturbing and it's something you want to push out of your mind, it might be an intrusive thought. The thought feels hard to control. Intrusive thoughts are often repetitive and won't go away. The more you think about an intrusive thoughts, it might make you more anxious and dwell on them even more. Instead of fighting intrusive thoughts, it's better to learn to live with them. When these thoughts emerge, try taking the following steps: 1. Identify the thought as intrusive. Think to yourself, 'that's just an intrusive thought; it's not how I think, it's not what I believe, and it's not what I want to do. 2. Don't fight with it. When you have an intrusive thought, just accept it. Don't try to make it go away. 3. Don't judge yourself. Know that having a strange or disturbing thought doesn't indicate that something is wrong with you. When to seek help See a mental health professional if unwanted thoughts are starting to disrupt your daily life, particularly if they're impairing your ability to work or to do things you enjoy. However, even if intrusive thoughts aren't affecting your life in a significant way, you can still see someone to get help. Cognitive behavioral therapy is one strategy that is often successful in helping people manage intrusive thoughts. The process may help you to shift some of your general thought patterns, which can enable you to better manage these thoughts when they do occur and might lessen their frequency. Intrusive thoughts can also be managed by addressing the underlying problem, such as anxiety, stress, or a personal history of trauma. While it may be helpful to share the particular thoughts you are having, keep in mind that even if you aren't comfortable talking about them in detail, a therapist can still help. People should also know that intrusive thoughts typically respond well to therapy. Keep in mind that you might not need help forever. It may be a very short-term thing.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/11-foods-that-lower-cholesterol,11 foods that lower cholesterol,1,"Changing what foods you eat can lower your cholesterol and improve the armada of fats floating through your bloodstream. Adding foods that lower LDL, the harmful cholesterol-carrying particle that contributes to artery-clogging atherosclerosis, is the best way to achieve a low cholesterol diet. Add these foods to lower LDL cholesterol Different foods lower cholesterol in various ways. Some deliver soluble fiber, which binds cholesterol and its precursors in the digestive system and drags them out of the body before they get into circulation. Some give you polyunsaturated fats, which directly lower LDL. And some contain plant sterols and stanols, which block the body from absorbing cholesterol. 1. Oats. An easy first step to lowering your cholesterol is having a bowl of oatmeal or cold oat-based cereal like Cheerios for breakfast. It gives you 1 to 2 grams of soluble fiber. Add a banana or some strawberries for another half-gram. Current nutrition guidelines recommend getting 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day, with at least 5 to 10 grams coming from soluble fiber. (The average American gets about half that amount.) 2. Barley and other whole grains. Like oats and oat bran, barley and other whole grains can help lower the risk of heart disease, mainly via the soluble fiber they deliver. 3. Beans. Beans are especially rich in soluble fiber. They also take a while for the body to digest, meaning you feel full for longer after a meal. That's one reason beans are a useful food for folks trying to lose weight. With so many choices — from navy and kidney beans to lentils, garbanzos, black-eyed peas, and beyond — and so many ways to prepare them, beans are a very versatile food. 4. Eggplant and okra. These two low-calorie vegetables are good sources of soluble fiber. 5. Nuts. A bushel of studies shows that eating almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and other nuts is good for the heart. Eating 2 ounces of nuts a day can slightly lower LDL, on the order of 5%. Nuts have additional nutrients that protect the heart in other ways. 6. Vegetable oils. Using liquid vegetable oils such as canola, sunflower, safflower, and others in place of butter, lard, or shortening when cooking or at the table helps lower LDL. 7. Apples, grapes, strawberries, citrus fruits. These fruits are rich in pectin, a type of soluble fiber that lowers LDL. 8. Foods fortified with sterols and stanols. Sterols and stanols extracted from plants gum up the body's ability to absorb cholesterol from food. Companies are adding them to foods ranging from margarine and granola bars to orange juice and chocolate. They're also available as supplements. Getting 2 grams of plant sterols or stanols a day can lower LDL cholesterol by about 10%. 9. Soy. Eating soybeans and foods made from them, like tofu and soy milk, was once touted as a powerful way to lower cholesterol. Analyses show that the effect is more modest — consuming 25 grams of soy protein a day (10 ounces of tofu or 2 1/2 cups of soy milk) can lower LDL by 5% to 6%. 10. Fatty fish. Eating fish two or three times a week can lower LDL in two ways: by replacing meat, which has LDL-boosting saturated fats, and by delivering LDL-lowering omega-3 fats. Omega-3s reduce triglycerides in the bloodstream and also protect the heart by helping prevent the onset of abnormal heart rhythms. 11. Fiber supplements. Supplements offer the least appealing way to get soluble fiber. Two teaspoons a day of psyllium, which is found in Metamucil and other bulk-forming laxatives, provide about 4 grams of soluble fiber. Putting together a low-cholesterol diet When it comes to investing money, experts recommend creating a portfolio of diverse investments instead of putting all your eggs in one basket. The same holds true for eating your way to lower cholesterol. Adding several foods to lower cholesterol in different ways should work better than focusing on one or two. A largely vegetarian ""dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods"" substantially lowers LDL, triglycerides, and blood pressure. The key dietary components are plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains instead of highly refined ones, and protein mostly from plants. Add margarine enriched with plant sterols; oats, barley, psyllium, okra, and eggplant, all rich in soluble fiber; soy protein; and whole almonds. Of course, shifting to a cholesterol-lowering diet takes more attention than popping a daily statin. It means expanding the variety of foods you usually put in your shopping cart and getting used to new textures and flavors. But it's a ""natural"" way to lower cholesterol, and it avoids the risk of muscle problems and other side effects that plague some people who take statins. Just as important, a diet that is heavy on fruits, vegetables, beans, and nuts is good for the body in ways beyond lowering cholesterol. It keeps blood pressure in check. It helps arteries stay flexible and responsive. It's good for bones and digestive health, for vision and mental health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/foods-that-fight-inflammation,Foods that fight inflammation,1,"What does an anti-inflammatory diet do? Your immune system becomes activated when your body recognizes anything that is foreign—such as an invading microbe, plant pollen, or chemical. This often triggers a process called inflammation. Intermittent bouts of inflammation directed at truly threatening invaders protect your health. However, sometimes inflammation persists, day in and day out, even when you are not threatened by a foreign invader. That's when inflammation can become your enemy. Many major diseases that plague us — including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, depression, and Alzheimer's — have been linked to chronic inflammation. One of the most powerful tools to combat inflammation comes not from the pharmacy, but from the grocery store. ""Many experimental studies have shown that components of foods or beverages may have anti-inflammatory effects,"" says Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. Choose the right anti-inflammatory foods, and you may be able to reduce your risk of illness. Consistently pick the wrong ones, and you could accelerate the inflammatory disease process. Foods that cause inflammation Try to avoid or limit these foods as much as possible: refined carbohydrates, such as white bread and pastries French fries and other fried foods soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages red meat (burgers, steaks) and processed meat (hot dogs, sausage) margarine, shortening, and lard The health risks of inflammatory foods Not surprisingly, the same foods on an inflammation diet are generally considered bad for our health, including sodas and refined carbohydrates, as well as red meat and processed meats. ""Some of the foods that have been associated with an increased risk for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease are also associated with excess inflammation,"" Dr. Hu says. ""It's not surprising, since inflammation is an important underlying mechanism for the development of these diseases."" Unhealthy foods also contribute to weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for inflammation. Yet in several studies, even after researchers took obesity into account, the link between foods and inflammation remained, which suggests weight gain isn't the sole driver. ""Some of the food components or ingredients may have independent effects on inflammation over and above increased caloric intake,"" Dr. Hu says. Anti-inflammatory foods An anti-inflammatory diet should include these foods: tomatoes olive oil green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, kale, and collards nuts like almonds and walnuts fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines fruits such as strawberries, blueberries, cherries, and oranges Benefits of anti-inflammatory foods On the flip side are beverages and foods that reduce inflammation, and with it, chronic disease, says Dr. Hu. He notes in particular fruits and vegetables such as blueberries, apples, and leafy greens that are high in natural antioxidants and polyphenols — protective compounds found in plants. Studies have also associated nuts with reduced markers of inflammation and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Coffee, which contains polyphenols and other anti-inflammatory compounds, may protect against inflammation, as well. Anti-inflammatory diet To reduce levels of inflammation, aim for an overall healthy diet. If you're looking for an eating plan that closely follows the tenets of anti-inflammatory eating, consider the Mediterranean diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils. In addition to lowering inflammation, a more natural, less processed diet can have noticeable effects on your physical and emotional health. ""A healthy diet is beneficial not only for reducing the risk of chronic diseases, but also for improving mood and overall quality of life,"" Dr. Hu says.",3,0.31456587,0.22295906,False

In May 2022, Enoch Burke, a history and German language teacher at the Church of Ireland-operated Wilson's Hospital School in Multyfarnham, County Westmeath, faced controversy for his noncompliance with the school principal’s order to use a preferred feminine name and pronouns for a student who was transitioning to female. This refusal set off a chain of events leading to his imprisonment. (Related: AP abandons facts, demands all media outlets play along with transgender pronoun insanity .) First, Burke was placed on paid administrative leave in August 2022 while the school board conducted a disciplinary process. However, he continued to come to the school despite being ordered to stay away, which led to his arrest for contempt of court on Sept. 5, 2022. As a result, Burke was sentenced to jail until he either pleaded his contempt of court or the court decided otherwise. After 108 days, the High Court in Dublin ordered Burke's release, with the judge arguing that Burke was using his imprisonment for his ends. In January 2023, the school dismissed Burke, but he continued to present himself at the school, incurring a daily fine of 700 euros ($756), which led to his re-imprisonment in September 2023 in Mountjoy Prison in Dublin. After spending more than 400 days in Mountjoy Prison, Justice Mark Sanfey of the High Court ordered Burke's release on June 28 due to the summer recess of Irish schools. Sanfey warned that Burke could return to jail if he violated the conditions of his release, which include a ban on returning to Wilson's Hospital School.

Burke and his fellow Christians defend their religious beliefs against transgender movement The case has become a contentious issue in Ireland as transgender ideology gains more prominence in society, especially with the ongoing tension between the country's highly religious society and the demands of government institutions to comply with transgenderism. Some argue that Burke's jail term results from his persistent refusal to accept his dismissal by the school and that he could be released if he agreed not to return to the school. However, others view Burke as a public champion opposing the increasing acceptance of transgender ideology in Ireland. ""Enoch Burke has defeated the Irish woke Establishment . He has been released from Mountjoy Prison without having to purge his so-called 'contempt.' Enoch Burke has been unjustly imprisoned for over 400 days for refusing to call a boy a 'girl.' Enoch Burke is a Christian hero,"" Nick Donnelly, a vocations and formation director for the permanent diaconate, posted on X . ""All Irishmen, but especially Irish Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, should have joined in opposition to his persecution. He kept the faith,"" one X user replied to Donnelly.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/spring-cleaning-prioritize-your-fridge-and-pantry,Spring cleaning? Prioritize your fridge and pantry,1,"With spring's arrival, maybe you're planning to attack those dusty baseboards, smeared windows, and cluttered closets. But if you've been neglecting your refrigerator and pantry, these hard-working storage areas should take priority — and they need far more than annual cleaning to help you avoid food-borne illnesses, Harvard experts say. It's not a minor threat. Each year, an estimated one in six Americans — 48 million people — get sick from germs in food, according to the CDC. About 128,000 of them are hospitalized and 3,000 die as a result of food-borne illness. Spring cleaning offers an opportunity not only to thoroughly scour your home, but also to give your fridge and pantry — which can harbor harmful bacteria — more than just a cursory swipe of a sponge. In the process, you can purge dated and possibly contaminated products from overlooked corners. Think of it this way: these chambers don't just house your food; they also protect it—and you, by extension. ""It's tough to compare this to spring cleaning, because certainly I'd recommend cleaning out your refrigerator and pantry way more than once a year,"" says Cynthia Parenteau, associate director of public health in the Department of Environmental Health and Safety at Harvard University, who specializes in food safety. ""Personally, I do it once a week. Every time new groceries go in, I make sure anything that's expired goes out, and I move older food to the front."" Dangerous complications Food-borne illnesses result from microbes or toxins that contaminate foods or drinks. More than 30 pathogens (disease-causing agents), including Salmonella, norovirus, Listeria, Escherichia coli, and bacteria that cause botulism, are known to travel in food. Raw or undercooked poultry or meat, raw eggs, unpasteurized milk or dairy products, raw fruits and vegetables, and foods prepared in large batches kept at unsafe temperatures are vehicles for these pathogens. Some lucky folks manage to skirt the consequences of eating germ-laden foods, while others develop food poisoning and suffer through symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, intense stomach cramps, and fever. ""The majority of us eventually get a food-borne illness,"" says Parenteau's colleague Marykate Franks, a senior environmental public health officer. ""Most people associate it with the last thing they ate, though that may not be the case. If we're lucky, we feel crummy for a day or two, rebound, and write it off."" While food poisoning symptoms often resolve without problem, infections spread by food can have lasting, dangerous consequences. They sometimes lead to conditions such as arthritis, meningitis, kidney damage, or brain and nerve damage. (See ""When should you see a doctor for food poisoning?"") Parenteau notes that certain people — including pregnant women, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems — are susceptible to worse cases and more serious outcomes. Cleaning strategies How can you better protect yourself? Parenteau and Franks recommend these tips to tackle your refrigerator and pantry: Take everything out. Approach your food clean-out with the same commitment as you would a closet purge. Completely emptying your fridge and pantry allows you to appraise each item for safety as well as inspect the inside of each space. ""Even with something as simple as cleaning out your pantry, you'll find a wayward cheese puff at the back or a pile of cracker crumbs,"" Franks says. ""You also have to be alert for mice or flour weevils that might be really intrigued by what you have in your cabinets."" Wash everything thoroughly. Pull out all shelving and clean every surface with food-safe sanitizer spray. (For a homemade version, Harvard experts suggest blending one tablespoon of unscented liquid chlorine bleach with a gallon of water.) Pay particular attention to any spills or dried, sticky areas. Make sure surfaces are dry before putting anything back. Check expiration dates. Toss all expired food or drink items, as well as those whose containers are rusted or leaking. If you don't know the expiration date, a rule of thumb suggests keeping opened refrigerated items for seven days or less. ""This is a good opportunity to go through your refrigerator and pull out all the Tupperware and leftover restaurant containers and make way for new stuff,"" Parenteau says. Use your senses. Expiration dates differ from sell-by or best-used-by dates, which only suggest freshness. This is often applicable to items such as condiments and salad dressings. If those dates have only recently passed, check the product's appearance and smell for signs of decay. ""If something doesn't quite smell right or the color of the food is off, trust your instincts,"" Franks says. ""Better safe than sorry."" Pay attention to packaging. Generally, unopened or vacuum-packed foods will stay fresher longer. But once they're opened, the clock starts. ""The date to use a product by becomes pretty confusing when you see a freshness date a month or two down the road but you've already opened it,"" Parenteau says. She advises using a marker to note on the package the date you unsealed it. Then keep it for only another seven days — especially packaged deli meats or hot dogs. Avoid cross-contamination. Keep raw meat, seafood, and eggs separate from ready-made foods so germs don't spread. Store these items in sealed containers so juices don't leak onto other foods. And if your refrigerator features dedicated meat and produce drawers, use them only for those items. ""You don't want juices that leak from chicken or beef packages getting on produce or food items that are not going to be cooked,"" Parenteau says. When should you see a doctor for food poisoning? In most cases, food poisoning symptoms are mild enough to ride out without medical attention. But certain symptoms should prompt a doctor's evaluation, according to the CDC. These include bloody diarrhea or diarrhea lasting longer than three days fever over 102° F vomiting so frequently you can't hold liquids down signs of dehydration, such as dry mouth and throat, scant urination, and dizziness upon standing. Don't forget your freezer. Since the whole purpose of freezing food is to keep it from spoiling, the freezer doesn't need as much attention as the refrigerator. But take a look at its contents every few weeks and weed items out. ""Everyone is guilty of sticking something in the back of the freezer, saving it for a rainy day, and forgetting about it,"" Franks says. ""It's good to pull that stuff out to check if it expired and assess if it's worth keeping."" Image: © fcafotodigital/Getty Images",4,-0.058382053,-0.00067436695,True

Researchers combined the results of 15 randomized clinical trials that included about 2,800 ICU patients and found that twice-a-day toothbrushing was associated with lower rates of death compared with not regularly brushing. Patients who had their teeth brushed daily also had shorter ICU stays and spent less time on a mechanical ventilator. (Since ICU patients are often unable to brush on their own, toothbrushing was done by the hospital care team.) The reason? Regular toothbrushing appears to protect ICU patients from getting pneumonia, the most common ICU-acquired infection, according to the researchers. While the trials did not focus on non-ICU patients, the researchers added that regular toothbrushing might offer similar protection from pneumonia during regular hospital stays, but more research is needed.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/fighting-fatigue,Fighting fatigue,1,"Here are some tips to help you get your energy back. If you have felt like you are dragging lately, you may be wondering what is going on. Fatigue is a common symptom that can be caused by a whole host of factors, from medical conditions and stress to poor sleep. The good news is that in many cases you can make changes that will help bring your energy back, but you need to get to the root of the problem in order to treat it. Fatigue triggers Part of the challenge when it comes to a general symptom like fatigue is that it's so commonplace and can be triggered by so many different things. This makes it hard to pinpoint what's causing the problem. However, there are a few main culprits that often cause fatigue. Stress. Some people have reported feeling increasingly fatigued these days. This might be the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic — or more specifically, of the stress it has caused. Changing responsibilities, added work, struggles with child care, financial pressures, and reduced social opportunities are just some of the stressors people now face. And chronic stress can lead to fatigue. When you are under stress, it can cause levels of a hormone called cortisol to rise, which can trigger problems sleeping as well as feelings of anxiety and other symptoms. Hormonal changes. In women, hormonal changes can contribute to shifts in metabolism and sleep disturbances, which lead to fatigue. A decline in female hormones, such as estrogen, during the menopause transition may induce hot flashes, which can lead to broken sleep. Hot flashes are brief episodes during which your body feels like it's overheating. They can last for a few seconds or minutes. During a hot flash, your skin may flush, and you may start to sweat. If these occur at night, they can make it hard to sleep soundly and leave you dragging the next day. Problems associated with the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of your neck that regulates your metabolism, may also cause fatigue. When the thyroid gland is underactive and produces inadequate levels of thyroid hormone (a condition called hypothyroidism), it can make you feel tired, in addition to other symptoms. Women are more likely than men to have thyroid disease, and incidence rises with age. Your diet. If you are not eating a well-balanced diet, it may result in vitamin deficiencies that can sap your energy. Two of the more common ones are vitamin D and vitamin B12 deficiencies. Fatigue is also sometimes brought on by dehydration. Poor sleep habits or sleep disorders. Perhaps the most obvious reason you might be feeling tired is that you are not getting adequate sleep. Sometimes this results from bad sleep habits. Staying up late at night, too much screen time — those habits can definitely affect people's energy level. People who have work schedules that require staying up all night may also have difficulty getting a consistent block of time to achieve restful, deep sleep. But inadequate sleep can also be caused by insomnia or poor sleep quality triggered by stress, or sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea. If you have obstructive sleep apnea, tissues in your throat relax during sleep, periodically blocking your airway, causing breathing interruptions that disrupt sleep. Medical conditions and medications. Fatigue may be the predominant symptom in people with depression. Numerous medical conditions, including infections, anemia, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, neurological conditions, and autoimmune conditions also cause fatigue. Certain medications can also make people feel tired or drowsy. Overcoming fatigue If you are experiencing fatigue that lasts for more than a day or two, try to determine what is causing you to feel so tired and then test different solutions to see if they help. Make lifestyle changes. If you suspect that lifestyle factors, such as poor sleep or eating habits, are causing your fatigue, work on improving your diet and focusing on following good sleep practices at night. (See ""How to get a better night's sleep."") Fatigue may also be brought on by a sedentary lifestyle, so it is important to make sure you are getting enough physical activity. While it can be a challenge to get moving if you are tired all the time, exercise can help you feel better if you give it a chance. As with any type of behavioral change, recognize that it may feel too difficult. Try to break things down into small, achievable goals. For example, you might start by doing two minutes of exercise a day, and then after a few days increase it to five minutes, and then 10 minutes, she says. Getting more physical activity into your day can also help you sleep more soundly at night. Check your medications. Fatigue may be caused by certain medications. If you are taking a new medication and suddenly experience fatigue, reach out to your doctor. Promote calm. If anxiety or stress is triggering your symptoms, paying attention to your mental health should be a priority. Cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness meditation practice, and stress reduction strategies can help. How to get a better night's sleep If you are experiencing sleep disturbances, improving your sleep habits may help. Strategies to try include the following: Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. Avoid electronic devices at least two hours before bed, because the light from these devices may disturb your body's natural sleep clock. Sleep in a quiet, dark, cool space. Avoid caffeine late in the day. Get regular exercise. Avoid alcohol before bed. Alcohol may help you fall asleep faster, but it generally results in more fragmented sleep, and sleep quality in people who are alcohol users tends to be worse. However, if these strategies do not help, and the sleep problems you are experiencing are frequent and affect your daily life, it is time to visit your health care professional. Seeing your doctor However, not all causes of fatigue are treatable on your own. You may need to pay a visit to your primary care provider. Warning signs for fatigue include severe or persistent symptoms or when it interferes with your ability to function. If this is the case, it may be time to make an appointment to get checked out. Your clinician will want information about your diet, physical activity, sleep habits, stress level, and mood. He or she will do a physical exam and likely order blood tests to rule out anemia or a thyroid disorder. If your fatigue is being caused by an underlying medical condition, treating it can often help you get your energy back. Image: © ljubaphoto/Getty Images",5,0.24478753,-0.08919602,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/one-more-reason-to-brush-your-teeth-202402263019,One more reason to brush your teeth?,1,"Maybe we should add toothbrushes to the bouquet of flowers we bring to friends and family members in the hospital — and make sure to pack one if we wind up there ourselves. New Harvard-led research published online in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests seriously ill hospitalized patients are far less likely to develop hospital-acquired pneumonia if their teeth are brushed twice daily. They also need ventilators for less time, are able to leave the intensive care unit (ICU) more quickly, and are less likely to die in the ICU than patients without a similar toothbrushing regimen. Why would toothbrushing make any difference? ""It makes sense that toothbrushing removes the bacteria that can lead to so many bad outcomes,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, an instructor in oral health policy and epidemiology at Harvard School of Dental Medicine, who wasn't involved in the new research. ""Plaque on teeth is so sticky that rinsing alone can't effectively dislodge the bacteria. Only toothbrushing can."" Pneumonia consistently falls among the leading infections patients develop while hospitalized. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, each year more than 633,000 Americans who go to the hospital for other health issues wind up getting pneumonia. Air sacs (alveoli) in one or both lungs fill with fluid or pus, causing coughing, fever, chills, and trouble breathing. Nearly 8% of those who develop hospital-acquired pneumonia die from it. How was the study done? The researchers reviewed 15 randomized trials encompassing nearly 2,800 patients. All of the studies compared outcomes among seriously ill hospitalized patients who had daily toothbrushing to those who did not. 14 of the studies were conducted in ICUs 13 involved patients who needed to be on a ventilator 11 used an antiseptic rinse called chlorhexidine gluconate for all patients: those who underwent toothbrushing and those who didn't. What were the findings? The findings were compelling and should spur efforts to standardize twice-daily toothbrushing for all hospitalized patients, Dr. Jiang says. Study participants who were randomly assigned to receive twice-daily toothbrushing were 33% less likely to develop hospital-acquired pneumonia. Those effects were magnified for people on ventilators, who needed this invasive breathing assistance for less time if their teeth were brushed. Overall, study participants were 19% less likely to die in the ICU — and able to graduate from intensive care faster — with the twice-daily oral regimen. How long patients stayed in the hospital or whether they were treated with antibiotics while there didn't seem to influence pneumonia rates. Also, toothbrushing three or more times daily didn't translate into additional benefits over brushing twice a day. What were the study's strengths and limitations? One major strength was compiling years of smaller studies into one larger analysis — something particularly unusual in dentistry, Dr. Jiang says. ""From a dental point of view, having 15 randomized controlled trials is huge. It's very hard to amass that big of a population in dentistry at this high a level of evidence,"" she says. But toothbrushing techniques may have varied among hospitals participating in the research. And while the study was randomized, it couldn't be blinded — a tactic that would reduce the chance of skewed results. Because there was no way to conceal toothbrushing regimens, clinicians involved in the study likely knew their efforts were being tracked, which may have changed their behavior. ""Perhaps they were more vigilant because of it,"" Dr. Jiang says. How exactly can toothbrushing prevent hospital-acquired pneumonia? It's not complicated. Pneumonia in hospitalized patients often stems from breathing germs into the mouth — germs which number more than 700 different species, including bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microbes. This prospect looms larger for ventilated patients, since the breathing tube inserted into the throat can carry bacteria farther down the airway. ""Ventilated patients lose the normal way of removing some of this bacteria,"" Dr. Jiang says. ""Without that ventilator, we can sweep it out of our upper airways."" How much does toothbrushing matter if you're not hospitalized? In case you think the study findings only pertain to people in the hospital, think again. Rather, this drives home how vital it is for everyone to take care of their teeth and gums. About 300 diseases and conditions are linked in some way to oral health. Poor oral health triggers some health problems and worsens others. People with gum disease and tooth loss, for example, have higher rates of heart attacks. And those with uncontrolled gum disease typically have more difficulty controlling blood sugar levels.",4,-0.048131716,0.10786785,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-alkaline-water-better,Is alkaline water better?,1,"Question: Is alkaline water better for you than plain water? Answer: The simple answer is no. There is not any evidence to support choosing bottled or home-treated alkaline water over safe tap water or regular bottled water. To better understand what is meant by alkaline water, let's start with a review of pH. This is a measure of the acid-base balance of a fluid. The range of pH is zero to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral. A pH above 7 means the fluid is alkaline (basic) and a pH below 7 is acidic. The higher the pH number the more alkaline it is, and the lower the number the greater the acidity. For reference, the normal pH of our blood is slightly alkaline, with a range of 7.35 to 7.45. The fluid in the human stomach is very acidic, with a usual pH of 1.5 to 3.5. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that town water pH should range between 6.5 and 8.5, with most town water averaging around 7.5. Common bottled waters are usually close to neutral at a pH of 7.0. Bottled alkaline water has a higher pH between 8 and 9. Because the fluid in the stomach is so acidic, once regular or alkaline water gets down to your stomach there will be little difference in the resulting stomach fluid pH. You could potentially raise the stomach fluid pH by drinking a lot of alkaline water, but it would only be temporary. Even if you drank enough alkaline water to slightly raise the pH of your blood, your kidneys would quickly go into action to rebalance your blood pH. One potential benefit of alkaline water is to provide symptom relief of heartburn from acid reflux. But again, this would only be temporary. There are much more effective options, such as antacids and drugs that block stomach acid production. There are possible disadvantages from drinking alkaline water with pH levels above 9. The water will likely have a bitter taste. And for people who regularly take stomach acid production blockers called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to maintain a higher stomach pH, drinking strong alkaline water could be dangerous. Adding alkaline water could raise that pH even more and might result in an increased blood pH, which can alter the normal blood levels of chemicals like potassium, especially if they have kidney disease.",3,0.19747761,-0.108025216,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-sleeping-with-an-eye-mask-improve-learning-and-alertness-202402213017,Does sleeping with an eye mask improve learning and alertness?,1,"All of us have an internal clock that regulates our circadian rhythms, including when we sleep and when we are awake. And light is the single most important factor that helps establish when we should feel wakeful (generally during the day) and when we should feel sleepy (typically at night). So, let me ask you a personal question: just how dark is your bedroom? To find out why that matters — and whether sleeping in an eye mask is worthwhile — read on. How is light related to sleep? Our circadian system evolved well before the advent of artificial light. As anyone who has been to Times Square can confirm, just a few watts of power can trick the brain into believing that it is daytime at any time of night. So, what's keeping your bedroom alight? A tablet used in bed at night to watch a movie is more than 100 times brighter than being outside when there is a full moon. Working on or watching a computer screen at night is about 10 times brighter than standing in a well-lit parking lot. Light exposure at night affects the natural processes that help prepare the body for sleep. Specifically, your pineal gland produces melatonin in response to darkness. This hormone is integral for the circadian regulation of sleep. What happens when we are exposed to light at night? Being exposed to light at night suppresses melatonin production, changing our sleep patterns. Compared to sleeping without a night light, adults who slept next to a night light had shallower sleep and more frequent arousals. Even outdoor artificial light at night, such as street lamps, has been linked with getting less sleep. But the impact of light at night is not limited to just sleep. It's also associated with increased risk of developing depressive symptoms, obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Light exposure misaligned with our circadian rhythms — that is, dark during the day and light at night — is one reason scientists believe that shift work puts people at higher risk for serious health problems. Could sleeping with an eye mask help? Researchers from Cardiff University in the United Kingdom conducted a series of experiments to see if wearing an eye mask while sleeping at night could improve certain measures of learning and alertness. Roughly 90 healthy young adults, 18 to 35 years of age, alternated between sleeping while wearing an eye mask or being exposed to light at night. They recorded their sleep patterns in a sleep diary. In the first part of the study, participants wore an intact eye mask for a week. Then during the next week, they wore an eye mask with a hole exposing each eye so that the mask didn't block the light. After sleeping with no light exposure (wearing the intact eye mask) and with minimal light exposure (the eye mask with the holes), participants completed three cognitive tasks on days six and seven of each week: First was a paired-associate learning task. This helps show how effectively a person can learn new associations. Here the task was learning related word pairs. Participants performed better after wearing an intact eye mask during sleep in the days leading up to the test than after being exposed to light at night. Second, the researchers administered a psychomotor vigilance test, which assesses alertness. Blocking light at night also improved reaction times on this task. Finally, a motor skill learning test was given, which involved tapping a five-digit sequence in the correct order. For this task, there was no difference in performance whether participants had worn an intact eye mask or been exposed to light at night. What else did the researchers learn? No research study is ever perfect, so it is important to take the conclusions above with a grain of salt. According to sleep diary data, there was no difference in the amount of sleep, nor in their perceptions of sleep quality, regardless of whether people wore an eye mask or not. Further, in a second experiment with about 30 participants, the researchers tracked sleep objectively using a monitoring device called the Dreem headband. They found no changes to the structure of sleep — for example, how much time participants spent in REM sleep — when wearing an eye mask. Should I rush out to buy an eye mask before an important meeting or exam? If you decide to try using an eye mask, you probably don't need to pay extra for overnight shipping. Instead, follow a chronobiologist's rule of thumb: ""bright days, dark nights."" During the daytime, get as much natural daylight as you possibly can: go out to pick up your morning bagel from a local bakery, take a short walk during your afternoon lull at work. In the evening, reduce your exposure to electronic devices such as your cell phone, and use the night-dimming modes on these devices. Make sure that you turn off all unnecessary lights. Finally, try to make your bedroom as dark as possible when you go to bed. This could mean turning the alarm clock next to your bed away from you or covering up the light on a humidifier.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/chia-seed-benefits-what-you-need-to-know,Chia seed benefits: What you need to know,1,"Packed with fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants, tiny chia seeds pack a nutritional punch. From adding them to prepared dishes or as a topping on oatmeal, cereals, or smoothies, you can easily incorporate chia seeds into many foods to give them a nutritious boost. What are chia seeds? Chia seeds are tiny black or white seeds derived from the Salvia hispanica plant, a member of the mint family native to Central America. These small seeds have been a part of human diets for over 5,000 years. Chia seeds were a staple food for the Aztecs and Mayans. Health benefits of chia seeds Chia seeds are packed with nutrients that may support numerous health benefits. Among them: reducing blood pressure lowering cholesterol levels supporting digestive health aiding in weight management reducing inflammation helping to control diabetes protecting against chronic disease improving anxiety and depression. When chia seeds are ingested, they form a gel-like substance in the stomach that can increase your feeling of fullness and decrease your appetite and calorie intake. Chia seeds: Nutritional heavyweights Chia seeds contain a variety of nutrients including fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and various vitamins and minerals like calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus that are beneficial to your health. Omega-3 fatty acids Chia seeds are a powerhouse of omega-3 fatty acids. This type of fatty acid is primarily found in fatty fish, nuts, and seeds. Omega-3 fatty acids play an important role in brain function, heart health, and reducing inflammation in the body. Incorporating omega-3s into the diet promotes overall well-being, benefiting cardiovascular and cognitive functions. Chia seeds are rich in a type of omega-3 fatty acid known as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). The body cannot produce ALA its own, so it must be obtained through food. Consuming ALA has been linked to a decreased heart disease risk. Fiber Incorporating chia seeds into your diet is also an excellent way to increase your intake of fiber. Just one ounce of chia seeds (two to three tablespoons) provides approximately 9.8 grams of dietary fiber. Research has shown that adequate fiber intake is associated with a decreased risk of: coronary heart disease type 2 diabetes several types of cancer inflammation digestive disorders. On the heart health front, fiber helps lower LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and helps increase levels of heart-protective HDL cholesterol. The fiber in chia seeds can also aid healthy digestion by softening the stool and providing bulk to it. This allows the stool to pass more quickly through the intestines and can help alleviate constipation. Antioxidants Chia seeds are packed with antioxidants including tocopherols, phytosterols, carotenoids, and polyphenolic compounds. Antioxidants play a crucial role in protecting the body from damage caused by free radicals, which can build up in the body and lead to cell damage and disease. Thanks in part to their antioxidant content, chia seeds may help protect against: inflammation diabetes cancer heart disease Alzheimer's disease. Protein Chia seeds are also a valuable source of protein. Chia seeds contain all nine essential amino acids. The protein in chia seeds can help stabilize blood sugar levels and provide a steady source of energy. How to incorporate chia seeds into your diet It's very easy to incorporate chia seeds into your diet. You can simply sprinkle a tablespoon or two on foods such as yogurt, cereal, or salads. You can add chia seeds to smoothies or soups, or mix them into pancake batter or another breakfast food. Chia seeds have a mild flavor, so they are not likely to affect the taste of your food. Another popular way to get chia seeds into your diet is to make a simple chia pudding. When mixed with liquid, chia seeds develop a gelatinous coating, expanding in size and creating a pudding-like consistency. Chia pudding recipe Add 2 tablespoons of chia seeds into 1/2 cup of milk (almond, soy, and dairy all work). Use a mason jar or other container with a lid. Close the lid tightly and shake well. Wait 10 minutes, then shake again, making sure there aren't any clumps. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes, though overnight or for least four hours will allow the pudding to thicken better. Add berries, nuts, cinnamon, and a touch of sweetener.",3,0.36819464,0.017826498,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/fighting-inflammation-with-food,Fighting inflammation with food,1,"In the fight against chronic inflammation — a state of persistent activation of the immune system — your diet is a powerful weapon. Eating healthy foods helps quiet chronic inflammation, and it benefits your health in other ways (like lowering cholesterol levels). Chronic inflammation often is seen with, and may contribute to, chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline. Where do you find inflammation-fighting foods? They're all part of a Mediterranean-style diet, which consists of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, lean proteins, and small amounts of dairy foods and olive oil. ""Plant-based foods provide us with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals—plant chemicals that appear to fight free radicals [molecules that damage cells] and may protect our cells against inflammation, cancer growth, and viruses,"" says Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Fish, nuts, and plant oils contain healthy unsaturated fats, which are good for your blood vessels, heart, and brain."" Here are some foods that support the quest to keep inflammation in check. Berries Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries may just seem like sweet treats. But berries are also hardworking inflammation fighters. Berries contain phytochemicals called anthocyanins, which give the fruits their red and purple hues. Anthocyanins have an anti-inflammatory effect on cells and are associated with lower risks of heart disease, cognitive decline, and diabetes. Fatty fish Fatty fish — such as salmon, tuna, and sardines — are abundant sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. That benefit might be due to reduced inflammation in the body, especially in the blood vessels (protecting them against the buildup of plaque). Some evidence has found that eating fatty fish is associated with lower levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker in the blood. Leafy greens Green leafy vegetables — such as arugula, chard, kale, and spinach — are loaded with vitamins A, B, C, E, and K, as well as important minerals (iron, magnesium, and potassium) and phytochemicals. Spinach is associated with a reduction in inflammation levels over time, slowed cognitive decline, and reduced risks for coronary artery disease and stroke. Nuts and seeds Tiny but mighty, nuts and seeds (such as pistachios, almonds, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds) are rich in fiber and other nutrients that help keep your gut bacteria healthy and in turn may help tamp down brain inflammation (see ""Shield your memory from decline""). Certain nuts and seeds — such as walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and hemp seeds — are also good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Tomatoes Tomatoes get their superpowers from a phytochemical called lycopene. It not only gives tomatoes their vibrant red color, but also appears to help reduce levels of interleukin-6, a protein that causes inflammation. Tomatoes are also associated with reduced risks for developing heart disease and prostate cancer. What to eat To get enough foods that fight inflammation, eat at least two servings of fatty fish per week and at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day (two fruits, three vegetables). It's okay to enjoy a handful of nuts or seeds each day. And you'll want to bulk up on fiber sources, such as legumes like beans and lentils (women older than 50 need 21 grams of fiber per day; men need 30 grams per day). ""For the most impact, get the widest variety of plant-based foods possible in each meal. For example, make a big green salad with several kinds of greens and colorful vegetables, seeds, berries, and a simple dressing of a little olive oil and vinegar,"" McManus suggests. ""Or cook whole grains such as quinoa or brown rice, and stir in the greens of your choice, beans, and colorful vegetables like carrots, squash, and tomatoes."" It's easiest to toss extra plant foods into a meal when you have them on hand. ""If produce seems to spoil faster than you can use it, keep it in your freezer, divided into small amounts. That way, you can reach for fruits and vegetables when you need them,"" says McManus. And as much as possible, avoid eating processed foods. They typically contain high amounts of calories, added sugars, unhealthy saturated fats, and salt, and are associated with chronic inflammation.

Generations of people have been poisoned through the water supply without their consent. This toxic byproduct – hexafluorosilicic acid – has been dripped into most municipal water supplies for decades. The institutions that thought they knew what was best for everyone’s dental health have instead dumbed down entire generations of people, harming their IQ and cognitive development. This widespread dumbing down of human populations helps explain the lack of critical thinking skills in the 21st century. None of these serious matters of public health seem important to institutions like the American Dental Association, however. In fact, the ADA immediately issued a statement, doubling down and defending water fluoridation. Some institutions, like the American Dental Association, are pushing back against the science and dismissing this federal court ruling, demanding that fluoride be considered safe for everyone, against all available evidence. The ADA, representing some 159,000 dentists across the country, posits itself as “the premier source of oral health information.” The ADA claims that they have “promoted the art and science of dentistry since 1859” while advocating for the public’s health. But the ADA aren’t thinking about the big picture with fluoride and how it is destroying the cognitive abilities of those exposed on a daily basis. Immediately after the court’s ruling, the ADA hastily wrote: The American Dental Association (ADA) remains staunchly in support of community water fluoridation at optimal levels to help prevent tooth decay. The district court ruling against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides no scientific basis for the ADA to change its endorsement of community water fluoridation as safe and beneficial to oral health. The ADA called the ruling and the barrage of social media posts that followed “pseudo-scientific information.” The ADA claims that social media users are spreading information that “is not always based on research conducted according to impartial and evidence based scientific methodology.” The ADA contends that “conclusions drawn from research are not always scientifically justifiable or without bias.” One might point out that the ADA is drawing their own biased conclusions from research that was validated in court. By ignoring the latest evidence on fluoride’s damage to children’s brains, the ADA might be guilty of spreading “pseudo-scientific information.” The ADA wrote that the District Court Judge did “not conclude with certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health.” However, the ruling does require the EPA to take regulatory actions to protect future children and populations from this toxic byproduct. The EPA and CDC’s current recommendation of .7 parts per million fluoride in drinking water is now outdated and not consistent with the latest science. The ADA fails to acknowledge this reality and is therefore acting against the best interest of communities that want to protect future generations. The court’s recent decision should effectively undo the longstanding fluoride recommendations of the Environmental Protections Agency (EPA), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). These corrupt agencies contend that fluoridated water is “one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.” The CDC has historically recommended, and currently recommends, fluoride at a level that was found to be damaging to children’s brains. Public water systems have added fluoride to drinking water for more than 75 years. This was done in the name of “preventing tooth decay” although tooth decay still remains a serious health issue. This is because the ADA is too busy poisoning children’s brains instead of working to eliminate added sugars from food. The real question is: Will municipal water systems across the nation begin to phase out fluoride use, in the face of opposition from American institutions that have misled the public for decades?",8,-0.15592293,0.092571124,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/glp-1-diabetes-and-weight-loss-drug-side-effects-ozempic-face-and-more,"GLP-1 diabetes and weight-loss drug side effects: ""Ozempic face"" and more",1,"GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss have proven to be very effective, but they do have side effects. Among those side effects is ""Ozempic face,"" where skin on the face sags and wrinkles. ""Ozempic face"" was coined in reference one of these drugs, although any rapid weight loss can cause it. What are GLP-1 drugs and how do they work? GLP-1 drugs, also called GLP-1 agonists, are shortened names for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic the GLP-1 hormone that is naturally released in the gastrointestinal tract in response to eating. When you eat, your digestive system breaks carbohydrates down into simple sugars that travel through your bloodstream. GLP-1 triggers the release of insulin from your pancreas. Insulin helps usher glucose (sugar) out of the bloodstream and into your cells, where it can be used for nourishment and energy. In people with type 2 diabetes, the body's cells are resistant to the effects of insulin, the body does not produce enough insulin, or both. GLP-1 agonists stimulate the pancreas to release insulin and suppress the release of another hormone called glucagon, both of which help control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. These drugs also act in the brain to reduce hunger and act on the stomach to delay emptying, so you feel full for a longer time. These effects can lead to weight loss, which can be an important part of managing diabetes. GLP-1 agonists have been used to treat type 2 diabetes for about two decades. More recently, the FDA has approved several GLP-1 agonists for weight loss in people with obesity who do not have diabetes. When used for overweight or obesity, the drugs are typically prescribed in higher doses than when prescribed for diabetes. What GLP-1 drugs are available? Ten GLP-1 drugs are FDA-approved to treat either type 2 diabetes or weight loss. Some GLP-1 agonists have the same generic name but are marketed under a different brand name and are approved for a different purpose, depending on the dose and how they are taken. GLP-1 drugs Generic name Brand name Approved use Semaglutide injection Ozempic Type 2 diabetes Semaglutide injection Wegovy Weight loss Semaglutide tablets Rybelsus Type 2 diabetes Liraglutide Victoza Type 2 diabetes Liraglutide Saxenda Weight loss Tirzepatide Mounjaro Type 2 diabetes Tirzepatide Zepbound Weight loss Dulaglutide Trulicity Type 2 diabetes Exenatide Byetta Type 2 diabetes Exenatide extended-release Bydureon Type 2 diabetes The differences between GLP-1 drugs include: Dosages. GLP-1 drugs for weight loss typically involve higher dosages than the same drug taken to manage diabetes. How they are taken. Most are given by injection, but there is one pill option (Rybelsus). Additional benefits. Some have been found to also protect the heart, and can benefit people at risk for a heart attack. Age. All can be used by adults, but some are also approved for children. Tolerance. If your body can't tolerate one GLP-1 drug, you may be able to try another. ""Ozempic face"" as a side effect of GLP-1 drugs You may have heard about ""Ozempic face"" as a side effect of GLP-1 drugs, though the term is misleading because this can be a side effect of any GLP-1 drug or any other cause of rapid weight loss. The rapid loss of fat in the face can cause: a hollowed look to the face changes in the size of the lips, cheeks, and chin wrinkles on the face sunken eyes sagging jowls around the jaw and neck. If weight is lost in a more gradual way, these changes may not be as noticeable. It's the faster pace of weight loss that occurs with GLP-1 drugs that can make facial changes more obvious. If ""Ozempic face"" side effects are significant, they can be treated with plastic surgery. Other side effects of GLP-1 drugs Gastrointestinal symptoms — nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation — are by far the most common side effects of GLP-1 drugs. Nausea can be managed by avoiding strong smells and eating crackers, mint, or ginger-based food or drinks about a half hour after taking a GLP-1 drug. Vomiting can be managed by staying well hydrated and having more frequent meals in smaller amounts. Diarrhea can be managed by drinking plenty of water and avoiding dairy products and high-fiber foods until symptoms go away. Constipation can be managed by getting enough fiber in your diet and drinking plenty of water. To help avoid gastrointestinal side effects of GLP-1 drugs: Eat slowly and stop when full. Have smaller portions. Avoid being too active immediately after eating. Less common but more serious side effects of GLP-1 agonists include: pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas that causes abdominal pain gastroparesis, in which movement of food out of the stomach is slowed or stopped bowel obstruction, a blockage that keeps food from passing through the intestines gallstone attacks and bile duct blockage. When to see a doctor about GLP-1 drug side effects Most side effects of GLP-1 drugs are not serious. You should immediately seek medical attention if you have: severe vomiting and diarrhea severe pain or tenderness in your belly inability to pass gas or move your bowels jaundice (yellow skin color). In addition, tell your doctor that you take GLP-1 drugs if you are having surgery or a procedure that involves general anesthesia. Because GLP-1 drugs slow digestion, you may need to stop taking them a few days beforehand to ensure you have an empty stomach before receiving anesthesia.",8,0.28297985,0.13263582,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/alert-this-hidden-condition-increases-heart-attack-and-stroke-risks,Alert: This hidden condition increases heart attack and stroke risks,1,"It has an unfamiliar name, produces few symptoms, and involves a cluster of health problems. But metabolic syndrome is a common and dangerous condition that's steadily increasing in adults of all ages in the United States, largely a result of the obesity epidemic. The syndrome significantly increases the risks for heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and more. What is it? Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interrelated conditions. A diagnosis requires at least three of the following cardiovascular risk factors. Obesity. You have this risk factor if your waistline is greater than 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women, no matter your height, or if your body mass index is 30 or more. High blood sugar. After you eat, your body converts carbohydrates into blood glucose, a type of sugar that the body uses for energy. Sugar in the blood then enters your cells, where it's needed to produce energy. In people with diabetes or prone to it, this process is impaired, raising sugar levels in the blood and damaging the cells and blood vessels. A fasting blood sugar level of 100 milligrams per deciliter of blood (mg/dL) or more is considered high. Having diabetes (a fasting blood sugar of 126 mg/dL or higher) also counts as a metabolic syndrome risk factor. High triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood. Having a high level — 150 mg/dL or higher — increases your risk for heart disease and stroke. You can find your triglyceride levels in your cholesterol test results. Low HDL (good) cholesterol. HDL is another type of fat in the blood. It helps remove LDL (bad) cholesterol. If your HDL is below 40 mg/dL in men or 50 mg/dL in women, it's considered low. High blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if your systolic pressure (the top number in a measurement) is 130 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher, or your diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is 80 mm Hg or higher. If you're already taking medication for high blood pressure, you should still count this condition as a metabolic risk factor. What does it mean? When three or more of these risk factors occur together, metabolic syndrome is present, and numerous studies have shown that means you have higher risks for heart disease and stroke. ""Having just one of the risk factors is bad enough. But having more makes the likelihood of bad health outcomes greater. That's why clinicians developed the term metabolic syndrome many years ago: it helped identify people at risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Today we have even better risk calculators, which take other risk factors into account, such as age and activity levels. But you can still pay attention to metabolic syndrome as a way to recognize that trouble is brewing,"" says Dr. David M. Nathan, a Harvard Medical School professor and the director of the Diabetes Center and Clinical Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. Metabolic syndrome also increases the risk for developing liver disease, kidney disease, or sleep apnea (a condition marked by pauses in breathing during sleep). What to eat when you have metabolic syndrome Having metabolic syndrome means you're likely overweight or that you have another condition, such as high blood sugar, cholesterol, or blood pressure, that may be stoked by an unhealthy diet. One of the best antidotes is eating a healthy plant-based diet. Swap junk food for lots of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and whole grains; moderate amounts of fish and poultry; and limited portions of red or processed meats. And do one thing more: ""Eat less. If you expend more calories than you're taking in, you'll lose weight,"" says Harvard Medical School diabetes expert Dr. David M. Nathan. His go-to tricks: eat smaller portions and focus on foods high in fiber (such as vegetables and legumes), which will keep you fuller longer. Diagnosis and treatment You can measure your waist to see if you have at least one metabolic syndrome risk factor. But you can't see the others. So perhaps discuss it at your next doctor appointment, and double-check your annual blood work results. The good news is that you can reverse metabolic syndrome. Losing weight is central to reducing many of its features. Lowering elevated blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels also plays a major role in reducing your risk for heart disease and stroke. If you can do that and live a healthy lifestyle — exercising daily, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, not smoking, and limiting alcohol intake — you'll not only decrease your risks for heart disease and diabetes, but also increase your odds of living longer.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/do-i-still-need-to-keep-taking-a-statin,Do I still need to keep taking a statin?,1,"Q. I'm 81 years old, and I've been on a statin drug for 30 years because I'm at increased risk for heart disease. At my age, do I need to still keep taking it? A. Statin drugs were introduced into medical practice in the 1980s. They are very effective at lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and in reducing inflammation inside cholesterol-filled plaques of atherosclerosis. In people older than 75, are they still effective in lowering cholesterol and in reducing the risk of heart disease? In the last few years, we have started to get solid information that addresses your question. A recent study from Denmark, published in the August 2023 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, included about 84,000 people — about 10,000 of whom were older than 75. Participants began taking one of two different statin drugs, simvastatin (Zocor) or atorvastatin (Lipitor), between 2008 and 2018. The study found that the people most likely to have their LDL cholesterol lowered by statin drugs were those older than 75. So, statins remain effective at lowering cholesterol in people older than 75. But do they also reduce the risk of developing heart disease? Another observational study from Denmark, published in The Lancet in 2020, identified more than 90,000 people not on statins who were free of heart disease or diabetes (a risk factor for heart disease) — and then started taking a statin drug. Over an average follow-up period of 7.7 years, the people who were most likely to benefit from statin drugs were those older than 75. Randomized trials provide stronger evidence than observational studies. However, relatively few randomized trials of the ability of statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs to reduce heart disease risk have included people older than 75. To overcome that problem, an international team based here at Harvard pooled the results for more than 21,000 people older than 75 (and even more who were younger than 75) from multiple different cholesterol-lowering drug trials. The study, published in 2020 in The Lancet, found that the older group benefited at least as much as the younger group. In short, for people older than 75 who have heart disease already, or who, like you, are at increased risk of developing heart disease, I think there now is solid evidence that statins remain effective at lowering cholesterol and, more important, in reducing the risk of new or recurrent heart disease. For people older than 75 who have not been diagnosed with heart disease and are not at increased risk for developing it, I think the value of statins still is uncertain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-portfolio-diet-a-smart-investment-for-your-heart,The portfolio diet: A smart investment for your heart,1,"The portfolio diet, which emphasizes plant foods rich in fiber and healthy fats, was conceived some 20 years ago. Since then, many studies have documented the diet's ability to lower harmful LDL cholesterol. But because none of those trials lasted any longer than six months, the portfolio diet's long-term returns were unknown. Now, new research suggests that the more closely you follow a portfolio-style eating pattern, the greater your protection against heart disease and stroke. Published Nov. 28, 2023, in Circulation, the study included more than 210,000 people who enrolled in three Harvard-led health studies in the 1980s and 1990s. Using data from diet questionnaires the participants filled out every four years, researchers scored each person's diet based on how well it complied with the portfolio eating pattern. After 30 years of follow-up, researchers compared the scores with the participants' health outcomes. People with higher scores (that is, those who followed the diet most closely) had a 14% lower risk of heart disease compared to those with lower scores. ""A lot of different foods can lower LDL cholesterol, but only by a little bit — about 5% to 10%. The idea behind the portfolio diet was to combine many of these foods together to get a larger reduction,"" says registered dietitian Andrea Glenn, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a co-author of the study. Earlier studies found that the portfolio diet may lower LDL cholesterol by as much as 30%. In the new study, people with higher portfolio diet scores not only had better cholesterol profiles, they also had lower blood levels of C-reactive protein and other inflammatory substances compared to people with lower scores, says Glenn. Inflammation is a key player in the buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries — the root cause of most heart attacks. What's in the portfolio diet? The diet discourages foods from animal sources, particularly red and processed meat, high-fat dairy, and eggs, which means it's naturally low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol, both of which raise LDL cholesterol in the body. The featured foods fall into five main categories. Here's a rundown, including ways to incorporate them into your meals. Plant protein. This includes beans, lentils, and peas (collectively known as legumes), with a specific focus on foods made from soybeans, says Glenn. In 1999, the FDA authorized a health claim for soy protein, noting that consuming at least 25 grams daily as part of a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fat may lower the risk of heart disease. Soy protein comes in many different forms: edamame (whole, green soybeans often sold frozen in pods), soy milk, soy yogurt, tofu, or tempeh (fermented soybeans). But there are many other legumes to choose from, including black beans, pinto beans, chickpeas (garbanzo beans), lentils, and split dried green peas. Try this plant protein Swap out some of the meat in homemade soups, stews, or casseroles with beans or tofu. Replace some dairy products (like milk and yogurt) with soy-based versions. Snack on edamame or hummus. Nuts and seeds. All nuts — including almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios, walnuts — are included. So are all sorts of seeds: chia, flax, hemp, pumpkin, sunflower, sesame. Try these nuts and seeds Add nuts or seeds to hot cereal, muffins or other baked goods, yogurt, and salads. Spread peanut butter or other nut butters on whole-grain crackers or sliced apples. Snack on mixed nuts. Viscous fiber. Viscous fiber is a type of soluble fiber that has a somewhat sticky quality, says Glenn. ""It's found in grains like oats and barley, certain vegetables such as eggplant and okra, and fruits like apples, oranges, berries, and persimmons,"" she says. One of the best sources is psyllium seed husks, which transform into a viscous gel when dissolved in water. People may be familiar with psyllium because the powdered husks are the key ingredient in Metamucil, which helps treat constipation, says Glenn. But you can buy plain psyllium seed husk in stores. In the intestines, viscous fiber binds to bile acids, which carry fats from your small intestine into the large intestine for excretion. This triggers your liver to create more bile acids—a process that requires cholesterol. If the liver doesn't have enough cholesterol, it draws more from the bloodstream, in turn lowering your circulating LDL. In addition, viscous fiber is fermented in the gut into short-chain fatty acids, which may also inhibit cholesterol production. Try this viscous fiber Build what Glenn calls a ""super portfolio breakfast"": oatmeal topped with soy milk, fruit, nuts, and seeds. Try combos such as raspberries, chopped walnuts, and chia seeds or diced apples, almonds, and sesame seeds. Swap regular bread for oat bran bread. Try different ways to prepare eggplant, such as a Chinese-style stir-fry or ratatouille, a French vegetable stew. Plant sterols. Also known as phytosterols, these exist naturally in nuts, soybeans, peas, and canola oil. Plant sterols have a structure similar to cholesterol; eating them helps limit the amount of cholesterol your body can absorb. Margarine enriched with plant sterols, such as Benecol, provides a concentrated dose. But you have to eat quite a bit (about four tablespoons daily) to make a difference, says Glenn. It tastes similar to other types of margarine and can be used as a spread for toast and in sandwiches. Monounsaturated fats. Used in place of saturated fats, these fats help lower cholesterol. Extra-virgin olive oil is the top recommendation; other good options include canola, soybean, or ""high-oleic"" sunflower or safflower oils. Stock a variety of these oils for use on salads and in cooking and baking. Avocados are also rich in monounsaturated fat. You don't need to embrace every aspect of the diet to reap benefits, says Glenn. ""But we saw a dose-related response in the study, which means that the more of these foods were added to the diet, the lower the risk of cardiovascular disease we observed,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/antidepressant-may-help-manage-irritable-bowel-syndrome-symptoms,Antidepressant may help manage irritable bowel syndrome symptoms,1,"Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant also used to treat nerve pain, may be one of the best pharmacologic choices to help improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS causes abdominal pain and changes to bowel movements, with symptoms fluctuating in severity over time. IBS has no cure, and standard treatments like dietary and lifestyle changes and taking antispasmodic or antidiarrheal medications yield varying benefits. In a study published Nov. 11, 2023, in The Lancet, 463 people with IBS took either amitriptyline (10 to 30 milligrams based on the severity of each person's symptoms) or a placebo every day for six months. Afterward, people who took amitriptyline were almost twice as likely as those taking a placebo to report an overall improvement in their symptoms and had significantly lower IBS severity. It's believed amitriptyline helps by increasing people's threshold for IBS pain and discomfort. The researchers suggested that doctors should consider low-dose amitriptyline for managing IBS when dietary and other lifestyle changes are not sufficient.

Compared with women of the same age who still had their ovaries, women who were under age 46 when their ovaries were removed were 64% more likely to have arthritis, twice as likely to have obstructive sleep apnea, and nearly three times as likely to have had a bone fracture. They also performed worse on a six-minute walk test. Women who'd undergone ovary removal between ages 46 and 49 also had higher odds of arthritis and sleep apnea than same-age women who didn't have the surgery. However, researchers didn't find a link between ovary removal before menopause and an array of other conditions, including cancer, diabetes, dementia, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, irregular heart rhythm, osteoporosis, or kidney, liver, or thyroid disease. Women who have their ovaries removed before menopause should consider going on estrogen therapy until about age 50, the study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/bad-bedfellows,Bad bedfellows,1,"You woke up with a pep in your step, feeling energetic and well rested. But wait: your sleep tracker says otherwise. Does the data change your plans for the day and how you'll approach bedtime that night? Are you now anxious when you'd been feeling calm? The rise of sleep tracking devices — which monitor physiological factors related to sleep — has made this conundrum increasingly relevant. A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine shows that more than one-third of Americans have used electronic sleep tracking devices. Seven hours of sleep each night are generally adequate for an average adult, Harvard experts say. But many folks are fixated on getting a ""perfect"" eight hours after learning that sleep deprivation can raise the risks of an array of potentially serious health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The quest for better sleep may backfire, however, leading to anxiety and stress that can thwart restful slumber. ""We do need to lower the emotional temperature a bit and be rational about this,"" says Dr. John Winkelman, chief of the Sleep Disorders Clinical Research Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Many people still don't respect the importance of sleep, but using sleep trackers feeds into some people's anxieties,"" he says. ""Anxiety and psychological arousal are the opposite of what we need when we sleep."" Influential data Many types of devices are marketed to track sleep, ranging from watches and rings to smartphone apps and mattress monitors. Some measure whether you're asleep or not by recording aspects such as movement, heart rate, body temperature, and breathing patterns—all of which change at different sleep stages. The data these devices generate can also hold a lot of sway over how people feel each day. A small 2018 study in the Journal of Sleep Research demonstrated this phenomenon. It involved 63 adults with insomnia who were given wrist-worn sleep trackers. In the morning, half of them received information telling them they'd slept poorly, while the others were told they'd slept well — regardless of their actual sleep quality. All reported on their mood and alertness several times over the course of the day. The 32 participants who were told their sleep was poor reported lower alertness during the day and greater sleepiness in the evening compared to those given positive feedback. And people told they had restful sleep reported a significantly higher level of positive mood and alertness. ""In fact, there was no meaningful difference in sleep quality between the two groups,"" Dr. Winkelman says. ""I'm a little bit addicted to my Fitbit, but I don't use it to inform how I feel during the day. I just like knowing the data and thinking about the relationship of the data to how I think I slept. But understand: those two things are far from synonymous."" Pluses and pitfalls Using sleep trackers can present distinct pros and cons, Harvard experts say. Among the pros: They can make you more aware of your sleep patterns. They can offer affirmation if you're trying to form better sleep habits. ""Trackers allow people to see if their bedtimes and wake times aren't stable, which they should be,"" Dr. Winkelman says. ""Our sleep is really best when we're on a regular schedule."" They can identify a potential sleep disorder by spotlighting signs such as awakening many times during the night. ""Some trackers offer information about your oxygen variability,"" Dr. Winkelman says. ""They can be very helpful in identifying sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea."" But the devices can also lead to an unhealthy preoccupation with sleep, which can fuel insomnia, Dr. Winkelman says. Here are some other downsides: Interpreting and using the data can be confusing. For example, your tracker may tell you that you're apparently not sleeping very deeply, but you might not know how to change that. Focusing on sleep data may lead some people to ignore how they actually feel after sleeping. ""Can you wake up without an alarm clock? Make it through the day without feeling exhausted or drinking five cups of coffee?"" asks Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""To me, those are probably much more useful metrics."" A lack of accuracy Sleep trackers are only as useful as the data they produce — which aren't always accurate. A small 2019 study in the journal Sensors compared several types of sleep trackers to the gold standard of sleep measurement, a sleep study called polysomnography. After comparing 27 nights of sleep study recordings in 19 participants ages 19 to 64 (66% women) with sleep tracker data from the same nights, researchers found the trackers lacking. Specifically, the devices had difficulty detecting participants' wake periods, which hindered their ability to estimate total sleep time and sleep quality. However, the sleep trackers accurately detected the most basic sleep parameter — the actual amount of time participants spent in bed. ""They're not accurately reflecting how much sleep people are getting, or the depth of sleep or type,"" Dr. Klerman says. ""I think they're more accurate now than they used to be. On the other hand, they haven't been tested on every type of person who wears them."" What color is your sleep noise? It may seem paradoxical that a noisy environment could promote sleep. But some people prefer not to slumber in total silence — instead, they add background sound to the bedroom to sleep more soundly. Recent years have seen a proliferation of sleep machines and apps that emit various audio frequencies that sound similar to static from an untuned radio or TV. Some people profess that listening to these monotonous sounds before or during sleep can help them drop off more easily and stay asleep longer, calming them and drowning out background noise like traffic or creaky pipes. These sounds have colors assigned to them based on each noise's strength and frequency: White noise is perhaps the best‑known of all noise colors and contains all audio frequencies. It can be intense and high-pitched, resembling a fan, air conditioner, or vacuum. Pink noise is lower-pitched than white noise. It sounds like steady rain, wind blowing through trees, or waves on a beach. Brown noise sounds more bass, like a rushing river, pounding surf, or strong winds. Sleep-boosting measures If you've found that anxiety surrounding sleep is keeping you from restful slumber, Harvard experts suggest seeking a special type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called CBTi, that's designed to improve insomnia. ""The cognitive part works on anxious thoughts, while the behavioral part actually decreases the amount of time you spend in bed so you're really sleepy when you get there,"" Dr. Winkelman says. Here are some other tactics to improve your sleep: Set consistent bed and wake times. You can use a tracker to help you do this or merely rely on the clock. But either way, the practice should prod you to wind down calmly before bed. Don't check sleep data first thing in the morning. Start your day, decide how you feel, and then look at your sleep tracker. Monitor substance use surrounding sleep. Pay attention to when you last used caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco, which can all affect sleep quality. Consider your medication use. Ask your doctor if any prescriptions or supplements you take might make it harder to fall or stay asleep. Tweak the use of those medications if possible. Stay alert for breathing issues. If your bed partner says you snore or gasp frequently while sleeping, tell your doctor. Ditto if you can't sleep lying down and need to sit up, which usually indicates breathing problems. ""A tracker may not catch that,"" Dr. Klerman says. ""That's really good evidence you should see a health professional."" Image: © Kudryavtsev Pavel/Getty Images",5,0.18204626,-0.085997745,True

The study included 419 people with paroxysmal afib, which is characterized by intermittent episodes of a rapid, irregular heart rate. For 10 weeks, they used a smartphone app to rate their nightly sleep as amazing, good, average, bad, or horrible, and then used mobile electrocardiograms to measure afib episodes the following day. Researchers found that worse sleep quality on any given night was linked to a 15% greater risk of an afib episode the next day. Continued poor sleep was associated with longer episodes of afib, with each progressively worse category of sleep linked with an average of 16 additional minutes of afib per day. Strategies to improve sleep might help prevent and treat afib, say the authors, whose findings were published online Oct. 12, 2023, by JACC Clinical Electrophysiology.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/a-sharper-mind-tai-chi-can-improve-cognitive-function,A sharper mind: tai chi can improve cognitive function,1,"Up until about two decades ago, it was believed that your brain only produced new cells early in life. But research has shown that the brain has the ability to change throughout your entire life span, growing new cells, making new connections, and even increasing in size. These changes can improve cognitive function—and various forms of exercise, including tai chi, can help. In a meta-analysis of 20 studies on tai chi and cognition, tai chi appears to improve executive function—the ability to multitask, manage time, and make decisions—in people without any cognitive decline. In those with mild cognitive impairment, tai chi slowed the progression to dementia more than other types of exercise and improved their cognitive function in a comparable fashion to other types of exercise or cognitive training. In one study, researchers had nearly 400 Chinese men and women with some cognitive impairment perform either tai chi or a stretching and toning program three times a week. After a year, the tai chi group showed greater improvements, and only 2% of that group progressed to dementia, while 11% from the traditional exercise group did. In another study, tai chi outperformed walking. Following 40 weeks of either tai chi, walking, social interaction, or no intervention, researchers compared MRI images and discovered that brain volume increased the most in the tai chi group. In addition, that group also performed better on cognitive tests.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/tips-for-taming-caregiver-stress,Tips for taming caregiver stress,1,"Caring for others fulfills a basic social contract in ways that can draw generations and individuals closer. Certainly, caring for an elderly parent or ailing spouse or partner is a worthy, often satisfying pursuit. But it isn't easy. If you're among the many millions of Americans acting as caregivers for friends, family, or neighbors, you may often wrestle with stress as well as exhaustion, anger, guilt, grief, and other emotions. Two-thirds of these caregivers are women. The task is especially hard on women in the so-called sandwich generation, who are simultaneously caring for children and older parents, quite possibly while working outside the home, too. While you attend to the needs of others, your own sense of well-being may head south. Studies of men and women responsible for the long-term care of relatives show higher rates of illness, suppressed immune response, slower healing, and even earlier death among caregivers. Additionally, research reveals that ongoing stress endured by older adults caring for spouses with Alzheimer's disease has a negative impact on the caregiver's own mental functioning. In order to give care to others, you need stress relief, support, and time for yourself and your family. Theses ""Tips for taming caregiver stress"" may help. • Relaxation response techniques and nurturing techniques are vital. Practicing them often will enable you to feel calmer, happier, and better able to help others. If it's too hard to find the time, consider getting extra help with some household tasks. The Eldercare Locator at www.eldercare.gov can help you find varied services for older adults and their families; it's run by the Administration on Aging. The Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving, at www.rosalynncarter.org, also provides recommendations for evidence-based caregiver support programs. • Protect your own health. Research suggests that a caregiver's immune function is often suppressed by the stress of caring for others. Boost your resistance by eating well, getting enough rest and exercise, and pursuing activities that bring you pleasure. Take advantage of regular respite care from professionals, family, and friends to give you much needed breaks. • Join a support group to talk out frustrations with other people in your situation and to get helpful ideas. Some caregiver support groups are available online (such as a nationwide chat group run by AARP; for a quick link to it, go to /cgteam). Others are run by local hospitals, senior centers, and community groups. • A blend of assertiveness and cognitive restructuring skills can help you share the work, instead of taking on everything yourself. Spell out to other family members what needs to be done and what sort of help would be best. If no one offers help, ask for it. Linking those who can lend a hand has gotten much easier with new websites and apps that help friends, family, and communities coordinate care. Another example of a helpful site is CaringBridge (www.caringbridge.org). • When someone offers help, accept. Keep handy a list of small tasks people can do, such as calling regularly, cooking an occasional dinner, shopping, and running errands. You can dole out tasks or ask people to check off what they can do. • Accept that circumstances change quickly. Periodically reassess what you can offer and what assistance you need. If it's getting too hard to fulfill certain needs, ask family members for help or consider other options, such as hiring paid caregivers to take on these tasks. Consult a geriatric care manager (www.aginglifecare.org) or social worker for help; your local council on aging or visiting nurse association should be able to help you find one. If necessary, consider another living arrangement that would help you meet your needs and those of your loved one. • Accentuate your spiritual connectedness to something greater than yourself, be it to God, community, or the natural world. • Remember that you're doing this not solely out of obligation. Focusing on the love you hold for your loved one can help dial back stress when things become frustrating and overwhelming.

(Article by Danielle republished from 100PercentFedUp.com ) “The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, will be argued in the term that starts in October,” Fox News reports. It’s the first time the high court will review a case regarding restrictions on transgender medical procedures for minors. The case stems from the Biden administration challenging Tennessee’s ban on puberty blockers and transgender surgeries for minors. BREAKING: The Supreme Court will take up state bans on gender-affirming care for transgender minors. https://t.co/dZXfiPAces — The Associated Press (@AP) June 24, 2024 Fox News reports: Tennessee is one of 22 states that has measures banning such medical intervention for minors. A federal appeals court had allowed the law in Tennessee and Kentucky to go into effect pending the outcome of ongoing litigation. “Tennessee adopted a law that said, if you’re under 18, a doctor can’t provide you with hormone treatments or puberty blockers or gender reassignment surgery, for gender purposes. And we were sued by the DOJ, the ACLU and Lambda Legal,” Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in an interview with Fox News last month. “We won in the Sixth Circuit, and now they’re trying to get the US Supreme Court to address that. But the bottom line is the Court of Appeal saw it was states have the authority to decide whether or not these treatments should be legal within their boundaries. And some states authorize them. Some states don’t. That’s the way our system works.” Among those filing amicus briefs opposing the state law is actor Elliot Page. The Oscar-nominated star of “Juno,” “Inception” and “The Umbrella Academy” is one of 57 transgender people who joined in supporting the Biden administration’s suit. “Supreme Court to consider restrictions on puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and transgender surgery for minors this fall.

At least 11 states have adopted laws barring transgender girls and women from girls’ and women’s bathrooms at public schools, and in some cases other government facilities. The nation’s highest court has only rarely taken up transgender issues. In 2020, the justices ruled that a landmark civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in employment. In 2016, the court had agreed to take up the case of a transgender student, backed by the Obama administration, who was barred from using the boys’ bathroom in his Virginia high school. But the court dropped the case after a directive advising schools to allow students to use the bathroom of their chosen gender, not biological birth, was scrapped in the early months of the Trump administration. The directive had been a key part of an appeals court ruling in favor of the student, Gavin Grimm. In 2021, the justices declined to get involved in Grimm’s case after the appeals court again ruled in his favor.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/when-to-worry-about-worrying,When to worry about worrying,1,"We all worry. Today, there seems to be no shortage of things to worry about. It's normal to feel anxious on occasion. In fact, temporary anxiety can be a healthy response to uncertainty and danger. But constant worry may be a sign of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Do I have generalized anxiety disorder? According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 5.7% of adults in the U.S. experience GAD . While other types of anxiety disorders arise from particular situations, generalized anxiety disorder is persistent and characterized by debilitating worry and agitation about everyday matters. People with generalized anxiety disorder can't shake the feeling that something bad will happen and they will not be prepared. They may worry to excess about missing an appointment, losing a job, or having an accident. Some people even worry about worrying too much. Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder Persistent, excessive worry about several different things for at least six months Fatigue, difficulty sleeping, or restlessness Trouble concentrating Irritability Muscle tension Feeling tense or ""on edge"" Only your doctor can determine whether you meet the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. If you think you might have this condition, don't hesitate to talk to your primary care doctor. There are many different treatments that can ease the very real discomfort of this condition. Physical symptoms are common too and can include a racing heart, dry mouth, upset stomach, muscle tension, sweating, trembling, and irritability. These bodily expressions of anxiety can have a negative effect on physical health. For example, people with generalized anxiety disorder are at greater risk for heart attack and other cardiovascular problems. Treating anxiety If you have generalized anxiety disorder, your doctor may discuss the following treatment options. Therapy. For some people, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help. CBT helps people recognize when they are misinterpreting events, exaggerating difficulties, or making unnecessarily pessimistic assumptions, and offers new ways to respond to anxiety-provoking situations. Medications. Commonly prescribed drugs include antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (like Prozac or Zoloft), or dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (like Effexor or Cymbalta). These drugs take longer to work than the traditional anti-anxiety drugs, but also may provide greater symptom relief over time.

https://www.infowars.com/posts/breaking-fluoride-in-water-poses-unreasonable-risk-to-children-federal-judge-rules,"Breaking: Fluoride in Water Poses ‘Unreasonable Risk’ to Children, Federal Judge Rules",0,"A federal judge ruled Tuesday that fluoride in the drinking water poses an “unreasonable risk” of reduced IQ in children. In a massive vindication to Infowars sounding the alarm about the dangers of fluoride for decades, Judge Edward Chen of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California wrote in an 80-page landmark decision that the current “optimal” levels of water fluoridation exposure may damage human health. Over 200 million Americans currently drink water treated with fluoride at the “optimal” level of 0.7 milligrams per liter (mg/L). “In all, there is substantial and scientifically credible evidence establishing that fluoride poses a risk to human health; it is associated with a reduction in the IQ of children and is hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,” Chen wrote. “EPA’s own expert agrees that fluoride is hazardous at some level,” he added, citing a report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) which “concluded that fluoride is indeed associated with reduced IQ in children, at least at exposure levels at or above 1.5 mg/L.” The ruling concludes a historic 7-year lawsuit brought against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by environmental and consumer advocacy organizations like the Fluoride Action Network, Moms Against Fluoridation and Food & Water Watch, along with individual parents and children. Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), as amended by Congress in 2016, U.S. citizens can petition the EPA to evaluate whether a chemical presents an unreasonable risk to public health and should be regulated. The ruling represents a devastating blow to the EPA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Dental Association (ADA), who for decades staked their reputations on the safety of water fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. For over 70 years U.S. public health officials have pushed water fluoridation as a key strategy for maintaining and improving dental health. Rick North, board member of Fluoride Action Network, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said, “What’s false is the CDC claiming that fluoridation is one of the 10 greatest health achievements of the 20th century. What’s true is that ending fluoridation will be one of the 10 greatest health achievements of the 21st century.” In fact, these regulatory agencies ignored mounting compelling evidence showing fluoride’s neurotoxic risks, and even worked to suppress the research and discredit the scientists carrying it out. The judge wrote, “One thing the EPA cannot do, however, in the face of this Court’s finding, is to ignore that risk,” adding they must take some sort of regulatory action. “The judge did what EPA has long refused to do, and that is to apply the EPA standard risk assessment framework to fluoride,” said Michael Connett, attorney for the plaintiffs. “In so doing, the court has shown that the widespread exposure to fluoride that we now have in the United States is unreasonably and precariously close to the levels that we know cause harm.” Judge Chen also shot down the EPA’s argument that the exact level at which fluoride is hazardous is too unclear for the agency to determine whether the chemical presents an unreasonable risk, concluding it was “not persuasive.” “Under even the most conservative estimates of this level, there is not enough of a margin between the accepted hazard level and the actual human exposure levels to find that fluoride is safe,” Chen wrote. “Simply put, the risk to health at exposure levels in United States drinking water is sufficiently high to trigger regulatory response by the EPA under Amended TSCA,” he added. Experts noted that the ruling means the EPA will have to go beyond simply ending water fluoridation. “EPA will have to consider what to do in the southwestern parts of the country where the fluoride content of groundwater is too high due to minerals in the soil containing fluoride,” said Harvard environmental health professor Philippe Grandjean, M.D., Ph.D. “And then there is the question about ingestion of toothpaste.” Once again, Infowars has demonstrated it’s years ahead of the curve and truly lives up to its motto, “Tomorrow’s News Today.” Read the ruling:",8,-0.037500825,0.13388707,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/questions-and-answers-about-the-new-anti-obesity-medications,Questions and answers about the new anti-obesity medications,1,"A blockbuster batch of anti-obesity drugs continues to grab headlines and dominate social media posts, and not just because the new year revs up our resolve to shed pounds. The medications — semaglutide (Wegovy), liraglutide (Saxenda), and tirzepatide (Zepbound) — are backed by science and stunning accounts of people losing as much as 20% of their body weight. While that's remarkable, it's not the whole story. Many questions about the drugs remain, and some answers are complicated. What are they? The recently FDA-approved anti-obesity medications are in a class called GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s). They mimic a hormone (glucagon-like peptide 1) that helps the body slow stomach emptying, control blood sugar levels, and suppress appetite, a combination that leads to weight loss. One of the drugs, Zepbound, mimics GLP-1 as well as a hormone called a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), believed to promote the effects of GLP-1. ""Many people say these anti-obesity medications have changed their lives,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, an obesity medicine specialist and co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. The drugs also significantly reduce the risk of death from heart-related causes in people with overweight or obesity as well as heart disease (or both heart disease and diabetes, depending on the drug). Plus, they enhance the ability to exercise and boost quality of life. ""The medications may even affect the reward center in the brain, the part that enables you to eat chocolate cake even though you're full. These drugs seem to dampen the reward response, which also may reduce addictive behaviors like cravings for alcohol, sugar, and nicotine,"" Dr. Apovian says. Wait — aren't they diabetes drugs? All three of the anti-obesity drugs were first approved by the FDA just to treat diabetes, under the brand names Ozempic, Victoza, and Mounjaro. But people taking them noticed they were losing substantial amounts of weight. Studies confirmed this effect, and the FDA eventually approved the medications for weight loss, under new brand names: Wegovy, Saxenda, and Zepbound. For overweight or obesity, the drugs are typically prescribed in higher doses than their diabetes counterparts. There are older GLP-1s approved for diabetes, such as dulaglutide (Trulicity), but these treatments have less effect on weight. How do you take the medications? Most of these new drugs come in the form of injections that you give yourself daily or weekly. They are loaded in an injector pen (like an EpiPen for an allergic reaction) that you press against your abdomen or thigh. A pill form of semaglutide (Rybelsus) is also available. It's FDA-approved to treat diabetes, but not yet approved for weight loss. Several other pill formulations are being tested. What are the side effects? Both the anti-obesity and diabetes formulations have potential side effects. Common ones include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or constipation. Dr. Apovian says those tend to go away after a few weeks. In rare cases, the drugs might cause an obstruction in the small bowel, gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), or inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). ""As far as I know, side effects are not permanent. They go away if you stop taking the medications,"" Dr. Apovian says. But the very long-term effects of taking the newer medications are not yet known."" Who's a candidate for the drugs? The drugs are approved for weight loss only in people diagnosed with obesity (a BMI of 30 or greater) or a higher range of overweight (a BMI of 27 to 29.9), as well as a medical problem related to excess weight, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Of course, that hasn't stopped some people who don't meet these criteria from using them. Because these drugs are new and powerful, and are the subject of intense study, it is expected that recommendations as to who should use them will change in the coming years. Researchers are likely to identify new groups of people who might benefit — or, conversely, people who may be at extra risk from drug side effects. How long do you take the drugs? Taking one of the new GLP-1s is not a short-term solution. Once you go on the drug, you must stay on it indefinitely to keep getting the benefits. You regain the weight if you stop taking the medications. ""Overweight and obesity, like diabetes and hypertension, are serious conditions that often require ongoing, even lifelong treatment. There are no 'one-and-done' treatments,"" Dr. Apovian says. Costs and coverage Spectacular results don't come cheaply, and the new drugs range from about $900 to $1,600 per month. Don't expect your insurance to pay for them. Medicare does not cover the anti-obesity medications, and Medicare coverage for the new diabetes drugs is iffy and partial at best, depending on your plan. Private insurance often will pay for the drugs to treat diabetes, as long as you've tried other diabetes treatments without success. But Dr. Apovian says only about 20% to 30% of private insurers currently are covering the anti-obesity formulations. Some manufacturers of GLP-1s offer coupons with steep discounts, but many pharmacies don't accept them. And beware of budget-friendly versions touted in online ads or offered by ""med-spas."" Dr. Apovian says these are compounded (custom-mixed) drugs brought in from other countries, with no oversight by the FDA, and no guarantee of what they contain. Are they even available? To make matters worse, the drugs' frenzied rise in popularity has now caused shortages, making them hard to find. ""The shortage has to do with the manufacturers not anticipating this kind of demand,"" Dr. Apovian says. ""Over 40% of Americans have obesity. The drug companies didn't anticipate how many of them would want to use the medications. The companies are trying desperately to make enough supplies as we speak."" Until they do, and until more insurance companies cover the medications or manufacturers are forced to lower prices (both of which are being debated in Congress), many people with serious medical conditions are finding that they must forgo the most effective anti-obesity drugs we've ever seen.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/does-your-gut-affect-your-risk-for-alzheimers-disease,Does your gut affect your risk for Alzheimer's disease?,1,"Q. I know that your genes and lifestyle can influence your risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. Now I read that microbes in our guts also may be involved. Really? A. Genes and lifestyle both influence our risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. And, as strange as it may seem, so may the microbes in our gut. We've known for nearly 200 years that microbes live on and in us. We thought they were just living off the warmth and nutrients that our bodies provided to them — invisible freeloaders that had no effect on our health. Beginning about 20 years ago, we began to learn that was wrong. Like humans, microbes have genes. All of the different genes of the microbes that live on us or in us, collectively, are called our ""microbiome."" To our surprise, we've learned that these microbe genes can make chemicals that can affect human health. We now know that our microbiome can affect our risk for obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other important diseases. A study reported in October 2023 in the prestigious scientific journal Brain finds that our microbiome may even influence our risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies had reported that in people with Alzheimer's disease, some particular species of gut bacteria are more prevalent, while other species are less so, compared to people without the disease. But that did not answer the cart-and-horse question: does the disease affect the difference in the gut bacteria, or does the difference in the gut bacteria affect the disease? The new study provides provocative evidence that the gut bacteria may actually influence the risk of getting the disease. The research team took a group of healthy young rats and eliminated all bacteria from their guts. Then the team collected bowel movement samples from people with Alzheimer's disease and from people with normal cognition and no signs of the disease. Such samples are full of gut bacteria. Then the samples from humans were squirted into the rats' guts. The microbiome from people with Alzheimer's disease — but not the microbiome from people without the disease — caused some Alzheimer's-like changes in the rats' brains. Those rats also developed memory impairments. Moreover, the rats that received the microbiomes from the most severely affected Alzheimer's patients developed the greatest brain abnormalities and memory problems. It will require much more research to confirm that our gut microbiome influences our risk of Alzheimer's disease—and, if so, how it does so. The answer to that last question could someday point to treatments that can treat or even prevent Alzheimer's disease. Image: © chombosan/Getty Images",7,0.22517361,0.14204057,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-06-27-biden-drop-age-limits-transgender-surgery-guidelines.html,MUTILATED TODDLERS: Biden administration pushing for age limits to be dropped from transgender surgery guidelines,0,"A top health official for the administration of President Joe Biden previously worked to convince an international transgender health nonprofit made up of so-called medical experts to drop age limit guidelines for various risky transgender medical procedures , including life-changing gender surgery for minors. This is according to an unsealed court document, which shows how Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Rachel Levine pressured the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) in 2021 to leave out the ages in its guidelines. The first draft of the international group’s guidelines recommended implementing a minimum age of 14 to undergo hormone treatment, while the recommended minimum age for a mastectomy for biological women was 15, breast augmentation and facial surgery was 16 and genital surgery was 17. Levine, who is transgender, believed that listing the ages would drive further political opposition to these dangerous treatments and might be used by conservative legislators to enact laws with age restrictions equal to or higher than the WPATH's recommendations. In an internal email, one member of WPATH wrote: “We sent the document to Admiral Levine … She like[s] the SOC-8 [Standards of Care Version 8] very much but she was very concerned that having ages (mainly for surgery) will affect access to health care for trans youth and maybe adults too.” They added that she had the support of the Biden administration in her request, writing: “Apparently the situation in the USA is terrible and [Levine] and the Biden administration worried that having ages in the document will make matters worse.” Human knowledge is under attack!

Another official, Sarah Boateng, who was Levine’s chief of staff at the time, was also referenced in one of the emails, whose author noted: “She is confident, based on the rhetoric she is hearing in D.C., and from what we have already seen, that these specific listings of ages, under 18, will result in devastating legislation for trans care. She wonders if the specific ages can be taken out.” Other officials made similar requests, and their efforts ultimately appear to have been successful as the age minimums were not included in the final draft of their standards of care released in September of 2022. One WPATH member told Levine directly in an email that they would make the changes. (Related: Nashville school shooter was a violent trans girl who said she'd ""kill"" for puberty blockers – manifesto finally released .) Some states are trying to protect minors from risky, irreversible procedures they might regret The emails were released as part of litigation challenging a law in Alabama that outlaws certain types of gender-related procedures. In a filing, psychologist Dr. James Cantor asserted that the association “capitulated and removed the text in violation of its own process despite the preference of its own committee members to retain the age limits.” The suit was filed on behalf of a group of transgender children and their families by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. Alabama is one of several states that have passed laws making performing sex changes on children a felony. Cantor, who is critical of transgender procedures for adolescents and is supporting Alabama in the case, filed the email excerpts as evidence suggesting that the group made its decisions based on politics instead of science. The plaintiffs in the case are trying to stop Cantor from testifying. Gender transition care for adolescents is highly controversial given the lack of long-term safety evidence and the fact that their brains have not fully developed. Several European countries, including Britain and Sweden, have recently added new age restrictions on gender medications and will only allow surgeries for those aged 18 and older.",9,-0.20349142,-0.05486828,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tips-to-navigate-a-sleep-divorce,"Tips to navigate a ""sleep divorce""",1,"When your bed partner regularly shatters your good night's rest — by snoring, kicking, tossing and turning, or stealing the covers, for example — you might wonder if you'd be better off sleeping apart. And you're not alone if you give it a try. A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that a third of respondents reported occasionally or regularly sleeping in separate rooms to accommodate a bed partner. Just keep in mind that the arrangement comes with a risk. ""Your relationship might suffer, especially if one person doesn't want to sleep apart or doesn't like the new sleeping environment,"" says Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. Here's what you can do if you're considering a ""sleep divorce."" Why consider a sleep divorce? Sleeping apart seems counterintuitive for couples. But a good night's sleep is very important for health. ""Sleep deprivation promotes depression, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating, which can keep you from engaging well with your partner. A lack of sleep also increases the risk for chronic health problems such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cognitive decline,"" notes Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. The goal is to sleep seven to nine hours per night. Work with your partner to make sleep a priority for both of you. And make that sleep top quality. Have a heart-to-heart first Discuss your partner's disruptive sleep behaviors with compassion, and talk about the problems that result for both of you. ""The conversation can be embarrassing. It requires you to be vulnerable, and a lot of sensitive topics might come up beyond sleep behavior,"" Dr. Collier says. ""If it's hard to communicate about it, consider a couples counseling session with an objective third party to guide you."" Seek a compromise Before seeking a complete sleep divorce, consider compromises that are acceptable to both of you. ""For example, if your partner's snoring wakes you up, try wearing earplugs, use a bedside sound machine, or wear earbuds and listen to a podcast as you fall asleep,"" Dr. Collier suggests. If snoring is a problem, your partner could try sleeping on his or her side and seeing a doctor to find out what's causing the snoring. Dr. Collier recommends you go together to the doctor's appointment so you both learn about any possible underlying conditions and treatments, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for sleep apnea. ""Another solution could be sleeping separately in the same room. Perhaps you each get a bed. That's helpful when one person awakens frequently to urinate or has involuntary twitching movements in the legs during sleep. Another idea is napping in the same place during the day but sleeping apart at night."" Sleeping apart successfully If you decide to try sleeping apart, consider following these guidelines. Make both sleeping spaces cozy. ""Neither of you should have to sleep on the couch,"" Dr. Collier says. ""You both need a good mattress and a comfortable sleeping environment that's cool, dark, and inviting. Make sure both parties are happy."" Schedule intimacy. Sharing a bed promotes personal connection, sexual activity, and feelings of comfort and security. To get the same intimacy when you sleep apart, Dr. Collier says, you must make a concerted effort. For example, if nighttime is when you have sex, cuddle, or share meaningful details of your day, schedule that before bedtime, and then move to separate rooms after your time together. Or set aside time for closeness during the day and make it a priority. Create a nighttime routine. It can be tough sleeping alone after years of being together, especially if you have anxiety or stress. ""You'll have to develop your own bedtime routine, one that makes you feel relaxed and sleepy, such as reading for a little while and then turning out the light and listening to a bedside sound machine. If you miss the comfort and security of your partner, sleeping with a body pillow or a weighted blanket might help,"" Dr. Collier says. ""Or, talk to your partner on the phone or in a video call as you're going to sleep. That way you can still be together."" Assess the arrangement regularly. Check in with each other daily to see what's working and what isn't. ""It's not good enough if it's helpful only for one person,"" Dr. Collier says. ""Go back to the drawing board and come up with something better. Your relationship is at stake, and so is your health and well-being. Sleeping apart can be beneficial if both parties are happy with the setup, both parties sleep well, and you continue to nurture your relationship.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/poor-sleep-linked-to-high-blood-pressure,Poor sleep linked to high blood pressure,1,"Sleep problems — including trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, and too little sleep — are associated with a greater risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) in women, according to a new study. Published in the Nov. 2023 issue of Hypertension, the study tracked the health of 66,122 women for 16 years. When the study began in 2001, the women ranged in age from 25 to 42 and didn't have hypertension. After researchers accounted for various demographic and lifestyle factors, they found that compared to women who slept seven to eight hours daily, those who slept six or five hours were 7% and 10%, respectively, more likely to develop hypertension. Women who said they sometimes or usually had trouble falling or staying asleep were 14% and 28% more likely to have hypertension, respectively, compared to those who rarely had trouble sleeping. The findings don't prove that sleep problems cause elevated blood pressure. However, as the authors suggest, one possible explanation for the link may be increased stress, which is associated both with poor sleep and high blood pressure.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-you-worry-about-your-waistline,Should you worry about your waistline?,1,"Extra padding around your midsection goes by many different names — a spare tire, muffin top, or love handles. Too much of any type of fat isn't healthy, but some forms are worse than others. The flab you can pinch between your fingers is known as subcutaneous fat, which lies just beneath the skin. A more worrisome type of fat lies deep within the abdominal cavity, padding the space between your organs (see illustration). Known as visceral fat, it does more than add inches around your waistline; it also raises your risk of cardiovascular problems. ""Growing evidence suggests that your waist circumference is a better predictor of heart disease than your body mass index,"" says Dr. Osama Hamdy, medical director of the Obesity Clinical Program at Harvard-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center. Body mass index (BMI), an indirect estimate of body fat based on height and weight, doesn't distinguish between the different types of fat. ""People can have what's considered a healthy BMI but still have a large belly and visceral fat,"" says Dr. Hamdy. Another measurement, the waist-to-hip ratio, correlates with visceral fat. But there's no need to do that extra hip measurement or math because waist circumference alone is strongly linked to visceral fat, says Dr. Hamdy. Just make sure you measure correctly (see ""Gut check: How to measure your midsection""). Why is visceral fat dangerous? Visceral fat is also a marker for ectopic fat, which refers to fat that accumulates inside organs (such as the liver, heart, and pancreas) and muscles. Both type of fat are closely tied to metabolic problems, especially type 2 diabetes — which, in turn, is a potent risk factor for heart disease. In addition, visceral fat secretes hormones and other inflammatory factors, collectively called adipokines or cytokines, which trigger a buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries (atherosclerosis). Who's at risk? Your genes, ethnic background, and sex all influence how likely you are to accumulate visceral fat. Native Americans (notably the Pima tribe), Hispanics, and people living in India and South Asia have a higher likelihood of abdominal obesity (as well as diabetes). In addition, white men and black women tend to accumulate relatively more visceral fat compared with black men and white women. Gut check: How to measure your midsection To measure your waist accurately, wrap a measuring tape around your bare abdomen just above the upper border of your hipbone, which you can easily feel on both sides. Usually, the tape measure will cross your bellybutton, but not for everyone. Make sure the tape measure isn't twisted and that it stays taut, but not tight enough to compress the area. Don't suck in your gut or hold your breath. Check the number right after you exhale. For women, a waist circumference of 35 inches or higher signals a high risk. For men, it's 40 inches or higher. Ideally, your waist circumference should be no greater than one-half your height. What helps to banish a big belly? Although some people are predisposed to larger midsections, there's a lot you can do to remedy the problem, says Dr. Hamdy. Get regular exercise. Sit-ups or other abdominal exercises won't shrink your belly. Instead, you need to burn calories to lose fat and build muscle through a combination of aerobic and strength training. Aim for at least 30 minutes daily of moderate-intensity exercise (like brisk walking), and do strength-based exercise at least two days per week. Follow a healthy, reduced-carbohydrate diet. Avoid foods and drinks with added sugars and other simple carbohydrates that spike blood sugar and encourage your body to store fat. These include foods made with white flour (common culprits include what Dr. Hamdy calls the ""P's and B's"": pasta, pizza, pretzels, bread, and bagels) and starchy foods, such as white potatoes, white rice, and corn. Try time-restricted eating. Some research suggests this strategy may lower blood sugar levels and reduce visceral fat. There are many ways to structure your eating; for example, you might eat only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and fast during the other 16 hours. This not only limits calorie intake but also kick-starts the body's fat-burning process. Illustration by Scott Leighton",3,0.33269203,-0.03262137,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-06-26-finland-bird-flu-vaccinations-workers-exposed-animals.html,Finland to provide bird flu vaccinations to all workers exposed to animals,0,"Finland is set to become the first country in the world to offer avian influenza virus vaccinations to workers exposed to animals. According to several reports, the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) announced on June 25 that the government bought avian influenza vaccines for 10,000 people, each consisting of two injections from CSL Seqirus, an Australian manufacturer with the broadest influenza vaccine portfolio in the world, as part of a joint procurement with the European Union in which the bloc will distribute up to 40 million doses for 15 member states. ""The vaccine will be offered to those aged 18 or over who are at increased risk of contracting avian influenza due to their work or other circumstances,"" the THL said. Beginning on June 30, the THL is expected to administer the vaccines to workers exposed to animals, including fur farm workers and laboratory technicians handling bird flu samples. Should any human infections be confirmed, the vaccine will also be offered to individuals in close contact with the infected patients. Finland is set to administer bird flu vaccinations even without any reported human cases Finland has yet to report any human cases of avian influenza. And yet, the Finnish government is already taking proactive measures to ""curb"" the potential virus transmission. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has long affected bird populations but has recently been detected in other species. For instance, in 2023, Finland's fur farms, which operate in an open-air environment, experienced significant bird flu outbreaks among mink and foxes. This, in turn, resulted in the culling of approximately 485,000 animals to mitigate the transmission risk.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-you-should-walk-with-a-doc,"Why you should ""Walk with a Doc""",1,"You know that walking helps your heart. So does spending time with other people, being outside in nature, and learning about ways to improve your health and well-being from a professional. Want to get all four at once? Show up at a Walk with a Doc event. Launched in 2005, this nonprofit organization sponsors free, doctor-led walks in mostly outdoor venues (usually public parks) across America. Today, Walk with a Doc is in 34 countries worldwide, including 560 communities around the United States. In surveys and focus groups, participants give the program high marks. Nearly all of the responders — 96% — say they strongly agree that Walk with a Doc has helped them lead a healthier lifestyle, according to a 2020 article in Current Cardiology Reports co-authored by Walk with a Doc founder Dr. David Sabgir. The program's initial inspiration was to encourage people to be less sedentary. But the informal teaching that happens before and during the walks is a boon for patients and doctors alike, says cardiologist Dr. Simin Lee, associate physician at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""In our current health care system, most of the care is compressed into a short office visit,"" she says. Walk with a Doc gives physicians time to discuss important health topics — such as exercise, diet, and stress management — in greater depth. Dr. Lee started the Walk with a Doc chapter in Jamacia Plain, the Boston neighborhood bordering the Longwood Medical Area, which is home to Harvard Medical School and many of its affiliated medical institutions. Walking and talking ""Most of the chapters do monthly walks, but I wanted to encourage continuity and habit formation, so I did my walks every week,"" says Dr. Lee. The walks, which are currently led by her Brigham and Women's colleague Dr. Catherine Hwang, feature a 1.5-mile loop around Jamaica Pond every Wednesday evening at 5:30 pm. In general, weekday walks are usually about 30 minutes long; weekend walks may last 60 to 90 minutes. About five minutes before starting the walk, the doctor speaks on various topics of interest, including those requested by the participants. For her initial talks, Dr. Lee focused on the recommended ""dose"" of exercise. During the walk, she demonstrated what moderate-intensity exercise looks like. ""I'd tell people to notice how I could still talk in full sentences but that my breathing was a little heavier than when we were just standing around,"" she says. During later walks, she taught interval training by cueing the group to pick up their walking pace for a few minutes, and to then pull back and return to their normal walking speed. Interval training is a good way to add variety to your workout and is especially helpful for improving cardiovascular fitness, she notes. ""Sometimes, it can feel futile to just rattle off some basic counseling about exercise during an office visit. It's so much more powerful when you can demonstrate it in person,"" she says. As much as we appreciate all the medications we have at our fingertips to manage cardiovascular disease, people really are interested in doing things for their health that doesn't involve taking pills, Dr. Lee says. She also did a series of talks about how exercise benefits so many chronic health conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, dementia, and cancer. Camaraderie and pleasant scenery As Dr. Sabgir wrote in his article, most Americans are living lives that are sedentary, lonely, and not connected with nature. Many Walk with a Doc programs, including Dr. Lee's, have helped foster social connections and forged friendships among the participants. The walks she led often included 10 or more people, who would sometimes bring friends or family members along. ""Creating a shared sense of community is a really important aspect of the program,"" she says. So is the stress-relieving power of spending time in nature, which has become less and less common. Research suggests that over half of all Americans spend fewer than five hours outdoors each week. ""In our increasingly digital world, where people spend a lot of time inside in front of screens, it's just lovely to be outside to get fresh air and witness a beautiful sunset and the changing seasons,"" says Dr. Lee.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-does-coffee-help-with-digestion,Why does coffee help with digestion?,1,"Q. I love my morning cup of joe, but I've noticed it also sends me straight to the bathroom for a bowel movement. Why can coffee have a laxative effect? A. Since about half of American adults profess to drink coffee every day, this perennially popular drink must boast some pretty compelling benefits. Beyond waking up our brains, coffee also helps jolt some people's digestive tracts. This happens for several reasons. A 2021 study suggests that two hormones coffee boosts — gastrin and cholecystokinin — trigger the so‑called gastrocolic reflex, prompting the colon to contract and move waste through the rectum. Since colon contractions tend to be strongest in the morning anyway, drinking coffee plays into this natural digestive process. This hormonal action is specific to coffee, not tea or other drinks, but coffee's caffeine content heightens this effect by increasing colon contractions and stool movement. For some people, this can happen within minutes; for others, it might take hours — or not happen at all. On the other hand, people who tend to be constipated often find that their morning cup of coffee helps keep them regular. But don't drink excessive amounts of coffee just for this reason. It can make us jittery or worsen the symptoms of certain conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, glaucoma, or overactive bladder.

These fleshy, soft growths — which are more common among women — are unquestionably annoying. They can sprout almost anywhere on the skin, but skin tags tend to develop on the neck, under the arms, or around the groin. While skin tags can be unattractive, the good news is that they're benign and won't develop into cancer. But they're linked with several health conditions that aren't harmless, which is why you should be concerned if you're developing more of them. These include diabetes or metabolic syndrome (a constellation of high blood pressure, unhealthy blood sugar levels, extra fat around your waist, and unhealthy cholesterol levels). Skin tags are also more common if you're pregnant or obese, or if you have family members who also develop them. Your doctor may want to run blood tests if you're getting a lot of skin tags with no explanation. If you'd like, she can also remove them using various in-office techniques.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/prebiotics-in-plant-based-foods-may-help-control-unhealthy-eating,Prebiotics in plant-based foods may help control unhealthy eating,1,"Science has shown that a healthy gut can make beneficial changes in the brain and vice versa, via a connection known as the gut-brain axis. A healthy gut requires good amounts of probiotics (beneficial bacteria), which grow by feeding off prebiotics, compounds found in plant fiber. A new study suggests prebiotics have a role in the gut-brain axis beyond being a food source and eating them might help people choose healthier foods. Researchers recruited 59 overweight adults who regularly followed a Western diet (higher in red meat, saturated fat, and processed foods) and assigned them randomly to take either 30 grams of inulin (a prebiotic found in onions, leeks, artichokes, and bananas) or a placebo supplement, every day for two weeks. Next, the participants had brain MRIs while they viewed pictures of various low-, medium-, and high-calorie foods and indicated how much they wanted them on a one to 10 scale. The MRIs measured how much of the brain's reward network was activated when the participants made their choices. Over a second two-week period, the process was repeated: everyone took the supplement they had not taken earlier, and then underwent the MRI session. The researchers found that after taking the prebiotic supplement, people were more likely to select medium- or low-calorie foods than high-calorie ones, and their MRIs showed less activation in their brain's reward network when shown high-calorie foods. The results were published online Oct. 4, 2023, by the journal Gut. Image: © OscarWong/Getty Images",3,0.33597016,0.058675885,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-to-lower-your-dementia-risk,How to lower your dementia risk,1,"An estimated 3% of adults ages 65 and older currently have dementia, and that proportion rises substantially as people age. By age 85, about one-third will be diagnosed with some form. The diagnosis of dementia is based on a set of symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, changes in personality, a decline in cognitive skills, and inability to perform everyday activities. But can you do anything to lower your risk? ""The most convincing evidence continues to be for the boring stuff — aerobic exercise, a brain-healthy diet, and quality sleep,"" says neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Daneshvar, chief of the division of brain injury rehabilitation with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Even people with a family history of dementia could lower the risk by investing more in these basic healthy lifestyle habits."" Here's how they help with dementia prevention. Aerobic exercise. The buildup of beta-amyloid protein in the brain is a key hallmark of many diseases that cause dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia. Another common form, vascular dementia, stems from damage to brain cells that occurs when narrowed or hardened blood vessels fail to supply enough blood to the brain. Aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain, supporting blood vessels and decreasing the risk of blood vessel damage. It also helps reduce inflammation, thought to be one of the main causes of abnormal protein buildup. Aerobic exercise is any activity that increases your heart rate. Although most aerobic exercise requires you to move your entire body, the main focus should be on your heart and lungs. ""Activities like walking, running, swimming, cycling, even dancing, if done at sufficient intensity, get you breathing faster and your heart working harder,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Guidelines recommend adults do at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week. It's never too late to begin, either. ""Even older people who have rarely done aerobic exercise before can still reap the benefits once they start,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Brain-healthy diet. There are several extensively studied diets that promote brain health, like the Mediterranean, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), and MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diets. ""These diets are linked to lower levels of brain-damaging chronic inflammation by reducing or eliminating red meat and processed foods and increasing the intake of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables and fatty fish high in omega-3 fatty acids,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Quality sleep. During sleep, the brain clears out harmful beta-amyloid proteins. But the cleaning process can't do a complete job if sleep is regularly disrupted — by insomnia, sleep apnea, or other issues that cause you to wake during the night. ""Eventually, this can cause or exacerbate abnormal protein buildup,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. If you regularly don't feel rested upon waking or have trouble falling and staying asleep, speak with your doctor. It's important to address any sleep disorder or other health issues that interfere with sleep, like acid reflux. Taking multiple medicines, depression, and changes in the bedroom environment (for instance, in temperature, noise level, smartphone usage, or light exposure) also can disrupt sleep. Engage your brain by socializing Another way to protect your brain from dementia is to socialize more. A study published online Oct. 24, 2023, by JAMA Neurology found that socially isolated older adults have a 27% higher chance of developing dementia than older adults who aren't isolated. ""Regular interactions activate mental processes, including attention and memory, which can bolster cognition,"" says neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Daneshvar with Massachusetts General Hospital. Here are some ways to increase your social engagement: Get into group dynamics.Join a group activity, such as a walking club, a golf or bowling league, a book or chess club, or a continuing education class at an adult education center. Schedule friend time.If you have a circle of friends but you don't see them regularly, take the initiative and schedule routine get-togethers. Designate a day, time, and place for coffee, lunch, or any type of gathering designed for easy conversation. Group video chats also are an option. Engage in ""weak ties."" Casual interactions, known as ""weak ties,"" also can provide stimulating engagement. For example, strike up a brief conversation with a stranger or employee at the grocery store or coffee shop. Even social media conversations and texting qualify. Image: © Pekic/Getty Images",7,0.37707347,0.19757934,True

More than 6.5 million emergency department visits in the United States each year are due to chest pain, as are nearly four million outpatient clinic visits, according to the American Heart Association. Notably, however, most of these cases are not found to be heart-related. To be clear, chest discomfort of any kind — whether pain itself or tightness, pressure, squeezing, or burning — should never be ignored. And new chest pain should prompt a call to your doctor. But understanding its many possible causes can calm worst-case-scenario fears and help you find solutions, says Dr. Daniel Sands, a primary care doctor at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""It's been drummed into us that chest pain is a danger sign that should make you see a doctor,"" Dr. Sands says. This remains solid and safe advice. But chest discomfort more often arises for reasons other than the heart. Lengthy list of causes For women, cardiac causes account for ""only a very small proportion"" of chest pain, Dr. Sands notes. This depends, of course, on each woman's specific risk factors for heart disease. And, particularly in women, heart attacks don't always show up with chest pain at all. ""If a 25-year-old woman comes in with chest pain, and she's generally healthy with no prior heart disease, the likelihood she has cardiac disease is infinitesimal,"" he says. ""But if it's a 60-year-old woman who smokes and has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and a family history of heart disease, that person is so likely to have heart disease that I'd send her to the ER right away."" A long list of other conditions — some minor and others deadly serious — can trigger chest pain or discomfort. These include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) gallstones asthma anxiety or panic attacks ulcers COVID esophagus spasms costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs to the breastbone) pleurisy (inflammation of the tissue separating the lungs from the chest wall) pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lung) aortic dissection (a rupture of the aortic artery) pericarditis (inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart). Spot the clues How can you tell if chest pain is most likely not heart-related? Dr. Sands offers these clues: It's brief, lasting only a few moments. You can climb stairs or exercise without the pain worsening. It's triggered by eating, occurring just afterward or only when you eat certain foods. It happens only when you move in a certain way, such as bending or stretching. It occurs only when you're coughing or breathing deeply. It's localized to a small spot, or feels better or worse when you rub the area. Regardless of how it shows up, any chest pain should prompt you to follow up with your doctor, Dr. Sands says. You may need treatment for another issue. ""Don't panic,"" he says. ""Your doctor can evaluate you to see if something serious is going on and work with you to find a solution to feel better."" Conversely, a heart attack or other catastrophic problem ""usually shows up with chest pain that goes on for a long period, not something that just goes away,"" Dr. Sands says. Watch for chest pain lingering for more than a few minutes; shortness of breath; pain in the jaw, neck, or back; pain in one or both arms; and feeling nauseous, weak, faint, or dizzy. Call 911 or have someone drive you to an emergency room if you experience any of these signs. But anytime you're not certain why you're having chest pain or where it stems from, ""call your doctor immediately,"" Dr. Sands says. ""Sometimes answering a few questions, even over the phone, can determine whether you need to be evaluated or not."" Image: © Povozniuk/Getty Images",7,0.1338928,-0.06257753,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-healthy-is-sugar-alcohol-202312183002,How healthy is sugar alcohol?,1,"If you are trying to cut back on added sugar — and you should, because excess sugar increases risks for obesity, diabetes, and heart disease — you might be tempted by products advertised as low sugar, no sugar, or sugar-free. Many contain familiar low-calorie sugar substitutes like aspartame or sucralose instead of sugar. And as you're reading labels, you also may run across another ingredient: sugar alcohol, which is used in products like sugar-free cookies, candies, ice cream, beverages, and chewing gums. Are any of these sweeteners a better choice nutritionally? Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, weighs in below. Are low-calorie or no-calorie sweeteners any healthier than natural sugar? Also known as artificial sweeteners or sugar substitutes, the list of low-calorie and no-calorie sweeteners you may see on product nutrition labels includes acesulfame-K, saccharin, sucralose, neotame, and advantame. These have a higher sweetness intensity per gram than natural sugar. So far research on them is mixed, although some observational studies have found that beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners are associated with a higher risk for diabetes and weight gain. What exactly are sugar alcohols and how can you spot them? Sugar alcohols may have the most misleading name, as they are neither sugar nor alcohol, according to Dr. Hu. ""They are a type of carbohydrate derived from fruits and vegetables, although most commercial sugar alcohols are synthetically produced."" You can usually spot many sugar alcohols on ingredient lists by ""-ol"" at the ends of their names. Examples include sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, mannitol, erythritol, and maltitol. Are sugar alcohols any healthier than other sugar substitutes or natural sugar? Here is a look at the pros and cons. The upside of sugar alcohols Sugar alcohols reside in the sweet spot between natural sugar and low-calorie sweeteners. They are not as overly sweet as sweeteners and don't add too many extra calories like sugar. ""Sugar alcohols are about 40% to 80% as sweet as natural sugar, whereas artificial sweeteners like aspartame are about 200 times sweeter,"" says Dr. Hu. ""And they have about 25% to 75% fewer calories per gram than sugar."" Another upside of sugar alcohols is that they break down slowly in the gut. Hence, your body only absorbs part of their overall carbohydrates. ""This keeps your blood sugar and insulin levels from spiking as they do with sugar,"" says Dr. Hu. ""That makes them a useful sugar substitute for people with diabetes."" The downside of sugar alcohols The main downside to sugar alcohols is this: when taken in high amounts they can cause gastrointestinal (GI) problems, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or loose stools. Because sugar alcohols are slowly digested, they have more time to feed bacteria in the gut, which can lead to fermentation and produce excess gas. Their slow digestion also can pull extra water into the colon and cause a laxative effect. People's tolerance for sugar alcohols depends on many factors, including body weight, health conditions, and the amount and types of sugar alcohols. ""Individual differences in digestion and metabolism, gut microbiome composition, and dietary habits can also make a difference,"" says Dr. Hu. ""For these reasons, we recommend introducing sugar alcohols into your diet gradually and observing how your body responds."" For people who experience GI symptoms caused by sugar alcohols, Dr. Hu says cutting back on the amount of foods and drinks made with them often can correct the problem. ""Sugar alcohols are commonly found in sugar-free or low-carb products, so pay attention to food labels"" he says. ""Because different sugar alcohols can have different effects, it might be useful to identify specific types of sugar alcohols that cause GI side effects."" Do sugar alcohols have health risks? Possible long-term health risks of sugar alcohol are still being explored. A 2023 observational study found a link between using erythritol as an added sweetener and cardiovascular disease events, such as stroke and heart attack, in people with heart disease or who had risk factors like diabetes and high blood pressure. However, these findings have not been confirmed in subsequent studies. ""Sugar alcohols offer a healthier alternative to sugar because of their lower calorie content and reduced glycemic response, which is the effect food has on blood sugar levels,"" says Dr. Hu. ""But they also have potential drawbacks, especially for those with sensitive digestive systems, so it's best to consume them in moderation as part of an overall healthy eating pattern.""",3,0.34904993,0.06788388,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/foods-you-should-eat-to-help-fight-inflammation,Foods you should eat to help fight inflammation,1,"We typically think of inflammation as a result of an injury or disease. But diet also plays an important role in chronic inflammation. This is in part because the foods we eat influence the types of bacteria that populate our gut and their chemical byproducts. While some foods encourage the growth of bacteria that stimulate inflammation, others promote the growth of bacteria that help suppress it. That's why it's important to know which foods have anti-inflammatory properties and which can cause inflammation Foods that fight inflammation Fruits and vegetables. Most fruits and brightly colored vegetables naturally contain high levels of antioxidants and polyphenols. Polyphenols are potentially protective compounds found in plants. Studies have shown that polyphenols have multiple anti-inflammatory properties and may improve the function of cells that line blood vessels. Foods high in polyphenols include onions, turmeric, red grapes, cherries, and plums, as well as dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, and collard greens. Nuts and seeds. Studies have found that consuming nuts and seeds is associated with reduced markers of inflammation and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Some oils and fatty fish. Olive oil, flaxseed oil, and fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel offer healthy doses of omega-3 fatty acids, which have long been shown to reduce inflammation. Coffee, cocoa and green tea. The polyphenols in coffee and the flavanols in cocoa are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea is also rich in both polyphenols and antioxidants. Foods that can fuel inflammation The foods that contribute to inflammation are the same ones generally considered bad for other aspects of health. These include: Sugary sodas Refined carbohydrates (like white bread and pasta) Red meat and processed meats Processed foods. Certain components or ingredients used in processed foods such as the emulsifiers added to ice cream, may have effects on inflammation. Such foods are also likely to contribute to weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for inflammation.. The key to reducing inflammation with diet To practice anti-inflammatory eating, it's best to focus on an overall healthy diet rather than singling out individual ""good"" and ""bad"" foods. In general, a healthy diet means one that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils, and limits food loaded with simple sugars (like soda and candy), beverages that contain high-fructose corn syrup (like juice drinks and sports drinks), and refined carbohydrates.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-more-fiber-in-your-diet,How to get more fiber in your diet,1,"Diverticulosis is a very common colon condition in which small pouches form on the colon wall. Most people who have diverticulosis have no symptoms, However, sometimes one of the pouches gets inflamed, usually due to a bacterial infection. To reduce your risk of getting diverticulosis and diverticulitis, add high-fiber foods to each meal. Aim for up to half your plate to contain some fiber-rich food. Here are some tips that can help you make the transition to a higher-fiber diet. Eat a minimum of three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit every day. This makes up the five-a-day recommended by the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In general, one serving is a single piece of fruit or a half-cup of raw fruits or vegetables, or a cup of leafy greens. Include fruits, vegetables, or both with every meal. For instance, include fruit with breakfast and as a snack, and vegetables with lunch and dinner. Eat pulses (the seeds of plants in the legume family), such as beans, lentils, and peas, at least three times a week. You can include them either as a plant-based protein in meatless dishes, or as the starch side in place of grains. For example, you could have fish on a bed of lentils rather than rice. Rely on nuts, seeds, and fruit for snacks. Or add them to other items like yogurt, oatmeal, salads, and stir-fries. Replace refined grains like white rice with whole grains like brown rice, wild rice, or bulgur. For pasta, look for versions made from quinoa or pulses like chickpeas and lentils. Check nutrition fact labels for the amount of dietary fiber. Aim for at least 5 grams of fiber per serving. Be careful about eating a lot of fiber at once. Overdoing it can cause gas, bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps as your gut bacteria try to process all the new fiber. These problems go away after a while as your digestive system gets used to the higher fiber levels, but you can avoid them by adding extra fiber gradually to your diet. For example, try to add just one more serving of a high-fiber food to your daily diet for a week, then see how your body feels. Give yourself another week, if needed. If everything is okay, add another daily serving for a week. Continue this pattern until you reach your daily quota of fiber. Also, make sure to drink plenty of fluids each day—about 16 ounces of water, four times a day. Increasing the water you drink can help fiber pass through your digestive system and avoid stomach distress. To learn how to halt the distress of diverticulitis, read Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis, an online guide from Harvard Medical School.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/try-this-progressive-muscle-relaxation-for-sleep,Try this: Progressive muscle relaxation for sleep,1,"For some people with insomnia, a racing or worried mind is the enemy of sleep. In others, physical tension is to blame. One way to quiet a racing mind or relax a tense body is a technique called progressive muscle relaxation. It involves gradually tensing and relaxing your muscles, beginning with your feet and working your way up your body. Try this when you have trouble falling asleep: Lie on your back in bed in a comfortable position. Put a pillow under your head or your knees to relax your back. Rest your arms with palms up, slightly apart from your body. Take several slow, deep breaths through your nose. Exhale with a long sigh to release tension. Focus on your toes and feet. Curl your toes and arch your feet. Hold this movement briefly to feel the sensation. Relax your muscles and let your feet sink into the bed. Feel them getting heavy and becoming totally relaxed. While breathing softly, move your attention slowly up your body, tensing then relaxing each area: calves, thighs, buttocks, lower back, abdomen, upper back, shoulders, arms, hands, neck, jaw, and forehead. Relax any remaining tense spots. If thoughts distract you, ignore them and gently return your attention to your breathing. Image: © Nicole S. Young/Getty Images",5,0.31207842,-0.2673738,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/can-weight-loss-slow-prostate-cancer,Can weight loss slow prostate cancer?,1,"You've had a biopsy and have been diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer, defined as a tumor that is confined to the prostate gland and unlikely to grow or spread. You decide to follow active surveillance, a protocol in which you regularly follow up with your doctor for routine PSA tests, prostate biopsies, and possibly MRI scans. If at some point it looks like the cancer has progressed, then you can consider treatment (radiation or surgery). For some men, this wait-and-see period lasts for years. But can you do anything to help slow your cancer's growth and delay treatment for as long as possible? Your bathroom scale might give you the answer. How monitoring works The reality is that most low-grade prostate cancer does not transform over time and become more aggressive, according to Dr. Mark Pomerantz, a medical oncologist with Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""Being on active surveillance is more about looking out for cancer that the original biopsy missed,"" he says. ""It's not necessarily that the original low-grade cancer becomes more aggressive — although that is possible in some cases — but rather, high- or medium-grade cancer is hiding and we're looking for changes in PSA levels that might suggest it's there and become aggressive."" About 45% to 60% of men on active surveillance will not need cancer treatment over the 10 to 15 years following their initial diagnosis, according to Dr. Pomerantz. While those are encouraging figures, they still leave the chance you may need treatment sooner. Controlling factors You can't control two factors that can increase the risk of undetected high- or medium-grade cancer from becoming aggressive: genetics and family history. But one aspect you may be able to change is your weight. ""While excess weight doesn't appear to increase the likelihood of low-grade prostate cancer, there appears to be a strong association between being overweight or obese and the risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. People with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are considered overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 or higher are classified as obese. Scientists reported in the Aug. 15, 2019, issue of Cancer that over a 10-year period, men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose waist size and BMI increased the most had greater risks of advanced and fatal prostate cancer compared with men who maintained a healthy weight. Specifically, a five-point increase in BMI was associated with a 50% higher risk for advanced or fatal prostate cancer, and a 4.1-inch increase in waist size was associated with a 40% higher risk. Where that extra fat lies also is a driving a factor. The same study discovered that extra visceral fat (the hidden kind that lies deep in the abdomen and surrounds the major organs) was linked with a 31% higher risk of developing advanced prostate cancer. Your past weight gain also may play a role in future cancer growth, suggests research presented at the European Congress on Obesity in May 2023. Researchers found that men who gained an average of 2.2 pounds each year from ages 17 to 29 increased their risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer later in life by 13%. ""So losing excess weight may be one way to possibly keep prostate cancer from growing more rapidly,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. The weight connection Experts don't fully understand the relationship between excess fat and prostate cancer growth. Some theories suggest that extra weight leads to higher levels of inflammation, which in turn acts like fuel to prostate cancer cells. Overweight and obese men also are more likely to have higher levels of blood sugar, which stimulates the pancreas to release more insulin. Some studies have shown a link between higher insulin levels and an increased risk of prostate cancer. ""This could be another factor raising the chance of more aggressive cancer,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. While weight loss and weight management are never easy, Dr. Pomerantz says many men on active surveillance often embrace the situation as an opportunity to make overall health changes. ""Increasing exercise and adopting a healthy, plant-based diet, both of which can help men lose extra pounds, not only can help with their prostate cancer, but can reduce their risk of heart disease and other cancers,"" he says. ""Most men on active surveillance will die of something other than prostate cancer, so this can be a wake-up call for men to get serious about their health.""

Researchers followed more than 6,500 white-collar workers for 18 years and identified two job-related conditions linked to higher cardiovascular risks. One was job strain, defined as high demands (such as having a heavy workload and tight deadlines) coupled with low control (for example, having little say in decision making). The other, called effort-reward imbalance, occurs when a person's effort is high but their salary, recognition, or job security are low. Compared with people who didn't experience work stress, men who reported either of those stressors had a 49% higher risk of heart disease. But their risk doubled if they reported both types. Among women, the results were inconclusive, which the authors say might reflect the fact that women tend to develop heart disease later in life than men. The men were also more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure, and other factors that raise heart disease risk.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cpap-machines-and-masks-which-ones-are-right-for-you,CPAP machines and masks: Which ones are right for you?,1,"Your doctor says you need continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to treat your sleep apnea, and you're eager to begin treatment. You're also a little worried, since you've heard that using a CPAP system can be uncomfortable and challenging. How do you choose a system that will give you the best odds of success? Here are some tips to help. Understand the treatment CPAP is the first-line treatment for people with obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder marked by repeated pauses in breathing caused by a blocked airway. The CPAP system's job is to keep your airway open. It does that by pushing a forceful stream of air through a tube and into a mask you wear while you sleep. The air comes from a small bedside pump (an air compressor). Other forms of positive airway pressure (PAP) may be helpful for people with central sleep apnea, although pauses in breathing in this type of sleep apnea are related to garbled messages from the brain, not blockages (see ""What is sleep apnea?""). What is sleep apnea? Sleep apnea is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. The pauses last at least 10 seconds, lead to poor-quality sleep, and put a strain on your body. Untreated sleep apnea may increase your risk for high blood pressure or stroke. In obstructive sleep apnea, pauses in breathing occur when the airway briefly becomes blocked. This can be caused by too much tissue in the airway (often due to excess weight), large tonsils, or a large tongue. In central sleep apnea, pauses in breathing occur when the brain fails to deliver electrical impulses to the muscles that help you breathe. Trust your doctor Your physician will determine what kind of CPAP device you need. ""The device and its settings are by prescription, just like a medication,"" says Dr. Noah Siegel, director of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Surgery at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear. With CPAP, a single fixed air pressure is used throughout the night. Other types of PAP therapies include auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP), which provides a range of preset pressures throughout the night bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), which provides two different preset pressures — a more powerful one when you inhale and a less powerful one when you exhale adaptive servo ventilation (ASV), an advanced device that provides pressure based on breathing patterns throughout the night. ""Generally speaking, people with obstructive sleep apnea respond better to CPAP or APAP. People with central sleep apnea may respond better to BiPAP or ASV,"" Dr. Siegel says. Investigate face mask options You get to choose the face mask for your PAP system, and it's an important decision. Face masks often feel bulky, making people reluctant to wear them. Dr. Siegel recommends looking at mask options online and trying on a few before making a selection. That might happen at a medical supply store or during a home visit from your medical equipment supplier. The masks fall into two categories. Full-face masks. These cover the nose and mouth and deliver air to them both. They are ideal for someone who breathes through the mouth or has nasal or sinus problems. Nasal masks. These masks deliver air through the nose only. They are less bulky than full-face masks and come in styles that fit over, under, or in the nose. An important consideration for both mask types, Dr. Siegel says, is the site where the tube from the pump enters the mask. ""Traditional-style masks connect the tubing in the front of the mask, near the nose. That's not great for people who roll over a lot in bed or people who are claustrophobic,"" he says. ""Newer styles attach at the top of the mask. It's much less intrusive."" Give it time Adjusting to any PAP system takes time. You may need to try a few masks to find the right fit and comfort. ""And if allergies or frequent sinus congestion keep you from using a nasal mask, we have interventions — such as nasal sprays or surgery — that might make a nasal mask more tolerable,"" Dr. Siegel says. Also, your doctor may need to make adjustments to your machine, such as changes to settings for pressure and humidification. Just stick with it, and remember that using a PAP system, like taking a medication, is an ongoing therapy that needs regular evaluation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-best-strength-building-exercise-to-lower-blood-pressure,The best strength-building exercise to lower blood pressure?,1,"Aerobic exercise involves moving the largest muscles of your body in a rhythmic, repetitive pattern — think brisk walking, running, cycling, and swimming. It's long been considered the best type of activity to lower blood pressure. But growing evidence shows that strength training can also reduce blood pressure. According to a new study, the most effective type involves contracting your muscles without any movement, which is known as isometric or static exercise (see ""Muscle-strengthening activity: Types, terms, and examples""). Published October 2023 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, the study pooled findings from 270 clinical trials involving a total of more than 15,000 people. All the trials lasted at least two weeks and reported the effects of exercise on blood pressure. As expected, most types of exercise helped lower blood pressure. But the most effective workout, especially in people who had high blood pressure, was isometric exercise training. ""It's an interesting and somewhat provocative finding because of the historic focus on aerobic exercise for reducing blood pressure,"" says Dr. Timothy Churchill, a cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Aerobic (which means ""with oxygen"") exercise boosts your heart rate and increases blood circulation to deliver oxygen throughout the body. The blood pressure benefits appear to stem from improvements in heart and blood vessel health. Muscle-strengthening activity: Types, terms, and examples Anything that makes your muscles work harder than usual counts as a muscle-strengthening activity — something all adults should aim to do at least two days a week, according to the federal Physical Activity Guidelines. Often referred to as strength training, this type of exercise works by harnessing resistance — that is, an opposing force that muscles have to strain against. It's also known as resistance training or weight training. You can use many different things to supply resistance, including your own body weight, free weights such as dumbbells, elastic bands, or specialized machines. Other options include medicine balls, kettlebells, and weighted ropes. Muscles can grow stronger by exerting force through these three actions: Concentric. Muscles move joints while shortening. Think of what happens when you flex your arm to show off your upper arm (biceps) muscle. It's the same type of motion you would use when raising a dumbbell or lifting a bag of groceries off the counter. Eccentric. Muscles move joints while lengthening. As you slowly lower a dumbbell or grocery bag, your biceps muscles lengthen while producing force to lower the object in a controlled manner rather than simply letting it drop. Isometric. Muscles don't shorten or lengthen much, and joints do not move. If you push against a wall, for example, or try to lift an object that is far too heavy for you, your arm muscles will tense. But since your muscles can't generate enough force to lift the object or shift the wall, they stay in the same position instead of shortening. Muscle-strengthening exercises that include both concentric and eccentric muscle movement is known as ""dynamic"" or ""isotonic"" strength training. Examples include push-ups, biceps curls, and squats. Examples of ""isometric"" or ""static"" strength training include doing wall squats (also called wall sits), planks, or an overhead hold. Adding isometric exercise The new findings add to the evidence that strength-based exercises are also good for cardiovascular health. But rather than taking priority over all other types of exercise, strength training should be incorporated into your overall routine, says Dr. Churchill. While isometric exercise — especially wall squats — appeared to lower blood pressure the most, the study authors were somewhat cautious about overselling that finding, given that relatively few studies (18 of the 270) included isometric exercise and none compared it directly against other forms of exercise. Still, experts have speculated about a possible mechanism. During isometric exercise, clenched muscles temporarily constrain blood flow. The subsequent surge of blood may stimulate the release of factors that help relax the vessels and ultimately contribute to a reduction in blood pressure. Isometric exercise has some additional advantages. Because you don't move your joints, isometrics can be easier and safer for people with joint injuries or diseases. Many of the exercises don't require any special equipment, and you can do them anywhere. The physical activity guidelines don't specify how long to do muscle-building exercises. ""But even just 10 to 15 minutes, two days a week, is a good place to start,"" says Dr. Churchill. Try doing some wall squats or a modified plank. Wall squats To do walk squats, stand with your back flat against a wall. Walk your feet about 18 inches from the wall, placing your feet shoulder-width apart. Tighten your abdominal muscles, then inhale and exhale as you slide your back down the wall until your thighs are as close to parallel as possible to the floor and your knees are above your ankles. Hold for 20 to 60 seconds. Slide slowly back up the wall to a standing position. Rest for 30 to 60 seconds, and repeat two times. Exercise photo by Michael Carroll Remember to breathe! During any type of strength training, be careful not to hold your breath. Some people do this unintentionally, although others have a misguided belief that breath holding increases their effort and power. But breath holding during exertion can cause dangerous blood pressure spikes, says Dr. Churchill. When you do dynamic strength training, exhale as you lift, push, or pull, and inhale as you release. When doing isometric strength training, take a big breath as you move into position. Then take shallow breaths as you hold the pose, and take regular full breaths during the rest and recovery phase.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/high-protein-foods-the-best-protein-sources-to-include-in-a-healthy-diet,High-protein foods: The best protein sources to include in a healthy diet,1,"Including protein-rich foods in your diet is vital for maintaining overall health and well-being. But how much protein do you need and what are the best sources of this essential macronutrient? Why we need protein Proteins are building blocks in the body. They make up bones, cartilage, muscle, blood, skin, enzymes, hormones, and vitamins. They're essential for growth and development, repair and build cells and tissue such as muscle, and play an important role in body processes such as blood clotting, fluid balance, and the immune response. Proteins are made from amino acids. There are some amino acids that our bodies can make on their own. These are called nonessential amino acids. But there are nine amino acids that our bodies must get by consuming foods that contain them. These are called essential amino acids, and they are necessary for normal body functioning. What foods are high in protein? We can get protein from plant or animal sources. Protein in our diet can come from meat, dairy products, nuts, some vegetables, and certain grains and beans. Examples of high-protein foods Food type Examples beans, peas, and lentils chickpeas, lentils nuts and seeds walnuts, pumpkin seeds lean meats chicken, turkey fish salmon, tuna dairy products milk, yogurt soy products tofu Try to eat a variety of protein-rich foods to ensure you are meeting your daily protein needs as well as getting the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients needed for optimal health. Proteins that come from animal sources, such as meat, eggs, and milk, as well as soy and quinoa, are called complete proteins. This means they contain all the essential amino acids the body needs and are the highest-quality protein sources. You can also get essential amino acids from plant-based foods. However, most plant-based proteins do not contain all of the needed essential amino acids, and so are called incomplete proteins. If you avoid animal proteins, the best way to ensure you are consuming a healthy mix of amino acids is to enjoy a variety of plant-based proteins through the day. Foods that are particularly high in protein include: Lean meats such as chicken, turkey, beef, and pork are excellent sources of high-quality protein as well as important nutrients like iron and zinc. To avoid unhealthy saturated fat, opt for lean or low-fat meat options such as lean ground beef, pork loin, or skinless chicken breasts. Fish like salmon, tuna, and mackerel are not only rich in protein but also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for heart health. Look for seafood options that are lower in methylmercury, such as salmon, anchovies, and trout. Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt are rich in protein, calcium, and other essential nutrients. Greek yogurt is a great option, as it is high in protein as well as nutrients such as calcium, vitamins, and minerals. Dairy products can be high in saturated fat, so choose low-fat dairy options and limit the amount of cheese you eat. Beans, peas, and lentils include kidney beans, pinto beans, white beans, black beans, lima beans, fava beans, soybeans, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, pigeon peas, split peas, lentils, and edamame. These plant-based foods are excellent sources of protein as well as fiber, folate, potassium, iron, and zinc. Nuts and seeds include almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, peanuts, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and peanut butter. They are not only rich in protein but also provide healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. Nuts are high in fat and calories, so be mindful of portion sizes. Eggs contain all of the essential amino acids, making them a complete protein source. Eggs are also a source of vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and antioxidants. Quinoa is a plant-based protein source that is also a complete protein. A cup of cooked quinoa provides about 8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber. Quinoa is also a good source of minerals such as manganese, phosphorus, and copper. Soy products such as tofu and tempeh are good sources of protein, especially for vegetarians and vegans. One-quarter cup of tofu provides seven grams of protein. How much protein should you eat daily? For the average adult, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein, or the amount you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements and not get sick, is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or 0.36 grams per pound. For a person who weighs 75 kg (165 pounds), that comes to 60 grams of protein per day. To determine your target daily protein intake, you can multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36, or use this online calculator. It's important to keep in mind that your daily protein need is not a fixed number. For example, your protein needs will fluctuate depending on your level of physical activity, and whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Should I get my protein from animal or plant sources? In order to get enough dietary protein in the most healthful way, nutritional guidelines have shifted away from specific amounts of daily protein, and toward the importance of eating healthier, protein-rich foods. It's important to think about the protein ""package"" when making protein choices because food containing protein also includes fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, sugar, sodium, additives, and other components. While meat provides high-quality protein, some meats also provide unhealthy amounts of saturated fats and sodium. If you eat meat, it's important to choose leaner meats and poultry. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), meats that are high in saturated fat include: fatty cuts of beef, pork, and lamb ground beef (75% to 85% lean) processed meats such as bologna, salami, sausages, hot dogs, bacon some poultry, such as duck. A high-protein diet that is predominantly made up of red meat or processed meat is a cause for concern. Research has consistently found that both unprocessed and processed red meat are linked to higher risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. One meta-analysis found that replacing red meat with healthy plant proteins decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease. For optimal health and nutrition, you should emphasize plant-based protein and protein from a variety of sources. The Mediterranean style of eating is one approach that emphasizes healthy protein sources. Benefits of a higher protein diet While most Americans consume more than enough protein, some people may benefit from a higher intake of protein. To maintain or gain muscle mass If you are over age 50, you should increase protein intake to one gram per kilogram of your body weight just to maintain muscle mass, which declines with age. If you're trying to gain muscle mass, a higher-protein diet can help support muscle repair and growth. When you exercise, muscle cells break down. Protein from food helps to repair the damage, ultimately strengthening muscles. To lose weight The value of high-protein diets for weight loss remains controversial. However, one meta-analysis found that a high-protein diet could lead to weight loss and prevent weight regain after weight loss. The authors note the need for future studies that follow patients for longer than one year for more insight into this issue. Other benefits One study found that eating plant-based protein was associated with lower odds of developing cognitive decline later in life. For every 5% of calories that came from plant protein instead of carbohydrates, researchers observed a 26% lower risk for developing dementia in study participants. How much protein is too much? The idea of an upper limit of protein intake is controversial. Some experts believe the recommended amounts are too low. Others believe we are overconsuming protein. In general, the average person (not a body builder or an elite athlete) does not need high levels of protein and should not exceed 2 grams per kilogram; or about 125 grams per day for a 140-pound person. A main concern with taking in too much protein is an overall dietary imbalance. Consuming excessive protein may lead to inadequate intake of carbohydrates and fats. It's important to maintain a well-rounded diet that includes a balance of all three macronutrients for overall health. In addition, if you increase your protein intake without increasing physical activity, you may be taking in too many calories without expending enough, which could result in weight gain. There is also some evidence that eating a relatively high-protein diet can be problematic for individuals with pre-existing kidney conditions. A diet high in animal protein may pose a higher risk of kidney stones.",3,0.34351513,-0.023057848,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/several-factors-may-cause-testosterone-levels-to-drop,Several factors may cause testosterone levels to drop,1,"Testosterone levels tend to slowly decline in middle-aged men, and often fall faster after age 70. In an analysis of 11 studies involving about 25,000 men in total, researchers looked at the possible factors for this more rapid decline in testosterone levels later in life. They found that having a body mass index higher than 27 and engaging in less than 75 minutes of weekly vigorous activity were each linked to lower testosterone levels. Other contributing factors were having ever smoked and health issues like high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Low testosterone levels can contribute to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and reduced sex drive. While the findings only showed an association, the researchers stressed the need for older men to continue engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors and managing chronic health issues, which could help maintain their body's testosterone production. Men also should address these areas before considering hormone therapy for low testosterone. The results appeared in the September 2023 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/statins-types-uses-side-effects-and-alternatives,"Statins: Types, uses, side effects, and alternatives",1,"If your doctor wants you to take a statin for high cholesterol, you're not alone. More than 40 million Americans take them, too. In fact, statins are the most prescribed drugs in the U.S. But you may have questions. You may be wondering about side effects of statins, types of statins, how statins work, and what your doctor may prescribe instead of statins to help lower your cholesterol. What are statins? Statins are prescription drugs you take as pills to lower cholesterol. Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes. However, when you have too much, it can build up inside the walls of your arteries. This is called plaque. Cholesterol-laden plaque contributes to heart disease in different ways. A buildup of cholesterol can make your arteries narrow and even block them. If a cholesterol plaque ruptures, a blood clot forms there and this can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Cholesterol also provokes inflammation in the arteries, which can contribute to the formation of artery-blocking clots. Sometimes, just changing what you eat and being more active can lower cholesterol. But if your cholesterol stays high, you may need a statin or other cholesterol-lowering medication. How do statins work? Statins interfere with how your liver makes cholesterol; most importantly, LDL, the ""bad"" kind. Triglycerides are a second kind of cholesterol that can contribute to plaque buildup. HDL has traditionally been referred to as the ""good"" cholesterol because it helps your body get rid of LDL. However, changing HDL has not been seen to reduce the risk of heart disease, so this is no longer a focus of cholesterol management. Statins work to lower LDL levels. This slows the buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Statins also reduce inflammation in artery walls. If you do have plaque buildup inside your arteries, statins can help prevent them from breaking open and leading to blood clots. Once you start taking a statin (or any cholesterol lowering drug), you probably will stay on it for life. If you stop, your protection from the statin will wear off. Who might benefit from statins? You may benefit from statins if you have high LDL cholesterol levels have had a heart attack or stroke, or are at risk for having one have diabetes (a risk factor for heart disease) and are over age 40. Statins may help you live a longer and healthier life. But the degree to which you may benefit can vary. Your doctor can tell you about your personal risk and how much benefit to expect. People who are pregnant or who have liver disease should not take statins. What types of statins are available? Eight statins are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): atorvastatin (Lipitor) fluvastatin (Lescol) lovastatin (Mevacor) lovatstatin extended release (Altoprev) pitavastatin (Livalo) pravastatin (Pravachol) rosuvastatin (Crestor) simvastatin (Zocor). Your doctor picks which statin may work best for you by considering a few things. They include how much you need to lower your LDL by, and other medicines you are taking. Sometimes people will have a side effect with one statin but are able to tolerate another one. What are possible side effects of statins? More than three decades of research have shown that statins are safe and effective. But like all drugs, statins can have side effects. The most common side effects of statins are muscle aches and feeling tired. Other side effects that aren't as common are headaches, constipation, diarrhea, and sleep problems. A 2022 study published in The Lancet reviewed the records of over 150,000 people in randomized trials of statins, and analyzed those who had muscle aches after taking statins or placebo. The study found that more than 90% of those symptoms were not related to the statins. The researchers concluded that the risks of muscle problems are low compared to the health benefits of statins. How can I manage side effects of statins? Muscle soreness is the main reason why people want to stop using statins. Studies have evaluated many therapies for resolving statin muscle aches, including vitamin D, and coenzyme Q10, but have not found compelling evidence that any of them are effective. In many cases, side effects will go away as your body gets used to the statin. If they don't, your doctor may suggest switching to a different statin or taking a lower dose, and sometimes taking the low dose every other day, for example. What alternatives to statins might my doctor prescribe? Some people just can't tolerate the side effects of statins. Others still have high cholesterol even after taking statins for a while. Fortunately, there are different drugs to try and other ways to lower cholesterol. Non-statin drugs There are many classes of drugs to help lower cholesterol. These include ezetimibe (Zetia), bempedoic acid (Nexletol), and bile acid sequestrants, which have been seen to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke. Ezetimibe reduces the amount of cholesterol your body absorbs from food (or reabsorbs from what the liver releases). Large, randomized studies did not find any difference in side effects of ezetimibe compared with placebo. Bempedoic acid blocks the production of cholesterol in your liver, but the medication does not get into muscle cells, so it can be an effective option for people who have had problems with statins. It can be taken alone but is usually taken with other cholesterol-lowering medications. Side effects include gout (especially in those with a history of gout), mild worsening of creatinine (a measure of kidney function), and gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis). Bile acid sequestrants stop bile acid in your stomach from getting absorbed in your blood. Your liver then takes the cholesterol from your blood to make the bile acid it needs. Side effects include constipation, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, and muscle pain. PCSK9 inhibitors PCSK9 inhibitors are a newer type of cholesterol drug. These medicines are for people who have an inherited condition that causes very high levels of LDL. They also are for people with heart disease whose cholesterol has not been sufficiently lowered with a maximum dose of statins. PCSK9 inhibitors work by helping the liver remove cholesterol from the blood. PCSK9 is a naturally occurring protein that breaks down certain receptors in the liver that remove LDL from the blood as it passes through the liver. By reducing the number of these receptors, PCSK9 increases the level of LDL in the blood. By hampering PCSK9's ability to work, PCSK9 inhibitors allow more LDL receptors to remain active in the liver. With more receptors to sweep away LDL, a person's blood levels of LDL drop. These drugs are given by injection and are more expensive than statin pills. Side effects include flulike symptoms and pain from the injection. Nondrug ways to lower cholesterol Some people can lower their cholesterol without medicine by making lifestyle changes. Those changes include having a healthy diet. The DASH diet from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is one example. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish and poultry, beans, nuts, and low-fat dairy products. It limits sugary drinks, sweets, and foods high in saturated fat, like fatty meats and full-fat dairy products. If you are overweight, losing weight may lower your LDL. Having a healthy diet can help with that, too. Another way to lower cholesterol is through regular physical activity. Aim for 30 minutes each day. Other things to try include managing stress and quitting smoking. Both of those have an effect on cholesterol.",3,0.34735897,0.19152893,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/8-secrets-to-a-good-nights-sleep,8 secrets to a good night's sleep,1,"After a night spent tossing and turning, you wake up feeling like a couple of the Seven Dwarves: sleepy… and grumpy. Restless nights and weary mornings can become more frequent as we get older and our sleep patterns change. Later in life there tends to be a decrease in the number of hours slept. There are also some changes in the way the body regulates circadian rhythms. This internal clock helps your body respond to changes in light and dark. When it undergoes a shift with age, it can be harder to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night. We all have trouble sleeping from time to time, but when insomnia persists day after day, it can become a real problem. Beyond making us tired and moody, a lack of sleep can have serious effects on our health, increasing our propensity for obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. If you've been having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, you may have turned to sleep medications in search of more restful slumber. However, these drugs can have side effects, including appetite changes, dizziness, drowsiness, abdominal discomfort, dry mouth, headaches, and strange dreams. You don't need to avoid sleep aids if you absolutely need them, but before you turn to pills, try these eight tips to help you get a better night's sleep. 1. Exercise Going for a brisk daily walk won't just trim you down, it will also keep you up less often at night. Exercise boosts the effect of natural sleep hormones such as melatonin. Just watch the timing of your workouts. Exercising too close to bedtime can be stimulating. Morning workouts that expose you to bright daylight will help the natural circadian rhythm. 2. Reserve bed for sleep and sex Don't use your bed as an office for answering phone calls, texting, and responding to emails. Also, avoid watching late-night TV there. The bed needs to be a stimulus for sleeping, not for wakefulness. Reserve your bed for sleep and sex. 3. Keep it comfortable Television and your smartphone aren't the only possible distractions in your bedroom. Ambience can affect your sleep quality too. Make sure your bedroom is as comfortable as possible. Ideally you want a quiet, dark, cool environment. All of these things promote sleep onset. 4. Start a sleep ritual When you were a child and your mother read you a story and tucked you into bed every night, this comforting ritual helped lull you to sleep. Even in adulthood, a set of bedtime rituals can have a similar effect. Rituals help signal the body and mind that it's coming to be time for sleep. Drink a glass of warm milk. Take a bath. Or listen to calming music to unwind before bed. 5. Eat — but not too much A grumbling stomach can be distracting enough to keep you awake, but so can an overly full belly. Avoid eating a big meal within two to three hours of bedtime. If you're hungry right before bed, eat a small, healthy snack (such as an apple with a slice of cheese or a few whole-wheat crackers) to satisfy you until breakfast. 6. Avoid alcohol and caffeine If you do have a snack before bed, wine and chocolate shouldn't be part of it. Chocolate contains caffeine, which is a stimulant. Surprisingly, alcohol has a similar effect. It makes you a little sleepy, but it's actually a stimulant and it disrupts sleep during the night. Also, stay away from anything acidic (such as citrus fruits and juices) or spicy, which can give you heartburn. 7. De-stress The bills are piling up and your to-do list is a mile long. Daytime worries can bubble to the surface at night. Stress is a stimulus. It activates the fight-or-flight hormones that work against sleep. Give yourself time to wind down before bed. Learning some form of the relaxation response can promote good sleep and can also reduce daytime anxiety. To relax, try deep breathing exercises. Inhale slowly and deeply, and then exhale. 8. Get checked An urge to move your legs, snoring, and a burning pain in your stomach, chest, or throat are symptoms of three common sleep disrupters — restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, and gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD. If these symptoms are keeping you up at night or making you sleepy during the day, see your doctor for an evaluation. Taking sleep medicines safely If you've tried lifestyle changes and they aren't working, your doctor may prescribe hypnotic sleep medications. These drugs can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer, but they also can have side effects. Here are some tips for ensuring that you're taking these medicines as safely as possible: Tell your doctor about all other medicines you're taking. Some drugs can interact with sleep medications. Take only the lowest possible effective dose, for the shortest possible period of time. Carefully follow your doctor's instructions. Make sure you take the right dose at the right time of day (which is typically just before bed). Call your doctor right away if you experience any side effects, such as excess sleepiness during the day or dizziness. While you're taking the sleep medicine, also practice the good sleep habits outlined in this article. Avoid drinking alcohol and driving while taking sleep aids. Sleep medications may make you walk unsteadily if you get out of bed in a drowsy state. If you routinely have to get out of bed during the night to urinate, be sure the path to your bathroom is clear of obstacles or loose rugs so you don't fall.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/stomach-troubles-with-no-clear-cause-heres-what-you-can-do,Stomach troubles with no clear cause: Here's what you can do,1,"Your stomach doesn't feel well. It's not heartburn, but you feel bloated, full, and nauseous. The discomfort started during a meal, or maybe a half an hour later. When this happens commonly, you should seek medical evaluation. Your doctor will make sure there are no worrisome symptoms or signs, and then likely diagnose you with functional dyspepsia. This is a type of chronic indigestion, or a stomachache and full feeling during and after meals. While most often there is no single medical solution to functional dyspepsia, different approaches might work. Here are some to try out: Eat Right Avoid foods that trigger symptoms. Common culprits are caffeine, chocolate, alcohol, and spicy, acidic, or fatty foods. Eat smaller, more frequent meals so your stomach does not distend and can empty quickly. Chew your food slowly and completely. Avoid activities that result in swallowing excess air, such eating quickly, chewing gum, drinking carbonated beverages, and smoking. Avoid lying down within two hours of eating. Keep your weight under control. Reduce Stress Use stress reduction techniques, including relaxation therapies. Exercise. In addition to being good for your overall health, it's a proven stress reducer. Try cognitive behavioral therapy. Reduce Fatigue Get enough rest. Try to go to bed and get up at the same times each day. Avoid caffeine after noon. Exercise Perform aerobic exercise three to five times a week for 20 to 40 minutes per session. Don't exercise immediately after eating. Learn more about gut health inThe Sensitive Gut, a Special Health Report from Harvard Medical School.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/long-lasting-c-diff-infections-a-threat-to-the-gut-202311012987,Long-lasting C. diff infections: A threat to the gut,1,"If you've ever dealt with diarrhea, you know how quickly it leaves you feeling depleted. Now imagine a case that rages on and on — or comes back again and again. This is the reality for nearly 500,000 Americans each year who have the bacterial infection known as Clostridioides difficile, or C. diff. Virulent diarrhea and inflammation of the colon can even turn life-threatening. This primer will help you understand how C. diff spreads and releases toxins, what the common symptoms are, and who is most vulnerable. Dr. Jessica Allegretti, director of the fecal microbiota program at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, also touches on promising preventive strategies and treatments. How does C. diff spread? Like many bacteria, C. diff is present in our stool. It's carried by virtually everyone — on our skin and even on the soles of our shoes. When C. diff bacteria are outside the body, they are inactive spores. They only have a chance to become active when they're swallowed and reach the intestines. Even then, many people who swallow C. diff spores never become ill. The spores only sicken people whose gut microbiome — the trillions of organisms living in their intestines — becomes imbalanced for one of the various reasons described below. When an imbalance occurs, the spores start to multiply and create toxins that lead to a C. diff infection. ""Many of us are colonized with C. diff bacteria without any consequences,"" says Dr. Allegretti. ""We're swallowing C. diff spores all the time. Only under the right circumstances will the spores germinate and release a toxin. It's the toxin that makes you sick."" What are the symptoms of a C. diff infection? The symptoms mimic those of many other types of gastrointestinal ailments. Initially, this may make it difficult to tell the infection apart from milder illnesses. Symptoms to watch for include persistent diarrhea lasting three or more days nausea fever stomach pain or tenderness appetite loss. ""C. diff isn't something that people in the general population should be walking around scared of,"" Dr. Allegretti says. ""But if you need to take an antibiotic, be on the lookout for diarrheal symptoms after finishing the course of antibiotics. Diarrhea that's associated with antibiotics alone should resolve once you finish taking the medication."" Who is most vulnerable? A few sobering facts from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC): C. diff is the top cause of health care-associated infections in the US. It disproportionately strikes people in hospitals and nursing homes. Among people over 65, one in 11 of those diagnosed with a health care-associated case of C. diff dies within a month. However, other groups are also susceptible to the infection. Health care-associated C. diff infections are plateauing, Dr. Allegretti notes, while so-called community-based infections that occur among the general population are increasing. People most likely to experience such infections: Are taking antibiotics or have just finished a course of antibiotic therapy. People are up to 10 times more likely to get C. diff while on antibiotics or during the month afterward, according to the CDC. ""Not everyone who takes an antibiotic gets C. diff, and not everyone who gets C. diff gets recurrent C. diff,"" says Dr. Allegretti. ""It has a lot to do with your host response, your gut microbiome, and your individual risk factors, such as immunosuppression or inflammatory bowel disease."" Have a weakened immune system due to cancer, organ transplant, or treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (such as people with inflammatory bowel disease or autoimmune conditions). Have close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with C. diff. What prevention strategies help block the spread of C. diff? Hospitals try to prevent C diff. among patients in several ways. They impose scrupulous hand-washing requirements among staff members. Patients who develop new diarrhea are tested for C. diff infection. Those who have it are isolated in their own rooms to help prevent further spread. Outside of a hospital, you can help prevent this gut infection through a few commonsense measures. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water every time you use the bathroom and always before eating. Clean hands are especially important if you've had C. diff or know you've been exposed to someone with it. By the way, alcohol-based hand sanitizer isn't effective against C. diff because its organisms can form resistant spores. Take antibiotics only when strictly necessary and for the shortest period possible. ""The biggest thing we can do is advocate for ourselves,"" Dr. Allegretti says. ""During cold and flu season, we know a lot of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are written for infections that are most likely viral, not bacterial. Antibiotics do not kill viruses — and unnecessary antibiotics may upset the bacterial balance in your gut. Ask your doctor: Do I need this prescription? Is there an alternative?"" When you do need antibiotics, ask if a narrow-spectrum antibiotic would be effective for your type of infection. Why? Broad-spectrum antibiotics kill a wider array of bacteria. This may be overkill, depleting your gut microbiome unnecessarily and enabling C. diff bacteria to germinate. ""The caveat is, we don't want patients to not take antibiotics they need for an actual infection,"" she says. ""But have a conversation with your health care team."" The type of antibiotic prescribed also matters, according to a 2023 study in the journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases. Researchers compared more than 159,000 people who had C. diff infection with 797,000 healthy controls. Study findings suggest that using clindamycin and later-generation cephalosporin antibiotics pose the greatest risk for C. diff infection. Meanwhile, the antibiotics minocycline and doxycycline were associated with the lowest risk. ""But there are very few safe antibiotics with regard to C. diff risk,"" Dr. Allegretti says. Can probiotics help prevent or treat C. diff infection? Probiotics are live microorganisms that can help keep the gut healthy and are found in supplements, yogurt, and other fermented foods. Two familiar examples are various strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. However, probiotics haven't been found to prevent C. diff or its recurrence. Research performed in mice and humans suggests that giving probiotics after a course of antibiotics may slow the pace of microbiome recovery. ""You're potentially delaying the recovery of your microbiome with probiotics,"" she says. How is C. diff infection treated? Ironically, C. diff therapy typically starts with antibiotics, despite the infection's proliferation due to antibiotic use. The antibiotics of choice include fidaxomicin or oral vancomycin. However, about one in five people will suffer one or more recurrences –– and with each one, yet another recurrence becomes far likelier, Dr. Allegretti says. A repeat episode may happen because people haven't disinfected their homes effectively. That leaves them open to reinfection with the same strain of C. diff while still vulnerable. When C. diff recurs, fecal microbial transplants (FMT) are considered the gold standard treatment. FMT transplants fecal matter from a healthy donor into a patient's gut, placing it there using an endoscope, enema, or within an oral capsule. This year, the FDA approved two live fecal microbiota products aimed at preventing recurrent C. diff infections. ""We haven't gotten away from antibiotics yet to treat this disease,"" says Dr. Allegretti. ""But we have a lot of preventative strategies now. It's certainly very exciting for people struggling with C. diff infections.""",1,-0.04413825,0.034505084,True

The lawsuit, filed by Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, contends that Pfizer deliberately concealed evidence linking its vaccine to myocarditis and pregnancy complications. "" Pfizer made multiple misleading statements to deceive the public about its vaccine at a time when Americans needed the truth,"" Kobach said. The legal action, initiated on Monday, June 17, claims that Pfizer falsely promoted its vaccine's efficacy despite knowing that its protection diminished over time and was ineffective against certain COVID-19 strains. (Related: Former Pfizer VP warns COVID-19 vaccines intentionally designed to HARM, MAIM AND KILL and reduce human infertility .) Additionally, Kobach argues that Pfizer misled the public by claiming its vaccine prevented coronavirus transmission, despite the company later admitting it had never studied this aspect. Kobach also accused Pfizer of working with social media platforms to ""censor speech critical"" of COVID-19 vaccines. The lawsuit alleges that Pfizer's actions violate the Kansas Consumer Protection Act and seeks unspecified monetary damages. Pfizer has denied the allegations, with a representative stating that the lawsuit has ""no merit"" and that the company’s representations about its COVID-19 vaccine have been accurate and science-based.

In November, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a similar lawsuit, accusing Pfizer of ""unlawfully misrepresenting the effectiveness of the company’s COVID-19 vaccine and attempting to censor public discussion of the product."" The controversy around Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine is not new. In June 2021, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, rare heart inflammation conditions, associated with Pfizer and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines. The warning came as reports emerged of individuals experiencing these conditions post-vaccination. Adding to the scrutiny, a study released earlier this month by Amsterdam’s Vrije Universiteit indicated that medical professionals and recipients reported ""serious injuries and deaths following vaccination"" in ""various official databases."" Researchers suggested that ""suspected"" adverse events associated with vaccination may have contributed to excess mortality in 47 countries between Jan. 1, 2020, and Dec. 31, 2022. The Kansas lawsuit also arrives amid ongoing debates about vaccine mandates and the transparency of pharmaceutical companies. The Kansas Attorney General's office argues that Pfizer’s alleged actions have undermined public trust at a critical time. Kobach emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability, particularly during a global health crisis. ""At a time when Americans needed the truth, Pfizer's actions only served to mislead and deceive the public,"" he said. The outcome of this lawsuit could have significant implications for Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies, potentially influencing future policies and public perception of vaccine safety and efficacy.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/try-this-look-snap-and-connect-for-better-memory-recall,"Try this: Look, snap, and connect for better memory recall",1,"Mnemonics, named for Mnemosyne, the Greek goddess of memory, are techniques for recalling information. Mnemonics use cues — such as images, acronyms, rhymes, and easy-to-recall phrases — to reinforce memories. One type of mnemonic is called ""look, snap, connect."" It uses visualization, word association, and storytelling to help you solidify a memory so you can recall it later. It's a great tool for retaining details of new information. Here's an example of how it works: Look. Look refers to slowing down and noticing what you want to remember — for example, the fact that you parked your car in section 3B of the parking garage. Snap. Snap means taking a mental snapshot of the item. That could be an image of the actual parking garage sign, or a more elaborate image, such as that of three bumblebees (representing the 3B section where you parked). Connect. Connect involves connecting the image and the information you want to remember — in this case, the three bees and the garage section where you parked. Imagine the bees in your car. Then when you return to the garage and pause to remember where you parked, the image of the three bees buzzing in your car will help jog your memory.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-new-weight-loss-drugs,Understanding new weight-loss drugs,1,"Some people who struggle with weight loss have been able to find assistance from several FDA-approved weight-loss medications, such as bupropion plus naltrexone (Contrave), phentermine (Adipex-P), phentermine plus topiramate (Qsymia), and orlistat (Xenical, Alli). On average, such drugs can help people lose 5% to 7% of their body weight when paired with a healthy diet and exercise. Now a newer class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes has gained attention because of their impressive weight-loss results — in many cases, 10% to 20% of a person's body weight. They're called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Tale of two drugs Two of these GLP-1 receptor agonists are FDA-approved in formulations specifically designed for weight loss in people without diabetes: liraglutide (Saxenda) and semaglutide (Wegovy). Lower-dose versions of these same active ingredients, known respectively as Victoza and Ozempic, have been used for years to help people with diabetes control their blood sugar levels. ""They can lead to substantial weight loss when used in conjunction with healthy lifestyle changes in people who are overweight or have obesity with or without type 2 diabetes,"" says Dr. A. Enrique Caballero, an endocrinologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""But whether they can be safely used for all people who simply want to lose an extra 10 to 20 pounds is questionable."" New drugs on the horizon Other GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight loss may soon be available. A recent trial, funded by Eli Lilly, the company that makes tirzepatide (Mounjaro), found that around half of participants with both obesity and type 2 diabetes lost around 15% of their body weight on the medication. Also, initial research suggests that retatrutide, a triple hormone receptor agonist (acting on receptors for GLP-1, GIP, and CGCR), may lead to weight loss of up to 25% in people with diabetes. The FDA approved tirzepatide for treating type 2 diabetes in May 2022 and is now reviewing whether to approve it to treat obesity. How the new drugs work GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic the GLP-1 hormone that is naturally released in the gastrointestinal tract in response to eating. ""The drugs prompt the body to produce more insulin after eating, limiting the elevation of blood sugar levels after meals, something particularly crucial for people with type 2 diabetes,"" says Dr. Caballero. The drugs also regulate appetite by sending signals to the brain to tell the body it is full, which inhibits overeating. It is important to remember that these medications are only approved for people who meet certain criteria. Wegovy and Saxenda are for adults diagnosed with obesity — a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher — or those with a BMI of 27 plus at least one weight-related condition, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or type 2 diabetes. The other versions of these drugs—Victoza and Ozempic — are for people with type 2 diabetes. Still, that has not stopped some doctors from prescribing these medications ""off-label"" for weight loss, which means they are used for a different purpose than explicitly intended. ""But there isn't enough evidence to know whether these drugs might be beneficial or dangerous for people who fall outside of the FDA criteria,"" says Dr. Caballero. However, the larger issue is that many people see the new drugs as a quick-fix solution. ""It is paramount to remember that all weight-loss medications are recommended as an aid in the overall strategy that centers around a healthy meal plan and regular physical activity,"" says Dr. Caballero. ""In fact, people who stop taking these drugs will often regain the weight unless they have truly established a consistent and effective change in their eating and physical activity habits."" Know the downsides When discussing with your doctor whether GLP-1 receptor agonists are worth exploring, it's important to understand their potential downsides. You might develop various gastrointestinal side effects, including gas, bloating, indigestion, nausea, or irregular bowel movements. But these issues usually resolve within a few weeks, according to Dr. Caballero. ""The lowest doses of these medications are usually given at first and then gradually increased so people have less chance of developing side effects,"" he says. Another downside is the cost. The drugs are expensive — about $1,000 to $1,500 per month. Even if you qualify for their use, the drugs are not covered by Medicare for obesity, although Victoza and Ozempic are covered by Medicare and most private insurers to treat type 2 diabetes. Finally, be aware that the drugs are given via injection into the arm, stomach, or thigh using a pen-like device with a tiny needle the width of two human hairs. (Semaglutide is given weekly, while liraglutide injections are done daily.) Semaglutide prescribed for diabetes is now also available as a daily pill called Rybelsus. You have to wait 30 minutes to an hour after taking it before you can eat or drink. Image: © 3dfoto/Getty Images",8,0.18814638,0.22184448,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/check-out-your-skin,Check out your skin,1,"You probably look at your face in the bathroom mirror a couple times each day. But do you ever take a close-up look at your entire skin? Devoting time to regular full-body check-ups can help you identify abnormalities that may signal skin cancer. ""Many skin spots and growths are related to normal aging and are not cause for concern,"" says Dr. Abigail H. Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""But you should note and monitor anything new or unusual."" Do a self-check Dr. Waldman recommends doing a head-to-toe self-exam every three to six months. Use a full-length mirror, plus a handheld mirror for hard-to-see spots, and a magnifying glass to examine smaller areas. ""If possible, have someone assist you so you don't miss anything,"" says Dr. Waldman. Here's how to do it. Look at your face, neck, ears (especially behind them), and scalp. Use a comb or a blow dryer to move your hair so that you can see better. Look at the front and back of your body in the mirror. Then, raise your arms and look at your left and right sides. Bend your elbows. Look carefully at your fingernails, palm and back of each hand, forearms (including the undersides), and upper arms. Check the back, front, and sides of your legs. Also, check the skin all over your buttocks and genital area. Sit and examine your feet, including the soles of your feet, the spaces between your toes, and your toenails. Note any new or questionable moles, sores, painful or itchy spots, raised or firm bumps, dark flaky patches, and black or brown lines along fingernails and toenails. Make sure to feel any suspicious areas for firmness, too. ""We often feel something troubling before we see it,"" says Dr. Waldman. Write down the date of your self-exams and record what you find, including the exact locations. Take photos with your phone to share with your doctor or dermatologist. ""After six to eight weeks, look at the trouble spots again, and get them checked out if they have not improved, or have changed color or size, have become painful, or easily bleed,"" says Dr. Waldman. Cosmetic changes Father Time brings us wrinkles, lines, bags under the eyes, age spots, raised rough lesions, and sagging skin. Many cosmetic treatments can treat these issues, such as botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, chemical peels, freezing liquid nitrogen sprays, laser treatments, prescription creams, and plastic surgery. Speak with your dermatologist about available options. Looking for skin cancer Melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer, and the earlier you can catch it, the better the outcome. The first sign of melanoma is usually a change in an existing mole. However, it also may appear as a new mole. Melanoma often appears on sun exposed areas, however, it also can occur in areas protected by the sun like nails. To recognize possible melanoma, follow the ABCDE guide: Asymmetry: the shape of one half doesn't match the other half Border: ragged or blurred edges Color: red, brown, blue, black, or white, and the shades may be uneven Diameter: about a quarter of an inch or larger, although some can be smaller Evolution: any changes in size, shape, or color. Here are some other skin issues to look out for during your self-exam: Freckles. Monitor large, irregular ones. If they grow or change appearance, this can be a prelude to a specific form of melanoma called lentigo maligna melanoma. Problem freckles often appear on the face, upper shoulders, chest, and arms. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). ""Both are types of skin cancer, but they are slow-growing, usually not life-threatening, and easy to treat if caught early,"" says Dr. Waldman. BCC may look like a bleeding pimple, an open sore, a red patch, a shiny pink growth, or a scar. SCC resembles a crusted, scaly red bump, patch, or wart. Both cancers appear in areas frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face, rim of the ear, lower lip, balding scalp, neck, hands, arms, shoulders, back, and legs. Actinic keratoses (AKs). These growths are rough, gritty, and sometimes painful. They can be flat or slightly raised and appear in different colors, such as red, tan, pink, skin-colored, brown, or silver. AKs often appear on the face, tips of the ears, bald spots, and backs of the arms and hands. ""While AKs are not initially dangerous, get them looked at, as they may lead to squamous cell carcinoma if left alone,"" says Dr. Waldman.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/staying-regular,Staying regular,1,"Maybe you notice your spouse visits the bathroom every morning after a cup of coffee and marvel at his regularity. Perhaps you don't share that level of frequency — and wonder if you should. But what does ""staying regular"" really mean? The answer is different for every person, reflecting such factors as age, diet, physical activity, daily routine, and hydration levels, says Dr. Lawrence Borges, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Mt. Auburn Hospital. For some people, being regular means having a bowel movement once or twice a day. But it could also mean once or twice a week — or anything in between. ""Normal"" is whatever's normal for you. But many people still fret if they don't have frequent bowel movements, he says. ""People have in their minds that one perfect poop a day is the goal, but the reality is everyone's pattern may be different from that,"" Dr. Borges says. ""I try to stress that there's no single right answer, no perfect or correct pattern."" When routines change Stress alone is one negative offshoot of irregular bowel habits. Another is disrupted sleep, since people may awaken in discomfort or need to use the bathroom at odd hours. ""But being irregular, on its own, is common and not necessarily a sign of something wrong,"" Dr. Borges says. While how often you have a bowel movement doesn't matter, what does matter is that the pattern remains relatively consistent and you feel comfortable. With healthy bowel movements, you'll also feel you're completely emptying the rectum, not bloated or in pain, and don't have to strain hard to get the job done. Spotting a problem starts with noticing a dramatic change in what's normal for you. If you typically have one bowel movement a day and suddenly you're having them only once a week, for example — and you can't explain this change — you should see your doctor. That visit is even more pressing if you're also having other symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, unintended weight loss, blood in your stool, or a change in stool consistency. ""These are alarming changes that should prompt an evaluation,"" Dr. Borges says. Digestion direction Many people who ask Dr. Borges about being regular really want to know how to avoid constipation. Again, there's no single answer, with a menu of options to help keep digestion humming. In addition to mainstay advice such eating whole grains and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, exercising regularly (which keeps your colon moving, too), and drinking plenty of water, Dr. Borges offers this guidance. Maintain a toileting schedule. Try visiting the bathroom at the same time every day, such as in the morning after breakfast. This can help train your body to go at the same time in a place you're comfortable. ""If you're racing out the door for work and not leaving time to take advantage of that readiness, that's not helpful — you may not be able to take advantage of it later in the day,"" he says. Heed your body's signals. Along those lines, when you feel the urge to have a bowel movement, don't put it off until later. ""The opposite is also true: just because you haven't gone doesn't mean you should try to force it,"" he says. ""If your body's not ready, you may not be able to go because no stool is ready to be expelled."" Try a toilet stool. Toilet footstools have emerged as a quietly popular bathroom accessory, with devotees saying it helps them have more comfortable, effective bowel movements. ""The purpose is to change the angle and orientation of the rectum to make it more of a straight path to expel stool,"" he says. ""Some people find when they raise their feet six inches, they do have an easier time."" Image: © brizmaker/Getty Images",1,0.34713668,-0.14805068,True

The debacle raises serious questions about academic integrity, industry influence, and the politicization of the misinfo debate. (Article republished from GreenMedInfo.com ) McGill's Disinformation Debacle: Debunking the ""Disinformation Dozen"" In March 2021, McGill University's Office for Science and Society published an article by Jonathan Jarry titled ""A Dozen Misguided Influencers Spread Most of the Anti-Vaccination Content on Social Media.""1 Citing a report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), Jarry claimed that ""two-thirds of anti-vaccine content shared or posted on Facebook and Twitter between February 1 and March 16, 2021, can be attributed to just twelve individuals."" 1,2 Among those named in this so-called ""Disinformation Dozen"" was Sayer Ji, founder of the natural health website GreenMedInfo.com. Jarry painted Ji and the others as dangerous spreaders of ""blatant and harmful misinformation"" with outsized influence. 1 However, a bombshell statement from Meta (formerly Facebook) has revealed fatal flaws in the CCDH report, calling into question McGill's uncritical endorsement of its claims and the legitimacy of Jarry's attacks on Ji and the other named individuals. Debunked Data, Baseless Accusations In August 2021, Meta's VP of Content Policy Monika Bickert directly refuted the CCDH's central claim, stating: ""There isn't any evidence to support this claim. Moreover, focusing on such a small group of people distracts from the complex challenges we all face in addressing misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines."" 3 Bickert revealed that the CCDH report ""analyzed only a narrow set of 483 pieces of content over six weeks from only 30 groups,"" arguing that this cherry-picked sample was ""in no way representative of the hundreds of millions of posts that people have shared about COVID-19 vaccines in the past months on Facebook."" 3 She also highlighted the CCDH's lack of transparency in how it categorized content as ""anti-vax"" and selected the groups it analyzed. 3 Despite relying heavily on the CCDH report, Jarry's article failed to critically examine these serious methodological issues, instead presenting the disinfo dozen narrative as established fact.

Why do these form? A. These nail spots are a common occurrence — and usually don't signal a serious problem — but it may take some sleuthing to figure out why you've developed them. The most likely cause of white spots on the nails is minor trauma of some sort, whether from a rough manicure involving filing and cuticle cutting or excessive tapping of the hands and fingers on a hard surface. Sometimes, dry, white areas on the nails form when you leave nail polish on for too long — weeks or longer — which doesn't allow the nail to shed cells normally. A fungal infection could also be the culprit, depositing a white film that may cover a few areas or even all of the nail. Certain more serious conditions can also cause half or more of the nail to appear white. These include low iron levels, kidney disease, or scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). If hand trauma or wearing nail polish for prolonged periods don't seem likely causes of your nail spots, ask your doctor for her assessment. Letting the spots disappear on their own could be a lengthy process, since it can take six or more months for fingernails to grow out. Image: © Nadya So/Getty Images",0,0.09121446,-0.19709313,True

But most studies have involved people in Mediterranean countries, such as Spain. Now an observational study published online Aug. 8, 2023, by Mayo Clinic Proceedings suggests what experts have long suspected: the lifestyle has benefits for people living in other parts of the world, too. Researchers, including some from Harvard, analyzed diet assessments and self-reported lifestyle habits of about 111,000 people (ages 40 to 75) in England, Wales, and Scotland. Participants were followed for up to nine years. People who adhered most closely to a Mediterranean lifestyle had a 28% lower risk of dying from cancer and a 29% lower risk of dying prematurely from any cause, compared with people whose lifestyles were most different from the Mediterranean pattern. The authors say the findings indicate that people outside Mediterranean countries can use their own locally available products to follow a Mediterranean-style eating pattern, which emphasizes olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains; moderate amounts of fish, poultry, cheese, and wine; and limited portions of red or processed meats.

Exercise promotes the birth of new brain cells and increases the production of enzymes that break down amyloid proteins associated with dementia. Sleep also plays a role in cognitive health, flushing those amyloid proteins out of the brain. The right amount of sleep is so important that a lack of Z's may sabotage the cognitive perks of exercise, according to a study published July 2023 in The Lancet Healthy Longevity. Researchers evaluated the periodic memory test results and self-reported sleep and exercise habits of almost 9,000 dementia-free people (ages 50 and older) who were followed over 10 years. Among people who started the study at age 50 or 60 and reported the highest rates of exercise, those who said they got less than six hours of sleep per night had faster rates of cognitive decline than those who said they got six to eight hours of sleep per night. For people who started the study at age 70 and reported high rates of exercise, the amount of sleep they got didn't seem to affect their rate of cognitive decline.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-a-healthy-gut-helps-your-heart,How a healthy gut helps your heart,1,"Your gut microbiome — a collection of trillions of microorganisms inhabiting your intestinal tract — has wide-ranging effects on your health. Your unique mix of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses reflects your genes, your age, the medications you take — but most of all, what you eat. Over the past two decades, numerous studies have explored how gut microbes and their breakdown products (metabolites) affect factors linked with heart disease. For the most part, the findings support the same basic advice health experts recommend: Follow a mostly plant-based eating pattern, and cut back on highly processed foods. Doing so can help promote a more diverse, healthier microbiome. ""The standard American diet — appropriately called SAD — features a lot of processed foods that are high in sugar, artificial sweeteners, and unhealthy fats,"" says Dr. Uma Naidoo, director of nutritional and metabolic psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. This nutrient-poor diet can lead to dysbiosis, an overgrowth of harmful microbes. When bad microbes thrive in the gut, they form pro-inflammatory breakdown products and toxins, Dr. Naidoo explains. The resulting low-grade, bodywide inflammation contributes to obesity, poor mental health, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Animal vs. plant-based foods One metabolite of interest is trimethylamine (TMA), which is created when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). While some research suggests a link between TMAO and artery-clogging plaque, the evidence isn't consistent. Still, the advice to limit red meat consumption — the main source of TMA in the diet — makes sense. But according to Dr. Naidoo, there's no need to avoid those animal-based foods, which most Americans aren't especially keen on doing. Instead, people should focus more on what they're not eating — namely, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Fermented foods Eating fermented foods may help dampen inflammation in the body. When shopping, look for the words ""contains live cultures"" when choosing yogurt or kefir, a yogurtlike drink with a tart flavor and a thinner consistency than yogurt. While both products are usually made with dairy milk, they also come in nondairy versions made from almond, coconut, or oat milk. Another beverage, kombucha, is a fizzy, tart, slightly sweet drink made from fermented tea that's often flavored with fruits and herbs. Look for brands without added sugar. For fermented products made from vegetables, look in the refrigerated section and check for the words ""naturally fermented"" on the label. When you open the jar, check for telltale bubbles in the liquid, which signal that live organisms are inside. Most supermarket pickles are preserved with vinegar and not made with a natural fermentation process using water and salt. For sauerkraut (pickled cabbage), choose raw or nonpasteurized products. If you're a fan of spicy food, try kimchi, a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish from Korea made with a mix of garlic, salt, vinegar, and chili peppers. From Japan, there's miso (a strong, salty paste made from soybeans fermented with brown rice) and tempeh (a firm, chewy product made from fermented soybeans). Diversify your diet A woefully small percentage of adults — only about 10% — eats the recommended daily amount of fruit (one-and-a-half to two cups) or vegetables (two to three cups). Don't limit yourself to only a few favorites like apples or broccoli, says Dr. Naidoo. ""Eat a wide variety of different fruits and vegetables on a regular basis to bring biodiversity to your microbiome,"" she says. Despite a recent uptick, whole grains make up less than 16% of the average American's total grain intake. Whole grains such as oats, quinoa, spelt, and barley are healthier choices than most ""whole-wheat"" bread, which isn't always made with 100% whole grains. Other foods that promote gut health include beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds. Fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains are good sources fermentable or prebiotic fiber, which gets broken down by bacteria in your colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds then circulate through the bloodstream and interact with receptors on cells that quell inflammation. These fatty acids also appear to play a role in keeping blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels in check. You can also increase good gut bacteria levels by consuming probiotics, which are found in fermented foods (see box). ""Try adding a little bit of these foods to your meals and then grow from there,"" Dr. Naidoo suggests. Image: © marekuliasz/Getty Images",3,0.37536305,0.13902931,True

But in terms of heart-related benefits, does it matter if you rack up most of your exercise minutes over just one or two days instead of spreading them out over an entire week? Earlier research has suggested that both patterns are equally beneficial. But those findings relied on people to self-report their exercise, which can be unreliable. Now, a study of nearly 90,000 adults who used wristband monitors to record their physical activity has reached a similar conclusion. ""The findings add to the body of literature showing that it doesn't matter when you get your exercise, as long as you get the recommended amount each week,"" says Dr. I-Min Lee, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert on the role of physical activity in preventing disease.

""Usually, weekend warriors are seen as people who don't exercise on weekdays but then take a long hike or play two hours of tennis on Saturday or Sunday,"" she says. Instead, researchers used participants' physical activity data, which were recorded over seven consecutive days, to categorize them into different groups. About two-thirds of them met the federal physical activity guidelines (see ""How much exercise?""). About 42% were deemed ""weekend warriors,"" meaning they met the guidelines but got half or more of their total physical activity — not just exercise — on just one or two days. Another 24% were ""regularly active,"" meeting the guidelines with activity spread out over the week. The remaining 34% didn't meet the guidelines. After roughly six years, the researchers found that participants who followed either activity pattern had a similarly lower risk of heart attack, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure compared with people in the inactive group. Historically, experts have encouraged people to be regularly active, mainly because anecdotal reports suggest that weekend warriors may be more prone to injuries. But this study didn't find any difference in injury rates between the two active groups. That's likely because of the definition used in the study: the ""warrior"" group wasn't necessarily doing the types of high-intensity activities or sports often associated with muscle sprains and related injuries, Dr. Lee says. Best time of day to exercise? Whatever works for you Are there any pros or cons associated with exercising at certain times of the day? Research results are all over the map, says Harvard Medical School professor Dr. I-Min Lee. The best strategy is to exercise when it's most convenient and comfortable for you, whether that's the first thing in the morning, early evening, or anytime in between. If you exercise early in the day, you can check it off your to-do list and can take advantage of the ""feel-good"" brain chemicals, serotonin and dopamine, that are released during exercise. But afternoon workouts also have some benefits. Your joints and muscles may be more limber later in the day, which may make exercise feel less taxing. If you experience a midafternoon lull, exercise can be a good way to reinvigorate yourself. If you can, find a buddy who likes to exercise at the same time, so you can go together and hold each other accountable. Likewise, there's little evidence to suggest that coordinating your exercise with respect to mealtimes has any good or bad effects. Some people find that vigorous exercise right before a meal curbs their appetite, while others find the opposite is true. A pre-breakfast workout works well for certain people. But having a small, carbohydrate-rich snack (like a banana or a slice of whole-grain toast) at least half an hour before exercising may provide a helpful energy boost, says Dr. Lee. Short bouts of activity count Wristband devices enable researchers to capture all the short bouts of activity people do throughout the day that they may not remember. ""If you do jumping jacks occasionally while watching television, you won't necessarily recall that activity the way you remember that you play tennis three times a week,"" says Dr. Lee. Similarly, people whose daily commutes include a few 10-minute bouts of walking may not consider that as counting toward their moderate-intensity activity minutes. But these small spurts of activity — sometimes referred to as exercise ""snacks"" — seem to be beneficial. If you're sitting for a long stretch, stand up and move around for a few minutes every hour. Activating your muscles even just briefly can help improve your body's ability to keep your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol in check. It's also worth noting that if you don't meet the physical activity guidelines, you'll still benefit from doing even small amounts of exercise — and every minute counts.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/saturated-fat-how-much-is-okay,Saturated fat: How much is okay?,1,"Q. I was very interested in the May 2023 Heart Letter feature about Dr. Ludwig's research, which suggests that eating fewer carbohydrates and more protein and fat can help with weight loss and lead to better health outcomes. But his menus and recipes include foods that contain saturated fat, such as meat and full-fat dairy products. For many years, we heard from reputable sources that we should aways limit saturated fat. This is very confusing! Can you explain? A. You're right about advice to limit saturated fat in your diet, which stems from the fact that eating too much saturated fat tends to raise levels of harmful LDL cholesterol. But not everyone agrees on what the limit should be. The American Heart Association advises a limit of 5% to 6% of your daily calories, while the Dietary Guidelines for Americans says 10% is fine. Registered dietitian Kathy McManus, who directs the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, suggests a happy medium of 7%. That happens to be the typical amount of saturated fat in the heart-friendly Mediterranean-style diet. She analyzed the nutrient composition of the sample menu in the feature you referenced (""Cut calories or carbohydrates for better heart health?"" in the May 2023 Heart Letter). The three meals and snack include about 1,900 calories, which is just below the 2,000 daily calories recommended for the average woman. About 12% of the calories in Dr. Ludwig's sample menu are from saturated fat, which isn't too much higher than the Dietary Guidelines limit of 10%. Also, a 1.3-ounce piece of dark chocolate contains about eight grams of saturated fat, which is close to one-third of the 25 total grams of saturated fat in this menu. If you omitted the chocolate, the saturated fat in this sample menu would be around 8% of the total calories. But here's the thing: Most people don't want to spend time calculating their calories or saturated fat, which is why McManus and many other nutrition experts recommend focusing more on eating mostly whole or minimally processed foods, which is also one of Dr. Ludwig's main messages. As she notes, his menu doesn't include refined, processed carbohydrates like white rice, white bread, sugary drinks, or other sweets. Muffins, cookies, pie, and other baked goods often contain quite a bit of saturated fat because they're made with butter, lard, vegetable shortening, or tropical oils such as palm or palm kernel oil. Finally, although dark chocolate has saturated fat, it also contains heart-protecting plant compounds known as flavanols, which appear to outweigh the risk from saturated fat, according to nutrition experts at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Image: © fcafotodigital/Getty Images",3,0.3493594,0.07141088,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-sleep-do-you-actually-need-202310302986,How much sleep do you actually need?,1,"On average, how many hours do you sleep each night? For most healthy adults, guidelines suggest at least seven hours of slumber. But these are general recommendations and not strict rules. ""Some people need less than seven hours, while others might need more,"" says Eric Zhou with the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Do you need more or less sleep time? We get it: you know people who swear they only need five hours of sleep per night, yet you feel foggy unless you log in eight to nine hours. The major reason for individual differences is that we often look at sleep the wrong way. ""Instead of focusing exclusively on the number of hours we sleep per night, we should also consider our sleep quality,"" says Zhou. Sleep quality means how well you sleep during the night. Did you sleep straight through? Or did you have periods where you woke up? If so, did it take you a long time to fall asleep? How did you feel when you woke up? ""If you awaken refreshed and feel like you have the energy to get through your day, then I would worry less about the exact number of hours you're sleeping,"" says Zhou. How does sleep quality affect your health? Sleep quality is vital for our overall health. Research has shown that people with poor sleep quality are at a higher risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and mental health issues like anxiety and depression. And that's not all. ""Poor sleep also can increase daytime fatigue and make it more difficult to enjoy life,"" says Zhou. Yet it's normal for people's sleep patterns to change over time. ""Many people are not going to sleep in their 50s and 60s exactly like they did in their 20s,"" says Zhou. Many of these changes are age-related. For instance, your circadian rhythm — which regulates many bodily functions, including our sleep-wake cycle — can naturally get disrupted over time. This means people spend less time each night in restorative slow-wave sleep. Production of melatonin, the sleep hormone, also gradually declines with age. ""As a result of these changes, when we get older we may start to wake up earlier than we did when we were younger, or wake up more frequently during the night,"" says Zhou. How can you track sleep quality? How can you better understand the factors likely contributing to your sleep quality? One way is to keep a sleep diary where you track and record your sleep. Every day, record the time you went to bed, how long it took you to fall asleep, whether you had any nighttime awakenings (and if so, how long you were awake), and at what time you woke up. Also, keep track of how you feel upon awakening and at the end of the day. ""After a week or two, review the information to see if you can identify certain patterns that may be affecting your sleep quality, then make adjustments,"" says Zhou. For example, if you have trouble falling asleep, go to bed half an hour later than usual but maintain the same wake-up time. ""It is common for people struggling with their sleep to try to get more sleep by staying in bed longer, but this disrupts their sleep patterns and diminishes their sleep quality,"" says Zhou. Three key strategies to support the quality of your sleep Other strategies that can help support good sleep quality include: maintaining a consistent wake time, especially on weekends limiting daytime naps to 20 to 30 minutes, and at least six hours before the desired bedtime being physically active. When it comes to sleep quality, consistency is vital. ""People with good sleep quality often have a predictable sleep window where their sleep occurs,"" says Zhou. ""Good sleepers are likely to sleep around the same number of hours and stay asleep through the night."" The bottom line on getting restful sleep It's unrealistic to expect perfect sleep every night. ""If you have trouble sleeping one or two nights during the week, that can be related to the natural ebbs and flows of life,"" says Zhou. ""You may have eaten a big meal that day, drank too much alcohol while watching football, or had a stressful argument with someone. When tracking sleep quality, look at your overall sleep health week-to-week, not how you slept this Tuesday compared to last Tuesday."" If you are doing all the right things for your sleep but still do not feel rested upon waking, talk to your doctor. This can help you rule out a sleep disorder like sleep apnea, or another health issue that can interfere with sleep such as acid reflux or high blood pressure. Other factors that can affect the quality of your sleep include taking multiple medicines, depression, anxiety, loneliness, and environmental changes like temperature, noise, and light exposure.",5,0.26174012,-0.05911518,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-body-fat-percentage-determine-whether-you-are-overweight,Can body fat percentage determine whether you are overweight?,1,"On call Q. My fitness club recently measured my body fat at 14%. What are the normal ranges for older men, and is body fat percentage a good way to determine a healthy weight? A. A 14% body fat is considered excellent for a healthy male, but it may not indicate a ""healthy"" weight. Body fat percentage, just like weight, depends on multiple factors that can vary per person, such as overall health, metabolism (how your body burns excess calories for energy or stores them as fat), amount of activity, and musculature. Also, where you store body fat has a significant impact on health risks. Even if your weight is close to the normal range, a large waist size may mean you have an unhealthy amount of belly fat (visceral fat). Larger amounts of belly fat increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Therefore, it's possible that you could have a good overall body fat percentage yet still be at higher risk if the fat is concentrated at your waistline. Rather than just relying on one measurement like body fat percentage or body mass index (a calculation based on both weight and height) to determine if you are overweight, I suggest using two measurements: waist size and ratio of waist size to hip size. Waist size. Wrap a measuring tape just above your navel to find your waist size. Ideally men should strive for 35 inches or less. Ratio of waist size to hip size. Measure your hips around the widest part of your buttocks. Then divide your waist size by your hip size. The ideal waist-to-hip ratio for men is 0.9. If your number is higher, you may have too much belly fat. — by Howard LeWine, M.D. Editor in Chief, Harvard Men's Health Watch",3,0.35309264,0.04452461,True

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/get-back-your-social-life-to-boost-thinking-memory-and-health,"Get back your social life to boost thinking, memory, and health",1,"We are wired to be social. Just think how good it feels to have a nice chat with a friend. Those feelings can be hard to come by if your loved ones are far away or you've lost touch with friends. But the benefits of an active social life are significant, going beyond warm, fuzzy feelings. Connection brings a treasure trove of important health benefits and cognitive perks. And if you've been more isolated or out of touch with friends lately, it's time to take back your social life and reap the rewards. Connection and cognition Many studies suggest that having strong social networks (friends who support or help you) or taking part in social activities is associated with a reduced risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia. For example, a study of more 66,000 people in Europe and Israel (average age 70), published online Oct. 25, 2021, by Ageing & Society, found that people with the highest levels of social connectedness (good friends) and engagement (activities) had the highest scores on cognition tests, compared with people who had the lowest levels of social connectedness and engagement. And an earlier study of 1,100 adults (average age about 80) followed for five years found that the people who were the most socially active had 70% less cognitive decline compared with those who had the lowest rates of social activities. These studies were observational and don't prove conclusively that socializing protects cognition, but we know that it engages the brain in ways that promote better cognition. ""Social activities cause us to use our brains more than almost any other activity,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a neurologist and chief of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology at VA Boston Healthcare System. ""All of our senses — vision, hearing, smell — are engaged during social activities. We process people's facial expression, body language, tone of voice, and speech content, and analyze what's being said and the emotions behind the words. In turn, that influences how we react: our facial expression, body language, tone of voice, speech, and actions. Putting the brain to work like that strengthens the connections between brain cells and creates new ones, too."" Other health benefits Beyond cognition, socialization also appears to help with the following aspects of health. Longevity. Being social protects us against loneliness and isolation, which are associated with chronic disease and premature death. Stress reduction. ""People are emotion regulators. When someone you trust listens to you, you can feel your body calm down. Your blood pressure returns to baseline, your levels of stress hormones decrease. It takes us out of 'fight or flight' mode, which can gradually break down the body if we're stressed all the time,"" says Dr. Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Mood. ""The way people react to you reminds you of aspects of yourself, aspects that you may forget. It gets you out of your own head and your worries, and reinforces your sense of being competent. That boosts your mood,"" Dr. Waldinger notes. ""And connecting with people you haven't spoken to in a long time can remind you that you have this history with these people, you belong to this group, and you matter. That also boosts mood."" Reach out to friends All of us tend to lose touch with old friends. People move; circumstances change. But it's worth the effort to have some social interaction in your life, even if it's not in person. How do you get the ball rolling? Dr. Waldinger suggests something low-key. ""Send a card, an email, a text, or a message on Facebook,"" he says. ""You just want to see if someone might reply."" What should you say in the initial contact, especially if it's been a long time? ""Just say you're thinking of the person and want to see how they're doing,"" Dr. Waldinger advises. Other icebreakers include saying you were thinking about how you used to do a particular activity together, or sharing a nice memory of something you both experienced, such as a graduation or a successful project. You might even include a one- or two-sentence update on how you're doing and what you've been up to lately. What happens next? ""See if the person reciprocates,"" Dr. Waldinger says. ""If so, build from there. Ask if the person would like to have coffee or take a walk with you sometime soon. If the person is far away, ask they're available for a catch-up phone call or video chat."" Keep up the connection It may take time to rebuild the closeness or the frequency of contact you once had with a friend, if that's what you both want. So be patient, and keep reaching out to the person. How much contact will it take to boost your cognition and health? ""We don't have an amount of social connection that is 'enough' or a lower amount that is 'not enough.' Studies suggest that more is better, and some is better than none for improving your thinking and memory,"" Dr. Budson says. So why not rekindle several friendships? If they bring you joy, and if they offer important, healthy side effects, then you have nothing to lose and much to gain. Image: © FatCamera/Getty Images",7,0.20608266,-0.059908144,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-bitter-truth-about-added-sugar,The bitter truth about added sugar,1,"Extra sugar can cause big health problems. Here's how you can reduce your intake. There's a good chance you eat way too much sugar every day — and don't even know it. American adults consume an average of 77 grams (almost 20 teaspoons) of sugar per day, which adds up to around 60 pounds of added sugar per year, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Added sugar refers to sugars and syrups that are included in food products and beverages to increase sweetness and texture and extend shelf life. (This is different from natural sugar found in fruit, vegetables, and dairy.) A little extra sugar may seem harmless, but ingested often, it can contribute to a variety of health issues, like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. ""There's consistent evidence that all that excessive added sugar intake is a significant threat to one's health,"" says Dr. Qi Sun, an associate professor of nutrition at Harvard-affiliated T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Where the sugar is Sugar-sweetened drinks are the largest source of added sugar in the American diet. They include any of the following: regular soda juice drinks, like fruit punch and juice cocktails energy drinks sports drinks sweet tea sweetened coffee drinks Whole (100%) juices, which contain only the sugars from the extracted fruit or vegetable are healthier, but you don't get the benefits of fiber and other natural ingredients as you do in whole fruit. Many food products also contain high amounts of added sugar, even if they are not always sweet-tasting. The most common are fruit-flavored yogurt, breakfast cereals, processed instant meals, soups, tomato sauces, snacks, and cured meats. Another source of added sugar is condiments, such as ketchup, relish, barbecue sauce, and salad dressings. Look closer at food labels Added sugars are identified on a product's ingredient label. They often are called by names other than ""sugar."" Here are the ones you should look for, according to the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2015–2020: agave nectar brown sugar cane crystals cane sugar corn sweetener corn syrup crystalline fructose dextrose evaporated cane juice fructose fruit juice concentrates glucose honey invert sugar lactose malt sugar malt syrup maltose maple syrup molasses raw sugar sucrose Too much is too much Research has found that too much added sugar can affect your health in many ways. For instance, a study published online Sept. 3, 2019, by JAMA Internal Medicine looked at more than 450,000 people over a 16-year period and found that those who drank two or more 8-ounce glasses of sugar-sweetened soda a day had a higher risk of dying for any reason than people who drank less than a glass each month. Drinking large amounts of artificially sweetened sodas was also associated with earlier death. Consuming too much sugar also can increase chronic inflammation. And higher sugar consumption has also been linked to a higher risk of frailty as we age. A study in the May 2018 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that older adults who consumed more than 36 grams per day of added sugar were more likely to become frail compared with those who consumed less than 15 grams daily. One of the biggest threats from added sugar is weight gain. Your body doesn't know the difference between natural sugar and added sugar. They both get processed the same way. The important difference is how fast the body digests them. ""Foods with natural sugar — fruits and vegetables — also contain soluble fiber, which means your body digests the accompanying sugars more slowly,"" says Dr. Sun. In comparison, added sugar lacks fiber, so it's absorbed much faster. ""This can cause blood sugar levels to spike, leading to an insulin surge, which can increase hunger,"" says Dr. Sun. Substitutes for sugar Another way to avoid added sugar is to switch it out for other sweeteners. Add whole or frozen fruit to cereal or oatmeal, tea, and yogurt. Also, try antioxidant-rich spices like ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Manage your intake The AHA suggests men consume no more than 36 grams (about 9 teaspoons) of added sugar per day. This is approximately equal to what's in a 12-ounce can of soda. The best ways to control your intake of added sugar are to read food labels and cut out sugar-sweetened beverages, suggests Dr. Sun. ""For labels, note the number of grams of sugar per serving and the total number of servings,"" he says. ""The label might say 5 grams of sugar per serving, but you might eat three or four servings, so you end up consuming a lot more added sugar."" A good rule is to choose products that have less than 10 grams per serving and to monitor how many servings you eat. Instead of buying sugar-sweetened beverages, make your own healthier versions. Begin with plain or sparkling water and then add slices of fresh fruit or an ounce or two of 100% fruit juice for flavor. Image: © OcusFocus/Getty Images",3,0.37328154,0.112679616,True

Federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against Haim for revealing publicly that Texas Children's has been ""transitioning"" children who want to become LGBTs, this after the facility's administrators previously claimed that such mutilative procedures had ceased in accordance with state law. The administration of President Biden has been pursuing charges against Haim since last year when the physician leaked documents to a journalist showing that Texas Children's has been mutilating the genitals of children as young as 11 in violation of Texas law. ""They wanted to intimidate me into silence using every technique the federal leviathan had at their disposal, but they failed,"" Haim bragged on X. ""The only way to lose is to submit to corruption. It's time to fight back harder than ever!"" (Related: In 2023, a mutilated ""de-transitioner"" by the name of Soren Aldaco sued doctors for their coercive efforts to opt for trans surgeries.) Is Biden punishing Haim for becoming a whistleblower? The scheme goes back to May 2023 when Haim blew the whistle on the secret ""sex change"" procedures that were still taking place at Texas Children's. Though the hospital claimed that its gender clinic had been shut down, Haim revealed that it was still in operation – just in secret. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had warned the medical facility that ""gender-affirming care"" for children is now strictly forbidden under state laws that now deem it as a form of child abuse.

Documents leaked by Haim show that just three days after Texas Children's issued a statement in March 2022 claiming it was then in compliance with state law, physicians at the hospital proceeded to implant a hormone device inside the body of a young girl. Since that time, the number of ""gender-affirming"" procedures at Texas Children's has only increased rather than decreased. Keep in mind as well that Texas Children's is one of the largest pediatric hospitals in the entire country. Haim's leaks led to a magazine called City Journal publishing an article about the matter. That same week, the Texas Legislature passed a new law confirming that ""sex change"" procedures for children are banned in the Lone Star State. When Haim revealed that underage patients were still being ""treated"" with transitions at Texas Children's, he says he did not include any personal information about the patients. Even so, ""heavily armed"" federal agents showed up at Haim's door informing him that he now faces four felony charges for allegedly violating a patient privacy law, reports indicate. Haim was also given a summons to appear in court. It is somewhat odd for the Biden regime to be the entity going after Haim for all this. After all, Biden and his people support LGBT ""transitioning,"" and Haim blew the lid on it. At the same time, it appears as though the Biden regime is punishing Haim for blowing the lid on the secret operation at Texas Children's. ""You can't make this up – pure evil,"" commented author and conservative filmmaker Mike Cernovich about what the Biden regime is doing by going after someone for exposing ""experiments on children.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/are-certain-types-of-sugars-healthier-than-others-2019052916699,Are certain types of sugars healthier than others?,1,"Most people consume many different types of sugars from a variety of foods and beverages in their diet. A high intake of sugar is linked to an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. But whether some sugars are healthier (or worse) than others remains a question of interest to many. Sugar basics Sugar provides energy that our cells need to survive. Sugar is a type of carbohydrate, a macronutrient that provides energy (in the form of calories) from foods and beverages we consume. Carbohydrates are classified into two subtypes of sugar: monosaccharides, or ""simple sugars"" (consisting of one molecule),` and disaccharides (two molecules). The monosaccharides include glucose, fructose, and galactose. The major disaccharides include sucrose (one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule), lactose (one glucose molecule and one galactose molecule), and maltose (two glucose molecules). Fructose, glucose, and sucrose are found naturally in fruit and some vegetables, while lactose is found in dairy and maltose is found in germinating grains. Fructose and glucose are also found naturally in honey, as well as in common table sugar. Added versus natural sugars An increasingly important distinction among sugars as they pertain to health is whether they occur naturally in foods such as fruit, vegetables, and dairy, or whether they are added sugars (added to foods and beverages during manufacturing, processing, or preparation). Sugary beverages are the greatest source of added sugar in the diet, followed by sweets and grains such as ready-to-eat cereals. Intake of added sugar, particularly from beverages, has been associated with weight gain and higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Natural and added sugars are metabolized the same way in our bodies. But for most people, consuming natural sugars in foods such as fruit is not linked to negative health effects, since the amount of sugar tends to be modest and is ""packaged"" with fiber and other healthful nutrients. On the other hand, our bodies do not need, or benefit from, eating added sugar. Are all added sugars created equal? Added sugars come from a variety of sources and go by many different names, yet they are all a source of extra calories and are metabolized by the body the same way. A common misconception exists that some added sugars such as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) are unhealthy, while others such as agave nectar (from the succulent plant) are healthy. The reality is that most added sugars are composed of glucose and fructose in varying ratios. For example, sucrose (common table sugar) is 50% glucose and 50% fructose; the most common form of HFCS (which is produced from corn starch through industrial processing) contains 45% glucose and 55% fructose; and some types of agave nectar contain up to 90% fructose and 10% glucose. Whether an added sugar contains more or less fructose versus glucose has little impact on health. Some types of added sugar — honey, for example — may also contain micronutrients or other bioactive compounds. But these properties have little benefit when it comes to metabolic health. In short, it's best to limit all sources of added sugar to within the recommended intake level. For most people, one type of sugar isn't better than another.

""While mortality rates were 36% (n=25) and 27% (n=15) for non-COVID-19 [non-vaccinated] and [vaccinated] patients, respectively, in COVID-19 patients mortality rates were 37% [for non-vaccinated patients] and 70% [for vaccinated patients].""

Early death is not the only risk factor associated with COVID injections. We also know that COVID jabs are linked to other severe health complications such as potentially fatal blood, heart, and neurological conditions. The largest ever global study on the subject found that COVID injections are dangerous in general. This study was published around the time that AstraZeneca withdrew its viral-vector COVID injection from the global market following the revelation that the shot causes deadly Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS).

The only perhaps possible benefit of getting injected – emphasis on the word perhaps – is to prevent hospitalization, the study suggests, this being what we were all told from the very beginning was the only potential benefit of getting shot. The study authors made it clear that they in no way investigated this possibility because their data does not address it.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sleep-paralysis-causes-symptoms-and-treatments,"Sleep paralysis: Causes, symptoms, and treatments",1,"For many people, sleep paralysis is a distressing condition affecting their sleep and emotional health. While there is still much to learn about sleep paralysis, understanding the source of sleep paralysis symptoms can help with treatment and prevention. What is sleep paralysis? Sleep paralysis is a temporary sense of paralysis that occurs between stages of wakefulness and sleep. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you are conscious but unable to move or speak. One of the primary differences between sleep paralysis and other sleep states such as dreaming and nightmares is that you are awake during an episode of sleep paralysis. Types of sleep paralysis There are two types of sleep paralysis: Isolated sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis is isolated when it appears without any other signs of narcolepsy or other sleep disorders. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder in which a person may frequently fall into sudden episodes of deep sleep at any time. Recurrent sleep paralysis. This condition involves multiple sleep paralysis episodes over time. Recurrent sleep paralysis can be associated with narcolepsy. In many cases, both types of sleep paralysis occur together. In this case, you may experience recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (RISP). RISP involves ongoing instances of sleep paralysis without an association with narcolepsy. When does sleep paralysis typically occur? Sleep paralysis usually occurs when falling asleep waking from sleep at both times. Sleep paralysis is considered a parasomnia, or an abnormal behavior that occurs during sleep. Because it is linked to the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of the sleep cycle, sleep paralysis is considered a REM parasomnia. During REM, the eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming occurs, but the muscles of the body are relaxed to reduce movement. This muscle relaxation is controlled by the brain and called REM atonia. The purpose of atonia is to keep you from acting out your dreams, and typically ends when you wake up. However, during sleep paralysis you wake up suddenly from REM, regaining awareness even as your muscles are still relaxed, in atonia. For this reason, sleep paralysis may feel like temporary paralysis. In addition to atonia, the mental imagery of REM sleep also seems to persist even as you are in an aware state. How long does sleep paralysis last? An episode of sleep paralysis can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The episode usually ends on its own, or when someone moves or touches you or speaks to you. Making an intense effort to move can also end an episode. What does an episode of sleep paralysis feel like? An episode of sleep paralysis often involves hallucinations that can be frightening or cause anxiety. Hallucinations during sleep paralysis fall into three categories. Intruder hallucinations involve a sense of evil or a disturbing presence in the room, such as a bedroom intruder. Chest pressure hallucinations describe a sense of pressure on the chest, often accompanied by sensations of being choked or suffocated. Vestibular-motor (V-M) hallucinations can include feelings of movement, such as flying or out-of-body sensations. Can you die from sleep paralysis? Sleep paralysis can be frightening and can cause emotional distress for some people. However, it usually does not happen frequently enough to cause significant health effects, and is not a serious medical risk on its own. People who experience recurrent or frightening episodes may develop unhealthy sleep habits to avoid sleep, leading to sleep deprivation. This can have negative effects on a person's health. Symptoms of sleep paralysis Sleep paralysis may involve such symptoms as: inability to move the arms, legs, body, and head when falling asleep or waking up inability to speak full awareness of what is happening hallucinations. Episodes last from a few seconds to a few minutes, and may occur once in a person's life or repeatedly over their lifetime. What causes sleep paralysis? While the exact cause of sleep paralysis is not understood, research has linked certain sleep habits to the condition: inadequate sleep an irregular sleep schedule or a sleep schedule that often changes (this is often the case for shift workers) sleeping on your back. In addition, sleep paralysis has also been linked with sleep disorders such as narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a disorder that causes sudden episodes of deep sleep caused by a problem with the brain's ability to regulate sleep. some mental conditions, such as bipolar disorder, PTSD, or panic or anxiety disorders use of certain medicines, such as for ADHD substance use alcohol use. Many people report stressful events or an emotional experience preceding the episodes. In addition, research suggests there may be a genetic predisposition to this condition. How is sleep paralysis diagnosed? Sleep paralysis can affect men and women. It can be seen at any age, though it tends to first appear in the teen years. After appearing during the teenage years, episodes can occur more frequently in later years. If you experience episodes of sleep paralysis that make you feel anxious or if you have repeated episodes of sleep paralysis, speak with your doctor. It is possible that sleep paralysis may be due to another medical problem that needs further attention. To learn more about how sleep paralysis is affecting your health, your doctor may ask about your symptoms, sleep habits, and factors that affect your sleep. You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire about your sleep, or even complete a sleep diary to help identify sleeping patterns. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may refer you to a sleep specialist for further diagnosis, testing, and treatment. Your doctor may have you do a sleep study called a polysomnography. In this procedure, small wafer-thin electrodes and other sensors are pasted on specific body sites to take a variety of readings during the night. The sensors will record muscle activity, movements, breathing, blood oxygen level, heart rate, and rhythm. Readings are collected on a single printout (called a polysomnogram) and analyzed by a technician and physician. If a breathing problem is detected early on, you may be awakened and given treatment, such as PAP, during the second half of the night. This allows the sleep experts to monitor how well the treatment works for you. Your doctor may also want you to take one or more daytime sleep tests as well. One test, called a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), measures how long it takes you to drift off while lying down in a quiet room. The procedure is usually repeated four or five times during the day at two-hour intervals. The test also determines what stages of sleep you experience during a brief nap. MSLT can help to show if your sleep paralysis is a sign of narcolepsy. Falling asleep within eight minutes each time indicates extreme sleepiness. A person who enters REM sleep very quickly (within about 20 minutes) during two or more naps may also have narcolepsy. How to prevent sleep paralysis If you experience occasional sleep paralysis, one of the best ways to prevent sleep paralysis episodes is to improve the quality of your sleep. Try any of these sleep hygiene techniques to help improve sleep quality and prevent sleep paralysis: Get adequate sleep. Try to get seven to nine hours of sleep per night on a regular basis. Keep a consistent sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at consistent times every day, including on weekends. Create an ideal sleep environment. Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet. Ensure your mattress and pillow suit your body's needs. Choose a pillow that keeps your neck and head naturally in alignment. Your mattress needs will depend on the level of firmness that feels best to your body. Memory foam mattresses boast the benefit of molding to your body's pressure points. Reduce distractions. Avoid using electronic devices before going to bed. Relax before bed by taking a bath, reading, or listening to soothing music. Try new sleeping positions if you sleep on your back. Sleep experts have found a correlation between sleeping on your back and sleep paralysis. Do what you can to ease stress in your life, especially just before bedtime. Curb substance use: avoid alcohol intake, especially in the evening, and steer clear of nicotine altogether. Reduce caffeine intake. If you can't or don't want to give up caffeine, avoid it after 2 p.m. If you are diagnosed with narcolepsy or another sleep disorder, a sleep doctor will work with you to find a treatment plan for your disorder. If you are diagnosed with a mental health condition such as anxiety or bipolar disorder, your doctor will oversee your ongoing treatment with medication and behavioral therapy to help treat your mental health condition. Treating your underlying mental health condition may help resolve sleep paralysis. Be sure to see your doctor if sleep paralysis routinely stops you from getting a good night's sleep. Stopping sleep paralysis in the moment Currently, there is no direct treatment strategy to treat sleep paralysis during an episode.",0,0.11783293,-0.24600458,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/eat-these-fruits-for-their-anti-inflammatory-benefits,Eat these fruits for their anti-inflammatory benefits,1,"They're nature's original desserts. And naturally sweet fruits are essential in protecting our bodies from disease. Eating at least one-and-a-half to two cups of diverse fruits every day can boost antioxidant activity. Fruits are particularly abundant in anti-inflammatory compounds, which are important in protecting our bodies from heart disease, diabetes, and certain forms of cancer and bowel disease. How to get enough healthful fruits in your diet? One strategy is to eat with the seasons, choosing grapes and stone fruits in the summer, apples and pears in the fall, persimmons and pomegranates in the winter, and citrus and cherries in the spring. While all fruits tend to be rich in disease-protective nutrients, some have received particular attention in the nutrition world for their anti-inflammatory benefits. Berries. From strawberries and blackberries to cranberries and blue­berries, these gemlike fruits are particularly potent in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Along with fiber and vitamin C, berries possess plant pigment phytochemicals, such as anthocyanins and ellagic acid, which may be behind their health benefits. Studies have linked increased berry consumption with lower risks of heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. Apples. Maybe it's true what they say about an apple a day. A study of nearly 35,000 women, found that consumption of this fruit — along with its relative, pears — was linked with a lower risk of death from heart disease. The star components of apples — fiber, vitamin C, pectin, and polyphenols — have been associated, primarily in animal studies, with anti-inflammatory effects and an increase in beneficial microbes in the gut. Stone fruits. Cherries, peaches, apricots, and plums are all examples of stone fruits. These fruits contain fiber, vitamin C, potassium, and a variety of phytochemicals associated with their colors. For example, cherries have garnered the lion's share of the research among stone fruits. Some studies suggest that cherries can reduce pain and soreness after exercise as well as a reduced risk of gout attacks. The high levels of phenolic compounds in cherries, which have been linked to reduced inflammation, may be behind those benefits. Citrus. Oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes are famously rich in vitamin C. They also contain fiber, potassium, calcium, B vitamins, copper, and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals such as flavonoids and carotenoids. Though there is little human research on citrus, the nutrients found in citrus fruits have been associated with heart-protective effects. Pomegranates. Those tiny pomegranate seeds contain big rewards of vitamins C and K, potassium, fiber, and potent phytochemicals such as anthocyanin and resveratrol. These nutrients may be behind the potential benefits of eating pomegranates. Grapes. These succulent fruits are burst­ing with fiber, vitamins C and K, and powerful phytochemicals.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/healthy-lifestyle-can-prevent-diabetes-and-even-reverse-it-2018090514698,Healthy lifestyle can prevent diabetes (and even reverse it),1,"The rate of type 2 diabetes is increasing around the world. Type 2 diabetes is a major cause of vision loss and blindness, kidney failure requiring dialysis, heart attacks, strokes, amputations, infections, and even early death. Over 80% of people with prediabetes (that is, high blood sugar with the high risk for developing full-blown diabetes) don't know it. And one in four people who have full-blown diabetes don't know they have it. Research suggests that a healthy lifestyle can prevent diabetes from occurring in the first place — and even reverse its progress. Can a healthy diet and lifestyle prevent diabetes? The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a large, long-term study, asked the question: we know an unhealthy diet and lifestyle can cause type 2 diabetes, but can adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle prevent it? This answer is yes: the vast majority of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be prevented through diet and lifestyle changes, and this has been proven by 20 years of medical research. Researchers from the DPP took people at risk for type 2 diabetes and gave them a 24-week diet and lifestyle intervention, a medication (metformin), or a placebo (a fake pill), to see if anything could lower their risk for developing diabetes. The very comprehensive diet and lifestyle intervention had the goal of changing participants' daily habits, and included: 16 classes teaching basic nutrition and behavioral strategies for weight loss and physical activity; lifestyle coaches with frequent contact with participants; supervised physical activity sessions; and good clinical support for reinforcing an individualized plan. Perhaps not surprisingly, the diet and lifestyle intervention was incredibly effective. After three years, the diet and lifestyle group had a 58% lower risk of developing diabetes than the placebo group. Participants ages 60 and older had an even better response, with a whopping 71% lower risk of developing diabetes. The diet and lifestyle effect lasted: even after 10 years, those folks had a 34% lower risk of developing diabetes compared to placebo. Men, women, and all racial and ethnic groups had similar results (and almost half of participants represented racial and ethnic minorities). These results are not surprising to me or to other doctors, because we have all seen patients with prediabetes or diabetes get their sugars down with diet, exercise, and weight loss alone. Meanwhile, the medication group had a 31% lower risk of diabetes after three years, and an 18% lower risk after 10 years, which is also significant. It's perfectly all right to use medications along with diet and lifestyle changes, because each boosts the effect of the other. Studies looking at the combination of medication (metformin) with diet and lifestyle changes have shown an even stronger result. Dietary recommendations to prevent diabetes (and even reverse it) Decrease intake of added sugars and processed foods, including refined grains like white flour and white rice. This especially includes sugary drinks, not only sodas but also juices. The best drinks are water, seltzer, and tea or coffee without sugar. Swap out refined grains for whole grains. Whole grains are actually real grains that haven't been stripped of nutrients in processing. Foods made from 100% whole grain (like whole wheat) are okay, but intact whole grains (like farro, quinoa, corn, oatmeal, and brown rice) are even better. Increase fiber intake. High-fiber foods include most vegetables and fruits. Legumes are also high in fiber and healthy plant protein. Legumes include lentils, beans, chickpeas, peas, edamame, and soy. People who eat a lot of high-fiber foods tend to eat fewer calories, weigh less, and have a lower risk of diabetes. Increase fruit and vegetable intake. At least half of our food intake every day should be nonstarchy fruits and vegetables, the more colorful the better. Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, and high-fiber fruits like berries of all kinds, are especially healthy. Eat less meat, and avoid processed red meat. Many studies have shown us that certain meats are incredibly risky for us. People who eat processed red meat are far more likely to develop diabetes: one serving a day (which is two slices of bacon, two slices of deli meat, or one hot dog) is associated with over a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Eating even a small portion of red meat daily (red meat includes beef, lamb, and pork), like a palm-sized piece of steak, is associated with a 20% increased risk of type 2 diabetes. In fact, the less meat you eat, the lower your risk of diabetes. People who don't eat red meat at all, but do eat chicken, eggs, dairy, and fish, may significantly lower their risk of developing type 2 diabetes, by about 30%; those who eat only fish, 50%; those who eat only eggs and dairy, 60%; those who are vegan, 80%. Eat healthier fats. Fat is not necessarily bad for you. What kind of fat you're eating really does matter. Saturated fats, particularly from meats, are associated with an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease. Plant oils, such as extra-virgin olive oil and canola oil, carry less risk. Omega-3 fats, like in walnuts, flax seeds, and some fish, are actually quite good for you. Diet and lifestyle changes that can help prevent diabetes The CDC's Diabetes Prevention Program, used in many clinics, is a free tool to help you learn and stick with the healthy diet, physical activity, and stress management techniques that reduce your risk of diabetes. Another helpful tool is the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Nutrition Source Healthy Eating Plate, which shows you what your daily food intake should look like: half fruits and vegetables, about a quarter whole grains, and a quarter healthy proteins (plant protein is ideal here), with some healthy fats and no-sugar-added beverages.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-skin-creams-are-most-effective-for-eczema-202310122981,Which skin creams are most effective for eczema?,1,"Quelling the discomfort of atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema, can be a daily quest. This inflamed, itchy skin condition can interfere with sleeping, socializing, and many other activities. If home remedies such as gentle cleansing and regular moisturizing don't provide relief, your doctor might recommend a prescription treatment to apply to your skin. Which prescription cream is most effective? A new study boils it down to a few overall winners. What is atopic dermatitis and the itch-scratch cycle? Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. The areas commonly affected include the face, hands, feet, or the skin folds of the elbows or behind the knees. We don't know exactly what causes atopic dermatitis. Genes, the environment, and an overactive immune system all seem to play a role in creating inflammation, which feels itchy. Scratching the itch creates more irritation and inflammation, which causes more itching. As the itch-scratch cycle continues, the rash gets worse. The skin might tear, ooze, and crust over, which can be painful. Which skin treatments were more effective in the study? Some prescription topical skin treatments for atopic dermatitis are more effective than others, according to a 2023 study published online by The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Scientists evaluated more than 200 randomized trials involving more than 43,000 people with atopic dermatitis (average age 18). The researchers compared almost 70 different prescription creams or ointments, which are broadly called topical treatments and are designed to be applied to affected areas of skin. These treatments fall into five categories. If you have eczema, their generic names may or may not be familiar to you, but your medical team is likely to know them well: topical corticosteroids, divided into seven classes ranging from the most to the least potent, decrease the release of an inflammatory chemical called phospholipase A2 topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors interrupt inflammatory signals as they enter cells topical PDE4 inhibitors raise the production of a chemical called phosphodiesterase-4, or PDE4, and lower the body's inflammatory response topical calcineurin inhibitors help suppress the production of chemical messengers that tell the body to ramp up its defenses other topical treatments, including antibiotics and prescription moisturizers. Researchers looked at which medications had outcomes important to patients, including which were best at improving quality of life were best at reducing eczema-related severity, itch, sleep disturbances, or flare-ups caused the fewest serious side effects were discontinued least often due to serious side effects. Which atopic dermatitis medications proved to be most effective? The study yielded some predictable results and a surprise. The overall winners were two calcineurin inhibitors: pimecrolimus (Elidel) and tacrolimus (Protopic) moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, a large group that includes fluocinolone acetonide (Synalar cream 0.025%) and triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog cream/ointment 0.1%). What did these medications improve? Pimecrolimus improved six of seven outcomes, and was among the best at reducing sleep disturbances and eczema flares. High-dose tacrolimus (0.1%) improved five outcomes, and was among the best at reducing itch and eczema flares. Moderate-potency steroids improved four to six of the seven outcomes, and were best at reducing eczema itch, flares, and serious side effects. ""That's in line with what we often prescribe,"" says Dr. Connie Shi, a dermatologist who often treats people with eczema at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""The strongest topical steroids appeared to be the most effective at reducing eczema severity in the study. However, for longer-term maintenance we may consider switching to a moderate-potency steroid, or one of the nonsteroid options, to minimize the risk of thinning the skin, which can occur with long-term use of topical steroids."" The surprise finding: the study found little to no effectiveness from using a topical cream twice daily versus just once daily. ""The traditional advice is twice daily,"" Dr. Shi says. ""Once a day would make it more convenient to use, and it may help people stay on their medication regimen without decreasing effectiveness."" Which treatments were less effective in this study? The researchers found that topical antibiotics were among the least effective treatments for eczema. Should you change your treatment? ""While the study included more than 40,000 people, what worked for participants may not always work for you, as different people may respond differently to the same treatment,"" Dr. Shi explains. ""There are many factors to consider when prescribing a treatment, including your age, the areas on your skin that are affected, the severity of the eczema, and potential side effects."" The bottom line? ""If a treatment regimen is working for you, then continue it, as long as you don't have any serious side effects,"" she says. ""If your current regimen isn't working well, talk with your doctor or a dermatologist to see if there's another prescription cream or ointment that you may want to try.""",0,0.105599344,-0.16459759,True
https://www.webmd.com/brain/news/20250204/scientists-are-finding-more-microplastics-in-the-brain,Scientists Are Finding More Microplastics in the Brain,1,"Feb. 4, 2025 – Microplastics have been found in the brain, showing they can cross the blood-brain barrier, and the amounts of the tiny plastic bits inside our bodies appear to be increasing at a rate that reflects the increasing amount of global plastic waste. That’s according to a new study led by researchers at the University of New Mexico who measured microplastics in the brains, livers, and kidneys of people who died in either 2016 or in 2024. Plastic concentrations found in the brain were higher than those found in the kidney or liver, the results showed. The study was small – fewer than 30 people were represented in each comparison group – but is notable for comparing microplastic amounts in different organs and in people who died about eight years apart. The levels of microplastics found in the brains of people who died in 2024 were about 50% higher than the levels found in the brains of people who died in 2016. “I never would have imagined it was this high. I certainly don’t feel comfortable with this much plastic in my brain, and I don’t need to wait around 30 more years to find out what happens if the concentrations quadruple,” study author Matthew Campen, PhD, a toxicology expert and professor in the University of New Mexico College of Pharmacy, said in a news release. Much of previous microplastic research involving actual human beings has focused on finding microplastics by location in the body and also determining the type of plastic. Microplastics have been found in many organs, including the placenta, and in blood, breast milk, saliva, and even plaques that build up in people’s arteries. One study published last year linked the presence of microplastics and even smaller nanoplastics in plaque buildup inside the carotid artery – which carries blood from the heart to the brain and head – to a higher risk of a heart attack, stroke, or death from any cause. Laboratory and animal studies suggest the substances have potential health hazards, but so far, scientists have struggled to pinpoint connections with such things as level of accumulation, type of microplastic, or timespan of exposure. For this latest study, the tissue samples came from the university’s medical investigator, who had done autopsies on the 28 people who died in 2016 and the 24 people who died in 2024. The average age of people who died in 2016 was 45 years old, and the average age of people who died in 2024 was 51, although a statistical analysis suggests age wasn’t related to microplastic levels. The causes of death were as follows: In another analysis, the researchers looked at the brains of another group of people from New Mexico who died from 2019 to 2024 and had been diagnosed with dementia. Their brain tissue had higher levels of microplastics than the people who did not have dementia. The researchers cautioned that their study gave no evidence that microplastics cause dementia. The plastic concentration levels may simply be related to the disease process of dementia. “We start thinking that maybe these plastics obstruct blood flow in capillaries,” Campen said. “There’s the potential that these nanomaterials interfere with the connections between axons in the brain. They could also be a seed for aggregation of proteins involved in dementia. We just don’t know.”",8,0.03466767,0.011380225,False

One in four drug shortages lasted more than five years while six drugs, including epinephrine injections for serious allergic reactions, has been in low supply for a decade. More than half of all new drug shortages involve injectable generic medications. ""Unexpected shocks can break the system and disrupt the supply of quality medicines,"" said Anthony Lakavage, senior vice president for Global External Affairs at USP, a nonprofit organization that sets global quality standards for medications, dietary supplements and food ingredients. ""This worrisome trajectory leads to more frequent drug shortages, prolonged scarcity, and more people at risk of not getting the medicines they need, when they need them.""

U.S. manufacturing falling apart A big part of the problem is the manufacturing complexity involved with many drugs such as sterile injectables and antibiotics. These drug classes require dedicated facilities capable of complicated chemical synthesis – facilities that are increasingly in short supply in the United States. Ongoing and increasing quality control problems are a component of this as well with a 2023 report from the FDA showing that nearly half of all drug production facilities have ""objectionable conditions."" Another problem driving drug shortages is greed. Most of the drugs currently in short supply cost less than $5 with 66 percent of solid oral medications in short supply costing less than $2 to make. The number of discontinued drugs also increased by 40 percent between 2022 and 2023. Supply chain vulnerability is also driven by geographic concentration with 44 percent of injectable medications produced in the U.S. and 56 percent of solid oral medications produced in India. ""Quality comes at a price,"" said Vimala Raghavendran, vice president for Informatics Product Development at USP. ""The economics of generic drugs often leave manufacturers with razor-thin margins, making it challenging to prioritize investment in modern machinery or to elevate standards of quality. Without sufficient profitability, the cycle of innovation and improvement becomes difficult to sustain."" To fix or at least improve the situation, U.S. Pharmacopeia suggests better coordinating supply chain resilience and reliability efforts while increasing supply chain visibility. The group also suggests establishing a vulnerable medicines list; aligning the market to incentivize a higher quality supply chain; and expanding manufacturing capacity. ""The solution to drug shortage is do without drugs,"" an online commenter also suggested. ""Treat the root cause instead of a pill for everything. If your fish tank is dirty, you don't drug the fish, you clean the tank instead."" Another noted that there certainly is no shortage of vaccines, especially those being pushed for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). ""This is all intentional, people,"" this person said. ""Food shortages, drug shortages, etc."" Now is probably a good time to switch from pharmaceuticals to natural alternatives if possible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heart-disease-risk-partnering-on-lifestyle-change-can-help-202108042562,Heart disease risk: Partnering on lifestyle change can help,1,"After a heart attack, changing longstanding behaviors that affect heart health can be challenging. Many people have developed habits over 20, 30, or 40 years that are ingrained and can take a significant effort to modify. Does having a partner who is supportive and participatory help? A recent study demonstrated it can. The RESPONSE-2 Trial is a lifestyle intervention study that enrolled patients with coronary artery disease. More than 800 study participants were randomized into either a nurse-coordinated referral of patients and their partners to three widely available community-based lifestyle programs, or to usual care. The community-based intervention programs targeted weight reduction, increasing physical activity, and smoking cessation. Both the intervention and control groups continued to receive visits to their cardiologist, participate in cardiac rehab programs, and attend general counseling sessions on healthy lifestyles, risk factors, and medication adherence. Success was defined as improvement in one of the three risk factors without deterioration in the other two after 12 months. Results showed the proportion of successful patients who improved at least one of the lifestyle risk factors was 37% in the intervention group compared with 26% in the control group. Weight loss was the most successful component, with almost two times the number of patients achieving significant weight loss (at least 5% of starting weight) in the intervention group compared to the control group. Patients whose partner participated in the community-based program had the highest proportion of success. Modifiable lifestyle risk factors for heart disease It is well established that obesity puts you at risk for high cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes — all factors that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. By managing your weight through physical activity and healthy eating, you can reduce these risk factors, and thus decrease heart disease risk. How can a partner help? There are many challenges to improving our diet: what we eat, how much we eat, and where we eat, to name a few. What we eat: What is put on the table will translate into what we eat. A partner can develop a shopping list with you to determine what is brought into the house. You can create a menu together that is consistent with healthy eating guidelines. Limiting food brought into the house that is not heart-healthy can play a major role in someone's success. Once food is readily available, it is even more challenging for someone trying to modify their food intake. Making sure there are plenty of vegetables, fresh fruit, and lean protein, along with healthy fats, some low-fat dairy, and whole grains, can contribute to your success. How much we eat: Some people may eat mostly healthy foods, but they eat too much and therefore may struggle with their weight. A partner can help support you in preparing a reasonable amount of food so that there are not many leftovers. When plating food, you and your partner can use the ""balanced plate"" guidelines of 1/2 the plate with lower-calorie vegetables, 1/4 plate with lean protein, and 1/4 plate with whole grains or a healthy starch. Where we eat: Prior to the pandemic, Americans allocated a fair amount of their food dollar to consuming food away from home — as takeout, fast food, and in restaurants. With the shutdown of many establishments in 2020 and early 2021, cooking at home rose significantly. However, now that dining out has reopened, many Americans are resuming pre-pandemic habits. This can result in some meals being higher in overall calories, saturated fat, and sodium than home-cooked meals. A partner can help in the decision regarding how often and where to eat out. In addition, a partner can help choose restaurants where healthy options are readily available. Tips on healthy eating out Don't start out famished. Skipping meals or starving yourself can cause you to overeat! You may also find it difficult to avoid all those tempting foods. Don't feel like you have to eat everything on your plate. Send back what you don't want. Better yet, bring it home in a doggy bag and you'll enjoy the meal twice as much. Avoid nibbling. Listen to your body when it tells you it's full. Have the waiter or wait staff remove extra food from the table. The longer it stays, the more apt you will be to nibble. Eating is not meant to be a race. Eating too fast can lead to overeating, as it takes 20 minutes for your body to know it's full. So, take your time, put your fork down between bites, and focus on the social aspect of eating. Order a la carte. Who says you must order an entree? Make your own. You can choose any combination of appetizers, soups, salads, and side dishes. This allows more variety, and gives you more control over what and how much you eat. Longstanding habits are hard to change, but you can make small changes every day. A partner who is willing and able to support you in the change process may be a helpful resource for your success.",7,0.24912055,0.16089915,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/handling-hypoglycemia,Handling hypoglycemia,1,"Hypoglycemia is a potentially dangerous condition in which blood sugar falls too low. Too much exercise, too little food or carbohydrates, a missed or delayed meal, or a combination of these factors can bring on hypoglycemia. Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the reaction, but commonly include nervousness sweating feeling cold and clammy trembling or shakiness rapid heartbeat lightheadedness hunger irritability. If early symptoms aren't recognized and treated quickly, blood sugar levels may continue to fall, resulting in drowsiness weakness blurred vision slurred speech confusion clumsiness personality change or strange behavior such as belligerence or silliness. At its worst, hypoglycemia can cause seizures or coma. Most people with type 2 diabetes don't have to worry about hypoglycemia. It may, however, occur in those who use insulin or take a diabetes medication known as a sulfonylurea. Changes in eating habits, such as dieting— especially if carbohydrates are reduced—or increased exercise can lead to hypoglycemia. Talk with your doctor before making any changes in your diet or increasing your exercise. The 15/15 Rule to treat a low blood sugar Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of hypoglycemia, so that if it occurs, you can take steps to treat it appropriately and prevent the problem from recurring. If you think you're having an episode of low blood sugar, don't ignore your symptoms. If possible, test your blood sugar with a finger-stick test. If it is low, follow the 15/15 rule. Eat 15 grams of carbohydrate and wait 15 minutes. Here are some foods that will provide about 15 grams of carbohydrate to lower blood sugar: eat three glucose tablets or four dextrose tablets drink 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice drink 5 to 6 ounces (about half a can) of regular soda, such as Coke or Pepsi eat five to seven Life Savers eat 2 tablespoons raisins eat six jelly beans. Don't eat foods containing chocolate, peanut butter, nuts, or fats. Fat slows the body's absorption of carbohydrates, so foods with fat won't raise your blood sugar quickly enough. After the carbohydrate is eaten, wait about 15 minutes for the sugar to get into your blood. If you do not feel better within 15 minutes, more carbohydrate can be consumed. Your blood sugar should be checked to make sure it has come within a safe range.

The tasty green fruit is great in salads, smoothies, and desserts. And it might have an added bonus of helping to ease chronic constipation, according to a small randomized trial. Scientists asked more than 180 adults (some with constipation, some without) in Italy, Japan, and New Zealand to take part in two four-week courses of treatment. In one regimen, they ate two peeled kiwifruits per day. In the other, they took 7.5 grams of psyllium (a natural ingredient found in fiber supplements such as Metamucil or Fiberall) daily. The order of the two regimens was randomly assigned, and participants took a four-week break in between. The results: both treatments seemed to help constipated participants produce more bowel movements and experience less straining and abdominal pain, with kiwi being slightly more effective than psyllium. Scientists say kiwi contains not only fiber (about 3 grams per half-cup serving), but also raphides (natural needle-shaped crystals), which both help improve bowel function. The findings were published in the June 2023 issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology. Image: © Roman Samokhin/Getty Images",3,0.24686792,-0.021903425,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-closer-look-at-alcohols-effect-on-heart-health,A closer look at alcohol's effect on heart health,1,"Along with many major health organizations, the American Heart Association (AHA) warns about the dangers of excessive drinking, which can contribute to high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke. It also discourages people from drinking alcohol to improve their health, although the AHA maintains that moderate drinking (no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks or fewer per day for men) is acceptable. This complex advice stems from conflicting studies about the health effects of light to moderate alcohol consumption. While some research focusing on inherited factors (see ""Using genetics to explore drinking's effects"") has hinted that even light drinking may be harmful, other studies have looked for mechanisms through which moderate drinking could benefit the heart. Limited evidence suggests that alcohol may raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels, boost antioxidant levels, or enhance blood flow. But none of these explanations has proven very convincing. A recent report raised another possibility: reduced stress. You might also be interested in... Harvard Health Publishing’s 6-Week Plan for Healthy Eating This week-by-week plan, The Harvard Medical School 6-Week Plan for Healthy Eating, will help you transform your eating habits into a program of nutritious and delicious food choices that can last a lifetime. Applying the latest results from nutrition science, Harvard experts take you by the hand and guide you to create an eating plan to improve heart health, longevity, energy, and vitality. LEARN MORE Using genetics to explore drinking's effects One well-known problem of observational studies is that they can't prove cause and effect. Light to moderate drinkers tend to be educated and relatively wealthy, which often enables healthy habits and good medical care. Also, people who are ill or taking certain medications are often advised to avoid alcohol. If you compare these abstainers to drinkers, the drinkers appear healthier by comparison, but that's not necessarily due to the alcohol. In an attempt to adjust for these and other confounding factors, researchers have looked at genetic factors that influence alcohol use. But the studies — which found that even small amounts of alcohol might increase heart disease risk — relied on gene variants linked to alcohol use disorder or binge drinking. A predilection to heavy drinking, which has many damaging health effects, isn't necessarily a good way to assess the effects of light to moderate drinking, says Dr. Kenneth Mukamal, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. In addition, genetic factors are multifaceted and complex (see ""Genetic profiling for heart disease: An update""). The stress connection A study published in the June 20, 2023, Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that brain scans of people who reported light to moderate drinking showed less activity in the part of the brain that responds to stress, compared with the scans of people who abstained or drank very little. Stress not only raises blood pressure and heart rate but also triggers inflammation that causes plaque buildup, which contributes to heart attacks. The finding is limited by the fact that the brain scans were commonly done for cancer surveillance or diagnosis, says Dr. Ken Mukamal, an internist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who studies how alcohol and other lifestyle factors affect health. ""The stress level of someone in the midst of a cancer workup is likely quite high and may not reflect the typical stress level of an average person,"" he notes. Still, he says it's an intriguing finding that merits further study. In the moment, alcohol can help people feel relaxed, and that's especially true when people drink in social situations. It's possible that light to moderate drinkers have stronger social ties, which in turn provide resilience against stress. The study authors are now focusing on other interventions — such as meditation or exercise — that might lower the brain's stress activity without the potentially harmful effects of alcohol. How is drinking linked to diabetes? A 2022 study showed a link between moderate drinking (eight to 16 drinks per week) and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, but specifically among people who drank alcohol with meals. Many short-term trials that randomly assign people to drink either alcohol or a nonalcoholic beverage show lower blood sugar levels and better insulin sensitivity among people who drink moderate amounts of alcohol. While these biomarkers aren't a perfect representation of diabetes risk, they're pretty close, says Dr. Mukamal. People with diabetes are twice as likely to have heart disease as people without the condition. You might also be interested in...

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/hidden-causes-of-weight-gain,Hidden causes of weight gain,1,"The reason for gaining weight isn't always a mystery. For example, you might know you've been eating more and exercising less, a potent combo that often results in extra pounds. But sometimes the cause isn't quite so obvious. And you might not be aware of many of the other factors that can contribute to weight gain. Age-related causes Getting older brings physiological changes that can affect weight. Chief among them is muscle loss. Starting in middle age, we lose about 1% of muscle mass per year, which affects strength and metabolism (how fast we burn calories). ""Smaller muscles use fewer calories. If your diet doesn't change, you'll consume more calories than you need. The excess is stored as fat,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, an obesity medicine specialist and co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Here are other age-related changes that can affect weight. Chronic stress. It's harder to manage stress as we get older. And if you're constantly under stress, you might have consistently high levels of the stress hormone cortisol. One job of cortisol is helping the body replenish energy stores. In some people, that might indirectly promote weight gain by increasing appetite (since the body thinks it needs energy) and increasing the storage of unused energy as fat. ""But mostly, stress leads to compulsive behaviors, such as eating 'comfort' foods, which are often full of sugar, unhealthy fat, extra calories, and salt,"" Dr. Apovian says. Poor sleep. Age-related changes affect our ability to sleep well. ""If you're a chronic 'short sleeper,' getting six hours or fewer each night, it might affect hormones that regulate appetite. Short sleep is associated with higher levels of hormones that make us hungry, lower levels of hormones that tell us we're full, and higher levels of cortisol,"" Dr. Apovian says. Sex hormone changes. Older men and women experience reductions in certain sex hormones. In women, low estrogen levels are associated with sleep problems and increased body fat. In men, reduced testosterone levels are linked to less muscle mass. Underlying conditions Weight gain, especially if it's new, can signal a number of health conditions. For example, someone with heart failure might experience weight gain from fluid retention—which might appear as swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, or belly. ""This would likely be accompanied by symptoms such as fatigue or shortness of breath,"" Dr. Apovian says. Other underlying conditions associated with weight gain include diabetes certain kidney diseases sleep apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep) thyroid problems. Medication side effects Taking certain medications regularly can lead to weight gain. Some drugs, such as prednisone, can make you retain fluid and increase your weight. And many medications affect brain chemicals that regulate appetite, which might make you hungrier than usual, so you might eat more and gain weight. Examples include antidepressants such as paroxetine (Paxil) or phenelzine (Nardil) antihistamines that contain the ingredient diphenhydramine (the active ingredient in Benadryl) antipsychotics such as clozapine (Clozaril) or olanzapine (Zyprexa) beta blockers such as the drug atenolol (Tenormin) or metoprolol (Lopressor) sleep aids that contain the drug diphenhydramine, such as Sominex, Unisom SleepGels, or ZzzQuil. Other potential causes Some potential causes of weight gain aren't yet well understood and are currently being studied. One possibility is late-night eating. Some evidence, including a 2022 Harvard study, suggests that eating late at night might make us hungrier in the daytime, slow metabolism, and increase body fat. Another suspected factor in weight gain is the population of microbes that live in your gut (their genes are called your microbiome). Considerable evidence suggests gut microbes might influence appetite, metabolism, blood sugar, and fat storage. The strongest support comes from studies of animals. In humans, the evidence is less clear. ""Studies have found that the gut microbes of people with obesity are different from those of people who are lean,"" Dr. Apovian explains. ""But we don't know if this causes people to develop obesity. It could be that people who are genetically programmed to gain weight have a certain microbiome,"" she notes. ""Or it could be that people with obesity are eating a different way than lean people are eating, which may change the microbiome. We need more research for better answers."" What you should do Any recent or excessive weight gain warrants a visit to your doctor, who can hunt for new underlying conditions and check if your medications might be influencing your weight. Getting those two aspects of health under control are essential. It might also help to see a dietitian to determine the right calorie intake for your current needs. Beyond that, Dr. Apovian says the best way to control weight as we age is clean living: eating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, limited amounts of whole grains and starchy vegetables, and ample amounts of lean protein to help build muscle; avoiding late-night eating; getting seven to nine hours of sleep per night; exercising briskly every day for at least 20 minutes; and strength training at least twice a week. ""You can rebuild muscle,"" Dr. Apovian says, ""but it takes a combination of healthy lifestyle habits to control weight."" Image: © Westend61/Getty Images",3,0.4268481,-0.05664918,True

A new study suggests not, although with some caveats. Researchers enrolled 5,246 men ages 45 to 80 with testosterone levels of less than 300 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL). (Normal levels range from 300 to 1,000 ng/dL.) More than 50% had existing cardiovascular disease, while the others were considered at increased risk because of such factors as diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, and an imbalance of lipids (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides). For an average of 22 months, the men applied a gel to their skin daily. For half of the men, the gel was a placebo (inactive). For the others, it contained enough testosterone to maintain their hormone levels between 350 and 750 ng/dL. At the three-year follow-up, the researchers found no difference in the rate of heart attacks, strokes, or death from cardiovascular problems between the TRT and placebo groups. However, compared with the men using the placebo, those using TRT were more likely to have developed atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rate that can increase the risk for stroke and heart failure) and pulmonary embolism (in which a blood clot travels to a lung artery and blocks blood flow). The researchers pointed out that their findings do not apply to men who do not have a testosterone deficiency. Men considering TRT should discuss possible risks with their doctor, especially if they have any cardiovascular disease risk factors. The results were published in the July 13, 2023, issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. Image: © ljubaphoto/Getty Images",7,0.12727755,0.15907417,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/try-this-take-a-tactical-breather,Try this: Take a tactical breather,1,"Next time you feel overwhelmed by stress or need to stay mentally sharp in a high-stress situation, try tactical breathing. This breathwork (sometimes referred to as box breathing) is used by military and law enforcement personnel to remain calm and collected in dangerous situations. It works like this: Gradually take a full inhalation through the nose while counting one, two, three, four. With each count, draw in more air, so when you reach the count of four, you inhale to your maximum. Hold your breath as you count one, two, three, four again. Then slowly exhale through the mouth, again counting from one to four. Release some air with each count, fully exhaling when you reach four. After full exhalation, hold your breath again for a count of four. Repeat the breathing cycle several times. Tactical breathing can damp down the body's sympathetic nervous system, which directs our response to dangerous or stressful situations. It also engages the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls the body's ability to relax. Tactical breathing also can be used to calm a racing mind when you're trying to sleep and to help soothe pain. Image: © Zinkevych/Getty Images",5,0.18674219,-0.1409783,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/lending-a-helping-hand,Lending a helping hand,1,"The Greek philosopher Plato once said, ""Happiness springs from doing good and helping others."" Almost 2,500 years later, research shows that Plato was correct — people who devote time to helping others are often happier than those who don't. There are many ways lending a hand helps our minds and moods. One way is to turn our attention away from our own problems. ""Too much self-focused attention is linked with more negative thinking and a higher risk of anxiety and depression,"" says Robert Drozek, a psychotherapist with Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital who specializes in the use of ethics in psychotherapy. ""But serving redirects our energy and helps us realize that we have something to offer people, and they sometimes need our help."" Serving others helps brain health in other ways, too. It increases social connections, which can protect against loneliness and depression, and improves executive function skills like planning, attention, and remembering tasks. And when you help others, your brain releases feel-good chemicals like serotonin and dopamine. You don't need to devote much time to reap these benefits. A study in the August 2020 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that older adults who did any kind of service work for two hours a week felt more optimistic and had a greater sense of purpose compared with those who performed no service. How can you help yourself by helping others? Here are a few ways. Volunteering Volunteering provides a sense of purpose and an emotional boost as you support a cause or organization you believe in. You could also volunteer in professional fields or industries that match your life or work experience, like education, health care, or the arts. ""Volunteering in this way also offers opportunities to find structured and defined roles that fit your schedule, skills, and comfort levels,"" says Drozek. You can even volunteer from home. For instance, thanks to computers, being a ""virtual"" volunteer is common. You can provide administrative, accounting, or marketing assistance via computer or video chat. Telephones are still crucial for volunteer work. For example, you can make calls to help raise money for nonprofits, answer a hotline, or make check-in calls to homebound adults. Finding opportunities Search online for volunteering opportunities in your ZIP code on websites such as Volunteer Match (www.volunteermatch.org) or Idealist (www.idealist.org). You can look for local mentoring programs at the website of the National Mentoring Partnership (www.mentoring.org). Mentoring Mentors share their knowledge, wisdom, and experience with people who need direction. Many times, this is a child or young adult. A good place to begin is with a national program like Big Brothers, Big Sisters of America or the United Way. Also, many high schools, senior centers, churches, and faith-based organizations have mentoring opportunities. If you are more interested in sharing your professional expertise, contact your area Junior Achievement program or the local business community, or service clubs. Random acts of kindness Look for opportunities to serve others in daily life. For example, write to a friend saying you are thinking about them. Order takeout food for a neighbor. Send a gift in the mail. For an additional benefit, do the act anonymously, and don't tell anyone about it. ""This further takes the focus away from you and your worries,"" says Drozek. Different perspective An indirect way to serve others is to see things from their point of view. When you interact with someone — whether a friend, acquaintance, or stranger — focus the interaction entirely on the other person. What is going on with them? What issues do they face? Are they in pain or feeling conflict? Avoid injecting yourself — for instance, by describing how the same situation happened to you (unless they ask for feedback or advice). ""By lending an ear, you can provide emotional support they may need in that moment,"" says Drozek. ""Even if the exchange is generic and friendly, placing emphasis on the other person can boost their mood, and in the process, yours, too.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-06-14-epa-sued-pfas-in-biosludge-contaminating-farmland.html,EPA sued for failing to prevent toxic PFAS in biosludge from contaminating and destroying farm lands across America,0,"An environmental watchdog group has filed a lawsuit on behalf of Texas farming and ranching families who experienced health problems after their property was polluted with toxic sewage sludge from nearby properties. The suit, which was filed by the nonprofit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, maintains that the Environmental Protection Agency violated the Clean Water Act by not disclosing the presence of more than 18 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in treated sewage sludge that was spread across the families’ farmland in the Fort Worth area. In addition, they claim that the EPA was neglectful in its failure to develop regulations that would control the PFAS chemicals that they have previously acknowledged are present in sewage sludge. Instead, the EPA has sat by and allowed “millions of acres"" of land to be contaminated with these toxic chemicals and exposed the surrounding communities to their harms. In a press release, an attorney for PEER, Laura Dumais, said: “ PFAS poisoning of farmlands is fast becoming a national agricultural emergency. Farmers whose lands have been decimated by biosolids consistently ask, ‘why does EPA allow this?’ And they’re absolutely right. EPA needs to act immediately to protect farmers and our food supply from this toxic mess.” The plaintiffs also filed a suit earlier this year against the company Synagro, claiming their farms were contaminated after toxic sewage sludge was spread on a neighboring property.

This caused their livestock to become sick and compromised the farmers’ health. A liver sample from one of the farms' stillborn calves showed that it contained 610,000 parts per trillion of one of the most toxic types of PFAS, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). To put this number in perspective, consider the fact that the EPA proposed limiting PFOS in drinking water to just 4 parts per trillion. Moreover, because the PFAS pollution leached into their land, their property values dropped significantly. The suit alleges that Synagro failed to warn users of its fertilizer about negative health effects of PFAS exposure such as impaired liver and immune system function and cancer, instead marketing them as “safe and organic.” Right now, there's just one state that systematically tests its farmland for the presence of PFAS: Maine. They have found these toxins on at least 70 farms there, and their presence have been attributed to sewage sludge that was spread on farmland in the state in the past. Maine set up a $65 million fund to support farmers impacted by PFAS contamination. The state has also banned the land application of biosolids. 2.4 Million tons of sewage sludge are applied to American land each year According to the EPA, 60 percent of the sewage sludge that is produced each year by wastewater treatment plants in America is spread on farm fields, and there are no requirements in place at the federal level to test for PFAS. The agency estimates that more than 2.4 million tons of sewage sludge are applied to land each year in the form of fertilizer on farms, home gardens, parks, pastures and other types of land. Although biosolids are routinely treated to remove pathogens, the treatment process does not remove PFAS.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/overcoming-heart-health-obstacles,Overcoming heart health obstacles,1,"Prevention is the best medicine, but many men wait for a problem to arise before seeking help. For heart disease — the No. 1 cause of death among men — it could be runaway blood pressure, escalating cholesterol levels, or even a heart attack. Even when faced with the reality of heart disease, men often encounter obstacles that keep them from managing their condition or lowering their risk. What can they do? To find out, we asked two cardiologists — Dr. Haider Warraich and Dr. Dale Adler with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital — what they hear from their male patients and the advice they offer. Think about the future. During consultations, Dr. Warraich asks his patients about how they define longevity. ""When they reflect on what they hope to achieve as they age, most say they value a high quality of life and independent living rather than simply living a few years longer than normal,"" he says. Getting men to focus on their future helps them define goals and then determine if they are on the path to meet them. ""It helps them understand their shortcomings, like needing to be serious about weight loss or managing cholesterol, and can motivate them to make lasting changes,"" says Dr. Warraich. Monitor your blood pressure. Men sometimes don't feel in control of their heart health, says Dr. Warraich. One way they can play an active role is to regularly monitor their blood pressure. ""The heart health risks of high blood pressure are far-reaching, and even if men are not taking medication to manage high levels, keeping tabs on their numbers can be a proactive way to look out for potential problems,"" says Dr. Warraich. Men can easily do this by investing in a home blood pressure monitor. Record weekly readings and alert your doctor about sudden changes. Confront suspicions about medication. Dr. Adler has found that many men who need blood pressure medicine, statins to manage cholesterol, or other medications are hesitant to take them. ""They often focus too much on potential side effects and less on the benefits,"" he says. Much of this may reflect a general mistrust of medicine and the idea they have to take the pills indefinitely. But Dr. Adler says men can overcome this resistance by realizing they have a say in how the drugs are used. ""I tell my patients that by making diet and lifestyle changes, they can possibly take lower doses or even eventually stop taking them,"" he says. ""When they understand their power, they are more open to taking medication they need for better heart health."" Schedule time for health. Consistency is vital for maintaining heart-healthy exercise. But one of the top complaints Dr. Adler hears is lack of time. ""In general, men are receptive to routine and schedules, but they often don't do well when it gets disrupted,"" he says. Dr. Adler advises his patients to find a few blocks of time that work with their schedule and daily energy levels so they have multiple options. For instance, in the morning as soon as you wake up, or in the evening before dinner (exercise before a meal also curbs appetite). Also, treat workout sessions as critical meetings, and always have a backup plan in place. ""This way, if you miss your scheduled workout, you can automatically go to plan B."" For example, take a quick walk, do five minutes of squats and push-ups, or stop by the gym. Make weight loss a group effort. One of the greatest threats to heart health is weight gain. ""Weight loss is not easy, but studies have found that sharing your weight-loss efforts through friendly competitions or online community forums is a tool for staying motivated and overcoming setbacks,"" says Dr. Adler. You could also enlist friends and begin your own weight-loss club, where you share your daily or weekly weigh-ins, exchange tips and strategies, talk about challenges, and encourage each other. Learn portion control. ""People are generally not great at estimating food portions,"" says Dr. Adler. This is one reason weight-loss programs like Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers are effective, he adds. ""They give you the exact portions you are supposed to eat, which is what you need to feel satisfied."" He tells his patients trying to eat healthier or lose weight to always plan their meals in advance and get in the habit of measuring portions. ""This way, you can take the guesswork out of what to eat and avoid consuming extra calories."" Image: © AaronAmat/Getty Images",7,0.19228852,0.22276373,True

Published July 11, 2023, in JAMA, the study included about 4,200 people with high LDL (bad) cholesterol who couldn't take statins because of side effects. Their average age was 68, and about two-thirds had diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to take either bempedoic acid or a placebo. Over a follow-up period of about 40 months, those taking the drug were 30% less likely to die of a heart-related condition, have a heart attack or stroke, or need an artery-opening stent compared with the people who took placebos. Bempedoic acid reduced LDL levels by 21%. About 5% to 10% of people who try statins have to stop taking them, mostly because of muscle-related symptoms. This problem is less likely with bempedoic acid, although the drug has other side effects, including a slightly increased risk of gout and gallstones. Still, bempedoic acid can be a good alternative for people at high risk of heart disease who can't take statins. Image: © TimRobberts/Getty Images",8,0.23846939,0.27990717,True

But a new study suggests that carrying extra weight also makes it more likely a person will experience an inflammatory joint condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The study, published online May 23, 2023, by the journal Arthritis and Rheumatology, involved nearly 362,000 adults participating in the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database. Researchers analyzed how participants' BMI — a calculation of body size that considers height and weight — related to their likelihood of developing any of five joint conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and inflammatory spondylitis (a type of spinal arthritis). Other than osteoarthritis, most other joint diseases are driven by inflammation. Participants with higher BMIs (significantly greater than the ""normal"" BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9) had higher rates of rheumatoid arthritis (52%), osteoarthritis (49%), psoriatic arthritis (80%), gout (73%), and inflammatory spondylitis (34%) compared with people in the normal BMI range.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/hormone-therapy-linked-to-higher-risks-of-gerd,Hormone therapy linked to higher risks of GERD,1,"Women who have used hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms may be more likely to develop gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, a new analysis suggests. The study, published online June 27, 2023, by the journal Menopause, analyzed data from five earlier studies involving more than one million women, none of whom had been diagnosed with GERD before the study's start. Researchers found that participants who were current or past users of hormone therapy for relieving menopausal symptoms were 29% more likely over all to develop GERD, which is characterized by heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and chest pain. Women who used estrogen alone had a 41% higher odds of GERD, while progesterone-only hormone therapy was linked to a 39% higher risk. Hormone therapy combining estrogen and progesterone was associated with only a 16% higher risk for GERD. The study was observational, meaning it couldn't prove that hormone therapy causes GERD, only that an association exists. Female hormones are believed to relax the muscles that control the lower esophageal sphincter (the valve between the bottom of the esophagus and top of the stomach), allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. Women considering hormone therapy should review their other risk factors for GERD and make necessary lifestyle changes to prevent it, including quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and not lying down after eating heavy meals, the study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-bumpy-truth,The bumpy truth,1,"Noticing a new lump or bump on your skin is never a happy discovery, especially if it's something unfamiliar — not your garden-variety wart, mole, or hives — and you're not sure whether to worry. Even the term ""lump"" or ""bump"" can be confusing. Located on or just under the skin, these growths can be almost flat or ""cause the skin to pooch out over them,"" says Dr. Rachel Reynolds, interim chair of dermatology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Beyond that, their characteristics run the gamut: soft and squishy or rock-hard, movable or fixed in place, round or irregularly shaped, or growing slowly or quickly. Regardless, they seldom signal something serious. ""People feel a lump and often immediately think it's cancer,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""But that's quite rare."" Most common types Aside from highly common basal and squamous cell skin cancers — which can appear as shiny or wartlike domes — the vast majority of other skin bumps are either epidermal cysts or lipomas, Dr. Reynolds says. What are their qualities? Epidermal cysts often appear on the face or back and ""may feel like a marble under the skin,"" she says. They grow as benign ""buds"" off hair follicles, filling with a cheesy protein called keratin. (Pilar cysts are another version, but on the scalp.) As they grow, epidermal cysts can become inflamed or infected. ""Sometimes, even after being present for many years, they act like a boil, enlarging and becoming red and tender,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""If that happens, see a doctor, since some will require drainage or antibiotics."" Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that often appear on the trunk or shoulders. They usually grow slowly and can run in families. ""You can't see most lipomas unless they get really big,"" she says. ""But if you are able to feel them, they're really squishy, without any sharp edges."" A lipoma can become uncomfortable if it presses on surrounding nerves. In this case, your doctor can remove it surgically or with liposuction, or dissolve it by injecting it with a drug called deoxycholic acid (Kybella). Diverse list Other types of skin growths are defined by a variety of diverse features. Cherry angiomas are smooth, red bumps representing an overgrowth of superficial blood vessels in the skin. They can range in size from a tiny dot to the diameter of a pencil eraser. Cherry angiomas tend to appear suddenly, especially on the torso, and are more common in people over 40. Dermatofibromas are small, firm, brown or pink spots that contain scar tissue, sometimes appearing after a skin injury or insect bite. They might itch or pucker inward if you pinch them, but they aren't painful. Keloids occur when scar tissue continues to grow beyond an injured area. These large bumps aren't harmful, although ""they can become itchy and unsightly,"" she says. Sarcomas are cancerous tumors that can appear deceptively similar to cysts or lipomas, but typically grow more quickly. ""A sarcoma may feel firmer under the skin, but not like a marble, as an epidermal cyst does,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""It's a little more ill-defined, and sometimes it's painful."" If the lump hurts even when it's left alone, that's a particularly concerning sign. When to act While sarcomas are one of the few types of skin lumps that are dangerous, Dr. Reynolds urges caution about any lump appearing near lymph nodes — immune system nodules located in the armpits, groin, and neck. While lymph nodes can enlarge from a cold or other infection, swollen nodes sometimes signal cancer. Other symptoms might also be present, including weight loss, fever, and chills. ""Get checked,"" she says. ""Some lymph nodes become temporarily inflamed, enlarge, and then go back down, but it's something that should be monitored."" A dermatologist can usually diagnose a skin bump or lump on sight alone. Occasionally, imaging tests or a biopsy may be needed to determine the culprit. You can be proactive by doing the following: Pointing it out. At your next primary care appointment, ask your doctor to take a look. ""Seek a more urgent visit if something is growing quickly, bleeding, feels painful, looks infected, or is red or tender,"" Dr. Reynolds says. Speaking up. Your doctor might not focus on a benign bump unless you mention that it's painful, irritating, or cosmetically unappealing. Image: © jarabee123/Getty Images",0,0.028375449,-0.21624625,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-06-13-jj-700-million-talc-baby-powder-lawsuit.html,"J&J will pay $700 million to 42 states in talc baby powder lawsuit, officials announce",0,"To resolve an ongoing lawsuit over misleading safety claims for its talc-based baby powder products, pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (J&J) will pay out $700 million to 42 states, including Florida, North Carolina and Texas. Officials say the money will settle allegations that J&J's talc products contain asbestos, a chemical linked to cancer. The controversy led to J&J changing its baby powder formula to starch made from maize, or corn, which is typically genetically modified (GMO). Despite its safe use for more than a century, talc has become a target of litigation because depending on where it is mined – talc is a natural mineral – it could contain fibers of asbestos. In its settlement agreement, J&J did not include any admission of guilt for wrongdoing. The settlement agreement's judicial approval is also still pending. ""We have reached a landmark settlement with Johnson & Johnson ensuring that the company will abide by the law and take effective steps to protect consumers from potentially hazardous ingredients,"" announced Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. ""I'm proud to lead this coalition of 43 attorneys general to stand up for consumers’ health and truth in marketing."" (Related: Be sure to check out our earlier coverage about the criminal investigation of J&J to learn more about how we got here.) Billions awarded over talc cancer claims Over the years, J&J has faced a spate of lawsuits claiming that its products are linked to serious and occasionally fatal illness. Back in April, a Chicago grand jury awarded the family of a woman named Theresa Garcia who passed away from mesothelioma $45 million because she regularly used the company's talc-based products.

Back in 2020, J&J was ordered to pay $186 million to four plaintiffs out of New Jersey who claimed that they developed cancer because of J&J's talc-based products. Earlier this month, a woman in Oregon was awarded $260 million in damages after she claimed that J&J's talc-based products caused her to develop mesothelioma. On top of all this, there are tens of thousands of additional plaintiffs who are suing J&J claiming that their serious health conditions were caused by their use of products containing talc. Shareholders of J&J have also sued the company for allegedly misleading them about the alleged health risks of using talc products . To resolve the many cases, J&J declared bankruptcy and allocated upwards of $11 billion for prospective payments, though the courts have not yet approved the company's efforts. ""The Company continues to pursue several paths to achieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc litigation,"" said Erik Haas, J&J's worldwide vice president of litigation, in a statement. ""We will continue to address the claims of those who do not want to participate in our contemplated consensual bankruptcy resolution through litigation or settlement."" Talc in and of itself is safe, just to be clear. Only if talc is mined from areas where there is asbestos pollution is there any risk of illness. The American Cancer Society says that asbestos-containing talc is ""generally accepted as being able to cause cancer if inhaled."" However, there is no credible science to suggest that pure talc poses health risks. Cancer sufferers who believe their disease was caused by J&J talc-based products are asking a federal judge to block the company's proposed bankruptcy settlement. Absent a court order blocking such a filing, the plaintiffs say they will suffer ""irreparable harm."" J&J says it intends to have a subsidiary declare bankruptcy following claimants' vote on a $6.4 billion settlement offer. The company also hopes to gain the support of 75 percent of its claimants as part of a prepackaged bankruptcy plan, with a July 26 voting deadline.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/mastering-memory-maintenance,Mastering memory maintenance,1,"You know something's important to you when you can't seem to get it out of your mind. For many of us as we age, staying sharp seems to be that thing — a priority that becomes increasingly pressing as we hear frightening projections that dementia will affect nine million Americans ages 65 and older by 2030 and 12 million by 2040. ""There's more focus on this now because medical science has done a relatively good job of treating heart disease and cancer, but made fewer strides in addressing memory disorders such as dementia,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. ""I think more people are worried about this than ever."" But concern need not feed a sense of helplessness. Indeed, research is revealing we may possess more power against brain decline than once believed. A large new study zeroes in on the potent influence a healthy lifestyle exerts on memory maintenance, even in older adults with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. ""Just because you have a family history of a medical condition or neurocognitive disorder like dementia doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be stricken with it,"" says Lydia Cho, a neuropsychologist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""Our genetics don't completely define our physical and neurocognitive health. We have a choice for how to improve our bodies and minds to live the healthiest life we can."" Healthy habits matter The new study, published online Jan. 25, 2023, by The BMJ, involved more than 29,000 people in China without dementia (average age 72). Participants initially underwent cognitive testing, as well as genetic testing a variant of the APOE gene, APOE4, which is known to raise the risk for Alzheimer's. Participants also reported how stringently they stuck to six good lifestyle habits: eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, not smoking, not drinking alcohol, being socially active, and engaging in brain-challenging activities. Over the next 10 years, participants periodically reported their lifestyle habits and had additional cognitive tests. By the study's end, people who stuck with at least four healthy habits exhibited significantly slower memory decline than those who didn't practice any healthy habits — and this was true even among participants with the Alzheimer's-related gene. Dr. Budson wasn't surprised by the findings, noting that earlier studies reported similar results. ""But I'm thrilled that additional evidence has shown that by making these healthy lifestyle changes, people really are able to reduce their risk of developing dementia,"" he says. ""I think the study's message is clear: your fate, to a large extent, is in your own hands."" The central six Let's dissect the six lifestyle habits that appear to stem memory decline and why practicing each is important to our brain health. 1. Eat a healthy diet. Doing so reduces the risk of clots and other blood vessel problems in the brain, thereby cutting the risk of stroke — the second leading cause of memory problems. ""What's bad for the brain? One important example is eating simple sugars and carbohydrates in processed foods, which causes glucose and insulin spikes that can damage brain cells,"" Dr. Budson says. 2. Exercise regularly. Defined in the study as at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, consistent exercise boosts brain health through two pathways: reducing the risk of stroke and generating growth factors that help spawn new brain cells. ""Plus, there are more new brain cells produced in a structure called the hippocampus — which is critical for learning and memory — than in any other part of the brain,"" Dr. Budson says. 3. Don't smoke. ""By not smoking, you're doing two very important things: reducing the risk of stroke and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of your red blood cells,"" Dr. Budson says. 4. Limit drinking. ""There's no evidence that having a single alcoholic beverage a day causes permanent damage to the brain, but there's increasing evidence that having more than one drink per day can,"" Dr. Budson says. ""We all should be aware that with even a single drink, our memory performance will simply not be as good as if we abstained."" 5. Stay socially active. This can mean regularly visiting friends or relatives, attending parties, participating in meetings, traveling, and chatting online. (See ""Enjoy time online? It may stave off dementia."") Scientists don't fully understand why this tactic keeps brains healthier. ""I think it's because social interactions activate very large areas of the brain,"" Dr. Budson says. ""It's important to keep your mind active, and social interactions are truly one of the best ways to do that."" 6. Challenge your brain. This can include both fun pursuits and more serious ones — reading, writing, playing chess and card games, taking a course, learning a new language, and the like. ""Crossword puzzles are especially good because they force people to think about concepts and the relationships between words and ideas in new, flexible, creative ways,"" Dr. Budson says. Enjoy time online? It may be linked to lower dementia risk Whiling away a few hours online by posting on social media, playing games, and surfing websites can certainly feel relaxing. But if you're wary that it's just a time sink, think again: using the Internet regularly may be linked to a lower risk of dementia, according to a new observational study. The study, published online May 3, 2023, by the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, tracked more than 18,000 people (average age 55, 54% women) for an average of eight years. Every other year, researchers asked participants about their Internet use and administered cognitive testing. Nearly 65% of study participants reported being regular Internet users. People who connected online for about two hours a day were about half as likely to develop dementia than those who didn't use the Internet regularly. The Internet users also maintained better verbal reasoning and memory. The benefits disappeared at high levels of Internet use — defined as six to eight hours a day. The study authors speculated that online engagement could develop and maintain what's called cognitive reserve — the brain's ability to resist decline and find alternate ways to function efficiently. This could compensate for brain aging. But the study was observational — meaning it couldn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between Internet use and dementia risk — and participants' Internet use was self-reported. ""If we take the findings at face value, this would mean Internet use is another cognitive activity that can keep your brain active and healthy, which can potentially increase thinking and memory skills in the short term and reduce the risk of dementia over the long term,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. More study is needed to determine if specific types of online activity might be related to health outcomes. Image: © Ariel Skelley/Getty Images",7,0.15933889,0.13580845,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/healthy-eating-for-blood-sugar-control,Healthy eating for blood sugar control,1,"If you have diabetes, your healthy eating plan should not be that different from a healthy eating plan for someone without diabetes. In fact, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) echoes the dietary guidelines recommended for the general public: A diet centered on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (peas and beans), and low-fat dairy products. How carbs fit in However, you'll want to pay special attention to your carbohydrate intake. For most people with diabetes, carbohydrates should account for about 45% to 55% of the total calories you eat each day. Make sure you choose your carbohydrates wisely — ideally, from vegetables, whole grains, and fruits. Try to avoid highly refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta, and rice, as well as candy, sugary soft drinks, and sweets. Refined carbohydrates tend to cause sharp spikes in blood sugar, and can boost blood triglyceride levels. The facts on fiber Vegetables, fruits, and whole grains not only provide more nutrition per calorie than refined carbohydrates, they also tend to be rich in fiber. Your body digests high-fiber foods more slowly — which means a more moderate rise in blood sugar. Fiber comes in two forms: insoluble fiber, the kind found in whole grains, and soluble fiber, found in beans, dried peas, oats, and fruits. Soluble fiber in particular appears to lower blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity, which may mean you need less diabetes medicine. In addition, a number of studies suggest that eating plenty of fiber reduces the chances of developing heart disease — and people with diabetes need to do all they can to lower their risk.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-your-daily-nap-doing-more-harm-than-good,Is your daily nap doing more harm than good?,1,"A midday snooze can be helpful, but the need for one might signal chronic sleep deprivation. In many cultures, napping in the afternoon is not only common, but a regular part of daily life. In the United States, as many as a third of adults regularly partake in a midday catnap, according to the National Sleep Foundation. If you are in good health, these short daytime sleeps can bring benefits: helping you catch up on a late night, making you feel less cranky, or ensuring you're well rested if you do a job that falls outside traditional daytime work hours. They can also keep you safe on the road, protecting you from drowsy-driving accidents. ""In addition to reducing sleepiness, naps have been shown to improve memory in the laboratory setting. But the research on napping isn't all rosy. There have been some large epidemiology studies that have suggested both benefits and harms with napping on a population level. It is difficult to draw conclusions on the individual level. The pros and cons of naps For example, some studies have found that adults who take long naps during the day may be more likely to have conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and depression. The urge to sleep during the day may be a sign that they are not getting enough sleep at night, which is associated with a higher risk of developing those chronic conditions. Daytime drowsiness may also be a sign that you are getting low-quality sleep, which may indicate a sleep disorder. In some instances, napping sets up a vicious cycle. You sleep during the day to make up for lost sleep at night, but then you have a harder time falling asleep at night because you slept during the day. Limiting naps is one potential strategy to improve overall nighttime sleep. How to nap well If you do plan to take a nap during the day, here are some guidelines you can follow to help ensure that it won't interfere with your nighttime slumber. Time it right. The best time to sleep is the early afternoon, when your body experiences a natural circadian dip. If you take a nap in the late afternoon or evening, it will likely be harder to fall asleep later. Keep it short. Abbreviated sleeps, around 20 minutes, may be best to avoid grogginess when you wake up. Shorter naps can also help to prevent you from having trouble falling asleep that evening. Time it right by setting an alarm. Get comfortable. For a high-quality rest, be sure to find a quiet, cozy spot where you won't be distracted. Examine your motivation. If you need to nap during the day, it is important to assess why you may be sleepy enough to fall asleep during the day, especially if you nap regularly. Track how much sleep you are getting at night. If you aren't getting enough, try to improve your sleep habits (see ""Tips for better nighttime sleep""). If you are already getting at least seven or more hours of sleep at night and are still tired during the day, discuss this with your doctor. Tips for better nighttime sleep If you find yourself tossing and turning at night, here are some strategies you can use to rest more soundly. Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. Avoid alcohol and caffeine late in the day. These can both interfere with sleep quality. Turn off electronics at least one hour before bedtime. Blue light from screens, such as your television or phone, can make it harder for you to fall asleep. So shut them down at least an hour before you turn in. Exercise regularly. Daily workouts during the day can help promote better nighttime sleep. Set the stage. You'll get the best sleep if your room is cool, dark, and quiet. Be alert to signs of a sleep disorder. Pay a visit to your doctor if you are sleeping for the recommended seven to eight hours a night and are still feeling fatigued. Image: © kali9/Getty Images",5,0.24306345,-0.06839304,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/barium-swallow-upper-gastrointestinal-series-or-upper-gi-series-a-to-z,Barium swallow (upper gastrointestinal series or upper GI series),1,"What is the test? A barium swallow, or upper GI series, is an x-ray test used to examine the upper digestive tract (the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine). Because these organs are normally not visible on x-rays, you need to swallow barium, a liquid that does show up on x-rays. The barium temporarily coats the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and intestine, making the outline of these organs visible on the x-ray pictures. This test is useful to help evaluate potential problems in the esophagus, stomach and first part of the intestine. Images may suggest conditions such as an ulcer, narrowing of the esophagus, or an abnormal mass that could be a benign tumor or cancer, How do I prepare for the test? Tell your doctor and the x-ray technicians if there is any chance you could be pregnant. If you have diabetes or take an SGLT2 inhibitor for weight loss, let your doctor know because medication adjustment may be necessary prior to the test. Stop eating and drinking the night before your test. This is important because food in your stomach or intestine could prevent the doctors from seeing a clear outline of these structures on the x-rays. Usually it isn't a problem for you to take most of your regular pills, but you should check with your doctor. What happens when the test is performed? You wear a hospital gown for the test. At the start of the test, you drink barium, a liquid that looks like a milk shake but does not taste nearly as good (most patients say it tastes like chalk). You might also be asked to swallow some tablets that ""fizz,"" causing air-bubbles to be released in your stomach. This might make you feel like burping, but try not to. You will get better pictures if you can keep yourself from burping. The x-ray technician may ask you to stand or lie in different positions over the next few minutes, to help spread around the liquid you have swallowed. Most often, the x-ray pictures are taken while you lie on your back on a table. The x-ray machine or the table is moved a few times so it can take pictures of all of the internal structures. You are asked to hold your breath for each picture so that your breathing movement does not blur the image. What risks are there from the test? There are no significant risks. You are exposed to a small amount of radiation during the test, but the amount of radiation is too small to be likely to cause any health problems. Must I do anything special after the test is over?

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/when-and-how-should-you-be-screened-for-colon-cancer-202309202975,When — and how — should you be screened for colon cancer?,1,"Colon cancer is the second-deadliest form of cancer after lung cancer. If recent messages about colon cancer screening have left you a little confused, that's understandable. In August, the American College of Physicians (ACP) released updated guidance for colon cancer screening that differs from other major organizations, including recommendations from the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the US Preventive Services Task force (USPSTF). So, what do you need to know? How does the advice differ? First, please note that this advice applies only to people at average risk without a family history of colon cancer. If you have family history, or if other health issues put you at higher-than-average risk for colorectal cancer, talk to your doctor about the best course of action for you. The main point of disagreement relates to the age at which people should start getting screened. The new ACP guidance says 50, while the other two organizations recommend 45. That earlier age is endorsed by the U.S. Multisociety Task Force on Colorectal Cancer. It's also endorsed by many physicians, including Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Andrew T. Chan, a gastroenterologist and director of epidemiology at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, who helps explain key facts below. Why do experts suggest starting screening earlier? ""We're facing an unexplained and alarming increase in the incidence of colon cancer in people younger than 50,"" says Dr. Chan. Overall, deaths from colon cancer dropped by 2% per year from 2011 to 2020. But that's not the case among people younger than 50. In that age group, deaths from colon cancer rose between 0.5% and 3% during the same time period, according to statistics published in 2023. The rising rates of colon cancer in younger people are occurring in all racial and ethnic groups, with the steepest rises seen among Alaskan Natives and Native Americans. Overall, Blacks and African Americans are more likely to get and die from colon cancer than whites, and early-onset cases are higher in Black individuals than whites. Efforts to encourage colon cancer screening began in the mid-1990s. Today, about 60% of adults over 50 follow the advice to receive a colonoscopy (described below) on a regular basis. This track record, while not perfect, likely explains the decline in deaths from colon cancer in older adults. ""I think that promoting earlier screening will help stem the rise in early-onset cases, at least for those in their 40s. We've also seen that earlier colonoscopies may be associated with lowering incidence of colon cancer even later in life, ""says Dr. Chan. What are the different screening tests for colon cancer? The two most widely used screening tests are a standard colonoscopy and various stool-based tests. Colonoscopy. For this test, a gastroenterologist or surgeon snakes a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end through your rectum and beyond to inspect the entire length of your colon. Considered the gold-standard test, this procedure can detect precancerous polyps called adenomas, and allow for their removal. The test requires taking laxatives and drinking lots of fluids beforehand to clean all the fecal material (stool) out of your colon. Serious complications, which include perforation or bleeding, are rare, occurring in about three in 1,000 procedures. If no polyps are found, a repeat colonoscopy isn't recommended for another 10 years. If you have polyps, or your risk or symptoms change, this interval will be shorter. Stool tests. The more worrisome colon polyps (adenomas) often shed tiny amounts of blood and abnormal DNA into the stool. This can be detected from samples you collect yourself at home. Two tests, the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical test (FIT), check for blood. They require small stool samples that you put on a card or in a tube that's then mailed to a lab. These tests should be done every year. A third option, the FIT-DNA test, checks for both blood and abnormal DNA; it's usually repeated every three years. Additionally, the guidelines from the American College of Physicians suggest another option: flexible sigmoidoscopy, which inspects only the lower part of the colon, once every 10 years, combined with a fecal FIT testing every two years. However, doctors in the United States rarely order sigmoidoscopy today. If flexible sigmoidoscopy or any of these stool tests show evidence of a problem, a colonoscopy is needed to check for adenomas or cancer. Why might stool-based screening make sense for younger adults? Colonoscopy isn't necessarily the best initial screening test for everyone, says Dr. Chan. That's especially true for younger people, mainly because it's time-consuming and inconvenient. ""Maybe you just can't find time in your schedule or are worried about having a colonoscopy,"" he says. If that's the case, a stool-based test — which is noninvasive and takes very little time — is an appropriate option. ""The worst option is not doing anything, because early detection and treatment can prevent deaths,"" he says.",1,-0.025494892,0.15768431,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/got-expendable-body-parts-202309182974,7 organs or glands you may do just fine without,1,"There was a time when pediatricians routinely recommended tonsil removal, even for healthy children — including me. As far as I can tell, I suffered no ill effects — plus, I got extra ice cream! That practice is no longer routine. But it does raise an interesting question: Why do we have body parts that can be safely removed? If they're not needed, why do humans have them in the first place? One theory is that these nonessential organs and glands once served important roles in the lives of our evolutionary ancestors but now represent anatomic remnants. For example, it was long thought that the appendix helped our predecessors digest food, but over thousands of years became obsolete. And some organs are supremely useful during certain stages of life, but then become expendable. Seven (mostly) unnecessary body parts Here are seven removable parts of the body: Appendix This organ is about the size of your little finger and hangs from the lower right side of your colon. For reasons that aren't clear, this part of the intestinal tract sometimes becomes blocked, infected, or inflamed. Aptly enough, the word appendicitis means inflammation of the appendix. While it may settle down with antibiotic treatment, emergency surgical removal (an appendectomy) is often necessary. Tonsils A network of lymph nodes throughout the body is part of the immune surveillance system that helps trap dangerous invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Consider your two tonsils as larger, specialized lymph nodes watching out for these intruders. They are located at the back of the throat just to the sides of and behind the uvula, the dangling piece of tissue above them. Now, removing the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is only recommended for people with repeated bouts of bacterial throat infections such as strep throat, a condition common in children. Once removed, other lymphoid tissue, including the actual lymph nodes, can take over the job of the tonsils. Adenoids Situated in the back of the nose where the nasal passages meet the mouth and throat, adenoids are similar to tonsils. They can also become inflamed, infected, and swollen. So when the tonsils are removed, the adenoids are generally removed at the same time. The combined procedure is called tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. As is true for the tonsils, other lymphoid tissue takes over when the adenoids are gone. Gallbladder The gallbladder sits just under the liver in the upper right part of the abdomen. It stores bile made in the liver and releases it into the digestive tract when needed to help digest fatty foods. The gallbladder may need to be removed (a cholecystectomy) if it becomes inflamed, a condition called cholecystitis. Most often this occurs due to infection or gallstones, which are a hardened collection of bile. In some cases, rest and antibiotics can control gallbladder inflammation so removal can be delayed or even avoided. Uterus This remarkable reproductive organ has a single purpose: to support fetal growth until birth. When necessary, the uterus can generally be removed (hysterectomy) without impairing health. Common reasons for removal include painful or excessive menstruation, benign growths called fibroids that cause pain or bleeding, or cancer. Thymus gland This small gland sits high in the upper chest behind the breastbone. In a fetus or newborn, it's quite important in the development and maturation of the immune system. But adults can live well without it. Surgery to remove the thymus (a thymectomy) may be recommended if the thymus becomes cancerous, or if a person develops the autoimmune condition myasthenia gravis. Spleen Like adenoids and tonsils, the spleen is made up of lymphoid tissue. It filters the blood, removing infectious organisms, aging blood cells, and other abnormal cells traveling through the bloodstream. But sometimes the spleen becomes overactive and begins removing healthy cells. For example, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) may develop when platelets (clotting blood cells that prevent excessive bleeding) are removed from circulation. With few platelets left in the bloodstream, bruising and bleeding may be life-threatening. Although medications can help, removal of the spleen (a splenectomy) may be necessary. Or sometimes trauma to the spleen, especially after sports injuries and car accidents, causes internal bleeding, which may lead to splenectomy. People who lack a spleen are more prone to certain infections, so if removal isn't urgent, a number of vaccinations are recommended before splenectomy. The bottom line I've heard it said that at least half of all body parts are unnecessary. That's a myth. But as with most myths, there is some truth to it: there are indeed many body parts that can be safely removed. That said, it's generally best to avoid unnecessary surgery and keep the parts you were born with if you can. Sure, you can survive and thrive despite having your appendix removed. But it's worth keeping in mind that our understanding about so-called spare parts may change over time. The appendix is a good example: researchers have discovered that the appendix may play a role in immune development and stores ""good bacteria"" to repopulate the gut in case of future illness. And there is evidence that removing the thymus may slightly increase the risk of cancer, autoimmune disorders, and death. Someday we may discover important functions for other body parts we now consider expendable. And maybe then I'll wish I had my tonsils back.",1,0.07152663,-0.11993244,True

The nation isn’t out of the woods yet, though, in terms of seeing another tripledemic or even quad-demic. So far this year, the CDC estimates that 5.3 million people nationwide have had the flu, and the virus has hospitalized 63,000 people, as well as contributed to 2,700 deaths, including 11 children. Nearly 19% of influenza tests are positive, as are about 13% of tests for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 7% of COVID tests, according to CDC data. Those flu and RSV rates are similar to what was seen about this time last year, but COVID is trailing, at about half its seasonal rate. Also, COVID hospitalization rates are less than half of what they were at this time last year. Based on wastewater surveillance data, which can help predict whether viruses are expanding or receding, RSV and COVID may still be on the upswing. The CDC says COVID wastewater activity detections are “high.” And eight U.S. states recently reported “very high” RSV detections: Connecticut, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. Another 14 states logged “high” RSV wastewater levels, CDC data shows. Flu detections in wastewater monitoring nationwide is currently shown as “moderate” by the CDC, which only tracks influenza A – the type that accounts for most flu cases. Meanwhile, norovirus rates have hit what is at least a five-year high, with positive tests topping 22%, according to data through the end of December.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/treating-stomach-bugs-best-solution-may-simplest-one-201606149799,"When treating stomach bugs, the best solution may be the simplest one",1,"Follow me at @drClaire If you've got a vomiting kid, you don't need to rush out to the drugstore and buy those oral rehydration solutions. Just add some water to the juice you have in the refrigerator, and you're all set. That's the bottom line of a study published in JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association). Researchers studied about 600 children who came to the emergency room with stomach flu and minimal dehydration. Half of them were given dilute apple juice, and half were given an oral rehydration electrolyte solution (like Pedialyte), colored to look like apple juice and sweetened to make it taste better. The families whose children got the apple juice were told to give them whatever fluids they would take once they got home, while the ones who got the electrolyte solution were told to continue giving the solution at home. The children that got apple juice were less likely to need intravenous fluids or end up back in the emergency room. There are a few reasons why doctors have recommended the special solutions. The major reason is that they worry that fluids that have a lot of sugar in them, like juice or Gatorade, can worsen diarrhea. The other reason is that when you have a lot of vomiting or diarrhea, you can lose electrolytes like sodium that are crucial for your body's function. And certainly, in children with severe dehydration or in very small infants, these are real worries. But for the average child sick with stomach flu who has only mild dehydration, these aren't big worries. Those kids generally do just fine as long as they get fluids into them — pretty much any fluids. And as any parent knows, kids are most likely to drink fluids that are familiar to them, and that taste good. Solutions like Pedialyte are not familiar to most children — and while they don't taste bad, they can have an odd taste that many children don't like. Here are some important tips when giving fluids to children with vomiting and diarrhea: Start with clear fluids, like the diluted apple juice used in the study. Once they are keeping that down well, you can try milk or other fluids. The ""dilute"" part is also a good place to start. A little extra water, and a little less sugar, is easier on the stomach. Once they are keeping fluids down, it's less important to add the water. When children are vomiting, give them little bits at a time (an ounce or two) to be sure it stays down. Sometimes kids will be thirsty and want to take more — but their stomach can't handle it yet. Keep giving the small amounts until they are keeping fluids down. If your child can't keep anything down or is having repeated diarrhea, goes more than 6 hours without urinating, seems excessively tired to you, has a high fever, or has really bad pain of any kind, call your doctor. You should also call for advice if your child is less than 6 months old or has any ongoing medical problems. This study underlines what our grandmothers knew instinctively: when it comes to caring for sick children, most of the time, simple is best.",1,0.066215985,0.058497906,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-best-ways-to-manage-heartburn,The best ways to manage heartburn,1,"On call Image: © Juanmonino/Getty Images Q. I have about three episodes of heartburn per month and it often lasts all day. What do you suggest? A. Heartburn is caused by stomach acid moving up and out of the stomach and into the lower part of the esophagus. Reducing the overall acidity in the stomach protects the esophagus from irritation when the stomach contents back up (reflux). The fastest treatment is to neutralize the acid already in the stomach and lower esophagus by taking an over-the-counter antacid. While antacids work within minutes, they often don't last, so you may have to take repeated doses until symptoms subside. For longer-lasting relief, you can try an H2 blocker, which stops stomach cells from making acid. There are several over-the-counter brands of H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and ranitidine (Zantac). Generic versions also are available. H2 blockers come as a pill, liquid, or chewable or effervescent tablet. Most people react well to all of them. H2 blockers begin to act within an hour and last for another 10 to 12 hours. (If you still need the occasional antacid, wait 30 to 60 minutes after taking one before adding an H2 blocker.) Proton-pump inhibitors are even stronger acid blockers. Over-the-counter brands include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24HR), omeprazole (Losec, Omesec, Prilosec OTC), and omeprazole with sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid). If your heartburn doesn't respond to these drugs or lasts for more than 10 days, see your doctor. — by Howard LeWine, M.D. Editor in Chief, Harvard Men's Health Watch",1,0.20554186,-0.02677168,True

The study published June 10 in Lancet Regional Health – Europe looked at the diets of more than 118,000 participants from the UK Biobank study. Researchers behind the study assessed the diets of the participants, aged between 40 and 69 years old, over at least two days. They then split the foods the participants ate into two main categories – plant-based products and animal-based products. Fruits, vegetables, grains, bread, cakes, sweets and plant-based meat substitutes comprised the first group. The second group comprised fish, poultry, red meat, eggs and dairy. The two main groups were further divided into two sub-groups – UPF and non-UPF. Researchers linked this data from the participants to hospital and mortality records to obtain information on cardiovascular diseases. The study authors found that people who ate a lot of plant-based UPFs – which include vegan burgers, vegan sausages, cakes and potato chips – had a seven percent higher risk of suffering conditions such as blocked heart vessels. The same group of people had a 15 percent higher risk of dying from cardiovascular issues when compared with vegetarians who eat less UPFs. (Related: Plant-based fast foods NO HEALTHIER than their regular counterparts, study reveals. ) Deaths from heart disease fell by a fifth in vegetarians who consumed the least UPD. The same cohort also had a 13 percent overall risk reduction for cardiovascular disease. Those who eat UPFs need not fret, the study authors found, as increasing intake of the plant-based non-UPFs like fresh fruits and vegetables by 10 percent was linked to an eight percent lower risk of getting heart disease.

Study co-author Dr. Fernanda Rauber of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil meanwhile remarked that their paper is the first to show that plant-based UPFs are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. She explained that despite being plant-based, such foods may increase the risk of dyslipidemia (abnormally high amounts of fat in the blood) and hypertension due to their composition and processing methods. ""Food additives and industrial contaminants present in these foods might cause oxidative stress and inflammation, further aggravating the risks,"" Rauber explained. ""Therefore, our results support the shift toward plant-based food choices that consider the degree of processing to improve cardiovascular health outcomes."" Nutrition and health expert Dr. Hilda Mulrooney from London Metropolitan University , who isn't part of the study, said the findings will ""cause a stir."" She described the study's topic as ""an area well worth exploring,"" adding: ""I don't agree with the premise that just because something is 'plant-based,' it is automatically healthy."" According to the Mail , UPFs have undergone various modifications to extend their shelf life or make them more appealing to the customer, or sometimes both. It mentioned two signs that a certain food product is ultra-processed. First, a food product could be a UPF if it contains ingredients that can't be found in a kitchen cupboard. Such ingredients include unrecognizable food colors, sweeteners and preservatives. Second, a food product could be a UPF if it contains high amounts of fat, salt and sugar.

The person was more than 65 years old and had unspecified underlying health conditions, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, which announced in mid-December that the person was hospitalized with a severe case. The person’s infection also followed exposure to wild birds in addition to backyard poultry, the department said. “While tragic, a death from H5N1 bird flu in the United States is not unexpected because of the known potential for infection with these viruses to cause severe illness and death,” a CDC news release stated. In the past year, 66 people have had confirmed cases of bird flu in the U.S. The World Health Organization logged 939 human cases globally since 2003, of which 464 were fatal, although most cases and deaths occurred prior to 2015. Last year, there were three human deaths linked to bird flu worldwide. “CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low,” the CDC news release stated. “Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified. As with the case in Louisiana, most H5 bird flu infections are related to animal-to-human exposures.” Bird flu continues to be detected in both commercial and backyard poultry across the U.S., as well as in wild birds. Cattle infections were first detected last year and have now been documented in 16 states. In December, the state of California declared a public health emergency to better manage bird flu outbreaks.

In 2018, Hunter lied on a gun form that he was not a drug addict when in fact he was using crack cocaine at the time. As such, Hunter was found guilty of three federal charges, making him the first son of a sitting president to be convicted in federal court. Hunter could now face up to 25 years in prison for his crimes, though because he is the president's son it is expected that he will receive a much more lenient sentence due to his last name. During the week-long trial, the jury heard details about Hunter's history with using drugs, as well as testimony from his various former romantic partners. The jury also got to see Hunter's personal messages and private photos from his laptop, which was dropped off at a Delaware repair shop prior to the 2020 election. Reports indicate that Hunter's ex-wife, along with two ex-girlfriends, testified before the jury about Hunter's crack cocaine use and failed efforts to get clean.

However, when inflammation persists at low levels after the invader is eradicated, it can become our enemy. Many major diseases that plague us—including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, depression, and Alzheimer's—have been linked to chronic inflammation.

This report will examine the role that chronic inflammation plays in these conditions, and will also provide information on the breadth of drugs currently available to alleviate symptoms. Drug choices range from simple aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that’s been available for more than a century, to disease-modifying drugs and so-called biologics that promise more targeted treatments. LEARN MORE Choose the right foods, and you may be able to reduce your risk of illness. Consistently pick the wrong ones, and you may promote chronic inflammation, which sets the stage for a host of degenerative diseases Inflammation-promoting foods Not surprisingly, the foods that contribute to inflammation are the same ones generally considered bad for our health, including sodas and refined carbohydrates, as well as red meat and processed meats. Some of the foods that have been associated with an increased risk for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease are also associated with excess inflammation. It's not surprising, since inflammation is an important underlying mechanism for the development of these diseases. Such unhealthy foods are also likely to contribute to weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for inflammation. Yet in several studies, even after researchers took obesity into account, the link between foods and inflammation remained, which suggests weight gain isn't the sole driver. Mounting evidence suggests that certain components or ingredients in processed foods, like the emulsifiers added to ice cream, may have independent effects on inflammation. Inflammation-fighting foods Fortunately, you are probably already enjoying many of the foods and beverages that have been found to reduce the risk of inflammation, and with it, chronic disease. They include the following: Fruits and vegetables. Most fruits brightly colored vegetables contain high levels of natural antioxidants and polyphenols—protective compounds found in plants. Nuts and seeds. Studies have also associated nuts and seeds with reduced markers of inflammation and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Beverages. The polyphenols in coffee and the flavonols in cocoa are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea is rich in both polyphenols and antioxidants. Anti-inflammatory eating It's best to focus on an overall healthy diet rather than singling out individual ""good"" and ""bad"" foods, so you won't need bookkeeping software to balance your intake of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory foods. In general, a healthy diet means one high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils. If your plate is dominated by unprocessed plant-based foods and bursting with color, you're on the right track. In addition to lowering inflammation, a more natural, less processed diet can have noticeable effects on your physical and emotional health. A healthy diet is beneficial not only for reducing the risk of chronic diseases, but also for improving your mood and your overall quality of life.",3,0.23728079,0.29479462,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/when-your-colonoscopy-reveals-that-you-have-diverticulosis-hemorrhoids-or-both,"When your colonoscopy reveals that you have diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, or both",1,"In most cases, you won't know they're there. But if things change, home remedies often help. Image: © ttsz, JFalcetti/Thinkstock You received good news after your last colonoscopy: no cancer or precancerous polyps. But with the good news came with another finding: though you don't have symptoms, you do have diverticulosis and hemorrhoids. The news may be puzzling, but don't worry. Both conditions are common and usually don't cause any problems. Diverticulosis Diverticulosis is the term used to describe the presence of diverticula — pouch-like structures that sometimes form in the muscular wall of the colon and bulge outward. Between 40% and 60% of people have them, and they get more common as we age. They tend to cluster in the sigmoid colon, just above the rectum. Diverticulosis only causes symptoms if one of the diverticula bleeds or gets infected. When bleeding does occur, it tends to be intense for a short period, but usually stops on its own. We don't know the cause of the diverticular bleeding, only that something injures a blood vessel in the pouch. Even if bleeding stops on its own, you can still lose a considerable amount of blood, so you should see a doctor. In some people, diverticula can get infected. That's called diverticulitis. It's not clear why or how diverticulitis develops. Age, obesity, a lack of exercise, and a low-fiber diet are risk factors for the condition. Typical symptoms of diverticulitis include lower abdominal pain, more often on the left side; fever; and change in bowel habits, either loose stools or constipation. Mild cases might not even need antibiotics. But most often doctors will treat will oral antibiotics initially to prevent it from getting worse. People with more severe disease, such as an abscess (pocket of infection) or pus that needs drainage, often need hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics. Preventing problems It's not clear yet if we can prevent diverticulosis or diverticulitis. Exercising, controlling your weight, and eating less red meat and more fiber may help. Some data suggest that more fiber reduces the risk of both developing diverticula and getting symptoms if you already have them. Adults should get 25 to 30 grams of dietary fiber every day from foods such as beans, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. A fiber supplement may also help. But add fiber to your diet slowly, since you can get gas and bloating if you increase your fiber intake too fast. What about the warning that eating foods with small seeds can add to diverticulitis risk? There used to be a theory that seeds, nuts, and popcorn increased the risk of diverticulosis and diverticulitis, because they might lodge in the pouches and cause irritation or infection. However, that's never been proved. Seeds and nuts are an important source of fiber. Hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids have a bad rap, but we all have these pillow-like clusters of veins in the lining of the lower part of the rectum and anus, which help play a role in preventing stool leakage. When they become enlarged, however, they are anything but helpful and can even contribute to some leakage in addition to pain, itching, and bleeding. What causes hemorrhoids to swell? The veins are anchored by connective tissue. If the tissue is weakened, the hemorrhoids bulge out. The weakened tissue may be caused by a combination of genetics and pressure from sitting on a toilet too long or straining to have a bowel movement. Pregnancy is also a common trigger. When hemorrhoids in the lower rectum (internal hemorrhoids) swell, they may bleed, and you may see bright red blood in the toilet. But you won't feel the hemorrhoids unless they extend beyond the anus and become itchy. The hemorrhoids most people complain about (called external hemorrhoids) are located outside the anus. If they become swollen, the overlying skin becomes irritated, erodes, and may itch or hurt. A clot can form inside the hemorrhoid, which can be very painful. Treatment and prevention Hemorrhoids are typically diagnosed from a medical history and physical exam. Home remedies are usually effective to treat external hemorrhoids. Sitting in a warm bath may help soothe an irritated hemorrhoid. And lifestyle changes can also make a difference. Avoid sitting and straining on the toilet for long periods, and make sure stool moves along. He suggests increasing dietary fiber intake; using stool softener, such as docusate (Colace); or using a gentle laxative if you're constipated, such as polyethylene glycol 3350 (Miralax). Internal hemorrhoids that are bothersome are usually resolved with minimally invasive procedures performed in a doctor's office.",1,0.14140968,-0.1279586,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/upper-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy-or-egd-a-to-z,Upper endoscopy (eophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD),1,"What is the test? This test inspects your esophagus, stomach and the first section of intestine (the duodenum) using an endoscope. An upper endoscopy allows the doctor to explore the cause of such symptoms as difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, vomiting up blood, or passing blood in the stool. It can also diagnose irritation, ulcers, and cancers of the lining of the esophagus and stomach. During this type of endoscopy, the doctor can also take biopsy samples of tissue. How do I prepare for the test? Don't eat or drink anything for eight hours before this test. It's also best to stop taking aspirin and other NSAIDs for several days beforehand, to reduce the chances of bleeding should your doctor need to take a biopsy. Ask your doctor if you should avoid taking any other medicines on the day of the test. If you have diabetes, talk with your doctor about ways to avoid low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) since you will be fasting. If you wear dentures, remove them before the test. Arrange for a ride home because the medicine given for this test will make you drowsy. What happens when the test is performed? The nurse will place an intravenous catheter into your arm. During the procedure, the nurse will be monitoring your heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen content of your blood. You'll probably be given a sedative through an IV. This medicine may prevent you from remembering the test; it might even make you sleep through it. The doctor will spray a local anesthetic into your throat to prevent you from gagging when the endoscope is inserted. The endoscope used in this test is about half an inch in diameter and long enough to reach from your mouth through your stomach and into the first part of your small intestine. When the doctor places the endoscope in your throat, he or she asks you to swallow. This helps guide the endoscope into your esophagus. You are likely to feel pressure against your throat while the tube is in place and you might experience a ""full"" feeling in your stomach. The doctor gently advances the tube through your esophagus into your stomach. He or she will then move the scope into the duodenum. The camera at the end of the scope takes pictures that appear on a video screen. Your doctor will watch for any suspicious spots on the lining of your esophagus, stomach and duodenum. If any appear, your doctor might use some small clippers on the end of the scope to remove a tiny piece of tissue for a biopsy. Though the exam itself takes only 10-15 minutes, you will probably be in the exam room for 40 minutes or more because of the time it takes to set up. Your throat will feel numb, but this will wear off about 30 minutes later. The sedative will make you sleepy for an hour or more. What risks are there from the test? Complications are rare. One possible complication is aspiration (accidentally inhaling saliva into the lungs), which can cause pneumonia. If a biopsy is taken, or if the endoscope injures the wall of the esophagus or stomach, it can cause bleeding. If severe, internal bleeding can require a transfusion. In rare cases, perforation of the lining of the stomach, esophagus, or intestine can also occur, requiring surgery. The sedative given can sometimes cause an allergic reaction. Must I do anything special after the test is over? Medical personnel will probably watch you for half an hour or more after the test. Although you may eat an hour after the test, you shouldn't drive or drink alcohol for the rest of the day due to grogginess from the sedative. Call your doctor if you experience dizziness, chest pain, difficulty or pain with swallowing, fever, black stools, or vomiting material that looks like coffee grounds. The last two symptoms can indicate that you are bleeding from your stomach lining. How long is it before the result of the test is known? Your doctor can tell you right after the test what was seen in your upper digestive tract. If biopsies were taken, it can take several days to a week before the results are back.",1,0.15551671,0.027282387,True

https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/percutaneous-transhepatic-cholangiography-ptca-a-to-z,Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTCA),1,"What is the test? Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is an x-ray test that can help show whether there is a blockage in the liver or the bile ducts that drain it. Since the liver and its drainage system do not normally show up on x-rays, the doctor doing the x-ray needs to inject a special dye directly into the drainage system of the liver. This dye, which is visible on x-rays, should then spread out to fill the whole drainage system. If it does not, that means there is a blockage. This type of blockage might result from a gallstone or a cancer in the liver. How do I prepare for the test? Tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to lidocaine or the numbing medicine used at the dentist's office, or to x-ray dye. Also tell your doctor if you could be pregnant, since x-rays can harm the developing baby. If you have diabetes and take insulin, discuss this with your doctor before the test. Most people need to have a blood test done some time before the procedure, to make sure they are not at high risk for bleeding complications. If you take an anticoagulant drug (blood thinner), aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or other medicines that affect blood clotting, talk with your doctor. It may be necessary to stop or adjust the dose of these medicines before your test. You will be told not to eat anything on the morning of the test so that your stomach is empty. This is a safety measure in the unlikely case you have a complication, such as bleeding, that might require surgery. What happens when the test is performed? You lie on a table wearing a hospital gown. An IV (intravenous) line is inserted into a vein in case you need medicines or fluid during the procedure. An area over your right rib cage is cleaned with an antibacterial soap. Then the radiologist may take a picture of your abdomen with an overhead camera. Medicine is injected through a small needle to numb the skin and the tissue underneath the skin in the area where the dye is to be injected. You may feel some brief stinging from the numbing medicine. A separate needle is then inserted between two of your ribs on your right side. The needle is advanced into your liver. A small amount of x-ray dye is injected, and some pictures are taken that are visible on a video screen. Your doctor adjusts the placement of the needle until it is clear that the dye is flowing easily through the ducts (drainage tubes) inside your liver. Because taking the x-ray pictures sometimes requires a significant amount of time, the doctor replaces the needle with a softer plastic tube. First, the syringe holding the dye is detached from the top of the needle, leaving the needle in place. The doctor then gently pushes a thin wire through the needle and into the duct where the needle has been sitting. Next the needle is pulled out, sliding over the outside end of the wire. The wire is left with one end inside the liver to hold the position where the needle had been. The doctor then slides a thin plastic tube similar to an IV line along the wire, like a long bead on a string, until it is in the same place where the needle was. The wire is then pulled out, and the syringe with the dye is reattached to the tube. Then more dye is injected through the plastic tube, and pictures are taken with the video camera as the dye spreads inside the liver. If there is no blockage, the dye drains out of the liver through the bile ducts and begins to show up on the x-ray in your small intestine. Once all of the needed pictures have been taken, the plastic tube is pulled out, and a small bandage is placed over your side. The whole test usually takes less than an hour. What risks are there from the test? It is possible to have serious bleeding from this test. In some cases, blood leaks to the outside surface of the liver and causes a buildup of blood there. In other cases, blood can leak directly into the liver's drainage system, in which case it might start showing up in your intestine, causing a bloody bowel movement. It is possible that you could develop an infection after the test, although this is rare. The only soreness you are likely to have is at the skin surface where the needle went in. This should last for only a day or two. In rare cases, the dye used in the test can damage your kidneys. This kidney effect is almost always temporary, but some people have permanent damage. Because x-rays are used, there is a small exposure to radiation. In large amounts, exposure to radiation can cause cancers or (in pregnant women) birth defects. The amount of radiation from the video x-ray in this test is very small—too small to be likely to cause any harm. (The people performing the test will wear lead shields, since they would otherwise be exposed to this radiation over and over.) Must I do anything special after the test is over? Call your doctor right away if you have pain in your right abdomen or shoulder, fever, dizziness, or a change in your stool color to black or red. How long is it before the result of the test is known? You may be told some early results of your test as soon as the test is done. It takes a day or two for the radiologist to review the x-rays more thoroughly and to give your doctor a full report.",0,0.07056995,-0.05132489,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/will-digestive-enzyme-supplements-help-your-heartburn-2018041313643,Digestive enzyme supplements for heartburn?,1,"My love affair with spicy food came to a sad end a few years ago. Age — and I'm guessing too many jalapenos — have left me prone to heartburn if I eat meals with a fiery flare. My doctor says there's no underlying condition causing the problem, and advises me to avoid the foods that seem to trigger symptoms. But that's tricky sometimes. So I was particularly interested when a friend suggested that an over-the-counter (OTC) digestive enzyme supplement might help. I learned pretty quickly that there are lots of ads for the pills and powders. It's a booming business, with sales for OTC digestive enzymes of all kinds expected to reach $1.6 billion by 2025. About the supplements touted for heartburn relief OTC digestive enzymes claim they can help you break down food, just like digestive enzymes your own body makes (mostly in the pancreas). For example, the enzymes produced by the pancreas include: lipase, which breaks down fats amylase, which breaks down carbohydrates proteases and peptidases, which break down proteins. The supplement versions of these enzymes come from plants and animals. Plant sources include bromelain, derived from pineapples; papain, derived from papayas; and lactase that's obtained from purified yeasts or fungi. Animal sources include enzymes from the pancreases of pigs, cows, or lambs. But there's no way to know what's really in supplements. The FDA does not regulate them, therefore you can't be sure what the pills are really made of or the exact amounts of enzymes they may contain. ""It's buyer beware,"" warns Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Do supplements help heartburn? Sometimes the body doesn't make enough digestive enzymes. This can slow the digestion process and lead to uncomfortable symptoms. Would a digestive enzyme supplement help treat the symptoms of occasional heartburn, caused by acid reflux, slow stomach emptying, or an unknown reason (like I have)? The answer is that we don't know. ""Unfortunately, there is little evidence that OTC digestive enzymes are helpful for heartburn,"" says Dr. Staller. But we do know that OTC digestive enzymes can help manage other conditions. For example, if you don't make enough of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase, needed to digest the sugar in beans, you may benefit from taking an alpha-galactosidase supplement (Beano, Bean Relief). Or if you don't make enough of the enzyme lactase, needed to digest lactose — the sugar in milk and milk-based products — you may benefit by taking a lactase supplement (Lactaid, Lactrase). ""If you don't have lactase, the undigested lactose goes to the colon, which leads to more fluid entering the colon and more gas produced by bacteria in the colon. That creates bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea,"" explains Dr. Staller. ""A supplement might help."" What about prescription enzymes? Sometimes doctors recommend taking prescription-strength digestive enzymes. These may be necessary when digestion enzyme levels are low because of a health condition such as chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis. Taking prescription digestive enzyme medications helps bring levels back to normal. ""People with known deficiencies clearly get a benefit,"" says Dr. Staller. But these medications are not appropriate treatments for heartburn. The rest of my story Because I am persistent, I asked if it would hurt to try an OTC digestive enzyme for occasional heartburn. Both my doctor and Dr. Staller had the same answer: ""In most cases, it's unlikely to be harmful. But don't spend a lot of money on them,"" Dr. Staller advised. In other words, it won't hurt, but we don't know if it will help. So don't make a big investment in the treatment. With that dubious green light and a lot of curiosity, I tried an OTC enzyme made from papaya. And guess what — it helped! But as a health reporter I know that this could have been the result of my own personal hope (the placebo effect) or just a happy coincidence. I also know that ignoring my doctor's orders to avoid spicy foods (which is my heartburn trigger, but may not be someone else's) would be foolish, and could cause damage to my esophagus. So would using digestive enzymes as a crutch to eat anything I want. The lesson for me is that the OTC digestive enzyme supplement is there if I need it in a pinch, and that it might or might not work. But I won't make a habit of using it. I'll keep the spice factor dialed down to a lower heat, and l'll just have to learn to love being symptom-free the way I once loved those jalapenos.",1,0.21529339,0.09172185,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fermented-foods-for-better-gut-health-201805161607,Fermented foods for better gut health,1,"Naturally fermented foods are getting a lot of attention from health experts these days because they may help strengthen your gut microbiome — the 100 trillion or so bacteria and microorganisms that live in your digestive tract. Researchers are beginning to link these tiny creatures to all sorts of health conditions from obesity to neurodegenerative diseases. Fermented foods are preserved using an age-old process that not only boosts the food's shelf life and nutritional value, but can give your body a dose of healthy probiotics, which are live microorganisms crucial to healthy digestion, says Dr. David S. Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. Not all fermented foods are created equal The foods that give your body beneficial probiotics are those fermented using natural processes and containing probiotics. Live cultures are found in not only yogurt and a yogurt-like drink called kefir, but also in Korean pickled vegetables called kimchi, sauerkraut, and in some pickles. The jars of pickles you can buy off the shelf at the supermarket are sometimes pickled using vinegar and not the natural fermentation process using live organisms, which means they don't contain probiotics. To ensure the fermented foods you choose do contain probiotics, look for the words ""naturally fermented"" on the label, and when you open the jar look for telltale bubbles in the liquid, which signal that live organisms are inside the jar, says Dr. Ludwig. Try making your own naturally fermented foods Below is a recipe from the book Always Delicious by Dr. Ludwig and Dawn Ludwig that can help get you started. Spicy pickled vegetables (escabeche) These spicy pickles are reminiscent of the Mediterranean and Latin American culinary technique known as escabeche. This recipe leaves out the sugar. Traditionally, the larger vegetables would be lightly cooked before pickling, but we prefer to use a quick fermentation method and leave the vegetables a bit crisp instead. 2 cups filtered water 1 to 1-1/4 tablespoons sea salt 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 1 jalapeño or a few small hot chiles (or to taste), sliced 1 large carrot cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds or diagonal slices 1 to 2 cups chopped cauliflower or small cauliflower florets 3 small stalks celery (use only small inner stalks from the heart), cut into 1-inch-long sticks 1 bay leaf 1 cabbage leaf, rinsed Warm the water (no need to boil). Stir in the sea salt until it dissolves completely. Set aside to cool (use this time to cut the vegetables). Add the vinegar just before using. The brine can be made ahead of time and stored in a sealed glass jar on the counter to use when ready to pickle. Set a quart-size canning jar in the sink and fill it with boiling water to sterilize. Empty the jar and tightly pack the vegetables and bay leaf inside to within 1 to 2 inches from the top of the jar. Pour the brine over the vegetables to fill the jar to within 1 inch from the top. Wedge the cabbage leaf over the top of the vegetables and tuck it around the edges to hold the vegetables beneath the liquid. Set jar on the counter and cover with a fermentation lid. (Alternatively, use a standard lid and loosen it a bit each day for the first few days, then every other day, to allow gasses to escape.) Let pickle for three to five days, depending on the indoor temperature. Check the taste after a couple of days, using clean utensils. Vegetables will pickle faster in warmer climates. Make sure the vegetables stay packed beneath the level of the liquid and add salted water (2 teaspoons sea salt dissolved in 1 cup warm filtered water) as needed. When the vegetables are pickled to your liking, seal the jar with a regular lid and refrigerate. Vegetables will continue to slowly pickle in the refrigerator. They will keep for about one month. Taste for saltiness before serving and, if desired, rinse gently to remove excess salt.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/6-self-help-tips-for-hemorrhoid-flare-ups-201307196496,6 self-help tips for hemorrhoid flare-ups,1,"Getting older has its benefits—and its drawbacks. Included in the latter are hemorrhoids. These swollen blood vessels on the outer rectum and anus can turn bowel movements into intensely painful experiences. Classic symptoms include rectal pain, itching, bleeding, and possibly prolapse (protrusion of hemorrhoids into the anal canal). Although hemorrhoids are rarely dangerous, they can be a painful recurrent bother. Hemorrhoids come in two varieties. The internal type sprout from within the rectum. External hemorrhoids develop on the anus itself. Either way, stools passing by them can cause pain and bleeding. But simple self-help measures can ease the ordeal of most hemorrhoids and allow healing. Here are effective steps you can take to care for hemorrhoids—and when it's time to seek out a procedure to remove them. What helps hemorrhoids Here are six self-help tips to ease hemorrhoid pain and promote healing: Step up the fiber. The most important thing is to add fiber to your diet. This is best done with foods that help hemorrhoids, but some people find they need to take a fiber supplement to get 20 to 30 grams of fiber per day. To start, try a psyllium husk fiber supplement, such as Metamucil or a generic equivalent. If psyllium causes gas or bloating, try a supplement containing wheat dextrin or methylcellulose. Lubricate the process. Mixing a tablespoon of mineral oil with applesauce or yogurt and eating it at breakfast or lunch allows stool to slide by the hemorrhoid more easily. But don't do this for a long period (if you try this, you may want to place a liner in your undergarments to absorb any oil leakage.) Don't delay. When you feel the urge, go to the bathroom immediately; don't wait for a more convenient time. Putting off bowel movements can worsen constipation, which then aggravates hemorrhoids. Try elevation. Elevating your feet a bit with a step stool as you sit on the toilet changes the position of the rectum in a way that may allow for easier passage of stools. Off-the-shelf remedies. Over-the-counter products are available for hemorrhoids. These include witch hazel infused pads and soothing creams, like Preparation H and its generic equivalents. If these don't work, ask your doctor about prescription preparations. Sit in a sitz. Don't overlook the relief offered by sitz baths. Using a basin that fits under the toilet seat, soak the inflamed area in warm water for 10 to 15 minutes, two to three times a day. If hemorrhoids persist no matter what steps you take to make them go away, or they begin to bleed, interfere with bowel movements, or make life difficult, ask your doctor about medical procedures to remove or reduce hemorrhoids.",1,0.28652698,-0.11836352,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/leaky-gut-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-you-2017092212451,"Leaky gut: What is it, and what does it mean for you?",1,"Before the medical community had better understanding of the mechanisms that cause disease, doctors believed certain ailments could originate from imbalances in the stomach. This was called hypochondriasis. (In Ancient Greek, hypochondrium refers to the upper part of the abdomen, the region between the breastbone and the navel.) This concept was rejected as science evolved and, for example, we could look under a microscope and see bacteria, parasites, and viruses. The meaning of the term changed, and for many years doctors used the word ""hypochondriac"" to describe a person who has a persistent, often inexplicable fear of having a serious medical illness. But what if this ancient concept of illnesses originating in the gut actually holds some truth? Could some of the chronic diseases our society faces today actually be associated with a dysfunctional gastrointestinal system? What exactly is leaky gut? Inside our bellies, we have an extensive intestinal lining covering more than 4,000 square feet of surface area. When working properly, it forms a tight barrier that controls what gets absorbed into the bloodstream. An unhealthy gut lining may have large cracks or holes, allowing partially digested food, toxins, and bugs to penetrate the tissues beneath it. This may trigger inflammation and changes in the gut flora (normal bacteria) that could lead to problems within the digestive tract and beyond. The research world is booming today with studies showing that modifications in the intestinal bacteria and inflammation may play a role in the development of several common chronic diseases. Who gets a leaky gut (and why)? We all have some degree of leaky gut, as this barrier is not completely impenetrable (and isn't supposed to be!). Some of us may have a genetic predisposition and may be more sensitive to changes in the digestive system, but our DNA is not the only one to blame. Modern life may actually be the main driver of gut inflammation. There is emerging evidence that the standard American diet, which is low in fiber and high in sugar and saturated fats, may initiate this process. Heavy alcohol use and stress also seem to disrupt this balance. We already know that increased intestinal permeability plays a role in certain gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. The biggest question is whether or not a leaky gut may cause problems elsewhere in the body. Some studies show that leaky gut may be associated with other autoimmune diseases (lupus, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis), chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, arthritis, allergies, asthma, acne, obesity, and even mental illness. However, we do not yet have clinical studies in humans showing such a cause and effect. A path toward a healthier gut Although it is unusual to hear the term ""increased intestinal permeability"" in most doctors' offices, alternative and integrative medicine practitioners have worked on gut healing as an initial step to treat chronic diseases for decades. Other cultures around the world often recommend specific diets to make people feel better. Even in the United States, it is common to see people changing their diets after getting sick. A common initial step some practitioners take is to remove foods that can be inflammatory and could promote changes in the gut flora. Among the most common are alcohol, processed foods, certain medications, and any foods that may cause allergies or sensitivities. Controversy still exists on whether leaky gut causes the development of diseases outside the gastrointestinal tract in humans.

Each of us has a flat plate of muscle just beneath our lungs, separating our chest from our abdomen. It's called the diaphragm, and it helps us breathe: when it moves downward, it causes the lungs to pull in air through the nose and mouth. And when it moves upward, it forces air out of our lungs. The movement of the diaphragm is directed by the brain, which sends signals down nerves that end in the diaphragm. A hiccup occurs when the brain sends a signal for the diaphragm to shift forcefully downward, suddenly pulling a lot of air into the back of the throat. The sudden change in pressure causes a narrow area in the throat to temporarily snap shut, causing the ""hic"" sound of a hiccup.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/weak-kidneys-pay-attention-but-dont-worry-excessively,Weak kidneys? Pay attention but don't worry excessively,1,"You often hear older people say I have weak kidneys. That doesn't mean they can't do their job or are destined to fail. But it does indicate you have some form of chronic kidney disease. The kidneys — the body's blood-filtering urine factory — have less capacity to filter toxins from the blood and excrete them in the urine. How the kidneys work Every day, a healthy kidney filters a total of about 200 quarts of blood, removing waste products, excess water, and certain chemicals. If the kidneys didn't keep things in balance, you would slowly poison yourself. The kidneys have a remarkable ability to keep working despite changing conditions, like drops in blood pressure. The tiny filtering tubes in the kidney, called glomeruli, adapt in various ways. In a serious health crisis, the kidneys may shut down completely as a defensive move to keep fluids in the body. That's called an acute kidney injury, and it happens frequently to people who are hospitalized. What causes low kidney function? Half of U.S. adults over 75 may have below-normal kidney function. Most of them will never get sick from it. Several conditions or factors can injure the kidneys, leading to lower kidney function and possible chronic kidney disease. These include: diabetes smoking excessive alcohol consumption uncontrolled hypertension high cholesterol in addition, some medications can injure the kidneys. If you are leading a heart-healthy lifestyle (regular exercise and a nutritious plant-based diet), that will help protect your kidneys. How low is low? A healthy kidney filters wastes from the blood at a rate of 90 milliliters (ml) per minute or more. This is known as the glomerular filtration rate, or GFR. With time, many men's kidneys start to slip, but function must decline quite a lot before you start to really feel the impact. You feel fine up to the point that kidney function is almost gone, which means you can lead a normal life with reduced kidney function. On the other hand, lack of early warning from symptoms can deny you the chance to slow the slide. Most people don't start feeling really ill until kidney function is under 10%. How is kidney function tested? As part of standard blood tests, your doctor can check the creatinine level to assess kidney function. Creatinine is released from muscle cells into the bloodstream. Creatinine is one of the things that the kidneys filter from the blood. If the kidneys start to lose some function, blood creatinine level rises. The creatinine level is used to calculate an estimate of the GFR and provide an estimate of your kidney function. Most people who have a minor reduction in kidney function can take steps to not keep the kidneys from getting worse. If the function is somewhat low but stable, you may need to see your doctor only once per year. If the GFR is declining or it is already under 50, it's best to see a kidney doctor. How high blood pressure damages the kidneys High blood pressure can cause tiny cracks in the lining of arteries, which provide a breeding ground for fatty deposits that hamper blood flow. As the arteries that feed blood to the kidneys narrow, the body produces renin, a hormone that makes small arteries narrow further. This worsens high blood pressure, causing even more kidney damage. Over time, restricted blood flow can damage or destroy the nephrons, the tiny filtering units inside your kidneys. How to protect your kidneys and improve kidney function If kidney function begins to decline, you can take the following steps. Keep your blood pressure and blood sugar within norms This will help slow the decline in kidney function. In particular, keep blood pressure below 130/80. Lower your cholesterol Taking a statin medication to lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol may help to protect the kidneys. Also, individuals with reduced kidney function are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease, so reducing cardiac risk factors is important. Consider medication Certain prescription medications can protect the kidneys. The ones that physicians often use for this purpose are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), and SGLT2 inhibitors. These drugs lower pressure in the kidney filters and limit further damage. Eat a plant-based diet; limit protein intake Plant-based proteins rather than animal-based proteins may put less strain on weak kidneys. Use NSAIDs with caution Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, interfere with kidney function. Taking them when you are also depleted of fluids can lead to kidney shutdown and possibly hospitalization. For pain relief, acetaminophen (no more than 3,000 milligrams per day) is safer. If you must take an NSAID, be sure to drink plenty of water. Image: Undefined Undefined/Getty Images",7,0.28900853,-0.002320528,True

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/should-i-worry-about-the-side-effects-of-proton-pump-inhibitors,Should I worry about the side effects of proton-pump inhibitors?,1,"Q. I have had intermittent heartburn for years. My doctor ordered an upper endoscopy to look at my esophagus and stomach. My esophagus is inflamed due to acid reflux. I was told to stay on prescription-strength pantoprazole indefinitely. But I worry about side effects. If I eat less acidic foods and don't experience heartburn, is it necessary to take this drug to keep my esophagus healthy? A. Pantoprazole (Protonix) is a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). Drugs in this class are the most potent acid inhibitors. Examples of other PPIs include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), and rabeprazole (AcipHex). Most are available in low doses and less expensive generic formulations over the counter. Doctors can prescribe higher doses if needed. There is no simple yes-or-no answer to your question, but here is how I approach this common situation. First, I would ask these questions: Did you have the endoscopy because the heartburn was more frequent or severe? Were you taking any acid blockers before the endoscopy, and if yes, at what dose and for how long? These questions are to understand the severity of your esophageal inflammation (esophagitis). If your reflux was severe, or if you had been on treatment for a few weeks before the endoscopy and still had visible esophagitis, your doctor's recommendation sounds correct. Treating esophagitis with a high-dose PPI is not just about controlling symptoms. Persistent severe esophagus inflammation from acid reflux can lead to scarring and narrowing of the lower esophagus. It also increases your risk of developing a condition called Barrett's esophagus, which can lead to cancer. Most people who take PPIs have minimal, short-term side effects. PPI use is associated with a slightly increased risk of infections. It's possible to develop lower blood levels of vitamin B12 or magnesium. Studies looking at other long-term concerns regarding bone thinning, dementia, and kidney disease have provided some reassurance that PPIs are not the cause. Many people with acid reflux and esophagitis can use less potent anti-acid therapy. Your doctor may advise a repeat upper endoscopy before making any changes, or you might begin to taper down first. If you and your doctor decide it's the right time to transition, you will want to do it gradually. Never stop the acid blocker abruptly, as this could lead to rebound heartburn, since your body is used to the medication. It's also important to maintain lifestyle changes to reduce acid reflux, including losing weight if needed, not lying down after eating, and avoiding foods that typically cause heartburn.

U.S. life expectancy is expected to go from 78.3 years in 2022, to 79.9 years in 2035, to 80.4 years in 2050, according to forecasting models from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. But the U.S. is not keeping pace with peer nations. The U.S.’s global ranking in life expectancy is expected to drop from 49th in 2022 to 66th in 2050, said an analysis published in The Lancet. The modest increase in life expectancy is caused by a decline in mortality rates, including a drop in heart attack, stroke, and diabetes deaths rates. But American mortality is challenged by public health problems such as drug overdose deaths and obesity, the report said. “In spite of modest increases in life expectancy overall, our models forecast health improvements slowing down due to rising rates of obesity, which is a serious risk factor to many chronic diseases and forecasted to leap to levels never before seen,” co-senior author Christopher J.L. Murray, MD, a professor and director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, said in a news release. “The rise in obesity and overweight rates in the U.S., with IHME forecasting over 260 million people affected by 2025, signals a public health crisis of unimaginable scale.” Women fare worse than men in the life expectancy forecast. The study predicts that life expectancy for U.S. women will drop from 51st in 2022 to 74th in 2050. For U.S. men, the life expectancy will drop from 51st to 65th over that time span. The researchers said that increasing access to preventive health care for all Americans could help increase the nation’s life expectancy. If risk factors such as obesity, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure were eliminated by 2050, 12.4 million deaths could be averted in the U.S., the study said.",7,0.02974358,0.18769751,False

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/after-the-baby-grows-up-how-will-your-heart-fare,"After the baby grows up, how will your heart fare?",1,"Pregnancy is seldom a walk in the park. But if yours was marked by complications such as high blood pressure or diabetes, you probably hoped those hurdles were behind you after your baby was born. Hope isn't a strategy, however, when it comes to protecting your health. And it's becoming increasingly evident that certain pregnancy and reproductive factors raise red flags about your cardiovascular health years or decades down the line. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine equates pregnancy to a ""cardiovascular stress test,"" noting that certain complications point toward higher risks for heart attack or stroke later in life. ""We now understand that pregnancy is a window into a woman's future health,"" says Dr. Brett Young, an OB/GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. For example, women who had high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia (a condition marked by high blood pressure that can impair function of the heart, kidneys, and other organs) while pregnant later develop chronic high blood pressure at least twice as often as women whose blood pressure remained normal in pregnancy. Women who had these blood pressure problems also have 70% higher rates of diabetes and 30% higher rates of elevated cholesterol later in life, according to a Harvard-led 2018 study in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Diabetes or blood pressure complications, estimated to affect 5% to 10% of pregnancies, are on the rise as obesity rates climb and more women decide to have babies later in life. ""While they often resolve soon after, those conditions can translate into long-lasting increased risks for heart disease for these women,"" says Dr. Nicolas-Sonny Nguyen, a Boston-area family medicine doctor and clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School. ""Once you've finished having children, years or decades may go by where these health issues may not come up."" Common disease features New research magnifies these revelations. Pregnancy and childbirth complications can pose deadly implications as long as 50 years later, according to a study published online March 8, 2023, by Circulation. The analysis, which used long-term data from more than 46,000 women who gave birth between 1959 and 1966, tracked participants' deaths from any cause until 2016. Pregnancy-related high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, and preterm delivery were all linked to a greater risk of death in the decades following childbirth. Meanwhile, problems such as infertility, miscarriage, and stillbirth may be associated with greater stroke risks later in life, according to an analysis published online June 22, 2022, by The BMJ. Researchers reviewed data on nearly 619,000 women ages 32 through 73 from seven countries. Infertility was associated with a 15% higher risk of stroke, while repeated miscarriages were linked to a 37% higher risk. Women who'd had recurrent stillbirths were 44% more likely to die of a hemorrhagic stroke, characterized by uncontrolled bleeding in the brain. What's the link? Pregnancy and reproductive difficulties can share common features with cardiovascular disease, including blood vessel problems and fat deposits in blood vessel walls, Dr. Young says. ""Pre-eclampsia is a systemwide condition that affects many organs,"" she says. ""We think of it as a disease of the placenta, but the consensus is that it's actually a blood vessel disease that also affects the kidneys, heart, and brain."" Similarly, diabetes during pregnancy may signal simmering problems with a woman's insulin production or how efficiently her cells use energy. ""Even if you had gestational diabetes for only a few months of your life in a span of five, six, or more decades, those few months may have made a difference in your risks,"" Dr. Nguyen says. The need for check-ups The mounting research drives home the importance of preventive care and screenings for women who had complicated pregnancies and deliveries — especially at midlife and beyond, when heart disease risks already increase. ""The risks become less silent when women who had these pregnancy conditions reach menopause or beyond,"" Dr. Nguyen says. But even younger women — including those whose pregnancies weren't marked by complications — shouldn't skip regular primary care visits. A 2022 study in the journal Hypertension suggests that limited medical follow-up in the year after childbirth may miss high blood pressure in one of 10 new mothers whose blood pressure wasn't elevated during pregnancy. If you've dealt with pregnancy or reproductive difficulties, tell your primary clinician and your other doctors. Your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels should be monitored regularly, and any irregularities should be ""treated aggressively,"" Dr. Young says. ""Even if a woman had problems during only one of her pregnancies many years ago, that history is very important. It should be part of a conversation for the rest of her life,"" Dr. Nguyen says. Also don't ignore even mild symptoms that might be heart disease trouble signs, such as chest pain, unusual fatigue, neck or jaw pain, or shortness of breath. ""Talking about symptoms that pop up is important because early recognition is key,"" Dr. Nguyen says. ""Create a platform to have these conversations with your clinicians instead of waiting years, when coronary artery disease has perhaps been brewing for a while."" High blood pressure during pregnancy also endangers the brain Cardiovascular health isn't the only thing that might suffer in the aftermath of pregnancy-related high blood pressure. A new analysis suggests this complication is linked with later cognitive problems as well. The study, published online May 9, 2023, by Neurology, involved more than 2,200 women (average age 73), 83% of whom had at least one pregnancy. Every 15 months over an average of five years, participants took nine tests of memory and thinking that evaluated aspects such as processing speed, executive function, language, and overall cognition. After assessing the women's medical records for pregnancy-related data, researchers found that those who'd had high blood pressure during pregnancy experienced a greater decline in many aspects of thinking skills compared with women who maintained normal blood pressure while pregnant. The effects were even more pronounced among women who'd had pre-eclampsia, a more severe pregnancy-related blood pressure disorder. The findings aren't surprising, given that blood vessel problems that may contribute to pregnancy complications can also affect vessels that carry blood to the brain, says Dr. Brett Young, an OB/GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The results also suggest monitoring and managing blood pressure during and after pregnancy could pay important dividends for brain health later in life. The findings are consistent with the understanding that pregnancy can illuminate a woman's future health risks, including many conditions that affect the blood vessels, Dr. Young says. ""The brain,"" she says, ""requires healthy blood vessels just like the placenta does — it's a system based on blood vessels."" Big-picture risks Pregnancy complications, of course, are far from the only factor that influences a woman's future pregnancy risk. Also important are family history, race, diet, weight, and physical activity levels. ""It's important to know that heart disease affects one in five women, regardless of age,"" Dr. Nguyen says. ""Some women may think, 'I'm 35 and had my kids, I'm healthy, and there's no way for me to get heart disease.' But that's not true. I emphasize this to encourage women to optimize their lifestyle."" ""When you see your health care providers, be honest and thorough about your medical history, especially relating to your pregnancies,"" says Dr. Nguyen.

The Joint House Committees on Public Order and Safety on Human Rights are addressing a 43% rise in mortality rates from 2021-2023, compared to a 2% rise in previous years (2016-2020). On February 27, 2024, the committee began to have hearings on the excess mortality rates . The spikes in mortality were primarily witnessed, not in 2020 during the “global pandemic,” but during 2021 and 2022, during a global COVID-19 vaccine rollout. This so-called vaccine was a global experiment, based on fraud and implemented with great coercion and force.

The committee, chaired by Reps. Dan Fernandez and Bienvenido Abante Jr., are leading the inquiry (House Resolution 1481) based on data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Sally Ann Clark, an independent researcher, presented these findings to the committee, noting a correlation between the vaccine rollout and the spike in deaths. She reported a consistent increase in deaths across all vaccinated age groups , suggesting that the vaccines were a major contributor to these excess deaths. Clark's analysis indicated that nearly half a million excess deaths occurred up to September 2023, accompanied by a decline of nearly one million births during those same years, reflecting a continuous drop-in birth rate since 2019.

The spike in excess mortality specifically occurred in March of 2021, when the vaccine program was initially rolled out. In July and August of 2021, the spike intensified, correlating with the rollout of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccines. “There was a big spike in deaths exactly concurrent with that,” Clark testified. By 2022, there was still a rise in excess deaths, on average 8-9% greater than the pandemic year of 2020. According to her data, at least a half a million excess deaths occurred across the Philippines since the vaccine rollout, and the problem continues to this day. Clark provided the data to Congressman Zia Alonto Adiong as the House Committee members were discussing the horrifying implications of WHO’s proposed pandemic treaty – an agreement that would perpetuate the same vaccine holocaust of 2021-2023, with even greater force, while covering up the vaccine holocaust that continues through the relentless booster campaigns. Calls for accountability grow, as vaccine depopulation schemes blow wide open The fourth hearing on excess deaths in the Philippines was held on May 28, 2024. The hearings highlighted community concerns about the handling of the situation by the Department of Health. Tanya Karina Lat from LUNAS Pilipinas expressed frustration with the Department of Health’s indifference to the adverse effects of the vaccines, and she emphasized the need for accountability throughout the government and its health agencies. Speaking to the committee, she said, “There are Filipino people who are sick and tired of how the DOH has let us down, has refused to admit that people are dying. Turning a blind eye to the people who are getting sick, turbo cancers, myocarditis, children who are suddenly sick as if they are 60, 70-year-old people.” She continued: “Your Honours, we have seen the cavalier attitude of the DOH here over the past five hearings. They don’t care. We look into their eyes. There does not seem to be any sympathy for the people who have died, for the people who are now physically disabled because of these vaccines.” These are explosive hearings . Vaccines are being used to depopulate the Earth , and people are really starting to see it for what it is and speak out around the world.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-apple-cider-vinegar-curb-appetite,Can apple cider vinegar curb appetite?,1,"Q. My friend says she drinks apple cider vinegar at bedtime to help her eat less and lose weight. Could it work? A. Scientific evidence doesn't support drinking apple cider vinegar to dampen appetite or help with weight loss. But even on a commonsense level, it's not likely. Here's why: changing only a single part of our routine — such as drinking a shot of apple cider vinegar each evening — can't help us shed excess pounds as effectively as broader efforts that include changing our overall diet and exercising more often. Beyond that, apple cider vinegar's high acidity level makes bedtime a less-than-ideal time to drink it. Anyone prone to heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should avoid eating or drinking anything acidic at least 30 to 60 minutes before sleep to lessen the odds of uncomfortable burning in the chest. Over time, drinking undiluted vinegar can also erode your tooth enamel. People who still want to consume apple cider vinegar can do it more safely and comfortably if they mix a small amount into a large glass of water or combine it with other ingredients in salad dressings.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/eating-junk-food-may-affect-deep-sleep,Eating junk food may affect deep sleep,1,"Want better-quality sleep? Cut back on junk food. Researchers found that eating an unhealthy diet high in processed food can affect people's deep sleep (also known as slow-wave sleep). During this sleep stage, the pituitary gland in the brain releases a burst of growth hormone, which helps build and repair muscles, bones, and other tissues. Deep sleep also boosts cognitive function and memory. The study, published online May 28, 2023, by Obesity, looked at 15 healthy men with normal sleep habits (sleeping an average of seven to nine hours per night). The participants ate either a healthy or unhealthy diet for one week. The two diets contained the same number of calories, adjusted to each individual's daily requirements. However, the unhealthy diet had a higher content of sugar and saturated fat and included many processed foods. After a week on the diet, the participants spent two nights at a sleep laboratory where their slow-wave brain activity was measured. They first slept a regular night that matched their usual sleep schedule. The next night they were kept awake past their regular bedtime and then allowed to catch up on their sleep to mimic disrupted sleep. After several weeks, the study was repeated, with everyone switching to the other diet and revisiting the sleep lab. The researchers found that when participants followed the unhealthier diet they had poorer-quality deep sleep (indicated by a decrease in slow-wave activity). This was true for both normal and disrupted sleep. They noted that it is difficult to draw conclusions from only one week of poor eating. Still, the findings suggest there may be important ways diet can influence sleep quality. Image: © JGI/Jamie Grill/Blend Images LLC/Getty Images",5,0.3808967,-0.0061088204,True

Researchers evaluated the survey responses of more than 577,000 adults who reported their health and exercise habits and were followed for nine years. Compared with people who said they didn't meet the guidelines for weekly physical activity (150 minutes of aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, plus two or more sessions of muscle strengthening), people who said they met both guidelines had a 48% lower risk of dying from flu or pneumonia during the study period. Even if participants reported doing only aerobic exercise, below recommended amounts, the risks of dying from flu or pneumonia were still 21% lower, compared with people who didn't exercise. The study was observational and doesn't prove that exercise prevents these deaths in people who get sick. But study authors say the link is plausible, since exercise is associated with strong immune systems and lower rates of heart disease and stroke (two risk factors for fatal complications of flu and pneumonia). So even if you aren't up to meeting exercise recommendations, remember that any activity that works your heart and lungs could have big payoffs for you this winter and all year through.

The drugs previously were not required to be covered due to a tangle of laws and policies, among them one that said Medicare Part D plans cannot cover weight loss drugs. GLP-1 medicines work by mimicking hormones that affect blood sugar, digestion, and appetite. First approved by the FDA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the drugs are now approved to treat obesity and overweight, as well as to reduce the risk of problems with the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular problems). Research is increasingly linking the drugs to other health benefits, from helping with sleep apnea to knee pain. In its announcement, the Biden administration called anti-obesity medicines “life-saving drugs,” noting that they can also prevent diabetes. “But for too many Americans, these critical treatments are too expensive and therefore out of reach. Without insurance coverage, these drugs can cost someone as much as $1,000 a month,” the White House’s news release stated, adding that the price of the drugs internationally is lower. A one-year supply of Wegovy purchased at list price is more than $16,000. The White House said the new plan could reduce out-of-pocket costs by up to 95%, which would mean that a person may then pay around $800 per year for Wegovy, for example. “It’s unacceptable that Americans – especially those without insurance coverage for these drugs – are forced to pay so much more for life-saving medications,” the news release stated. “The proposed rule would be implemented at the same time as a comprehensive agenda to lower the costs of drugs, including the drug price negotiation program and increased market competition. We can lower drug prices and improve health outcomes for Americans.” The new coverage would affect about 3.4 million people with Medicare and about 4 million adults who have Medicaid, according to the White House. Estimates have put the cost to Medicare for expanding coverage at $25 billion over a decade, according to The New York Times. More than 40% of U.S. adults meet obesity criteria, and about 15% of adults have diabetes, although many are not aware and remain undiagnosed. Each condition is linked to serious long-term health risks. Medicare coverage under Part D plans has previously been limited to GLP-1 drugs that are FDA-approved for non-weight loss conditions, such as treating diabetes or reducing cardiovascular disease risk. But Part D plans are not required to cover GLP-1 drugs at all, just drugs that treat diabetes or cardiovascular disease.",8,-0.03187399,0.2155356,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/chronic-stomach-pain-in-children-whats-the-most-common-cause-202308232964,Chronic stomach pain in children: What's the most common cause?,1,"The most common cause of chronic stomach pain in children isn't anything you can find on a test or cure with a medicine. And that can make it very challenging to diagnose — and treat. You may not have ever heard of functional abdominal pain. Yet it ranks as the most common cause of stomach pain lasting two months or more in children and teens. What is functional abdominal pain? The mind and the body are tightly connected in ways that we are still working to understand, and this is particularly true of the mind and the gastrointestinal tract. Stress — particularly chronic stress, depression, and anxiety — can lead to pain that is very real. Sometimes the pain is the only symptom of stress, especially in children who are high-achieving or tend to hide their emotions. Sometimes the pain doesn't start from stress but from an infection or other illness, and stays once the illness is gone or adds additional pain to the illness while it is being treated. Worry about the pain and its possible cause can make things worse. The nervous system of the gut can go into overdrive. What are common symptoms of functional abdominal pain? Children with functional abdominal pain can have mild symptoms that just show up occasionally, or they can have more severe symptoms that interfere with daily life. Along with stomachaches, they can have nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea — or some combination of all of them. They may have a poor appetite or complain of feeling full very quickly. When should you contact your child's doctor? It's important to check in with your doctor if your child is having chronic stomachaches. They should have a physical examination, and your doctor may want to do some testing, such as blood or stool tests, as there are many medical conditions that can cause chronic stomachaches. It's particularly important to call your doctor if your child is losing weight has blood in their stool has severe pain has fever, rashes, sore joints, or other signs of illness. If your doctor finds that your child's examination and tests are normal, and they aren't losing weight, chances are that your child has functional abdominal pain. For some families, getting this diagnosis sounds like the doctors are saying that it is all in the child's head. But nothing could be further from the truth. It is very real pain — but it is not being caused by something dangerous, which is very good news. How can you help a child diagnosed with functional abdominal pain? There are many ways to help a child who has functional abdominal pain once the diagnosis is made. They include: Understanding and managing stressors in the child's life, if there are any Medications recommended by your health care team can help with symptoms, such as laxatives for constipation Cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a kind of therapy that teaches strategies for managing pain, as well as managing any stress or sadness that can be contributing Meditation, yoga, and other ways for a child to relax and regulate how they react to their world For some children, a low-FODMAP diet can be helpful Probiotics, peppermint oil preparations, and some other supplements are sometimes used to help soothe and prevent pain. Most children with functional abdominal pain can receive care from their pediatrician. Regular visits are a good idea, to check in to see how things are going and adjust any treatments. If things aren't getting better, a referral to a gastroenterologist can be helpful. Follow me on Twitter @drClaire",1,0.22344406,-0.19280748,True
https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20241125/first-bird-case-child-california,First Bird Flu Case in a Child Reported in California,1,"Nov. 25, 2024 — A child in California has been infected with bird flu. It’s the first case of H5N1 influenza in a minor, and the number of human infections in the U.S. this year has now reached 55, according to the CDC. The child had mild symptoms and was treated with flu antiviral medication. “There were low levels of viral material detected in the initial specimen collected, and follow-up testing of the child several days later was negative for H5 bird flu but was positive for other common respiratory viruses,” the CDC’s news release stated. All household members where the child lived had symptoms but tested negative for bird flu. Some family members tested positive for the same respiratory viruses that the child also had. An investigation is ongoing by California health officials to determine how the child may have been exposed to H5N1 influenza. California officials have documented 29 human cases of bird flu this year, mostly linked to exposure to sick cows. Bird flu was first detected in U.S. cattle in March. Since then, cases have been documented in dairy cow herds in 15 states. Other states with confirmed human bird flu cases are Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that a backyard non-poultry flock was confirmed to have H5N1 influenza after investigating the deaths of 10 birds that included ducks, geese, and a zebra dove. The deaths of the birds were reported to health officials on Nov. 12. “It is not known at this time how the avian influenza virus arrived in Hawai‘i, but the state is in the Pacific flyway, which is a migratory path from the continental U.S.,” a news release from the Hawaii Department of Health stated. “Strict quarantine rules have been in place to prevent bird diseases from entering the state via air transport and maritime routes.” The Hawaii agency emphasized that the risk to the public remains low. Federal officials also expressed the same assessment that the public health risk from H5N1 influenza is low.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heat-rash-how-to-spot-it-and-what-to-do-202308182968,Heat rash: How to spot it and what to do,1,"The first two weeks of July were the Earth's hottest on human record, and people across the country continue to suffer from lingering, suffocating heat waves. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued repeated warnings and tips about recognizing and preventing heat-related illnesses, like heat stroke, heat exhaustion, and heat cramps. But one heat-related illness that people do not always recognize is heat rash. ""Heat rash can indicate that your exposure to excessive heat could lead to other serious heat-related issues, if not addressed,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, a dermatologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""While heat rash is not dangerous in itself, sustained exposure to high heat can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, so it's important to note any early signs that your body is struggling with the heat."" What are the signs of heat rash? Heat rash is also known as miliaria or prickly heat. It is caused when ducts from eccrine sweat glands that lead to the skin's surface are blocked or inflamed. Eccrine sweat glands help your body maintain a steady temperature. When your internal temperature rises, these glands release water that rises to the surface of your skin through tiny ducts. There, it quickly evaporates, cooling your skin and the blood beneath. However, sweat ducts may get blocked when you sweat excessively in hot temperatures, particularly if skin folds or tight-fitting clothes hinder their function. Sweat is then trapped beneath the skin. This triggers inflammation, which leads to the appearance of small, itchy red bumps, similar to tiny pimples or blisters. In people with darker skin tones, these small, itchy bumps may not appear red, but will look slightly darker than surrounding skin. Where and when is heat rash likely to occur? Heat rash can appear on the neck, scalp, chest, groin, or elbow creases. ""Heat rash can occur any time the body sweats, so it is common in hot, humid climates, during hospitalizations, from fever, and during exercise,"" says Dr. Waldman. Heat rash also can occur in newborns, as their eccrine sweat glands are not fully developed. In newborns, heat rash looks like very thin blisters or water drops widely distributed on the face, trunk, arms, and legs. Call your pediatrician for advice if you notice a rash like this. How can you treat heat rash? Heat rash in adults is easy to treat with home remedies. ""The techniques to relieve symptoms also can help prevent heat rash for adults and babies,"" says Dr. Waldman. Cool down. The first step is to get out of the heat and cool and dry your skin. Use a fan or air conditioner, take a cool shower, or apply cool compresses to the affected areas. It's important to know that some people are more vulnerable to heat, and to make plans to help stay safe when temperatures are dangerously high. Prevent irritation. To prevent skin irritation, avoid wearing clothes made from synthetic materials, which can trap heat. (While dry-fit clothing helps to wicks away moisture from the skin, it often can be too tight fitting.) Instead, wear light, loose-fitting cotton clothing that allows airflow over your skin. If a heat rash occurs around your groin area, avoid wearing undergarments until it clears up. Try anti-itch products. Use an over-the-counter topical corticosteroid cream or calamine lotion for itching. However, avoid baby powder, oily or greasy moisturizers, and sunscreen, as they can further block sweat ducts. Heat rash typically goes away within one to two days once you cool down your body. More severe heat rashes can last a week or longer. See your doctor (or follow up with your pediatrician) if a heat rash has not cleared up after a week. Also seek immediate care if you experience pain, intense itching, or the rash appears infected.",0,-0.0070927516,-0.18425636,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/8-ways-to-get-constipation-relief,8 ways to get constipation relief,1,"Most healthy adults have bowel movements three times a day to three times a week. Constipation refers to bowel movements that occur less often than expected or when the stool is hard, dry, and difficult to pass. Though constipation may be a common problem, it is still uncomfortable and stressful when it strikes. The good news is that most people with simple constipation can get relief with at-home treatments such as diet changes, hydration or judicious use of laxatives. Here are top ways to get constipation relief: 1. Dietary fiber One of the first steps you can take to relieve constipation is to increase your intake of fiber through your diet. Fiber needs vary by age and sex, but generally adults should get 22 to 34 grams of fiber a day. There are two different types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Both types of fiber are important for health, digestion, and preventing diseases. But they act differently in the body. Soluble fiber absorbs the water in your food. In doing so, it turns to gel, which slows digestion. Some types of soluble fiber may help lower cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. Soluble fiber is found in the following foods: Oat bran Barley Nuts Seeds Beans Lentils Peas Some fruits and vegetables Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, doesn't absorb water and adds bulk to your stool. It can help food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestine, relieving constipation. Insoluble fiber can be found in foods such as: Wheat bran Vegetables Whole grains You can check the fiber content of common foods and drinks on the USDA food sources of dietary fiber page. Tip: Leave the skin on fruits and vegetables to increase fiber. 2. Fiber supplements Because dietary fiber provides a host of health benefits, you should aim for getting as much of your daily fiber as you can through foods. However, only about 5% of the U.S. population achieves the recommended level of dietary fiber consumption. For individuals who are not obtaining their daily fiber needs through diet, fiber supplements are a convenient way to enhance a low-fiber diet. Popular fiber supplements include the brand names Metamucil, All-Bran, and Citrucel. Fiber supplements vary in their active ingredients. Metamucil's active ingredient is the soluble fiber, psyllium. Citrucel's active ingredient, methylcellulose, is also a soluble fiber. However, the active ingredient in All-Bran is the insoluble fiber, wheat bran. Fiber supplements are among the safest ways to promote regular bowel movements, though they do act slowly and can cause gas and bloating. You should drink plenty of fluids when taking supplements. Because there are many different types of fiber supplement to choose from, with some offering other health benefits, you should speak with your doctor about the right fiber supplement for you. 3. Hydration Keeping hydrated is an important action to take for constipation relief. Water, other liquids, and foods with a high water content can help fiber work better, making stool softer and easier to pass. Good fluid choices include: Water Naturally sweetened fruit juices Vegetable juices Clear soups Staying hydrated is good for your overall health and can help you avoid getting constipated in the first place. How much water should you drink? Most people need about four to six cups of plain water each day. But it may be surprising to learn that optimal water intake is an individualized number. 4. Osmotic laxatives The name may sound technical, but osmotic laxatives are a class of medicines that include products you may be very familiar with, such as milk of magnesia. These laxatives use natural salts, magnesium salts, or undigested sugars to draw water into the large intestine, softening and loosening the stool. MiraLax is another example of an osmotic laxative. 5. Stool softeners Stool softeners add moisture to stools to make them softer and easier to pass. Docusate is one example of a stool softener. Stool softeners are often recommended for people who should avoid straining, such as people who have hemorrhoids or have recently had abdominal surgery. 6. Lubricants Lubricants, such as mineral oil, help stools slide out with more ease. They may be a good choice if your stools feel stuck low in your bowels, if you have an internal tear or ""fissure,"" or if you have pain from hemorrhoids during bowel movements. Mineral oil is taken by mouth and can cause pneumonia if aspirated into the lungs. 7. Stimulant laxatives Stimulant laxatives provide constipation relief by causing the intestines to contract more frequently or more forcefully, encouraging stool to move through the colon. Stimulant laxatives that contain senna, cascara, or bisacodyl, are more aggressive. These medicines may relieve constipation that is severe or has not responded to other treatments. Because of side effects, as well as the possibility of the large intestine becoming dependent on their use, stimulant laxatives should only be used as directed and only for brief periods. Stimulant laxatives can be taken by mouth or inserted into the rectum as a suppository. When taken as a suppository, stimulant laxatives can work in 15-60 minutes. Taken by mouth, stimulant laxatives can cause a bowel movement in 6 to 8 hours, 8. Enema Enemas are another option for constipation relief. They mechanically flush stool from the rectum and lower part of the large intestine. An enema works by loosening the stool in the rectum, thereby triggering the rectal muscles to squeeze as a reaction to their being stretched. A traditional enema is done with a bag of liquid (usually a mixture of salt and water) attached to a plastic tube with a tapered tip. After the tip is inserted into the anus, the enema fluid can be emptied into the rectum. The fluid is then expelled, washing stool out with it. When to call your doctor If self-care treatments don't work, you should see your doctor for constipation relief. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to treat your constipation. If you have fecal impaction (a large lump of dry, hard stool that stays stuck in the rectum), the hard stool may have to be removed by a doctor or nurse using a lubricated, gloved finger inserted in the rectum. This procedure can be painful, so a topical anesthetic is often applied. Some people may need to be sedated. Typically, an enema is given after the hard stool is removed. A high-fiber diet, stool-softening medication, or laxative may be recommended to promote regular bowel movements.",1,0.40895426,-0.070877805,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/common-celiac-disease-symptoms,Common celiac disease symptoms,1,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that mainly affects the gastrointestinal tract. In people with celiac disease, an allergic reaction is triggered when gluten (a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley) is ingested. Over time, the immune reactions triggered by gluten inflame and damage small structures on the surface of the intestine. Unmanaged celiac disease can cause uncomfortable digestive symptoms, as well as symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Some symptoms result from inflammation in the intestines, while other symptoms stem from a lack of nutrients, due to the failure of the damaged intestine to digest food properly. The symptoms of celiac disease vary so widely that there is no such thing as a typical case. Some people with celiac disease experience mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, which can delay a medical diagnosis. Digestive symptoms Digestive symptoms of celiac disease are more common in children than adults. Children generally develop symptoms only after they start eating foods that contain gluten. Digestive symptoms of celiac disease may include: bloating diarrhea constipation gas lactose intolerance loose, greasy, bulky, foul-smelling stools nausea or vomiting abdominal pain. Non-digestive symptoms Some people with celiac disease experience symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Problems associated with celiac disease or caused by poor absorption of nutrients include: bone or joint pain iron-deficiency anemia weight loss arthritis fatigue bone loss tingling or numbness in the hands or feet dermatitis herpetiformis (a skin condition characterized by extremely itchy bumps or blisters) depression, irritability, or mood changes delayed start or missed menstrual periods infertility or repeated miscarriages symptoms involving the mouth, such as canker sores liver disease. How long after eating gluten can symptoms start? The reaction and reaction time varies among individuals. Some people will have a reaction within two to three hours of gluten consumption. Others may not feel anything until the next day or a few days after, and some not at all. Common symptoms after exposure to gluten include: nausea vomiting (very severe in some cases) gas/bloating cramps abdominal pain diarrhea constipation tiredness brain fog muscle and joint pain. Diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease Celiac disease should not be self-diagnosed. If you suspect you or your child has celiac disease, see a doctor. Treatment for celiac disease is focused on eliminating gluten from the diet, which should be done in consultation with a doctor. After a person begins eating a gluten-free diet, symptoms typically improve and may go away. However, if a person consumes small amounts of gluten, symptoms may flare up.",1,0.2668167,0.0047101676,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/celiac-disease-diet-avoiding-foods-that-contain-gluten,Celiac disease diet: Avoiding foods that contain gluten,1,"Celiac disease is a chronic digestive and immune disorder in which consuming foods containing gluten triggers an immune reaction that causes gastrointestinal discomfort and, over time, damages the small intestine. If enough damage is done, the intestine may no longer be able to properly absorb nutrients, leading an individual with celiac disease to become nutrient-deficient. This could affect systems throughout the body. For this reason, it's important for people with celiac disease to follow a strict diet that excludes gluten. What is the connection between gluten and celiac disease? Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. In celiac disease, the immune system mistakenly recognizes gluten as ""foreign."" When people with celiac disease eat foods containing gluten, the immune system attacks the gluten when it gets into the small intestine. The attacks damage villi, which are small, fingerlike projections in the small intestine that help the body absorb nutrients from food. As villi become eroded and flattened, they have trouble absorbing nutrients. In the short term, this can lead to diarrhea and other digestive symptoms. Left unchecked, the inability of the small intestine to absorb nutrients can lead to malnutrition, weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, infertility, seizures, and nerve problems. Diet and treatment of celiac disease While there is no ""cure"" for celiac disease, avoiding gluten can prevent recurring symptoms. A gluten-free diet can also relieve celiac disease symptoms and even allow damage to the small intestine to heal. Because avoiding gluten is the only way to prevent symptoms and intestinal damage from celiac disease from returning, people with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet for life. Foods to avoid with celiac disease If you have celiac disease, you should seek the advice of a doctor or a registered dietitian for ways to maintain a balanced diet while avoiding gluten. Many foods can contain gluten — including many you wouldn't expect, like canned soups, sour cream, and cold cuts. That's why a person with celiac disease has to be vigilant about reading labels and asking questions about food ingredients. In general, avoid the following foods if you have celiac disease: Cereals, breads, or other grain products that include wheat, rye, barley, or oats. This includes white or whole-wheat flour (including cookies, crackers, cakes, and most other baked goods), semolina, couscous, bread crumbs, most pastas, and malt. Processed cheese, cheese mixes, low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese, or sour cream. Dairy products such as yogurt or ice cream that contain fillers or additives. Canned soups or soup mixes. Creamed vegetables. Products that contain modified food starch, food starch, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, stabilizers, or fat replacers or substitutes. (Examples of fat replacers include cellulose, gelatin, dextrins, gums, modified dietary fibers, whey protein, microparticulated egg white, and milk protein.) Check the label for these ingredients. Prepared or processed meats. Beer, gin, and whiskey. Flavored coffee, malted milk, or herbal tea with malted barley. What happens if you are celiac and keep eating gluten? Avoiding gluten is not easy. Gluten is common in foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, and cake. Consuming anything containing wheat, barley, or rye, even in small amounts, can trigger a celiac flare-up. Research has shown that the total daily gluten consumption that seems to be safe for most people with celiac ranges from just 10 to 50 milligrams (mg) of gluten; a slice of wheat bread contains 2,000 mg. Individuals with celiac disease should be aware of the risk of cross-contact in their food. Cross-contact is when a gluten-free food or food product is exposed to a gluten-containing ingredient or food — making it unsafe for people with celiac disease to eat. Cross-contact can happen at home, in restaurants, and in other food service locations. Cross-contact can occur when the same appliances or cleaning supplies are used for both gluten-containing and gluten-free foods. Cross-contact can also occur during the growing, processing, and manufacturing processes. Manufacturers can be contacted to ask if they batch-test their product for gluten, if they know how their raw materials were sourced and produced, and what procedures they go through to prevent cross-contact in the factory. What are good foods to eat if you have celiac disease? While the list of foods to avoid on a celiac diet seems long, you can follow a gluten-free diet and still enjoy many healthy foods. When you're shopping, look for products marked ""gluten-free."" If you have celiac disease, focus on foods you can enjoy that do not contain gluten. These include: fruits vegetables meat and poultry fish and seafood dairy beans legumes nuts chia corn flax millet potato quinoa rice soy tapioca wine gluten-free oats. (Oats are naturally gluten-free, but processing increases the risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing grains. Therefore, oats without a gluten-free label are not considered safe for individuals with celiac disease.) What happens if celiac disease is left untreated? It is important to adhere to a gluten-free diet if you have celiac disease.

A wave of dread overcomes you—your chest hurts, your heart flutters, and you can't catch your breath. These classic anxiety symptoms are often mistaken for a heart attack—and for good reason. Emotional turmoil triggers the release of stress hormones, which act on the same brain areas that regulate cardiovascular functions such as heart rate and blood pressure. A toxic mix Anxiety most often travels in the company of its henchmen—stress and depression. In fact, anxiety and depression are likely different expressions of a shared underlying biology. As many as two-thirds of people with anxiety disorders also suffer from depression at some point in their lives, and over half of people with depression also have an anxiety disorder. Long-term, unrelenting stress can be a precursor to both conditions. Stress, anxiety, and depression can be viewed as one family of related problems. It's hard to tease them out. For example, two people may have similar biology, but one of them is anxious, while the other is more depressed. Heart effects The relationship between heart health and depression is well documented. There is mounting evidence for an independent anxiety–heart disease link as well. In particular, people who have generalized anxiety disorder (see ""Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder"") seem to suffer higher rates of heart attack and other cardiac events. The effect is more pronounced in people who already have a diagnosis of heart disease, and the risk rises with the intensity and frequency of anxiety symptoms. There are several theories about how constant anxiety of this type may affect the cardiovascular system. Anxiety disorders can change the body's stress response, the combination of hormonal and physiological reactions that helps all animals fight or flee from a real threat. People with anxiety disorders have inappropriate ups and downs that can cause high blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances, or heart attack. A malfunctioning stress response promotes inflammation, which damages the artery linings and sets the stage for the buildup of coronary plaque. People with anxiety also have low levels of omega-3 fatty acids, and lower levels may be linked to a higher risk of heart disease. The presence of anxiety and depression also appears to make platelets ""stickier,"" so blood is more likely to clot. The connection between anxiety and heart health also travels in the other direction. A diagnosis of heart problems is likely to raise a person's baseline anxiety. In addition, people who are anxious may also have adopted unhealthy habits (like smoking or overeating) that add to cardiac risk. There's still much to be learned about how anxiety affects the heart. But its harmful effects—along with stress and depression—should not be ignored. Treating anxiety The choice of treatment for anxiety depends on a number of factors, such as its severity, which symptoms are dominant, and other health conditions. The primary approaches for treating anxiety entail talk therapies and medications. Very often, doctors recommend a dual approach that combines psychotherapy and medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy, the most studied technique, helps you identify automatic negative thoughts, understand why they aren't rational, and come up with ways to limit destructive thoughts and reinforce positive ones. Depending on an individual's needs, other types of psychotherapy may be recommended. Relaxation exercises, biofeedback, and meditation are other pill-free techniques for managing anxiety. Many people find relief by taking antidepressant medicines, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft). These are especially useful in people also burdened by depression. However, when seeking medication for anxiety, be sure to discuss your cardiovascular condition with your doctor to avoid adverse effects and undesirable drug interactions. Don't forget regular exercise, after your doctor gives you the go-ahead. It's good for your heart and also helps to boost your mood and calm your nerves.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/thyroid-hormone-how-it-affects-your-heart,Thyroid hormone: How it affects your heart,1,"Image: Sciero/Getty Images The thyroid gland, which wraps around the windpipe, releases hormones that have wide-ranging effects on the body. Too little or too much of this crucial hormone can contribute to heart problems. Located at the base your throat, the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland releases hormones that affect every organ in your body—especially your heart. Thyroid hormone influences the force and speed of your heartbeat, your blood pressure, and your cholesterol level. As a result, a malfunctioning thyroid gland can cause problems that masquerade as heart disease or make existing heart disease worse. An estimated 6% of people in the United States have thyroid disease. Most of them—about 80%— have an underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism. When thyroid levels drop, all the systems in the body slow down, triggering a range of symptoms that include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and dry skin. But these symptoms are very common in people as they grow older, including those with normal thyroid levels. More than half of people with normal thyroid function have symptoms of hypothyroidism. In addition, some people over age 60 with low thyroid levels don't have the classic symptoms. That's why recognizing hypothyroidism can be particularly tricky, he adds. Certain factors make people more likely to have thyroid problems. Hypothyroidism: The cardiac connection Hypothyroidism can affect the heart and circulatory system in a number of ways. Insufficient thyroid hormone slows your heart rate. Because it also makes the arteries less elastic, blood pressure rises in order to circulate blood around the body. Elevated cholesterol levels, which contribute to narrowed, hardened arteries, are another possible consequence of low thyroid levels. Another noncardiac symptom—muscle aches—may also be relevant. Muscle aches can be a symptom of hypothyroidism as well as a side effect of cholesterol-lowering statin medications, a condition known as statin-related myalgia. In fact, research suggests that hypothyroidism is more common in people who can't tolerate statins. Sometimes treating hypothyroidism helps relieve statin-related myalgia. Hyperthyroidism: Excess thyroid hormone The opposite problem, hyperthyroidism, or too much thyroid hormone, is far less common, affecting less than 1% of the population. But it, too, can harm the heart. The classic symptoms include sleeplessness, heat intolerance, excess sweating, weight loss, extreme hunger, and loose bowels. Excess thyroid hormone also causes the heart to beat harder and faster and may trigger abnormal heart rhythms. One is atrial fibrillation, a disorganized rhythm in the heart's upper chambers. A related symptom is palpitations, a sudden awareness of your heartbeat. People with hyperthyroidism may also have high blood pressure. In a person with clogged, stiff heart arteries, the combination of a forceful heartbeat and elevated blood pressure may lead to chest pain or angina. Who's at risk for thyroid problems? The following factors affect your odds of having a thyroid problem: The following factors affect your odds of having a thyroid problem: Family history. People whose first-degree relatives (parents or siblings) have an underactive or overactive thyroid face a higher risk of a similar problem. Gender. Women are five to eight times more likely to have thyroid problems than men. Age. The prevalence of hypothyroidism rises with age, especially after age 60. Race. Whites have higher rates of hypothyroidism than Hispanic Americans and African Americans. Health history. Thyroid problems are more likely among people with a personal or family history of certain conditions, including type 1 diabetes, Addison's disease, pernicious anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, premature gray hair, radiation treatments to the head and neck, and vitiligo.",7,0.35084894,-0.021574274,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-we-reduce-vascular-plaque-buildup,Can we reduce plaque buildup in arteries?,1,"Cholesterol is a fatty substance that occurs naturally in the body, High blood levels of cholesterol encourage the formation and growth of vascular plaques that put you at risk for heart attack and stroke. What causes arterial plaque? Plaque forms when cholesterol lodges in the wall of the artery. To fight back, the body sends white blood cells to trap the cholesterol, which then turn into foamy cells that ooze more fat and cause more inflammation. That triggers muscle cells in the artery wall to multiply and form a cap over the area. But the soft plaque beneath the cap is dangerous. For example, if your blood pressure spikes, it puts pressure on the thin wall of the plaque, which can break open, form a clot, and cause a heart attack. Most major heart attacks occur when plaques rupture. Plaques that gradually enlarge over time are often covered by thick, fibrous caps that can resist breaking apart. They can still block blood flow, causing angina (chest pain brought on by exertion or emotional stress). These blockages can also lead to different type of heart attack. Can you unclog your arteries, or reduce plaque buildup? Making plaque disappear is not possible, but with lifestyle changes and medication they can shrink and stabilize. Doctors especially want to target the softer plaques before they rupture. For example, if you have a 30% blockage in the artery from soft plaque, the goal is to try to suck out the cholesterol from the inside, so the plaque shrivels down to 15% and leaves nothing inside it. How do you get the cholesterol out of the plaque? By lowering levels of cholesterol in the blood, where it travels inside particles called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) deposits cholesterol into blood vessel walls. The drugs used most often to reduce LDL cholesterol levels are statins — such as atorvastatin (Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor). Statins block the liver enzyme that promotes cholesterol production. Very intensive lifestyle changes have also been shown to shrink plaque. Those lifestyle modifications include: Eating a Mediterranean diet It can reduce heart disease risk by 30%. It is rich in olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts and fish; low in red or processed meats; and moderate in the amounts of cheese and wine you can consume. Kicking the habit Smoking damages the lining of the arteries. Quitting can help raise HDL levels. Exercising Aerobic exercise can raise HDL, lower blood pressure, burn body fat, and lower blood sugar levels. Exercise combined with weight loss can also lower LDL levels. Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise. Busting the cholesterol myth Why you can't live without this tricky substance. Cholesterol is often vilified as the bad guy, but we need this waxy, fatty substance to make vitamin D, hormones, bile that aids digestion, and the coverings of our cells. The liver produces 75% of the body's cholesterol, but all cells have the ability to make it. When cells need more cholesterol, the liver sends it via the bloodstream in packages made of cholesterol on the inside and protein on the outside. These cholesterol-laden particles are known as low-density lipoprotein, or LDL. Too much LDL in the blood can cause cholesterol to lodge in the artery walls and form plaques. That's why LDL is known as ""bad"" cholesterol. Whereas LDL particles deposit cholesterol into plaques of atherosclerosis, some high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles help remove cholesterol from plaques. That's why it's often referred to as ""good"" cholesterol. How much HDL and LDL should you aim for? An HDL of 60 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or greater is associated with a lower risk of heart disease. Your personal goal for LDL depends on your cardiovascular risk profile. For people who have coronary artery disease or other evidence of cardiovascular disease, the goal is an LDL of less than 70 mg/dL and some doctors are now aiming for an LDL of less than 55 mg/dL.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/top-7-reasons-you-have-a-headache,Top 7 reasons you have a headache,1,"When a bad headache strikes, you just want it to end. The aching, throbbing pain can be debilitating and result in missed appointments, work, or time with family and friends. Regardless of whether you are prone to migraines, tension headaches, or cluster headaches (see ""Is this your headache?""), you may be able to reduce their frequency by identifying what brings them on. Here's a look at the most common triggers for each of these kinds of headaches. Stress Stress can cause tight muscles in the shoulders and neck, which often leads to tension headaches. When tension headaches become frequent, the pain in shoulder and neck muscles is felt by the brain as pain in the head. Hunger itself can trigger a migraine or tension headache. But eating certain foods may trigger migraines. It could be just one type of food — like beans or nuts — or many foods, such as avocados, bananas, cheese, chocolate, citrus, herring, dairy products, and onions. Processed foods with nitrites, nitrates, yellow food dyes, or monosodium glutamate can be especially problematic. Alcohol intake Alcohol is a common migraine trigger. For some people, a few ounces of red wine are all it takes to provoke a headache, although any kind of alcohol can be a trigger. It's not clear if the alcohol itself is to blame or if another component in the drink causes the problem. Environment Environmental factors such as bright light, smoke, humidity, intense scents, or cold weather are associated with migraine headaches. People with cluster headaches often note that their headaches occur with specific seasonal changes. Hormones Changes in estrogen levels are associated with migraines in women, and women suffer from migraines more often than men. Menstrual cycles may be tied to migraine in younger women. Varying estrogen levels during perimenopause can sometimes start migraines in women who never experienced them before. Estrogen therapy may also be a migraine trigger. Menopause does seem to end migraines in most women. Caffeine withdrawal If you normally consume caffeine in coffee or tea, stopping intake abruptly may trigger a migraine. This may be because caffeine causes blood vessels to constrict; without caffeine, the blood vessels widen and bulge out with each heartbeat — a chief reason for the pounding pain of migraines. Lack of sleep A lack of sleep is associated with migraines and tension headaches. For people with migraine, falling asleep can often stop an attack or at least decrease the severity of pain. Is this your headache? Here are three common types of headaches and their symptoms. Tension headache. Pain often starts in the neck and back and works its way up to feel like a tight band around your head. It often goes away with rest. Migraine headache. Pain typically begins on one side of the head, throbs or pounds, and makes you sensitive to light and sound. It may cause nausea. A migraine can last for hours or days. Cluster headache. A cluster headache feels like a stabbing pain in the eye. It may cause eye tearing or redness, runny nose, or nasal congestion. It may last for a few minutes or hours, go away, and come back several times per day. These headache clusters can occur for months, disappear, and reappear a long time later. What you can do Understanding your headache triggers can help you avoid getting headaches in the future. But identifying triggers can be tricky, especially if you have more than one (like several kinds of food). Try keeping a diary to note the day, time, symptoms, and circumstances surrounding a headache (what had you eaten? where did it happen?). If avoiding triggers isn't enough to keep headaches at bay, talk to your doctor. There are many prescription medications as well as pill-free treatments (acupuncture, meditation, biofeedback, relaxation therapy) that can help reduce headache frequency. And you'll need to go a step further: Make sure you get enough sleep, exercise, eat a healthy diet, limit alcohol intake, and reduce stress. Headaches are a condition of hypersensitivity, so you need balance in your system to fight triggers. Image: © peterschreiber.media/Getty Images",1,0.37154827,-0.055641815,True

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-lowdown-on-glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load,The lowdown on glycemic index and glycemic load,1,"What are the facts about the glycemic load of foods? If you have diabetes, you probably know you need to monitor your carbohydrate intake. But different carbohydrate-containing foods affect blood sugar differently, and these effects can be quantified by measures known as the glycemic index and glycemic load. You might even have been advised to use these numbers to help plan your diet. But what do these numbers really mean — and just how useful are they? Glycemic index vs. glycemic load The glycemic index (GI) assigns a numeric score to a food based on how drastically it makes your blood sugar rise. Foods are ranked on a scale of 0 to 100, with pure glucose (sugar) given a value of 100. The lower a food's glycemic index, the slower blood sugar rises after eating that food. In general, the more processed a food is, the higher its GI, and the more fiber or fat in a food, the lower it's GI. But the glycemic index tells just part of the story. What it doesn't tell you is how high your blood sugar could go when you actually eat the food. To understand a food's complete effect on blood sugar, you need to know both how quickly it makes glucose enter the bloodstream and how much glucose per serving it can deliver. A separate measure called the glycemic load does both — which gives you a more accurate picture of a food's real-life impact on your blood sugar. Watermelon, for example, has a high glycemic index (80). But a serving of watermelon has so little carbohydrate that its glycemic load is only 5. Glycemic load diet Some nutrition experts believe that people with diabetes should pay attention to both the glycemic index and glycemic load to avoid sudden spikes in blood sugar. The total amount of carbohydrate in a food, rather than its glycemic index or load, is a stronger predictor of what will happen to blood sugar. But some dietitians also feel that focusing on the glycemic index and load adds an unneeded layer of complexity to choosing what to eat. The bottom line? Following the principles of low-glycemic-index eating is likely to be beneficial for people with diabetes. But reaching and staying at a healthy weight is more important for your blood sugar and your overall health. Image: © designer491 | GettyImages",3,0.33098853,0.07314937,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/are-fats-so-bad,Are fats so bad?,1,"For years, fat was a dirty word in the dietary world. After World War II, large studies established links between saturated fat and heart disease. Most dietary experts advised people to reduce their fat intake, not only because of the heart connection, but also because fat has more calories per gram than protein or carbohydrate and was assumed to contribute more to weight gain. Many people did so, but they often replaced the lost calories with large amounts of carbohydrates— especially refined carbohydrates. They also stopped eating healthy fats, like olive and canola oils. Instead of helping us slim down, the decline in fat consumption was accompanied by higher rates of overweight and obesity. What went awry? As it turns out, the ""all fat is bad"" message was wrong. Foods that contain fat help fill you up, so you stop eating earlier. More important, not all fats are alike. Saturated fat, found mainly in meat and dairy foods, contributes to clogged arteries and cardiovascular disease. But monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, found in plants and healthful oils, actually protect your health by improving your cholesterol profile. Fat has little direct effect on blood sugar levels. It is a major energy source for your body, and it helps you absorb certain vitamins and nutrients. Another type of fat needed for a variety of vital physiological functions is the family of omega-3 unsaturated fats. Your body can't make these on its own; it must get them from food. Good sources of omega-3s include fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines, and mackerel. Flaxseeds, walnuts, wheat germ, canola oil, unhydrogenated soybean oil, and flaxseed oil are also rich in omega-3s. Trans fats are the worst fats for your health. These fats are made when hydrogen is added to healthy unsaturated fats to solidify them and make them less likely to spoil. Trans fats raise harmful LDL cholesterol, lower beneficial HDL cholesterol, increase inflammation, and make blood more likely to clot. The FDA has ruled that ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, the main source of trans fats in the American food supply, are no longer ""generally recognized as safe."" By now, most food companies have stopped using them. But to be sure, look for products that have a zero on the ""trans fat"" line in the Nutrition Facts box.",3,0.37789258,0.18013452,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/surprising-causes-of-neck-pain,Surprising causes of neck pain,1,"A sore neck can dog you in every position — lying down, sitting, standing, or walking — and the discomfort can be debilitating. The pain might come from structural neck problems such as arthritis (worn cartilage at the ends of your neck bones) or degenerated discs (worn cushions between your neck bones). But often the cause is related to strains in the neck muscles, triggered by something subtle in your daily routine. Here are some surprising culprits behind neck pain and strain, plus quick fixes to feel better. Binge-watching a TV show Like to watch back-to-back episodes of your favorite program? You might be holding your neck in an awkward position for hours at a time. ""A lot of people lean way back while they watch TV, extending the neck backward. Or they lean to the side, forcing the neck too far sideways. Both positions can strain neck muscles,"" says David Evangelista, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. You might also be interested in...

If you lean to the side, use more pillows to fill the gap between your head and shoulders. And change your position every 15 or 20 minutes to give your neck a break, so it doesn't get stiff,"" Evangelista says. Leaning forward You might lean forward throughout the day, whether that's toward a computer monitor that's hard to see or toward another person during a conversation. If you extend your neck each time, that can strain the muscles and cause pain. Quick fixes: If you're going to lean, keep your back straight and tilt forward at your hips. If you can't see your computer monitor well, pull it closer to you or increase the font size. If you have eyeglasses for reading or distance vision, see if they help. If they don't help enough, you can get glasses just for using a computer. If you don't use eyeglasses, get an eye exam: you may need a pair. Similarly, if you lean forward a lot to hear people in conversation, consider getting a hearing test. Wearing a flimsy bra Wearing a bra with little support makes your muscles and ligaments do all the heavy lifting. For someone with heavy breasts, the extra weight can pull the neck forward and stress the neck and shoulder muscles, leading to neck and back pain. Quick fixes: Get a better bra. Make sure both the underwire and middle section of the bra lie flat against your body, the cups aren't too tight or too loose, and the band is level across your back and doesn't ride up. Or try a sports bra or posture bra that brings the weight of the breasts closer to your ribcage and distributes it across your torso. Sleeping in risky positions Sleeping seems harmless, but some sleep positions pose big risks for the neck. When you sleep on your stomach, for example, you rotate your head to the side. Sleeping on your side without the right support pushes your neck toward your shoulder. Staying in these positions for hours can cause neck muscle strain and pain. You might also be interested in...

If you can easily slide your hand in the space between your head and shoulders, you're not getting enough support at night. Get a new pillow to fill the gap. Any material will do,"" Evangelista says. Sitting ""comfortably"" For many people, sitting comfortably means slouching, which is bad for your neck and back. ""Poor posture puts abnormal strain on the spine, including the neck and the ligaments holding it together, and that can cause pain,"" Evangelista says. Quick fixes: Sit up straight: pull your chin back, lower your shoulders, and arch your back. If that's challenging at first, sit on the edge of your chair for a few minutes, which makes sitting up straight a little easier, and then sit farther back on the seat. If your budget allows, get an ergonomic desk chair with low-back support, adjustable height, and a thick seat cushion. Looking at electronic screens We all spend a lot of time looking at electronic devices. For example, you might be looking up at a TV mounted on a wall, or down at a smartphone or laptop. The trouble is that your head is heavy; angling it up or down for a long time leads to muscle strain and pain. Quick fixes: Keep TVs, smartphones, and computer screens at eye level. Consider lowering the height of your TV, elevating your computer screen by putting it on a small stand, or raising your smartphone screen by putting it on a stand or a pillow on your lap. ""Wearing a travel pillow around your neck can add neck support,"" Evangelista says. Lifting heavy dumbbells Evangelista says many people lift dumbbells that are too heavy. ""That throws off your body mechanics. Your trapezius muscles in the back overcompensate. They're connected to the neck, and the overuse can cause neck pain,"" he says.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-06-04-fluoride-exposure-during-pregnancy-increases-neurodevelopment-issues-children.html,COGNITIVE RETARDNATION: Fluoride exposure during pregnancy increases risk of neurodevelopmental issues in children,0,"Since 1945, cities across the United States have added fluoride (hexafluorosilicic acid) to community drinking water systems. Currently, about 73 percent of the U.S. population receives fluoridated water at a targeted concentration of 0.7 mg/L. According to the American Dental Association, this fluoride level is considered optimal for dental health and for the prevention of dental caries. This mass fluoridation of human populations is conducted without the consent of the individual. Established and emerging research shows that fluoride exposure negatively affects the neurodevelopment of children. Now, a new study published in the JAMA Network Open medical journal has found that fluoride exposure during pregnancy increases risk of neurodevelopment issues in children. Fluoride exposure during pregnancy causes low IQ, ADHD and poor cognition in children In Canada, higher prenatal fluoride exposure was linked to lower IQ in children aged 3-4 years. In Mexico, prenatal fluoride exposure was associated with lower IQ in children aged 6-12 years. These studies have also found increases in ADHD for children ages 6-12 years and poorer executive function in children ages 3-5 years. Notwithstanding, a systematic review by the National Toxicology Program reported a consistent association between higher fluoride exposure and lower IQ in children. The latest study is the first in the U.S. to investigate the association between prenatal fluoride exposure and child neurobehavioral outcomes. The study looked at 229 mother-child pairs from Los Angeles, California with an average maternal age of 29.45 years. The median maternal urinary fluoride (MUFSG) levels for the mothers were 0.76 mg/L., and these levels stayed the same regardless of fasting status and maternal smoking exposures.

After the pregnancy, several child neurobehavioral outcomes were measured in the following areas: total problems, internalizing problems and externalizing problems. A 1-IQR increase in MUFSG was associated with: Nearly double the odds of Total Problems T scores being in the borderline clinical or clinical range A 2.29-point increase in Internalizing Problems T scores A 2.14-point increase in Total Problems T scores Due to higher fluoride exposures, some participants had scores in the borderline clinical or clinical range for total problems (14%), internalizing problems (15.3%) and externalizing problems (10%) Fluoride contributes to anxiety and autism in children Children’s neurodevelopment was measured using the Preschool Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a widely validated parent-reported measure for assessing neurobehavior in young children. The CBCL consists of 99 items and was administered when children in the study were approximately 36 months old. The CBCL looks at areas such as emotionally reactive, anxious-depressed, somatic complaints, withdrawn, sleep problems, attention problems and aggressive behavior. A noteworthy finding was that the average MUFSG across the first and third trimesters showed larger negative effects on CBCL scores than third trimester MUFSG alone. When it came to clinical diagnoses, a 1-IQR increase in MUFSG was linked to: A 13.54% increase in emotionally reactive scores A 19.60% increase in somatic complaints scores An 11.29% increase in anxiety problem scores An 18.53% increase in autism spectrum problem scores The study indicates that prenatal fluoride exposure, even at levels common in the U.S., is associated with an increased risk of neurobehavioral problems in children. This suggests a potential need for guidelines to limit fluoride exposure during pregnancy to protect child neurodevelopment. Several countries including Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland have stopped fluoridating their water supplies due to concerns about safety and effectiveness. There are approximately 350 million people around the world who are fluoridated without their consent on a daily basis . Most of these people (200 million) live in the United States. Generations of children are growing up poisoned and forcibly brain-damaged by water fluoridation policies. Thankfully, there are certain types of filters that can take fluoride and its byproducts out of drinking water. These filters are especially important for protecting pregnant women and children who live in communities that forcibly poison the people.

Chan School of Public Health. ""Whether that is directly linked with alcohol, other lifestyle factors, or some combination is still being explored."" Different findings Why might alcohol be healthy? It's thought that moderate intake helps raise levels of ""good"" HDL cholesterol, higher amounts of which are associated with a lower risk for heart disease. Alcohol also may discourage the formation of small blood clots that can lead to heart attacks and stroke. Still, new studies have cast doubt on the connection between alcohol and good health. For instance, a meta-analysis (that is, a study based on data collected in multiple earlier trials) published in March 2023 in JAMA Network Open concluded that low-volume drinkers (1.3 to 24 grams of alcohol daily, or less than two standard drinks) did not live longer than people who never drank. Medium-volume drinking (25 to 44 grams, about two to three daily standard drinks) also didn't offer significant health protection. Rimm is quick to pump the brakes on this and similar conclusions based on data from multiple studies. ""New findings do not mean that everything else that came before is wrong,"" he says. ""The problem with these studies is that they combine good and poor research. So, it's difficult to make a conclusion with information where alcohol is assessed so differently. For many studies they completely ignored measuring drinking patterns."" Another issue is that most alcohol-related studies are observational — that is, they can show an association, but not cause and effect. Other factors linked with alcohol intake may contribute to drinkers' well-being. For instance, a study published in March 2022 in JAMA Network Open found that moderate drinkers had the lowest heart disease risk compared with nondrinkers, suggesting that some alcohol intake may benefit heart health. Yet the research team also discovered that light-to-moderate drinkers had healthier lifestyles than abstainers. They were more physically active, ate more vegetables and less red meat, and didn't smoke as much. Glass half full What seems clear in most research supporting the health benefits of alcohol is that the amount is key. Light to moderate intake remains the best advice. The CDC classifies moderate alcohol intake for adult men as two standard drinks or fewer on days when they drink. A standard drink is approximately 12 ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol by volume, or ABV), 8 to 9 ounces of malt liquor (7% ABV), 5 ounces of wine (12% ABV), or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof spirits (40% ABV). (See ""What is a standard drink?"".) Of course, most people don't drink daily, and some may go for long periods without alcohol. ""But even occasional drinkers may still receive some benefits,"" says Rimm. Does the type of alcohol matter? Not really. Your body reacts to alcohol the same way whether it comes from a California wine, Scotch whiskey, or craft beer. ""The differences between beverages are the percentage of alcohol,"" says Rimm. (To more accurately analyze your drink's alcohol content per serving size, use this drink calculator from the National Institutes of Health: /size.) Your choice of beverage can have adverse health effects unrelated to the alcohol. For instance, a gin-and-tonic cocktail contains high amounts of sugar, and most beer is high in carbohydrates and calories. One part of the alcohol debate everyone agrees on is not drinking too much. ""Studies have found that regularly drinking beyond the recommended amount can raise a person's risk for numerous health problems, like liver failure, high blood pressure, heart failure, and several types of cancer,"" says Rimm. Also, avoid regular excessive drinking and binge drinking (consuming five or more drinks on one occasion). Last call So what is the conclusion? According to Rimm, if you don't drink, there is no reason to begin. If you only occasionally drink, don't increase your intake for health reasons. But for the casual or regular drinker, it's fine to enjoy an alcoholic beverage — in moderation. But you should also weigh your alcohol intake with your overall heart health, adds Rimm. For example, if you have high blood pressure, you may want to drink less or abstain from drinking and focus on getting your blood pressure under control. ""If you have any health issues, it's best to speak with your doctor about what is the proper amount of alcohol for you,"" says Rimm. Image: © Chris Ryan/Getty Images",7,0.31129768,0.1981395,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-are-you-coughing-at-night,Why are you coughing at night?,1,"Some people don't cough during the day, but then start hacking once they're in bed. Several conditions can cause this, and some have a common culprit: gravity. Common triggers Several health issues are associated with nighttime coughing. These are some of the most common: Postnasal drip. Postnasal drip describes a constant trickle of mucus from the upper airways — the sinuses and throat. ""In the daytime, when you're upright, these fluids drain naturally with the help of gravity, and you swallow and clear them. When you lie down, you lose the help of gravity, and mucus collects at the back of the throat. If mucus lands on the vocal cords in the throat, or if you inhale some mucus and it enters the lungs, it triggers a wet cough that produces phlegm or mucus,"" explains Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya, an ear, nose, and throat specialist (otolaryngologist) at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Stomach acid generally is squeezed down into the intestine when the stomach contracts, or is pulled down by gravity. However, when the circular muscle between the stomach and the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) fails to tighten properly, acid can squirt back up, irritating the lining of the esophagus and structures in the throat. This backwash is called reflux. When you lie down, acid doesn't flow naturally into the intestine and can reflux even more easily. ""When acid gets on the vocal cords, you start to cough. In severe cases, acid gets into the windpipe and causes wheezing,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. GERD can cause a dry cough that may or may not be accompanied by a burning feeling (heartburn) or pain in your chest. Medication side effects. Some drugs — for example, ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril, others) or enalapril (Vasotec), which are used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease — can cause a frequent, dry cough as a side effect. ""In the daytime it might feel more like a need to clear your throat. At night, it's much worse,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. Heart failure. Heart failure is the term for a gradual decline in the heart's ability to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. ""When the heart isn't pumping well, fluid backs up and seeps into other tissues. In the daytime, when you're upright, gravity forces the fluid into the lower extremities. When you lie down, some fluid builds up in the lungs, which makes you cough,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. ""A dry cough at night may be one of the first signs of heart failure."" What you should do When a new nighttime cough lasts more than a few weeks, see your doctor to rule out the most dangerous causes, like heart failure. Your doctor can also review your prescriptions for potential side effects that might lead to a cough, and swap out a medication if necessary. Those causes aren't too hard to suss out. ""But it can take a bit of trial and error to figure out if GERD or postnasal drip is causing nighttime coughing. I'll typically recommend a month of treatment for one or the other, depending on symptoms, and see if the person gets better,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. ""If one avenue doesn't work, we can try the other. It's better than doing an expensive diagnostic test that requires anesthesia."" GERD treatment involves dietary modifications (avoiding foods and drinks that seem to make your GERD symptoms worse) plus drugs that suppress acid, such as omeprazole (Prilosec). For postnasal drip, treatment involves medication that either thins mucus secretions (so they flow more easily and don't go in wrong places) or dries up mucus production (to decrease the volume of secretions). Other things you can do In addition to medical treatment, these strategies might help reduce nighttime coughing: Sleep on a wedge pillow. The elevation helps you swallow secretions better and makes it harder for stomach acid to reflux. Use a room humidifier. ""This is especially helpful in the winter, when dry air makes secretions thicker. A humidifier can break them up and thin them out,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. Stay upright after eating. Wait an hour or two before you lie down. Keep cough drops handy. If you wake up coughing, sit up and (when possible) suck on a cough drop to calm an irritated throat. Try some honey. Have a teaspoon of honey, or put some in a cup of decaffeinated tea. Some people find that honey can soothe a sore throat and suppress a cough. And at the very least, it can be a comforting treat.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-06-04-trudeau-women-successful-use-contraception-have-abortions.html,Pro-life group blasts Trudeau administration for implying that women must use contraception and have abortions to become successful,0,"A leading pro-life organization in Canada has strongly criticized the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after a senior cabinet minister implied that women must use contraception and accept unrestricted access to abortion to achieve success in life. In February 2024, the Trudeau administration introduced new federal legislation that would provide universal access to contraception medications and devices, including birth control pills, IUDs, implants and the morning-after pill. The plan is part of Bill C-64 or ""An Act respecting pharmacare,"" which aims to give women the freedom to choose if, when and how they plan their families. In line with this, Randy Boissonnault, the Liberal Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Official Languages, proudly discussed the proposed bill that would ensure the availability of certain contraceptives, including abortifacient pills, at no cost during a heated session of oral questions in the House of Commons on May 24. ""Our government believes in equipping women for success. That is why we are training women in skilled trades. That is why contraceptives will be free under our pharmacare plan. That is why we will defend a woman’s right to choose,"" Boissonnault declared. ""We support women every step of the way. What are the Conservatives doing to support women? They vote no."" However, Pete Baklinski, the communications director for Campaign Life Coalition (CLC), a leading pro-life organization in Canada, sharply rebuked Boissonnault’s comments. ""The Canadian Liberal government under Justin Trudeau literally believes that women need to poison their fertility and kill their preborn children to achieve ‘success.’ Women, is this truly your idea of success? Please respond,” Baklinski wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Human knowledge is under attack!

CLC has been vocal in its opposition to the government's stance on abortion and contraception. Earlier this May, the organization criticized Trudeau for making Canadians fund ""abortifacient pills,"" labeling his approach as ""wrongheaded"" and anti-family. Canadian government continues to support abortion and contraception despite proof of adverse effects The pharmacare legislation was a result of demands by the New Democratic Party (NDP) and its leader, Jagmeet Singh. Singh and his party had made their continued support for the Trudeau government conditional on the introduction of pharmacare legislation before March. The informal coalition between the NDP and the Liberals, established in 2023, is expected to sustain the government until the next scheduled election in 2025. As a matter of fact, the Deputy Prime Minister from Department of Finance Canada gave an official statement in March regarding their next step to universal access to free contraceptives . ""In the upcoming federal budget, we will be delivering free contraceptives through our national pharmacare plan,"" the department wrote on their official website. ""As a proudly feminist government, we take freedom of choice seriously. That freedom should not come with a cost. We are a proudly feminist government, and I am proud to be a feminist Finance Minister. We’re a government that believes women should have the right to make their own choices about their health and their bodies. As women’s reproductive rights are challenged in other parts of the world—including just south of the border—it is more important than ever for us to ensure that Canadian women have access to contraception. Today, tomorrow, and the day after that."" All this, despite mounting evidence of the adverse effects of abortion and contraception.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/does-coffee-help-or-harm-your-heart,Does coffee help or harm your heart?,1,"Many people can't imagine starting their day without a cup or two of coffee. Despite its popularity, however, coffee has been a bit controversial when it comes to heart health. ""The thinking about coffee's effects on the heart has swung in both directions,"" says Dr. J. Michael Gaziano, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. In the 1960s, coffee was considered a risk factor for coronary artery disease, although later research suggested that only heavy coffee consumption (more than five or six cups a day) might harm the heart. But people who drink excessive amounts of coffee often differ in many other ways from those who enjoy modest amounts, Dr. Gaziano notes. A java jolt? Because coffee contains caffeine, a stimulant, people have long wondered whether drinking coffee might ""jazz up"" the heart, triggering palpitations (the odd sensation of a skipped, missed, or strong heartbeat) or atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm problem marked by a rapid, irregular heartbeat). However, people who drink moderate amounts of coffee (one to three cups per day) actually appear to have a lower risk of atrial fibrillation, according to a 2019 study co-authored by Dr. Gaziano. Those who drank either more or less coffee were no more or less likely to develop atrial fibrillation, the study found. Like a lot of dietary research, that study was observational: people reported what they consumed and researchers tracked their health over many years. But a new study took a different approach — it directly measured the short-term effects of drinking coffee (see ""The coffee connection: More steps, less sleep, possible palpitations?""). The coffee connection: More steps, less sleep, possible palpitations? Many coffee drinkers appreciate the energizing buzz from a morning cup of joe. But does that boost have any short-term effects on the heart or other heart-related behaviors or risk factors — namely, exercise, sleep, and blood sugar levels? To find out, researchers put wearable sensors on volunteers for a two-week period. Their study, the Coffee and Real-time Atrial and Ventricular Ectopy (CRAVE) trial, was published March 23, 2023, in The New England Journal of Medicine. (Atrial and ventricular ectopy refers to premature contractions of the heart's upper or lower chambers. People typically experience these as strong, fast, or irregular heartbeats, known as palpitations.) Who: 100 healthy men and women, average age 39. What: Participants wore three separate devices: one that tracked activity levels and sleep, one that measured blood sugar, and one that monitored heart rhythm. They were also tested for common genetic variants that affect how quickly people metabolize caffeine. How: Researchers directed participants to drink as much caffeinated coffee as they wanted for two days and to activate the heart monitor after every cup they drank. They were then to abstain from coffee for two days. They repeated this cycle for 14 days. Key findings: On the days people drank coffee, they took an average of 1,000 extra steps per day. But they slept about 36 fewer minutes per night, on average. Coffee drinking had no apparent effect on blood sugar levels. And while coffee consumption did not increase premature atrial contractions, it did appear to slightly increase the incidence of premature ventricular contractions. Genetic differences in caffeine metabolism had no meaningful effects on any of these outcomes. Steps and sleep ""This new trial provides an important piece of the puzzle,"" says Dr. Gaziano. One finding — that people took more steps on coffee-drinking days — upholds other research showing that caffeine can slightly enhance physical performance. On the other hand, caffeine's adverse effects on sleep are also well known, and insufficient sleep is increasingly recognized as a risk to cardiovascular health. It's hard to know whether the extra exercise balances out the decreased shut-eye people may get from drinking coffee. Most people know how they react to coffee and adjust their intake accordingly, says Dr. Gaziano, who enjoys a daily cup that contains half decaffeinated coffee. Limitations of the study But like all studies, the new study has limitations. For instance, it included only relatively young, healthy coffee drinkers. So the findings may not apply to older people, who tend to be more likely to have palpitations. In fact, people who avoid coffee (and so weren't part of the study) may avoid the beverage because they notice it triggers palpitations. Other heart-related effects The study also discovered that drinking coffee led to a slight increase in premature ventricular contractions. These brief rhythm disruptions (which can feel as though the heart is pounding or flip-flopping) are common and usually harmless, especially in healthy people. However, people with heart disease who notice persistent, odd heart rhythms should talk to their doctor. Earlier research has investigated coffee's effects on other common heart-related risks. Although drinking coffee raises blood pressure, the effect is temporary and doesn't make you more likely to develop high blood pressure; it may even lower your risk. Unfiltered coffee, such as French press coffee and espresso, contains compounds that may raise harmful LDL cholesterol. But the effect is likely trivial compared with the rest of your diet, especially if you drink no more than two cups of unfiltered coffee daily. ""The question I have is, what is the overall impact on the outcome I care most about, which is cardiovascular disease?"" says Dr. Gaziano. When you look at the evidence as a whole, coffee doesn't seem to have a positive or negative effect, he says. If you like coffee, enjoy up to a few cups per day — as long as it's not interfering with your sleep. And don't dump a lot of cream and sugar into your coffee, since that adds saturated fat and empty calories, he adds. Image: © PeopleImages/Getty Images",7,0.25401506,0.16152202,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/keep-midday-naps-to-less-than-30-minutes,Keep midday naps to less than 30 minutes,1,"The health benefits of taking afternoon naps are well documented. They can improve mood, reduce fatigue, and increase alertness. But how long should they last? A study in the May 2023 issue of Obesity suggested the ideal duration is less than 30 minutes. The observational study included 3,275 healthy adults. Baseline health measurements were taken, and participants completed a questionnaire on their napping habits and other lifestyle factors like diet and sleep. The results found that compared with people who did not nap, those who took midday naps lasting 30 minutes or longer had a higher body mass index and levels of cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure. By contrast, those who had shorter naps (less than 30 minutes) did not share these risks and were even less likely to have elevated blood pressure than those who never napped. According to the researchers, some of these risks may be the result of long naps disrupting daily circadian rhythms, which can lead to insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes). Another possible connection could be overeating, as many people who napped for longer than 30 minutes reported feeling hungry and craving sweet foods afterward. Does it matter how often you nap? All afternoon nappers, no matter how long they slept, averaged about four naps per week, but the researchers found no link between frequency and higher health risks. So, enjoy your afternoon naps, but keep them under 30 minutes, and don't nap too late in the afternoon, as it could interfere with your night's sleep.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/when-to-worry-about-your-memory,When to worry about your memory,1,"Ever had those ""senior moments""? You misplace your phone (which was just in your hand). You lose your train of thought during a conversation. You forget directions five minutes after being told. You can't remember the day, but then it pops into your head. These memory slips can be embarrassing and stressful, but are they normal mental lapses — or early signs of dementia? ""The brain is like any other part of the body, and over time, it may not function as well,"" says Ana Trueba Yepez, a psychologist with the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""Brain regions involved with memory — like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex — can shrink, which makes it more difficult to multitask, stay focused, and hold on to information."" The good news is that these kinds of memory lapses are not automatic red flags for dementia. ""These episodes can be alarming, but for the most part, they are not something to worry about,"" says Trueba Yepez. Look for warning signs Senior moments may come and go. It's when they become more frequent or severe or if new cognitive issues emerge that they may signal a problem. For example, during conversations, you now have difficulty following conversations. Or you cut off people when they talk or begin discussing something unrelated to the conversation. Another warning sign is when memory lapses begin to interfere with daily life. For instance, you miss scheduled appointments, forget to pay bills, or fail to take regular medication. You may also have difficulty making decisions and forget regular grooming. ""Many times, people are not aware that memory issues have worsened,"" says Trueba Yepez. ""If you suspect any changes, no matter how innocent, it's best to ask family or friends to look for and point out changes in your memory, with examples."" Still, even these changes are not an automatic indicator of dementia. Sometimes, other factors like diet, alcohol use, medication, and mental problems (such as depression and anxiety) affect your memory. ""Many times, these issues show up in other ways besides memory problems, such as eating more unhealthy foods, showing less interest in your favorite activities, and not keeping up with hygiene and personal appearance,"" says Trueba Yepez. Manage your memory with DANCERS Enhance your memory and protect against dementia with DANCERS: D: Disease management. Control your weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. A: Activity. Cardio exercise improves oxygen and blood flow to the brain. N: Nutrition. Poor nutrition leads to poor brain health. Adopt a plant-based diet. C: Cognitive stimulation. The more you engage your brain, the more likely you can retain memory. E: Engagement. Social isolation is linked to lower cognitive function. R: Relaxation. Your brain needs downtime. Do relaxing activities like yoga, meditation, or reading. S: Sleep. Sleep is when your brain cleans out toxins. Get seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Seeking help A primary care doctor is your first point of contact if you, or someone else, suspects a problem. As scary as it may seem to confront changes in memory, there are many benefits to taking a proactive approach, including these: Ruling out other causes. A medical evaluation can help determine if symptoms are related to a condition, like depression, anxiety, or insomnia. Other factors also can affect memory, such as an infection, a new medication, or an unintended interaction between a prescription drug and an over-the-counter product. Addressing the underlying problem may lead to improved memory. Discovering a problem early. Memory issues could be related to a series of tiny strokes that produce only subtle symptoms, such as short episodes of confusion. In these episodes, small arteries in the brain become narrowed or clogged with fatty deposits, decreasing blood flow. ""The brain damage is often so small and subtle that most people don't notice it or shrug it off,"" says Trueba Yepez. It's important to spot this problem as early as possible to prevent it from progressing to a condition called vascular dementia. Certain medications, such as statins and low-dose aspirin, and lifestyle changes may help prevent further cognitive decline. Getting help sooner. If your doctor may refer you for a neuropsychological evaluation to assesses other cognitive skills, such as attention, executive function, and language. If you are diagnosed with early dementia, it's best to catch it sooner than later, so you can begin to manage the condition. Image: © LaylaBird/Getty Images",7,0.17662565,-0.15598683,True

The international study, published online April 5, 2023, by Neurology, involved nearly 4,500 people (average age 62). About half of the group had already experienced a stroke. Participants were asked about their sleep behaviors over the prior month, including how many hours they usually slept, impaired sleep quality, and napping habits, as well as snoring, snorting, and other breathing problems during sleep. Too little sleep was defined as less than five hours nightly, while too much sleep was defined as more than nine hours. Each of the sleep symptoms raised stroke risk, but participants who reported five or more symptoms were five times likelier to have had a stroke compared with those who had no sleep issues. The results held even after the researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect stroke risk, such as smoking, physical activity level, depression, and alcohol consumption.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/9-gerd-symptoms-to-know,9 GERD symptoms to know,1,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic medical condition that occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus — the tube connecting the mouth and stomach. This usually happens because the ringlike muscles that prevent backflow don't work properly. Common symptoms of GERD Two of the most common symptoms of GERD are heartburn and regurgitation. Many people experience both symptoms. However, some people can experience one without the other. Heartburn Heartburn can feel like a sharp, painful burning in the upper abdomen or middle of the chest, behind the breastbone. This is the most common symptom of GERD, and can rise up from the lower tip of the breastbone toward your throat. Heartburn may be worse when you eat, bend over, or lie down. Regurgitation Regurgitation is the backflow of stomach contents through your esophagus and into your throat or mouth. This may cause you to taste food or stomach acid. Other symptoms of GERD While chronic heartburn and regurgitation are common symptoms of GERD, you may experience one or more less common symptoms of the disease. Not all adults with GERD experience heartburn or regurgitation. Other symptoms of GERD may include: nausea difficulty swallowing (food sticks going down) or pain while swallowing (as food goes down) recurring sour or bitter taste in the mouth chronic cough hoarseness sore throat chest pain, or tightness in your chest or upper abdomen that may wake you up in the middle of the night. What health conditions can be mistaken with GERD? Pain that feels like heartburn also can be a symptom of a heart attack. In fact, the classic symptom of both heartburn and heart disease is discomfort in the center of the chest. Of the over eight million emergency room visits for chest pain each year, severe heartburn (GERD) accounts for over half the cases in which actual heart problems are ruled out. While heartburn is more likely to appear after a large or spicy meal, heart attacks are more common after physical exertion or stress. But if you're unsure, seek medical help right away. When should I see a doctor about GERD? You should see a doctor if you think you have GERD, or if your symptoms don't get better with over-the-counter medicines such as antacids or lifestyle changes. By seeing your doctor early, the physical cause of GERD can be treated, and more serious problems avoided. Always see a doctor if you have symptoms that could indicate GERD complications or other serious health problems, such as: chest pain loss of appetite persistent vomiting problems swallowing or pain while swallowing signs of bleeding in the digestive tract, such as vomit that contains blood or looks like coffee groundsstool that contains blood or looks black and tarry unexplained weight loss. If you think you may be having a heart attack, go to the emergency room. Up to 20% of the US population has GERD. GERD is more common among older adults, obese persons, and pregnant women.",1,0.33778125,-0.104291275,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/gerd-diet-foods-to-avoid-to-reduce-acid-reflux,GERD diet: Foods to avoid to reduce acid reflux,1,"One of the most effective lifestyle changes you can make to prevent the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is to ensure your diet and eating habits do not trigger symptoms. Foods to avoid for GERD While people with acid reflux were once instructed to stick to bland foods, that's no longer the case. There are many healthy and delicious foods you can eat if you have GERD, as well as many interesting ways to prepare them. Still, some foods are more likely to trigger reflux and heartburn. Reflux-triggering foods include: Fatty and fried foods, which linger longer in the stomach, making it more likely that stomach acid leaks back up into the esophagus, causing uncomfortable GERD symptoms. Spicy foods, citrus, tomato sauces, and vinegar, which may intensify heartburn. Chocolate, caffeine, onions, peppermint, carbonated drinks, and alcohol, which are all common heartburn triggers. If you eat any of these foods regularly, try eliminating them to see if doing so reduces your reflux. Then you can try adding them back one by one. Best foods for GERD When making food choices, some foods have been found to be less reflux-triggering. The following foods may help you ease or avoid symptoms. Non-citrus fruits. While you should avoid citrus fruits, you can enjoy non-citrus fruits such as bananas, melons, apples, and pears, among others. Vegetables. Try to eat your vegetables raw. While tomato sauce may bother you, a fresh tomato may not. Lean meats. Lean meats that are grilled, poached, broiled, or baked are your best options. Try using fresh herbs, rather than spices, to make them flavorful. Oatmeal, whole-grain bread, rice, and couscous. These are all good sources of healthy complex carbs and fiber. Unsaturated fats from plants and fish. Replace saturated fats and trans fats with oils such as olive, sesame, canola, sunflower, and safflower; avocados; nuts and seeds; soybean; and fatty fish such as salmon and trout. Best GERD eating habits Besides specific types of foods, changes to eating habits can also help to prevent repeated bouts of heartburn and acid reflux. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Do not lie down after eating. This means no naps right after lunch. When you're standing or sitting, gravity helps keeps acid in the stomach, where it belongs. Do not eat during the three to four hours before you go to bed. So, no late suppers or midnight snacks. Avoid vigorous exercise for a couple of hours after eating. A strenuous workout can send acid into your esophagus. If you're taking medication to help control your symptoms, it's probably okay to have a ""trigger"" food occasionally. But you should generally avoid foods that once caused heartburn.",1,0.37381828,-0.024252936,True

In fact, arteries are complex structures with crucial regulatory functions, and they are in the front line of the battle for cardiovascular health. Every artery has three layers in its wall. The inner layer, or intima, is composed of a thin layer of endothelial cells that are in direct contact with the bloodstream. The middle layer, or media, is composed chiefly of smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers. The outermost layer, or adventitia, is made up of supporting tissues that are dense and strong in larger arteries but nearly absent in the delicate blood vessels of the brain. Endothelial cells have a crucial role in vascular health, and exercise has an important effect on endothelial cells. If all the endothelial cells in your body were placed side by side, they would cover a football field; together, they weigh more than three pounds. Among other things, endothelial cells produce a molecule called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has two crucial functions. It keeps the arterial lining smooth and slippery, preventing white blood cells and platelets from latching on and causing damaging inflammation and artery-blocking blood clots. In addition, it relaxes the smooth muscle cells of the artery wall's middle layer, preventing spasms and keeping arteries open. Movement improves artery health Exercising muscles need more blood. And in response to regular exercise, they actually grow more blood vessels by expanding the network of capillaries. In turn, muscle cells boost levels of the enzymes that allow them to use oxygen to generate energy. More oxygen-rich blood and more efficient metabolism: It's the formula that explains why people who exercise regularly enhance their endurance and strength. To find out if exercise can affect arterial aging, scientists in Italy studied four groups of healthy people: young exercisers, young non-exercisers, elderly exercisers, and elderly non-exercisers. Comparing sedentary youths with sedentary senior citizens, they found that age took a substantial toll on endothelial function and nitric oxide production. But in people who exercised regularly, age had a much smaller effect; endothelial function still declined over the years, but there was a much smaller and more gradual drop in nitric oxide production. Indeed, exercise helped keep arteries young. The Italian researchers studied people who biked, ran, or swam at very high levels. But you don't have to be a triathlete to help your arteries stay young; just 2–3 miles of brisk walking nearly every day is a giant step in the right direction. And it's never too late to start. Scientists from the University of Colorado enrolled 20 sedentary men with an average age of 53 in an exercise program that consisted primarily of walking. At the end of three months, the men had improved their endothelial function so much that they achieved results similar to those of middle-aged and older men who had exercised for years. True, the Colorado volunteers were all healthy, but similar studies of patients with coronary artery disease have demonstrated that exercise can produce important gains in endothelial function, even in people who already have atherosclerosis.",7,0.27025923,0.039995253,True

The affected drugs are liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza), semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy), and tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound). “This was a safety-related labeling change for the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist product class,” an FDA spokesperson said. According to the new label: “There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations.” These medications help control blood sugar for people with diabetes. They also slow the movement of food through the gut, helping people feel full longer and lose weight. Keeping blood sugar steady during surgery is crucial, and so is having an empty stomach before anesthesia or sedation. Otherwise, stomach contents can come up while the patient is unconscious and make their way into the lungs – a dangerous condition doctors call “aspiration.” Patients on these drugs are counseled to tell their health care provider if they are scheduled to have surgery or other procedures that use anesthesia or deep sleepiness (deep sedation), according to the new warning. They are alerted that the GLP-1s they are taking may cause serious side effects, including food or liquid getting into the lungs during surgery or other procedures that use anesthesia or deep sedation. Patients are also advised to tell all their health care providers that they are taking a GLP-1 before they are scheduled to have surgery or other procedures.",8,0.19235648,0.093605235,False

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/brain-gut-connection-explains-why-integrative-treatments-can-help-relieve-digestive-ailments-2019041116411,Brain-gut connection explains why integrative treatments can help relieve digestive ailments,1,"During the 20th century, medicine became very good at compartmentalizing different systems of the body in order to understand them better. However, today we are increasingly realizing that different systems of the body are interconnected and cannot be completely understood in isolation. The brain-gut connection is one very important example of this phenomenon. Anatomy of the brain-gut connection What exactly is the connection between brain and gut? The brain sends signals to the digestive, or gastrointestinal (GI), tract via the sympathetic (""fight or flight"") nervous system and the parasympathetic (""rest and digest"") nervous system. The balance of signals from these two inputs can affect the speed at which food moves through the digestive system, absorption of nutrients, secretion of digestive juices, and level of inflammation in the digestive system. The digestive system also has its own nervous system, the enteric nervous system, consisting of approximately 100 million nerve cells in and around the GI tract. The enteric nervous system receives inputs from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems but can also function independently of them. The enteric nervous system is also intimately interconnected with millions of immune cells. These cells survey the digestive system and convey information, such as whether the stomach is bloated or whether there is infection in the GI tract or insufficient blood flow, back to the brain. Thus, the brain and GI system communicate with one another in both directions. Effects of stress and negative emotions on the gut Because of this strong brain-gut connection, stress and a variety of negative emotions such as anxiety, sadness, depression, fear, and anger can all affect the GI system. These triggers can speed up or slow down the movements of the GI tract and the contents within it; make the digestive system overly sensitive to bloating and other pain signals; make it easier for bacteria to cross the gut lining and activate the immune system; increase inflammation in the gut; and change the gut microbiota (the types of bacteria that reside in the gut). That's why stress and strong emotions can contribute to or worsen a variety of GI conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and food allergies and sensitivities. The negative changes in the GI system can then feed back on the brain, creating a vicious cycle. For example, new research is demonstrating that increased gut inflammation and changes in the gut microbiome can have profound effects throughout the body and contribute to fatigue, cardiovascular disease, and depression. Mind-body approaches to GI ailments Given this strong mind-body/brain-gut connection, it should come as no surprise that mind-body tools such as meditation, mindfulness, breathing exercises, yoga, and gut-directed hypnotherapy have all been shown to help improve GI symptoms, improve mood, and decrease anxiety. They decrease the body's stress response by dampening the sympathetic nervous system, enhancing the parasympathetic response, and decreasing inflammation. Other integrative approaches We've also learned that certain kinds of foods can trigger specific reactions in the gut of sensitive individuals. In those cases, specific diets, such as low-FODMAP for IBS or avoiding acidic foods for GERD, can be helpful for managing symptoms. Diet also profoundly affects the gut microbiome. For example, eating a more plant-based diet with few refined carbohydrates and little or no red meat often leads to a healthier microbiome. These dietary changes in turn reduce intestinal inflammation and may help reduce systemic symptoms such as fatigue or depression and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although each person's situation is unique, a combination of integrative approaches can be helpful for reducing GI symptoms and reestablishing both a healthy gut and a healthy mind.",1,0.2799204,-0.12097067,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/treating-constipation-with-biofeedback-for-the-pelvic-floor-2019051616638,Treating constipation with biofeedback for the pelvic floor,1,"Constipation is often clinically defined as having three or fewer bowel movements a week. Sometimes this is about expectations; people generally feel like they're not ""healthy"" if they don't have a bowel movement every day. But three bowel movements a week can be normal for some people, especially if that has been their pattern for a long time. There are many other factors that affect how people perceive bowel movements. According to the Rome IV criteria of constipation often used in research, frequency alone doesn't explain all complaints of constipation. Patients complaining of two or more of the following also qualify for a diagnosis of constipation: feelings of incompletely evacuating (not getting everything out) straining lumpy or hard consistency of the stool sensation of blockage using a finger to dislodge the stool. When constipation is a problem, there are two main reasons for it: slow movement of the colon and pelvic floor dysfunction. Treatment for slowed movement of the colon is usually laxatives and drugs to move your colon. But getting your pelvic floor evaluated is worthwhile, because a diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunction typically involves nondrug treatment. Pelvic floor dysfunction The pelvic floor is a muscular bowl that encompasses the rectum, bladder, and (for women) the uterus. There is a complex interaction among these different organs. In the act of defecating, or having a bowel movement, the anal sphincter (the group of muscles at the end of the rectum) has to relax, and the abdominal muscles need to contract. A common analogy I give is that it's like getting toothpaste out of a tube. When you want the toothpaste to come out, you loosen the cap and press on the tube. However, if you leave the cap on or even tighten it, pressing is not going to get the toothpaste out. In the same way, some people who have constipation fail to relax, or actually tighten, their anal sphincter, while using their abdominal muscles to contract the colon when they are trying to defecate. This leads to feelings of incompletely evacuating; hard, small stools; or even feeling like you have to use your finger to get the stool out. These uncoordinated pelvic floor dynamics are usually diagnosed with a test called anorectal manometry, which uses a thin tube to measure pressures, sensations, and reflexes in the rectum and anal sphincter. Biofeedback-based physical therapy to treat pelvic floor dysfunction The good news is that treatment typically does not involve medications. Instead, treatment involves physical therapy in the form of biofeedback. Currently, the best way to undergo physical therapy is in a private setting, with the help of a trained physical therapist who coaches you on the dynamics of defecating. During these sessions, the physical therapist inserts a probe into your anal sphincter and places sticky pads on your abdomen, to detect the movement of your anal sphincter and abdominal wall as you simulate defecation. By doing this, you receive feedback (either visual or verbal) on what you are doing with your abdominal wall muscles and anal sphincter during a bowel movement. The physical therapist will lead you through breathing exercises, as well as muscle strengthening and relaxation exercises, in order to help you retrain the movement and coordination of your pelvic floor. There are currently no devices available for at-home training, but such devices are undergoing research and development. The physical therapist will also discuss dietary recommendations including increased water and fiber consumption, positioning techniques (like using a Squatty Potty), or massaging your abdomen to stimulate the gut. The usual time commitment is about four to eight sessions, one session a week. Like physical therapy for your shoulder or your back, learning what you have done in physical therapy takes time and also practice at home. Some people understand and incorporate these techniques right away, and others take more time and practice. Retraining your body to change the way you have a bowel movement takes time. But it could potentially help with all of the symptoms of constipation.",1,0.31560045,-0.19841641,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/hemorrhoid-help-preventing-and-treating-flare-ups,Hemorrhoid help: preventing and treating flare-ups,1,"The best way to keep hemorrhoid flare-ups at bay is to maintain healthy lifestyle habits. Preventing constipation is key. Make sure your diet always includes enough fiber to promote healthy bowel movements, and be mindful about staying well hydrated. If you need help with your water intake, keep a water bottle by your side at all times as a reminder to drink. Jazz up your water with a slice of lemon, lime, or orange. Also, regular exercise supports good bowel function, so if you do not exercise on a regular basis, this is a good time to begin. Don't try to immediately reach the goal of at least 150 minutes per week of exercise. Begin with short periods of walking. Over time, you can increase your speed and duration of activity. Get your doctor's okay if you have any reservations about exercising or you plan to begin a vigorous routine. There are other simple, everyday habits you can develop to help with relief when a hemorrhoid flare-up arises. For example: Less strain, more gain. Don't delay bowel movements during flareups. Always go when you feel the urge, as putting off bowel movements can cause stool to back up, leading to increased pressure and straining, which aggravates your hemorrhoids. Also, try not to sit on the toilet for long periods; this tends to make hemorrhoids push out and swell up. A way to make going to the bathroom easier—and faster—is to elevate your feet with a step stool as you sit on the toilet. This changes the position of the rectum in a way that could allow for easier passage of stools. Keep the area clean. After every bowel movement, clean the anal area with a witch hazel pad, a soothing baby wipe, or a cotton cloth soaked in warm water. Be thorough but gentle. Aggressive rubbing and scrubbing, especially with soaps or other skin cleansers, can irritate the skin and make your hemorrhoids worse. Applying petroleum jelly or aloe vera gel to the anal area can soothe irritation after a bowel movement. Take a soft seat. Sitting on a cushion rather than a hard surface helps reduce the swelling of existing hemorrhoids and prevents the formation of new ones.",1,0.29623595,-0.05370161,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/take-control-of-your-heartburn,Take control of your heartburn,1,"A muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) separates the esophagus from the stomach. Normally, the LES works something like a gate. The muscle relaxes when you swallow, opening the passage between the esophagus and stomach and allowing food to pass into the stomach. When the sphincter tightens, it closes the passage, keeping food and acidic stomach juices from flowing back into the esophagus. In people with acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD), the LES relaxes when it shouldn't or becomes weak and doesn't close tightly. Either problem allows the contents of the stomach to rise up into the esophagus. The LES is controlled by various nerves and hormones. As a result, foods, drugs, and certain emotions such as anxiety or anger can impair its function, causing or worsening acid reflux. The following factors are under your power to change: Certain foods. Coffee, tea, cocoa, cola drinks, and other caffeine-containing products loosen the LES and stimulate gastric acid production. Mints and chocolate, often served to cap off a meal, can make things worse by relaxing the LES. Fried and fatty foods contribute to heartburn. Some people say that onions and garlic give them heartburn. Others have trouble with citrus fruits or tomato products, which irritate the esophageal lining. Eating patterns. How you eat can be as important as what you eat. Skipping breakfast or lunch and then consuming a huge meal at day's end can increase pressure in the stomach and the possibility of reflux. Lying down soon after eating will make the problem worse. Smoking. Smoking can irritate the entire gastrointestinal tract. In addition, frequent sucking on a cigarette can cause you to swallow air. This increases pressure inside the stomach, which encourages reflux. Smoking can also relax the LES. Overweight and obesity. Being overweight or obese increases the odds of having GERD and experiencing heartburn. Actually, any weight gain increases the risk of frequent GERD symptoms. In addition, eating larger meals distends the stomach, pushes the contents up toward the esophagus and loosens the LES. Certain medications. Some prescription drugs can add to the woes of heartburn. Oral contraceptives or postmenopausal hormone preparations containing progesterone are known culprits. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) can irritate the stomach lining. Other drugs—such as alendronate (Fosamax), used to prevent and treat osteoporosis—can irritate the esophagus. And some antidepressants, bronchodilators, tranquilizers, and calcium-channel blockers can contribute to reflux by relaxing the LES.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/living-with-lactose-intolerance,Living with lactose intolerance,1,"Food intolerance and food allergies often produce similar symptoms, but they're not the same. If dairy products leave you feeling gassy and bloated or cause diarrhea or nausea, you may have either condition. What's the difference? A dairy allergy is an immune system response to milk protein. In addition to feeling bloated or causing diarrhea, symptoms of a dairy allergy can include hives, wheezing, vomiting, cramps, and skin rashes. Dairy intolerance results from inadequate levels of lactase, the enzyme that breaks down milk sugar. While lactose intolerance can cause a lot of discomfort, it isn't life threatening, while a milk allergy can be. The severity of lactose intolerance varies. For some people, consuming any dairy product causes their digestive tracts to rebel. Others can enjoy yogurt, ice cream, or even an occasional glass of milk. The most successful approach to coping with lactose intolerance is to first avoid all dairy products. If you are lactose intolerant and love milk in all its forms, try experimenting with small amounts of dairy. In general, yogurt, cheese, and sour cream may be easier to tolerate because they contain less lactose than milk. However, several studies suggest that many people who are lactose intolerant can consume the equivalent of eight ounces of milk with no ill effects, and somewhat more when the lactose-containing food is part of a meal. Supplements containing enzymes produced by lactose-digesting bacteria (Lactaid, Lactrase, others) can be taken as tablets or added to foods. Some milk products (Lactaid) to which lactase has been added may contain little or no lactose, and they may taste sweeter than untreated products, because the milk sugar has already been broken down. The response to these products is highly individual. What works for your will depend on the amount of lactase your body produces, the type of intestinal bacteria that inhabit your colon, and the product itself. Finding the right approach for you can be a trial-and-error process. While this may take some time and expense, experimenting isn't likely to be harmful. Image:iStock",1,0.24651635,-0.06068296,True

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/11-stomach-soothing-steps-for-heartburn,11 stomach-soothing steps for heartburn,1,"Heartburn, that uncomfortable burning sensation that radiates up the middle of the chest, is the most common digestive malady. It's the result of a condition known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), often called acid reflux, in which stomach acid leaks upward from the stomach into the esophagus. While heartburn should not be ignored, there are many stomach-soothing steps you can try before going to a doctor. These can help cool your symptoms and prevent bigger problems later on. Eat smaller meals, but more often. A full stomach puts pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a valve-like muscle that keeps stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus. Eat in a slow, relaxed manner. Wolfing down your food fills your stomach faster, putting more pressure on the LES. Remain upright after meals. Lying down increases pressure on the LES, which makes acid reflux more likely. Avoid late-night eating. Eating a meal or snack within three hours of lying down to sleep can worsen reflux and heartburn symptoms. Leave enough time for the stomach to clear out. Don't exercise immediately after meals. Give your stomach time to empty; wait a couple of hours after eating before exercising. Tilt your torso with a bed wedge. Raising your torso up a bit with a wedge-shaped cushion reduces the pressure on the LES and may ease nighttime heartburn. Wedges are available from medical supply companies. Don't just prop your head and shoulders up with pillows, which can actually worsen reflux. Stay away from carbonated beverages. They cause belching, which promotes reflux of stomach acid. Find the foods that trigger your symptoms and avoid them. Some foods and drinks increase acid secretion, delay stomach emptying, or loosen the LES — conditions that set the stage for heartburn. Common offenders include fatty foods, spicy foods, tomatoes, garlic, milk, coffee, tea, cola, peppermint, and chocolate. Chew sugarless gum after a meal. Chewing gum promotes salivation, which neutralizes acid, soothes the esophagus, and washes acid back down to the stomach. Avoid peppermint flavors, which may trigger heartburn. Check your medications. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of the medications you take could worsen acid reflux or inflame the esophagus. For example, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline loosen the LES and tetracyclines such as doxycycline can cause esophageal inflammation. Lose weight if you need to. Being overweight puts more pressure on the stomach (and the LES). If changing your eating habits and other preventive steps don't get heartburn under control, talk with your doctor. He or she can advise you on which medications to try and recommend additional follow up if necessary. Image:iStock",1,0.42929232,-0.16451384,True

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-a-multivitamin-improve-your-memory-202307242957,Can a multivitamin improve your memory?,1,"We're bombarded with advertisements that tout all sorts of health benefits for vitamins and supplements, including improved memory. A May 2023 study of older adults suggests that a daily multivitamin can do just that — improve your memory enough such that it can function as if you were three years younger. So, should you take that daily multivitamin? Let's take a close look at the study. Who took part in this multivitamin study? This research is part of a larger study examining the effects of a multivitamin and/or cocoa (the main ingredient in chocolate) on cardiovascular and cancer outcomes. A prior sub-study found that a daily multivitamin improved thinking and memory — at least when evaluated with cognitive testing completed by phone. For this study, 3,562 participants were willing and able to perform some tests of thinking and memory on a home computer. Half received a multivitamin; the other half received a placebo. The participants identified as 93% white, 2.5% African American, and 1.4% Hispanic, so the results may not be generalizable. They were also well educated: more than half had completed college. In both groups, the average age was 71. How did the researchers test memory? The investigators evaluated the participants' thinking and memory at baseline and after one, two, and three years. For the memory test, participants were asked to memorize 20 words shown consecutively on a computer screen. Immediately after viewing these words, they had to type in as many words as they could remember (this was the primary measure of memory). Fifteen minutes later, they also typed in all the words they recalled (a secondary measure of memory). Other secondary measures included: a novel object discrimination test (is this object the same or different from one recently shown?) an executive control test (in an array of nine arrows, is the central arrow red or blue?). The participants repeated all of the tests one, two, and three years later. What were the results of this study? The two groups differed in immediate recall at year one: Those who took a placebo went from immediately recalling an average of 7.21 words at baseline to 7.65 words (a difference of 0.43 words) Those who took a daily multivitamin group went from 7.10 words at baseline to 7.81 words (a difference of 0.70 words). This result was statistically significant. Additionally, these small effects held up at years two and three. By year three, the placebo group immediately recalled an average of 8.17 words and the multivitamin group immediately recalled 8.28 words. No differences occurred between the two groups on secondary memory and executive function tests. How can a multivitamin improve memory? The authors note that low levels of vitamins B12 and D have been linked to cognitive decline and dementia. In a subset of participants who had their blood drawn, the levels of these vitamins did rise in the multivitamin group. It seems plausible that a few of the 3,562 participants had low levels of these or other vitamins that are important for thinking and memory. In the placebo group, the few who had vitamin deficiencies would likely show less improvement in memory after their baseline tests, or a small decline. By contrast, those few participants in the multivitamin group with deficiencies would have them corrected by the supplements and, therefore, would perform relatively better. Although this is just speculation, it would explain the small but seemingly real results — results that replicate the researchers' prior study, which used a telephone cognitive test to show thinking and memory benefit from a daily multivitamin. It's also worth noting that practice on memory tasks — the so-called practice effect — could contribute to small improvements shown from baseline to year one and year three. Should you take a multivitamin to improve your memory? The authors admitted that the effect of the multivitamin on immediate memory was small and may not be noticeable. However, they pointed out that this small effect could be important at the level of an entire population. My opinion?

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/understanding-triglycerides,Understanding triglycerides,1,"Q. I just got the results of my lipid profile. My cholesterol is high, but so are my triglycerides. What exactly are triglycerides, and how are they different from cholesterol? A. Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in the bloodstream. They consist of three fatty acid chains linked by a molecule called glycerol. When you eat food, enzymes in your gut break down fats into their component fatty acids, which are then reassembled to create triglyceride particles. These fatty particles can't move freely through the watery bloodstream. So they combine with cholesterol and protein to form lipoproteins. Your lipid profile lists two of these lipoproteins: low-density lipoprotein (better known as LDL cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (also called HDL cholesterol). But there are actually several other types of lipoproteins, including some that contain mainly triglycerides. Triglycerides can provide energy to fuel your body, while the extras are deposited in fat tissue. After a very heavy, fatty meal, your bloodstream may contain so many triglyceride particles that a blood sample may have a milky tint. But within a few hours, they're mostly cleared out. When you need energy between meals, hormones release the stored triglycerides into the bloodstream. Your liver also converts carbohydrates into triglycerides. When you eat extra calories — especially from carbohydrate-rich foods such as sweets and white bread — your liver churns out extra triglycerides. Other things that can raise blood levels of triglycerides include being overweight or obese, smoking, or heavy drinking. Certain medical conditions —including diseases affecting the liver, kidneys, or thyroid, and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes — can also lead to high triglycerides. For healthy adults, normal triglyceride levels are under 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Values of 151 to 200 mg/dL are considered borderline high; those 201 to 499 are high, and those 500 and higher are very high (and increase the risk of inflammation of the pancreas gland, called pancreatitis). Growing evidence suggests that above-normal triglyceride levels can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease independent of cholesterol levels. To get your triglycerides back into a normal range, start with lifestyle changes. Aim for a healthy weight, get regular exercise, and eat more whole, unprocessed grains. Eat fewer refined carbohydrates, and cut back on saturated fat from meat. Ideally it's best to avoid alcohol, but at the minimum, limit it to no more than one drink on any given day.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/looking-for-a-mellow-form-of-exercise-try-tai-chi,Looking for a mellow form of exercise? Try tai chi,1,"This ancient Chinese practice may help lower blood pressure and offer other heart-related benefits. Tai chi is a slow, flowing form of exercise that's sometimes described as ""meditation in motion."" The practice involves a series of choreographed moves with evocative descriptions, such as ""grasp the sparrow's tail"" or ""wave hands like clouds."" As your body moves, your mind has to focus. But tai chi also encourages relaxation, which helps ease stress. Those features are all important aspects of mind-body therapies, many of which seem to benefit heart health, says Dr. Gloria Yeh, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""On a simple level, tai chi is a very accessible form of exercise,"" she says. The movements are easy to adapt to different levels of intensity, and you can even do certain movements while seated in a chair. Tai chi doesn't require fully extending or stretching your joints, so it's also fine for people who are not so flexible. A gateway exercise Tai chi can be a good gateway exercise for people who cannot or will not engage in more conventional exercise. Even people who are out of shape can do tai chi, which can help build strength and confidence, both physically and mentally. And if you practice more vigorously or sink deeper into the poses, tai chi can provide a moderate aerobic workout. But the meditative aspects of tai chi that teach body awareness, slowing down, and stress management are also important, says Dr. Yeh, who directs the Mind-Body Research program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. People prone to heart disease can benefit from holistic approaches that address their overall well-being, she adds. Protecting the heart Studies exploring the health benefits of tai chi — which also include reduced pain and improved mood — date back to the 1950s. Tai chi may help lower cholesterol levels and dampen inflammation, both of which are linked to better heart health. But the best evidence seems to be for improving blood pressure, according to a 2008 review of 26 studies co-authored by Dr. Yeh in the journal Preventive Cardiology. In people with high blood pressure, systolic blood pressure (the first number in a blood pressure reading) fell seven to 32 points, while diastolic pressure (the second number) fell by two to 18 points. Healing the heart Tai chi may be a promising addition to cardiac rehabilitation, a multiweek program of structured exercise paired with lifestyle and nutrition education. Cardiac rehab, which is covered by Medicare, improves quality of life and survival after a serious heart-related problem, procedure, or surgery. But according to the American Heart Association, only about a quarter of eligible Medicare recipients participate in these programs. Studies by Dr. Yeh and others suggest that for people who decline cardiac rehab, tai chi can help them ease into exercising more, losing weight, and enjoying a better quality of life. As this research continues to grow, tai chi may become a more popular option in conjunction with cardiac rehab, says Dr. Yeh. Many academic medical centers, including Harvard Medical School, have integrative medicine programs that offer tai chi classes. Getting started with tai chi You also can find local tai chi classes at martial arts studios, community centers, health clubs, Y's, and senior centers. Costs vary widely, ranging from about $7 to $18 for an hourlong class. Wear loose, comfortable clothing, and supportive shoes like sneakers (or no shoes, if you prefer). During the class, the instructor will demonstrate graceful, slow arm and leg movements, often done with a slight bend in the knees. ""You might learn to let go of extra muscle tension, take deep breaths, and pay attention to how your body feels,"" says Dr. Yeh. You can learn tai chi from a watching a DVD, which you can also use to practice at home. But going to a class has certain advantages. It may be easier to grasp the concepts with a live instructor with whom you can interact, and being in a group provides both camaraderie and motivation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/they-found-colon-polyps-now-what,They found colon polyps: Now what?,1,"Follow-up exams at the right time are essential to prevent cancer from developing. Colorectal cancer is one of the most preventable forms of cancer—if you are screened for hidden warning signs while you are still healthy. Screening finds precancerous growths on the colon wall, called polyps, which the doctor can then remove. They are not cancer, and most of them have not started to change into cancer. If you get them at the precancerous phase, they don't have a chance to grow and turn into cancer. But you will need to come back for follow-up testing to see if more polyps turn up in the future. Here is what to expect. What are polyps? A colonoscope, the flexible device used to inspect the colon, can grab and snip off polyps if they are relatively small. The timing of follow-up depends on what kind of polyps the doctor finds, how many, and how big they are. Hyperplastic polyps: These polyps are not precancerous. Doctors generally remove them anyway, just to be safe. Adenomas: Many colon polyps are the precancerous type, called adenomas. It can take seven to 10 or more years for an adenoma to evolve into cancer—if it ever does. Overall, only 5% of adenomas progress to cancer, but your individual risk is hard to predict. Doctors remove all the adenomas they find. Sessile serrated polyps: Once thought harmless, this type of adenoma is now known to be risky. These are also removed. When to return for follow-up After polyps are removed, you will need to return for an additional colonoscopy. There is a 25% to 30% chance that a repeat colonoscopy will find additional polyps. How soon you need to return for follow-up depends largely on the size of the polyps found in the first exam. If the colonoscopy finds one or two small polyps (5 mm in diameter or smaller), you are considered at relatively low risk. Most people will not have to return for a follow-up colonoscopy for at least five years, and possibly longer. If the polyps are larger (10 mm or larger), more numerous, or abnormal in appearance under a microscope, you may have to return in three years or sooner. If the exam finds no polyps, you can usually wait 10 years for the next screening if you are at average risk for colon cancer. How a colon polyp progresses to cancer Get the best exam you can Whenever you have a colonoscopy, you should have the highest quality exam possible so the doctor can find all the polyps. During the colon-cleansing ""prep"" before the colonoscopy, follow the instructions to the letter. Eating a low-fiber diet for four to five days may improve the quality of the prep. That's because fiber gets stuck in the nooks and crannies of the colon wall and can block the doctor's view. For colonoscopy to prevent cancer, the doctor must find and remove as many precancerous growths as possible. Reducing your risk After polyp removal, certain steps may lower your risk of colon cancer: Eat less meat: Eat a healthy diet, with minimal red meat—especially processed or cured meats. Studies suggest that people with meat-rich diets tend to have higher rates of colon cancer. Aspirin: Some research suggests that taking aspirin may reduce overall colon cancer risk, but the evidence is not definite. If you need to take aspirin for your heart, then it may offer some protection for the colon. Calcium: Research has also linked a calcium-rich diet to lower colon cancer risk, but this, too, is uncertain. If you are already eating a healthy calcium rich diet to preserve bone health, you might get an extra ""bump"" of cancer prevention. Image: SciePro/Getty Images",1,0.007736031,0.027048767,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/3-surprising-risks-of-poor-posture,3 surprising risks of poor posture,1,"America, we have a posture problem. Whether it's the result of sitting at a desk all day, looking down at a smartphone, or lounging on a couch, poor posture is dogging people of all ages. And health experts are worried. ""It's a common and important health problem among Americans, and it can lead to neck pain, back problems, and other aggravating conditions,"" says Meghan Markowski, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Other posture-related problems While back and neck conditions top the list of potential posture woes, there are many others — such as poor balance, headaches, and breathing difficulties. ""Researchers are also looking into whether posture affects mood, sleep, fatigue, and jaw alignment,"" Markowski says. Three other problems linked to poor posture may surprise you. 1. Incontinence. Poor posture promotes stress incontinence — when you leak a little urine if you laugh or cough. ""Slouching increases abdominal pressure, which puts pressure on the bladder. The position also decreases the ability of the pelvic floor muscles to hold against that pressure,"" notes Markowski, who specializes in helping people overcome bladder, bowel, and pelvic floor problems. 2. Constipation. Poor posture on a toilet — hunched over with your knees lower than your hips — can promote constipation. ""That position closes the anus somewhat and makes it harder for the abdominal muscles to help move feces out,"" Markowski says. Constipation is characterized by fewer than three bowel movements per week; hard, dry stools; straining to move the bowels; and a sense of an incomplete evacuation. 3. Heartburn and slowed digestion. Slouched posture after a meal can trigger heartburn caused by acid reflux (when stomach acid squirts back up into the esophagus). ""Slouching puts pressure on the abdomen, which can force stomach acid in the wrong direction,"" explains Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""And some evidence suggests that transit in the intestines slows down when you slouch. In my opinion, it probably does play a small role."" What you can do Markowski recommends seeing a physical therapist if you suspect you have poor posture that is causing problems for you. The therapist will customize a program of exercises and stretches to improve your core muscle strength and flexibility. The core muscles (in the abdomen, pelvic floor, and back) support the spine. The goal is a neutral, upright spine position — not flexed too far forward or backward. A neutral spine is also important when it's time to move your bowels. ""Keep your back straight and lean forward at the hips. Keeping your knees higher than your hips — by placing your feet on a footstool — mimics a squatting position, which is best for helping to open the anus so you can pass feces without straining,"" Markowski says. To reduce the risk of stress incontinence leakage, Markowski recommends strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. ""We teach people how to control their pelvic muscles when they cough,"" she says. ""The proper neutral spine alignment will also help minimize abdominal pressure."" Move of the month: Seated knee lift Builds abdominal strength. Sit on a stability ball or chair with your feet hip-width apart and your hands at your sides. Exhale as you lift your right knee and left hand straight toward the ceiling. Return to the starting position. Repeat 10 times. Repeat the process by lifting with your left knee and right hand. Exercise image by Michael Carroll Some general posture pointers To attain the neutral spine position, Markowski advises you to put your shoulders down and back, pull your head back, and engage your core muscles. ""Bring your belly button in toward your spine, as if you're zipping up a snug pair of jeans. This will help to engage the transverse abdominis muscle, which acts like a corset around the spine,"" Markowski explains. Other tips: Use a low back (lumbar) support pillow to remind you to sit upright in a chair, and change your position every 30 to 60 minutes. ""We don't want people in fixed postures for hours at a time,"" Markowski says. ""Be vigilant, and good posture will contribute to many aspects of health.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-to-eat-when-you-have-chronic-heartburn,What to eat when you have chronic heartburn,1,"Avoid spicy foods, and keep some dazzle in your diet with low-fat sauces and fresh herbs. The fiery feeling of heartburn is the last way you want to remember a great meal. But when your doctor says you have chronic heartburn caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (see ""What is GERD?""), you may worry that a bland and disappointing menu is in your future. But the foods that trigger your heartburn may or may not be on the usual lists. That's why keeping a journal to determine which foods cause symptoms helps. Common culprits Some foods and ingredients may intensify heartburn, such as spicy foods, citrus, tomato sauces, and vinegar. Fatty and fried foods linger longer in the stomach, making it more likely that stomach acid leaks back up into the esophagus. Other common heartburn triggers include chocolate, caffeine, onions, peppermint, carbonated drinks, and alcohol. What's for dinner? You can still enjoy lean meats, fish, poultry, vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains. The trick is making them flavorful. If spices bother you, try using only small amounts, and be mindful of blends that contain cayenne or chili powder. Or use fresh herbs instead. Fresh herbs are less concentrated and may be less irritating. Instead use fresh parsley, oregano, and basil. Another tip: roast your food. This makes vegetables sweeter. The natural sugars come out and caramelize. Carrots, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, squash, and Brussels sprouts work well. Broiling, saut'ing, or grilling food also brings out intense flavor. Eat vegetables raw. Tomato sauce may bother you, but a fresh tomato may not. Use sauces but cut the fat. Blend low-fat yogurt with cucumber and basil, or saut' mushrooms in a little olive oil. Or make a pesto. Blend basil, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and a dash of olive oil or water. Use a tablespoon of it on food. Breakfast and lunch Avoid fatty meats like ham or bacon. Oatmeal is a great option. Throw in bananas, raisins, and maybe a hint of cinnamon. Other possibilities: low-fat yogurt with fruit or nuts, any kind of eggs, whole-grain toast, or a side of chilled whole grains like quinoa mixed with fruit or topped with a dollop of yogurt. For lunch, think salads with protein such as chicken or beans. But maybe use a yogurt-based dressing, to avoid vinegar and citrus. What is GERD? One of the most common causes of heartburn is called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, the tube connecting the mouth and stomach, usually because the ring-like muscles that prevent backflow stop working properly. In addition to heartburn, GERD may cause nausea, a sour taste in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, a sore throat, coughing, and tightness in the chest. Medications to treat GERD reduce stomach acid. Antacid pills and liquids have been around the longest. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole (Prilosec) or lansoprazole (Prevacid), and H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) or famotidine (Pepcid), are available over the counter. Don't fool yourself into thinking medication allows you to frequently eat foods that once caused heartburn. If medication controls your symptoms, then it's probably okay to have a 'trigger' food occasionally. But if you do that too often, the heartburn will return. You can limit and perhaps avoid medication to control GERD symptoms by losing weight if necessary, eating smaller meals and avoiding food triggers (see accompanying article).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heartburn-vs-heart-attack,Heartburn vs. heart attack,1,"The symptoms of these two health problems may overlap — and sometimes, so do the treatments. During your regular after-dinner walk around the neighborhood, you feel a painful sensation in the center of your chest. Could it be your heartburn flaring up again, or something more serious? Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), often called acid reflux. Acid from the stomach bubbles up into the esophagus, causing a painful burning just behind the breastbone. Not surprisingly, it's often mistaken for a heart attack. In fact, of the over eight million emergency room visits for chest pain each year, severe heartburn accounts for over half the cases in which actual heart problems are ruled out. Chest pain caused by insufficient blood flow to the heart (angina) or a heart attack is often described as a feeling of tightness, constriction, or pressure, rather than a burning sensation (see ""Heartburn or heart attack?""). But it's not always easy to tell the difference. ""Chest discomfort brought on by exercise is more likely to be a heart-related problem,"" says Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, cardiovascular specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. But you can also have angina that's not related to physical activity, she notes. If you have any symptoms you're not sure about, see a doctor. And call 911 if you feel chest tightness, have trouble breathing, break into a sweat, turn pale, or become very weak. GERD and heart disease are both common, and many people take medications to prevent or treat both conditions. Heartburn or heart attack? The symptoms of heartburn may mimic those of angina or a heart attack (or vice versa). If you're uncertain, don't hesitate to get to an emergency room for an evaluation as soon as possible. COMMON SYMPTOMS Angina or heart attack Tightness, pressure, squeezing, stabbing, or dull pain, most often in the center of the chest Pain that spreads to the shoulders, neck, or arms Irregular or rapid heartbeat Cold sweat or clammy skin Lightheadedness, weakness, or dizziness Shortness of breath Nausea, indigestion, and sometimes vomiting The appearance of symptoms with physical exertion or extreme stress Heartburn (GERD) Burning chest pain that begins at the breastbone Pain that moves up toward your throat but doesn't typically radiate to your shoulders, neck, or arms Sensation that food is coming back into your mouth Bitter or acidic taste at the back of your throat Pain that worsens when you lie down or bend over The appearance of symptoms after a large or spicy meal Avoiding clots Many people take daily, low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks, which works by discouraging the formation of blood clots. Doctors prescribe clopidogrel (a more potent clot-preventing drug) with aspirin, mainly for people who receive stents, the tiny metal mesh tubes placed in clogged blood vessels to improve blood flow. But there's a downside. ""Aspirin can increase the risk of bleeding from the stomach and the intestines, both by directly irritating the stomach lining and by making existing areas of irritation more prone to bleeding,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. Taking clopidogrel with aspirin can further increase that risk. Preventing bleeding People with heartburn often take proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). They include over-the-counter drugs such as omeprazole (Prilosec) and prescription drugs such as pantoprazole (Protonix). These drugs reduce the release of acid from the stomach lining. In addition to causing heartburn, excess stomach acid can also cause bleeding sores (ulcers) in the stomach; these, too, are treated with PPIs, among other drugs. Thanks to these stomach-protecting effects, doctors sometimes prescribe PPIs for people who take drugs that increase the risk of bleeding — even if they don't have heartburn. ""I usually recommend PPIs for people who are taking long-term aspirin or clopidogrel if they have ever had a bleeding stomach ulcer or are at high risk of developing one,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. Factors that can boost your odds include an infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria and routine use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Motrin, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox, others). Clopidogrel concern? Some research suggests a possible problem with taking both a PPI and clopidogrel. Two popular PPIs, omeprazole and esomeprazole (Nexium), inhibit a liver enzyme that helps convert clopidogrel to its active form. In theory, this could make clopidogrel less effective for heart attacks and stroke prevention. But large clinical studies have not revealed any meaningful differences. Still, anyone with lingering concerns about a possible interaction could take a different PPI, such as pantoprazole, which does not affect the liver enzyme.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/natural-ways-to-relieve-constipation,Natural ways to relieve constipation,1,"A few at-home tips can help you avoid the need for harsh laxatives. We often make light of constipation, but it's no laughing matter. When you can't go to the bathroom for days on end, you feel bloated and miserable. Straining day after day can also lead to more serious problems, like hemorrhoids or even prolapse (bulging) of rectal tissue. An estimated 40% to 60% of older adults regularly deal with constipation, although the aging process itself is not to blame. It's what goes along with aging. It's things like less physical activity, which helps the bowels move more regularly. It's the medications many older adults take. Constipation causes One of the biggest factors in constipation is diet. Eating high-fiber foods, such as raw fruits and vegetables and whole grains, helps to keep you regular. Drinking enough fluid is essential too. The fiber holds the water in the bowel so it can mix with the stool and make it softer. If you're getting plenty of fiber and fluids and you're still not regular, one of these constipation causes may be to blame: medicines such as narcotic pain relievers, antidepressants, aluminum-containing antacids, blood pressure medications, drugs for Parkinson's disease, and iron supplements lack of exercise regularly ignoring the urge to have a bowel movement diseases such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Getting going again Laxatives may seem like the quickest and simplest solution, but they're not a good idea If people go right to stimulant laxatives, there is a risk that they'll become physically dependent on them. Before taking any laxative, try these diet and lifestyle tips for managing constipation: Stay hydrated. Drink at least four to six glasses of fluids a day. Water and fruit juices are best for preventing constipation. Limit caffeinated beverages such as soda and coffee, which can actually leach more fluid from your body. Bulk up on fiber. Try to get at least 25 grams of fiber daily from your diet. Good food sources include Brussels sprouts, apples, figs, bran cereal, and black beans. Get on a daily schedule. The longer stool sits in your intestines, the harder it becomes, and the more difficult it is to push out. That's why having a regular bowel habit is important. Because the emptying reflex works best after a meal, a useful habit is to head to the bathroom after breakfast and see if you get the urge. Try not to strain. It could lead to hemorrhoids, anal fissures (tears in the skin around the anus), or rectal prolapse (when part of the intestinal lining pushes out through the anal opening). Add more fiber and fluid to your diet or try a stool softener to make bowel movements easier. If you simply can't go and you want to try a laxative, start with the osmotic type (such as MiraLAX or Geri Care). The osmotic laxatives are reasonably safe. They work gently by pulling water into your intestines, making the stool softer and easier to pass. If you've tried everything and you still aren't regular, see your doctor, who can evaluate you for a medical problem. Call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of a bowel obstruction, which can include abdominal pain, vomiting, a swollen belly, or the complete inability to have a bowel movement.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/what-to-do-about-gallstones,What to do about gallstones,1,"Gallstones are one of the most common digestive problems treated in women. More than 25 million people in the United States have gallstones, and 65% to 75% of them are women. Fortunately, for most people, gallstones are ""silent"" — they don't cause major symptoms. When they do act up, there are effective ways to address the problem. What are gallstones? Gallstones begin with bile, a substance that helps with the digestion of fats and the absorption of certain vitamins. Bile is made in the liver and carried to the gallbladder, a small, pear-shaped organ that concentrates and stores it. The fat in food triggers the release of a hormone that causes the gallbladder to contract and release bile into the intestine. Gallstones are solid lumps that develop when the stored bile crystallizes. Most are less than an inch in diameter, but they can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball. Most gallstones are composed mainly of cholesterol. The rest — known as pigment stones — are made of calcium salts and bilirubin, a breakdown product of red blood cells. Cholesterol stones form when liquid bile in the gallbladder contains more cholesterol than the bile salts can dissolve. Cholesterol stones may also develop if the gallbladder doesn't contract and empty as it should. Pigment stones are associated with certain medical conditions, including liver disease, some types of anemia, and infection of the bile ducts. Gallstone trouble Gallstones cause problems when they block any of the ducts carrying bile from the liver or gallbladder (or digestive enzymes from the pancreas) to the small intestine. Why are women at greater risk? It's the effect of female hormones. Estrogen increases cholesterol in the bile, and progesterone slows the emptying of the gallbladder. That may explain why the risk for women, relative to men, decreases with age. Before age 40, women are diagnosed with gallstones almost three times more often than men are (pregnancy, for example, increases the risk), but by age 60, their risk is just slightly greater. Estrogen therapy increases the risk, especially when taken as a pill rather than a patch. Oral contraceptive pills also increase the risk slightly, but only in the first decade of use. Obesity is another risk factor because bodies with more fat produce more estrogen. Paradoxically, rapid weight loss also increases the risk, because very low-calorie diets interfere with bile production and therefore cause more crystallization of cholesterol. Gallstones are so common after weight-loss surgery that patients may be advised to have their gallbladders removed at the same time. Gallstones are also more likely to occur in people with diabetes or any condition that decreases gallbladder contractions or intestinal motility, such as a spinal cord injury. Finally, there's some evidence for genetic vulnerability to gallstone formation. What are the symptoms? Most people who have gallstones don't know it. Their gallstones stay silent and may only be discovered incidentally, through an ultrasound or CT scan performed for other reasons. Symptoms arise mainly when stones pass through a bile duct or obstruct it, causing biliary colic — better known as a gallbladder attack. These attacks occur when the gallbladder contracts (usually in response to a fatty meal) and presses the stones so as to block the gallbladder duct. The main symptom is pain, usually in the right upper or middle abdomen (just below the rib cage), which builds to greatest intensity within an hour and can persist up to several hours. It can be either sharp and knifelike or a deep ache; sometimes it radiates to the back or the right shoulder. There may also be nausea and vomiting. The pain subsides as the gallbladder relaxes. A stone lodged in a duct can also cause more serious problems, including acute cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), or cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts in the liver). Any of these conditions can cause severe pain and other symptoms, including jaundice, high fever, chills, and vomiting. Treatment usually requires hospitalization and often surgical removal of the stone. If you think you're having a gallbladder attack, your clinician will probably order several blood tests and an abdominal ultrasound (after you fast for at least eight hours). Ultrasound is particularly helpful in diagnosing acute cholecystitis because it also picks up any thickening of the gallbladder wall and indicates the presence of fluid, which may suggest inflammation. Other diagnostic techniques include cholescintigraphy, a radioactive injection used to view a possible blockage of the cystic duct; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the bile ducts; endoscopic ultrasonography, which introduces an ultrasound device through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine) to get images of the area; and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which uses a scope inserted through the mouth to the duodenum to view the biliary ducts. How are gallstones treated? Typically, gallstones are treated only if they cause symptoms. For recurrent gallbladder attacks, the most effective treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder, or cholecystectomy. In the past, the standard procedure was surgery requiring a five-inch incision and a hospital stay of up to a week. This approach has largely been replaced by laparoscopic cholecystectomy, in which the gallbladder is removed with instruments inserted through small incisions in the skin. This procedure requires only an overnight hospital stay and a week of recovery at home. However, there's a slight risk of injuring the bile ducts, and in a small percent of cases, the surgeon may have to switch to an open surgery with a larger incision because of complications. You can easily live without a gallbladder. The liver produces enough bile for normal digestion. When the gallbladder is removed, bile simply flows directly into the small intestine through the common bile duct. When no food is present, loose stools may result, but you can treat that with a bile acid–binding medication, such as cholestyramine (Questran). Medical options If you can't or don't want to undergo surgery and your gallstones are small, one option is to take ursodiol (Actigall, Urso), a naturally occurring bile acid that helps dissolve cholesterol stones when taken by mouth two to four times a day. It's also used to prevent the formation of gallstones in people who are losing weight quickly. Ursodiol dissolves only those gallstones made of cholesterol, and it may take several months before it has an effect. Drug therapy is occasionally combined with lithotripsy, in which sound waves from outside the body are used to break gallstones into pieces that dissolve more easily or are small enough to safely pass through the bile duct. Unfortunately, stones are likely to recur after medical treatment. How can I reduce my risk for gallstones? There's no proven way to prevent gallstones, but eating a well-balanced diet, maintaining a normal weight, and exercising regularly (at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week). Avoiding fatty foods won't prevent or get rid of gallstones, but it may reduce the frequency of attacks. Image: rob_lan/Getty Images",1,0.33028266,-0.105528384,True
https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/news/20241017/standing-desks-dont-cut-stroke-or-heart-failure-risk,Standing Desks Don’t Cut Stroke or Heart Failure Risk,1,"Oct. 17, 2024 – People who use a standing desk for health benefits may need to re-evaluate their time spent with it. New research suggests that using a standing desk doesn’t reduce the chance of problems like heart disease or strokes, and may even boost the risk of circulatory problems, such as varicose veins or deep vein thrombosis. Ultimately, time spent stationary and not moving was linked to increased health problems. The findings were published Wednesday in the International Journal of Epidemiology. For the study, researchers didn’t specifically evaluate people who used standing desks. Instead, they analyzed data from 83,013 adults who used a wearable device that could detect their daily time spent sitting and standing for a week. The average age of the people in the study was 61 years old, and about 55% were women. The researchers then looked at the people’s health data for the next seven years and linked time spent sitting, standing, or both to how likely someone was to have heart disease, a stroke, heart failure, or circulatory problems like a potentially deadly blood clot in the leg or enlarged and twisted veins that can be uncomfortable. On average, people in the study spent nearly 13 hours per day stationary, meaning sitting or standing combined. About 2 hours were spent standing, and 11 hours spent sitting. People whose combined sitting and standing time exceeded 12 hours per day had an increased risk of circulatory problems, and that risk increased for every extra hour spent stationary. When the researchers looked at just time spent sitting or time spent standing, circulatory health risk steadily increased beyond two hours of standing or 10 hours of sitting. Extra time spent sitting beyond 10 hours daily also was linked to an increased risk of problems with the heart and blood vessels. But the next finding from the researchers suggests that just getting out of a chair and standing more may not be the solution. Time spent standing was linked to neither poor nor improved heart and blood vessel health, but it was linked to increased circulatory problems. “The key takeaway is that standing for too long will not offset an otherwise sedentary lifestyle and could be risky for some people in terms of circulatory health,” said lead author Matthew Ahmadi, PhD, who specializes in wearables research at the University of Sydney in Australia, according to a news release. A 2017 report, by a different team of University of Sydney researchers, suggested that the broad adoption of standing desks was fueled by media reports that failed to note the limited evidence for the desks’ health benefits. The report pointed to a widely – but not comprehensively – covered recommendation in a medical journal to increase standing and light activity time in the office. The report also expressed concern that the recommendation was co-authored by someone with commercial links to sit-stand desks. The authors of this latest study suggest that rather than focusing on standing more, people may instead aim to include more movement throughout their day and plan structured exercise time to manage risks to their heart and blood vessels. “Take regular breaks, walk around, go for a walking meeting, use the stairs, take regular breaks when driving long distances, or use that lunch hour to get away from the desk and do some movement,” said researcher Emmanuel Stamatakis, PhD, MSc, a University of Sydney professor of physical activity and population health.",5,0.15797985,0.026527703,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/healthy-gut-healthy-heart,"Healthy gut, healthy heart?",1,"The gut is known as the ""second brain,"" as it produces many of the same neurotransmitters, chemicals released by nerves needed for communication with other nerves and tissues. The gut and brain are also connected through a joint partnership called the gut-brain axis that links biochemical signals both to and from the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. But what about the gut and the heart? Do they have a similar connection? Research suggests there might be a link, but that it travels in one direction — from the gut to the heart — and that keeping your gut healthy can be another means to protect against heart disease. The gut-heart connection The gut is the primary home to trillions of microbes, collectively known as the human microbiota. These microbes help with digestion, manufacture certain nutrients, and release substances that have wide-ranging health effects. ""There's a complex interplay between the microbes in our intestines and most of the systems in our bodies, including the vascular, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, all of which are linked with cardiovascular health,"" says Dr. Stanley Shaw, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Since diet plays a significant role in the composition of gut microbiota, what you feed your gut can therefore affect heart health — for better and for worse. One way the gut does this is with metabolites, substances the gut microbiota creates when breaking down food. One particular gut metabolite, trimethylamine (TMA), forms when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a substance strongly connected with forming artery-clogging plaque. Research has shown that people with high TMAO levels in their blood are more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those with lower levels. Since red meat is a main source of TMA, cutting back can stop the gut from making too much TMAO. In fact, a study in the September 2022 issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found that among nearly 4,000 people ages 65 and older, those who ate an average of 1.1 servings of red meat per day had a 22% higher risk of heart disease compared with those who ate less. The researchers pointed out that about 10% of this added risk could be attributed to increased levels of TMAO as well as two other metabolites — gamma-butyrobetaine and crotonobetaine — which also are made by gut bacteria from components in red meat. Fiber at work Fiber also helps support the gut and thus the heart. According to some estimates, fiber-rich diets can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as 30%. Fiber in the small intestine binds fat and cholesterol, decreasing absorption and lowering blood cholesterol levels. But the gut's microbiota also helps out. Fiber gets broken down by bacteria in the colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds interact with specific receptors on cells that regulate blood pressure, better control blood sugar and body weight in people with diabetes, and dampen inflammation — all of which can improve heart health. Other supporting foods It's unclear whether eating other foods that improve gut microbiota — for example, probiotics (beneficial bacteria) found in yogurt and fermented foods (sauerkraut, miso, tempeh) — can also support heart health. The best advice for helping your gut help your heart is to follow a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean diet or similar eating patterns. These involve limiting red meat and eating plenty of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, all of which can have favorable effects on the gut,"" says Dr. Shaw. ""And if your gut is healthy, there is a greater chance your heart is healthy, too."" Image: © CareyHope/Getty Images",1,0.35523543,0.10383706,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-05-26-fluoride-exposure-pregnancy-behavior-problems-children.html,Fluoride exposure during pregnancy linked to behavior problems in children,0,"New research out of the University of Southern California (USC) drives another nail in the coffin of the outmoded and barbaric practice of artificial water fluoridation. Scientists from USC's Keck School of Medicine told the New York Post that children in the womb who are exposed to fluoride via their mothers tend to be born with health problems. The higher the exposure to fluoride, the more likely a child is to ""experience temper tantrums, headaches, stomachaches, anxiety, and symptoms linked to autism,"" they said. Senior study author Tracy Bastain issued the usual duplicitous disclaimer that ""exposure to fluoride during pregnancy does not mean that a children will experience greater neurobehavioral problems,"" even though this is exactly what her paper demonstrated. ""We found an association between higher prenatal exposure and more neurobehavioral problems at age three but more studies are needed to establish a causal link,"" she said, offering the typical more research needed excuse. (Related: A large-scale government study found that drinking fluoride does absolutely nothing to protect teeth from developing cavities.) Make sure your drinking water is clean For their study, Bastain and her colleagues pulled data from USC's MADRES Center for Environmental Health Disparities, which follows predominantly Hispanic families living in the Los Angeles area from pregnancy through childhood. To calculate fluoride exposure, the team collected urine samples from 229 pregnant moms during their third trimester. Children whose mothers had higher levels of fluoride were determined to be 83 percent more likely to show ""internalizing"" behavioral problems.

It should be noted that the study did not identify why some pregnant women had higher fluoride levels than others, but we know that fluoride exposure typically comes from artificially fluoridated drinking water, contaminated juices, and dental products like mouthwash and toothpaste. Lead investigator Ashley Malin, an assistant professor in epidemiology at the University of Florida College of Public Health, confirmed that the findings point to a relationship between fluoride exposure and brain damage in developing babies still in the womb. ""There is no known benefit of fluoride consumption to the developing fetus, but we do know that there is possibly a risk to their developing brain,"" Malin confirmed. ""We found that each 0.68 milligram per liter increase in fluoride levels in the pregnant women's urine was associated with nearly double the odds of children scoring in the clinical or borderline clinical range for neurobehavioral problems at age three, based on their mother's reporting."" The fact that fluoride is still being added to water supplies across the United States is appalling, especially considering that this is just one of many studies in recent years to confirm that fluoride provides no health benefits while causing plenty of harm. ""Conducting a nationwide U.S. study on this topic would be important, but I think the findings of the current study and recent studies from Canada and Mexico suggest that there is a real concern here,"" Malin added. In recent years, there has been a renewed push in some areas to remove fluoride from local water supplies. The problem is that there are still too many corrupt, bought-and-paid-for politicians in office who are gatekeeping efforts in especially larger cities to stop fluoridating the water supply. ""While fluoride supposedly hardens the enamel, consuming it was always known to be toxic,"" wrote a commenter at 100percentfedup.com .

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/stomachs-growl-noses-run-and-yawning-is-contagious-ever-wonder-why-202307192955,"Stomachs growl, noses run, and yawning is contagious: Ever wonder why?",1,"There are certain things our bodies do so often and so automatically that we barely notice them. Yawning, growling stomachs, and runny noses are good examples. Each is a universal part of our daily human experience. But did you ever wonder why? Below are a few things we know and a few we suspect. Why do you yawn? Perhaps you associate yawning only with being tired or bored. While we don't know exactly why people yawn, there's no shortage of theories. Yawning may stretch out our lungs and nearby tissues, preventing tiny airways in the lungs from collapsing distribute a chemical called surfactant, a gooey liquid that coats the tiny air pockets in the lungs and helps keep them open help prepare our bodies for transitions between wakefulness and rest: For example, yawning often occurs after a period of relaxation and when awakening from sleep. And it may serve as an internal signal that it's time to sleep, or time to take a break from activities (such as driving). play a role in maintaining proper brain temperature: Our brain functions best within a narrow range of temperatures. Some experts believe yawning can help cool the brain through complex effects on nearby circulation and the sinuses. It's also unclear why yawning is contagious. In the animal kingdom, it's common to see contagious yawning among members of a group, perhaps as a signal for collective behavior (such as moving from activity to rest). Why does your stomach growl? That rumbling in your stomach is known medically as borborygmi — an excellent Scrabble word if you have the right letters. We usually assume it reflects hunger. And it's true that the experience of hunger can make itself heard in anticipation of a meal. But your stomach may also growl after a meal, when the stomach and intestines propel liquids and food through the digestive tract. Stress can also trigger stomach rumbling. What's causing all that noise — and is it ever a problem? It may be due to gas moving around in response to muscular contractions of the intestinal walls. Occasionally, noises from the abdomen may be a sign of an intestinal infection or other trouble. If you're experiencing other symptoms, such as pain or fever, check in with your doctor. But the vast majority of noises are harmless and a sign that your gut is working normally. Why does your nose run? Sometimes it can seem like your nose is running for no reason. But there are some well-known triggers, such as: Infection. When you have a cold, mucous membranes produce more mucus as part of your defense system: more mucous flowing out means fewer germs getting in. Allergies. Pollen, ragweed, or other triggers stimulate immune cells that produce histamine. Histamine opens up blood vessels just beneath the mucous membranes, and that leads to increased production and release of fluid and mucus. As with infection, this response may be helpful to dilute the offending trigger and rid it from the area. Cold, dry air. The inside surface of the nose is covered with mucous membranes that warm and humidify air well before it reaches the lungs. When you inhale dry, cold air through your nose, these membranes humidify the air by secreting water and mucus. Spicy foods. Spices like capsaicin act as an irritant to the sinuses and mucous membranes, which release fluid in response. The bottom line Some of the most common everyday human experiences are also some of the least understood. There are many other examples, of course: Why are we ticklish? What purpose do hiccups serve? What's the deal with brain freeze? Perhaps topics for another day. It may seem like a leap of faith, but it's likely there are very good reasons for the way our bodies work — even when we don't know what those reasons are.",5,0.21960704,-0.19425392,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-irritable-bowel-syndrome-the-same,Are inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome the same?,1,"Ask the doctors Q. I was recently diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. Is this the same thing as inflammatory bowel disease? A. No, they are not the same. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to two conditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which are caused by a malfunctioning immune system. In these diseases, the immune system misfires, causing the lining of the digestive tract to become chronically inflamed and irritated. Both can lead to long-term digestive tract damage. In Crohn's disease, this inflammation can occur anywhere in the digestive tract, while colitis affects only the colon and the rectum. IBD triggers a number of symptoms, including abdominal pain and cramping, fevers, ­diarrhea, and bloody bowel movements, among others. While people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may experience some of the same symptoms as people with IBD, there is no obvious inflammation within the digestive tract. The underlying cause of IBS is unknown, but symptoms may arise due to uncoordinated intestinal contractions that affect bowel movements and hypersensitive nerves in the gut. People with IBS commonly have diarrhea, constipation, or both, as well as abdominal pain and cramping. While IBS can cause significant distress and discomfort for those affected, people don't typically experience severe complications as a result of the condition or need to have surgery. It's most often managed through lifestyle change or medication. Image: © Mono/Getty Images",1,0.2116731,-0.020978019,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection,The gut-brain connection,1,"Pay attention to your gut-brain connection – it may contribute to your anxiety and digestion problems The gut-brain connection is no joke; it can link anxiety to stomach problems and vice versa. Have you ever had a ""gut-wrenching"" experience? Do certain situations make you ""feel nauseous""? Have you ever felt ""butterflies"" in your stomach? We use these expressions for a reason. The gastrointestinal tract is sensitive to emotion. Anger, anxiety, sadness, elation — all of these feelings (and others) can trigger symptoms in the gut. The brain has a direct effect on the stomach and intestines. For example, the very thought of eating can release the stomach's juices before food gets there. This connection goes both ways. A troubled intestine can send signals to the brain, just as a troubled brain can send signals to the gut. Therefore, a person's stomach or intestinal distress can be the cause or the product of anxiety, stress, or depression. That's because the brain and the gastrointestinal (GI) system are intimately connected. This is especially true in cases where a person experiences gastrointestinal upset with no obvious physical cause. For such functional GI disorders, it is difficult to try to heal a distressed gut without considering the role of stress and emotion. Gut health and anxiety Given how closely the gut and brain interact, it becomes easier to understand why you might feel nauseated before giving a presentation, or feel intestinal pain during times of stress. That doesn't mean, however, that functional gastrointestinal conditions are imagined or ""all in your head."" Psychology combines with physical factors to cause pain and other bowel symptoms. Psychosocial factors influence the actual physiology of the gut, as well as symptoms. In other words, stress (or depression or other psychological factors) can affect movement and contractions of the GI tract. In addition, many people with functional GI disorders perceive pain more acutely than other people do because their brains are more responsive to pain signals from the GI tract. Stress can make the existing pain seem even worse. Based on these observations, you might expect that at least some patients with functional GI conditions might improve with therapy to reduce stress or treat anxiety or depression. Multiple studies have found that psychologically based approaches lead to greater improvement in digestive symptoms compared with only conventional medical treatment. Gut-brain connection, anxiety and digestion Are your stomach or intestinal problems — such as heartburn, abdominal cramps, or loose stools — related to stress? Watch for these and other common symptoms of stress and discuss them with your doctor. Together you can come up with strategies to help you deal with the stressors in your life, and also ease your digestive discomforts. Image: © ChrisChrisW | GettyImages",1,0.3503164,-0.17383355,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-05-24-pandemic-treaty-bird-flu-arriving-same-time.html,The WHO’s pandemic treaty and a bird flu crisis are both arriving at the same time,0,"Health officials are issuing very ominous warnings about the potential for an H5N1 pandemic among humans at the same time that the WHO is preparing for a vote on the global pandemic treaty at the 77th World Health Assembly at the end of this month. The global pandemic treaty will give the World Health Organization far more authority than it had during the last pandemic, and a lot of people are deeply concerned about how that power will be used during the next major health crisis. As you will see below, two more human cases of the bird flu have just been confirmed. If the bird flu mutates into a form that can spread easily from human to human, that will create an enormous amount of fear, and the death toll could potentially be catastrophic. In such an environment, what sort of extreme measures would the World Health Organization decide to institute? (Article republished from EndOfTheAmericanDream.com ) In recent weeks, negotiators have been feverishly working to finalize the global pandemic treaty. The following comes directly from the official WHO website … Governments of the world today agreed to continue working on a proposed pandemic agreement, and to further refine the draft, ahead of the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly that starts 27 May 2024. Governments meeting at the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva agreed to resume hybrid and in-person discussions over coming weeks to advance work on critical issues, including around a proposed new global system for pathogen access and benefits sharing (i.e. life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostics); pandemic prevention and One Health; and the financial coordination needed to scale up countries’ capacities to prepare for and respond to pandemics. Here in the United States, the mainstream media has been strangely quiet about this treaty, but it is a really big deal. Negotiations have been taking place for the last two years , and the plan is to submit the final draft for a vote at the World Health Assembly at the end of this month… The Member State-led Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) was established over two years ago to take this effort forward. The Bureau of the INB, which is guiding the process, will submit its outcome for consideration at the World Health Assembly. INB Bureau Co-Chair Dr Precious Matsoso, from South Africa, said progress had been made during this latest round of discussions on a wide range of issues contained in the draft agreement. “We are witnessing history play out before our eyes during this process, with the coming together of all countries to decide a binding pact to protect all citizens of the world,” said Ms Matsoso. “This is not a simple exercise. This is the first ever process to develop a proposed agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. Getting this done means getting it right, and the INB Bureau is committed to help finalize a meaningful, lasting agreement.” The 77th World Health Assembly will be held in Geneva, Switzerland from May 27th to June 1st. Member nations will cast their votes on the final draft of the global pandemic treaty, and it is fully expected to pass. We have been told that the global pandemic treaty has been “watered down”, but in reality all that has really changed is that some language in the treaty has been made more vague. If this treaty passes, when the next pandemic erupts the WHO will be running the show, and most people in the general population do not realize this. And the next pandemic may be a lot closer than most of us think. Read more at: EndOfTheAmericanDream.com",4,-0.34530103,0.13785993,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-gut-healthier-aging,"Healthy gut, healthier aging",1,"Support beneficial microbes in the gastrointestinal tract with these healthy lifestyle habits. Trillions of microbes — bacteria, viruses, fungi — call your gut home. They do more than just help you digest food. They fight harmful pathogens; make vitamin K and other important chemicals; affect the way medications work; and may influence your immune system, heart health, and cancer risk. It also appears gut microbes may play a role in healthy aging and longevity. The genes of all your gut microbes are collectively called the gut microbiome. Encouraging findings In a study published online Feb. 18, 2021, by Nature Metabolism, scientists observed that older adults whose mix of gut microbes changed the most over time lived longer than those people with less change in their gut microbiome. The study didn't prove that an eclectic microbiome directly caused people to live longer. However, such a microbiome was also associated with lower cholesterol levels, faster walking speeds, and higher levels of beneficial blood chemicals — all factors that lengthen the life span. How do you make your gut microbiome more diverse and achieve health benefits? It mainly comes down to lifestyle factors. Indeed, one of the reasons that a healthy lifestyle may protect your health is through the impact of your lifestyle on your microbiome. Eat a healthy diet Eating the right foods is one of the best ways. Your gut microbes like to eat, too, and their favorite foods are the ones that are healthiest for us: fruits, vegetables (especially dark, leafy greens), legumes (beans, peas), and whole grains (quinoa, whole wheat, brown rice). ""Those foods contain fiber. Our bodies don't break down fiber for food; fiber passes through to the gut and microbes feed on it. It gives them a good environment to grow,"" explains April Pawluk, strategic program manager at the Harvard Chan Microbiome in Public Health Center. But when you eat an unhealthy diet with lots of processed, fatty, sugary foods, it makes it harder for helpful microbes to survive. ""In the absence of diversity-promoting nutrients like fiber in our diets, the genes of our gut microbiome can produce chemicals that could increase our risk for developing different diseases,"" Pawluk says. Exercise Exercising appears to promote gut microbiome diversity, but the way it works is a matter of speculation, ­Pawluk says. Several ways are plausible. ""It could be that exercise changes the rate at which material moves through the intestines. Or perhaps exercise reduces inflammation in the gut. Or exercise might alter our appetite, and alter the way that our bodies process the food we eat. All of these could affect the microbiome environment,"" Pawluk says. Get a dog Dogs are always tracking things in from outside — like dirt, grass, and insects — exposing their human families to more microbes. That might help counteract the effect of a modern world on the microbiome. ""Over the past century, there's been a decrease in the diversity of the human microbiome, possibly because of sanitation and modern medicine,"" Pawluk says. ""Studies looking at young children growing up in a house with a pet show their microbiome becomes more diverse and they have less risk of allergies. We don't know if this helps older adults, but it wouldn't hurt."" Don't smoke Cigarettes contain lots of chemicals and toxins that are harmful to the whole body, including your gut and its residents. ""Smoking can kill some microbes and decrease microbe diversity. Smoking also puts physical stress on the body, including microbes. And when microbes are under stress, they change their function; they sense that they're in a bad situation and in some cases attack each other — or us. That can cause imbalance in the gut microbiome,"" Pawluk says. Consider probiotics One last suggestion that may affect the gut microbiome is to ingest colonies of ""good"" bacteria known as probiotics, which come in pills or powders or occur naturally in fermented foods (such as yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut). ""The intention is to boost the amount of beneficial bacteria in the gut,"" Pawluk says. ""If you've recently taken antibiotics, which kill both harmful and beneficial bacteria, probiotics may help re-establish a diverse microbiome. The thing is, if you already have a diverse gut microbiome, adding more of one species probably isn't going to promote any significant change."" But Pawluk says there's no evidence probiotics are harmful, especially when they come from food. And there are many reasons why you might want to eat healthy probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, which has lots of calcium, or try any of the lifestyle habits we've laid out here. They all benefit health in numerous ways. Image: © wmaster890/Getty Images",1,0.33747053,0.1687858,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/dont-take-back-pain-sitting-down,Don't take back pain sitting down,1,"Sitting down is supposed to be a way to relax after a long day on your feet. But for many people, sitting for any length of time is painful. It aggravates pain in the back instead of relieving it. What causes lower back pain when sitting? Although the specific reason for back pain often cannot be identified, muscle spasms are probably the most common cause. While there isn't proof from medical studies that sitting leads to more spasms, people often report tighter and more painful back muscles with prolonged sitting. A long car ride is a typical example. Sometimes people attribute the pain to the jarring and bouncing around that occurs on the road, but often it's just pressure from sitting that triggers the problem. If you experience lower back pain when sitting, the problem could be one of several common conditions, says Dr. Steven J. Atlas, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Herniated discs Herniated discs refers to a problem with one of the discs that act as pads between the vertebrae in your back. In particular, a disc can become herniated, meaning it develops a bulge that can pinch a nearby spinal nerve, causing pain. ""There have been some studies that measured the amount of pressure on the discs,"" says Dr. Atlas. ""Not surprisingly, the pressure is lowest when you're lying down."" But there is more pressure on the discs when you're sitting than when you're standing. ""In fact, if I come into the exam room and a patient is standing, rather than sitting, my suspicion that the person has a disc herniation goes up a lot,"" he says. Sciatica Disc problems can cause back pain alone, but when the pain moves into the legs, this may be the nerve pain known as sciatica. Sciatica sometimes occurs when a herniated disc pinches one of your sciatic nerves. These are the longest nerves in your body, running from the lower back into each leg. People with sciatica typically report a burning pain that involves the lower back, the leg, and sometimes the foot. When lower back pain is eased by sitting There is one common condition in older women that is eased by sitting. This is a type of arthritis of the lower back called spinal stenosis. ""In cases where the arthritis is severe enough to pinch nerves going to the buttocks and legs, people often report that the pain is better when sitting than standing. This is because when you sit, you bend forward a little bit at the lower back, and this may spread out the arthritic bones enough to relieve the pain temporarily,"" says Dr. Atlas. Pain relief may also occur when you lean forward while using a shopping cart or a walker. When to see a doctor In most cases, you should be able to manage back pain by yourself. Modify your activity and slowly work toward regaining function, says Dr. Steven J. Atlas, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. However, you should see a doctor if the pain isn't improving after you've modified your activity for a few weeks. (It can take up to four to six weeks to see improvement in sciatica from a herniated disc.) You should see a doctor right away if your pain is extremely severe, if it gets better but comes back, or if it occurs after an injury — such as falling down a flight of stairs, being in a car accident, or slipping on a patch of ice. That's different from back pain that begins during the course of regular movements, says Dr. Atlas. In other words, if your back starts to hurt when you lean over to tie your shoe, that's not an injury. How to relieve the pain If you're experiencing back pain when sitting, your impulse may be to lie down and then try to slowly progress back to sitting, says Dr. Atlas. But this is the wrong approach. You should lie down to relieve the pain, but the goal should be not to return to sitting, but rather to regain your ability to stand and move. ""The goal isn't to get into the chair. The goal is to start moving. Walking is better than sitting,"" he says. Movement is often the best medicine when it comes to relieving pain. Treating back pain If you can't manage your back pain yourself and opt to see a doctor, it's likely she or he will order treatments that follow a course similar to what you can do at home. ""There has been a shift away from medical intervention for back pain and an increased emphasis on treatments that don't focus on medication,"" says Dr. Atlas. ""There is also an increased appreciation that even medicines such as acetaminophen have risks, particularly in older adults."" A typical course of treatment starts with activity modification, progressing to exercise. ""For patients with severe symptoms, the first line of therapy might be manual treatment, such as massage, chiropractic, or physical therapy,"" says Dr. Atlas. Preventing problems Movement is the best way to ward off back pain. Regular physical activity can make the back stronger to reduce future episodes of pain. Exercises should focus on increasing strength and improving range of motion — as well as ensuring balance on both sides of the body, as some back pain can start when one side of the body is stronger than the other. In addition, whenever possible, avoid prolonged sitting. If you sit at a desk in the office all day, get up periodically — at least every 30 minutes — and walk around. Walk to get a drink of water or to pick up your mail. Take breaks throughout the course of the day to prevent future bouts of pain. Simple exercises for a healthy back Some simple exercises (done with the approval of your doctor) can help keep back pain at bay. These exercises build not only strength, but also flexibility. For more tips and exercises to help your back, check out the Harvard Special Health Report Back Pain: Finding solutions for your aching back (/lbp). Lie on your back with both knees bent. Pull one knee toward your chest and hold it for 5 to 10 seconds. Return to the starting position. Repeat with the other leg. Do this 5 to 10 times with each leg. Lie on your back with both knees bent and your feet on the floor. Pull both knees toward your chest and hold for 5 to 10 seconds. Return to the starting position. Do this 5 to 10 times. Lie on your back with both knees bent and your feet on the floor. Gently flatten your lower back to the floor and hold for 5 to 10 seconds, then relax. Do this 5 to 10 times.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/want-probiotics-but-dislike-yogurt-try-these-foods-202107142918,Want probiotics but dislike yogurt? Try these foods,1,"The top item on my grocery list is always yogurt: unsweetened, organic, made with almond milk. I'm always afraid I'll run out since I use it all the time. I put two tablespoons in every smoothie, switch it out for mayo, and nothing beats a cool cup on a hot day as an afternoon snack. Besides healthy doses of calcium and protein, yogurt is a prime source for probiotics, the ""good"" live bacteria and yeasts. Why are these helpful? Having a proper balance of bacteria in your gut improves digestion, blocks dangerous organisms that can cause infections, and boosts your immune system. It also helps your body absorb vital nutrients from food. What to know about probiotics Unlike vitamins, there is no recommended daily intake for probiotics, so there is no way to know which type of bacteria or quantities are best. The general guideline is to add some foods with probiotics to your daily diet. Hundreds of ingestible bacteria are classified as probiotics. The two found in most probiotic foods are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, each of which contains various strains. On food labels, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are often abbreviated as L. or B. and then combined with name of a specific strain. So, the strain acidophilus within the Lactobacillus bacteria is written as L. acidophilus. Probiotics in yogurt This brings us back to yogurt, which often contains L. acidophilus. Yogurt is a popular probiotic food because it's widely available, and there are different ways to consume it. Some brands include a Live & Active Cultures (LAC) seal from the International Dairy Foods Association to verify probiotic content. Otherwise, look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label. (Also, many fruit or sweetened varieties have too much sugar, so check labels for that, too.) Looking beyond yogurt for probiotics What if you are not a yogurt enthusiast, or simply want more options? Luckily, many other foods also serve up a good dose of good bacteria. They come in various flavors and textures, so odds are you will find a few to your liking. Kefir. This yogurtlike drink has a tart flavor, with a thinner consistency than yogurt. The beverage is usually made with dairy milk, but also comes in non-dairy alternatives, like coconut water, coconut milk, and rice milk. Kefir also comes in fruit and vegetable flavors, or you can add flavors yourself like cinnamon, vanilla, and pumpkin spice. It is also an excellent base for smoothies. Kimchi. Kimchi is a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish made with a mix of garlic, salt, vinegar, and chili peppers. It's often served alone or mixed with rice or noodles. You can also add it to scrambled eggs or on top of potatoes. You can find it at most grocery stores or Asian markets. Kombucha. This fermented tea drink has a tangy-tart flavor. Kombucha contains caffeine comparable to some other tea drinks. Some brands have added sugar, so check the label and avoid anything with more than 5 grams of sugar per serving. Miso. A popular paste in Japanese cuisine, miso is made from soybeans fermented with brown rice. It has a strong, salty flavor, and a little goes a long way. Use it as a dipping sauce, spread over your toast, or add it to marinades for fish, meats, and vegetables. Pickles. Not every type of pickle will do. Look for brands brined in water and sea salt instead of vinegar. Sauerkraut. Sauerkraut is pickled cabbage and may be an acquired taste. (I am a fan thanks to my German-born grandmother, who made me Reuben sandwiches as a kid.) Use it as a hot dog topper, mix it into salads, or combine it with your regular side vegetables. Always choose raw or non-pasteurized sauerkraut. It contains more probiotics than commercial sauerkraut, which loses much of its bacteria from pasteurization. Tempeh. Tempeh is a cake made from fermented soybeans, with a firmer texture than tofu. It is a popular meat substitute — try it as a veggie burger patty, or add to pasta sauce. Tempeh often comes precooked and ready to eat, but some brands may need cooking.",1,0.26131442,0.04710725,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/common-causes-of-constipation,Common causes of constipation,1,"Many factors can dispose a person to constipation. Some can easily be prevented by changing habits and lifestyle, but often the reason(s) are not so obvious. Following are the more common causes of constipation: Lack of exercise. People who exercise regularly generally don't develop constipation. Basically, the colon responds to activity. Good muscle tone in general is important for regular bowel movements. The abdominal wall muscles and the diaphragm all play a crucial role in the process of defecation. If these muscles are weak, they're not going to be able to do the job as well. But exercise is not a cure-all. Increasing exercise to improve constipation may be more effective in older people, who tend to be more sedentary, than in younger people. Opioids. The digestive tract has receptors for opioids, and constipation can occur (or worsen) when people take opioid pain medications. Opioid-induced constipation occurs in roughly 90% of cancer patients taking opioids for pain and 40% of people taking opioids for chronic noncancer pain. Other medications. Constipation is a side effect of many prescription and over-the-counter drugs. These include antacids that contain aluminum, antispasmodics, antidepressants, tranquilizers and sedatives, bismuth salts, iron supplements, diuretics, anticholinergics, calcium-channel blockers, and anticonvulsants. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some people who suffer from IBS have sluggish bowel movements, straining during bowel movements, and abdominal discomfort. Constipation may be the predominant symptom, or it may alternate with diarrhea. Cramping, gas, and bloating are also common. Over use of laxatives. Laxatives are sometimes used inappropriately, for example, by people suffering from anorexia nervosa or bulimia. But for people with long-term constipation, the extended use of laxatives may be a reasonable solution. In the past, long-term use of some laxatives was thought to damage nerve cells in the colon and interfere with the colon's innate ability to contract. However, newer formulations of laxatives have made this outcome less common. Changes in life or routine. Traveling can give some people problems because it disrupts normal diet and daily routines. Aging often affects regularity by reducing intestinal activity and muscle tone. Pregnancy may cause women to become constipated because of hormonal changes or because the enlarged uterus pushes on the intestine. Ignoring the urge. If you have to go, go. If you hold in a bowel movement, for whatever reason, you may be inviting a bout of constipation. People who repeatedly ignore the urge to move their bowels may eventually stop feeling the urge. Not enough fiber and fluids in the diet. A diet too low in fiber and fluids and too high in fats can con-tribute to constipation. Fiber absorbs water and causes stools to be larger, softer, and easier to pass. Increasing fiber intake helps cure constipation in many people, but those with more severe constipation sometimes find that increasing fiber makes their constipation worse and leads to gassiness and discomfort. Other causes. Diseases that can cause constipation include neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, or multiple sclerosis; metabolic and endocrine disorders, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease; bowel cancer; and diverticulitis. A number of systemic conditions, like scleroderma, can also cause constipation. In addition, intestinal obstructions, caused by scar tissue (adhesions) from past surgery or strictures of the colon or rectum, can compress, squeeze, or narrow the intestine and rectum, causing constipation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-is-a-hiatal-hernia,What is a hiatal hernia?,1,"Ask the doctors Q. My partner just got diagnosed with a hiatal hernia. What is it, and is it dangerous? A. Hiatal hernias are very common. They occur when part of the stomach pokes through a natural gap (called a hiatus) in the diaphragm, which is a muscle separating your chest from your abdomen. Normally the esophagus connects with the stomach through this hole, but in some cases, the upper part of the stomach slides upward through the hiatus. The most common cause is weakened musculature that surrounds the hiatus, which can be aggravated by straining during bowel movements, intense coughing, pregnancy, or heavy exertion. While many people who have a hiatal hernia have no symptoms, acid reflux is common. The hernia can change the position and function of the lower esophageal sphincter — a circular muscle at the base of the esophagus that normally keeps acid inside the stomach. The sphincter does not always close when it should, allowing irritating stomach acid to escape into the esophagus, which can cause heartburn. The good news is that most people with a hiatal hernia don't need treatment, and fewer than 5% of people with a hiatal hernia need surgery to fix the problem. If you are experiencing acid reflux symptoms, such as heartburn, it may be helpful to eat smaller meals and avoid eating within two hours of bedtime at night. If your doctor thinks it's necessary, you may also want to take an antacid. Illustration by Michael Linkinholker",1,0.20214802,-0.13176677,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/the-impact-of-stress-on-your-gut,The impact of stress on your gut,1,"Given how closely the gut and brain interact, it might seem obvious that the pair often influence each other. Some people feel nauseated before giving a presentation; others feel intestinal pain during times of stress. In any case, emotional and psychosocial factors play a role in functional gastrointestinal disorders. Treating the whole body Stress-related symptoms felt in the gastrointestinal tract vary greatly from one person to the next, and treatment can vary as well. For example, one person with gastroesophageal reflux disease might have an occasional, mild burning sensation in the chest, while another experiences excruciating discomfort night after night. As the severity of symptoms varies, so should the therapies, medications, self-help strategies, or even surgeries used to relieve them. Many people have mild symptoms that respond quickly to changes in diet or medications. If your symptoms do not improve, your clinician may ask you more questions about your medical history and perform some diagnostic tests to rule out an underlying cause. For some people, symptoms improve as soon as a serious diagnosis, like cancer, has been ruled out. Your doctor may also recommend symptom-specific medications. But sometimes these treatments are not enough. If symptoms persist, it's common to experience psychological distress. Some people are reluctant to accept the role of psycho-social factors in their illness. But it's important to know that emotions cause genuine chemical and physical responses in the body that can result in pain and discomfort. Cognitive behavioral therapy and stress reduction techniques such as meditation and relaxation therapies can help manage pain and improve other symptoms in ways that are different from how drugs act. The goal of all therapies is to reduce anxiety, encourage healthy behaviors, and help people cope with the pain and discomfort of their condition.

Is cheese a good source? A. Probiotics, good bacteria that can contribute to gut and overall health, can be found in some types of cheese as well as in dietary supplements, fermented foods, and yogurt. Typically, probiotics are in cheeses that have been aged but not heated afterward. This includes both soft and hard cheeses, including Swiss, provolone, Gouda, cheddar, Edam, Gruyère, and cottage cheese. Adding probiotics to your diet can potentially improve your health by helping to foster the growth of good bacteria inside your gut. Your gut contains some 100 trillion bacteria, but in some cases, the balance between the helpful and harmful bacteria falls out of balance. When this occurs, experts believe it may be linked to a host of conditions, such as allergies, mood disorders, and arthritis. Eating foods that contain probiotics, such as cheese, can help restore this natural balance. The only caution when it comes to cheese is to not overdo it. Cheese tends to be high in calories, saturated fat, and sodium.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/looking-out-for-diverticulitis-202108162572,Looking out for diverticulitis,1,"Most people don't have much in common with Pope Francis. But about 200,000 Americans each year can say they share an experience with the head of the Catholic Church: they had surgery for diverticulitis. Although Pope Francis recovered well from his procedure in July, it shed light on this potentially serious condition of the colon. If you have questions about why diverticulitis occurs, the most common signs of this condition, and how it is treated, read on. What is diverticulitis? Diverticulitis arises from a condition called diverticulosis, which occurs when weak areas in the inner wall of the colon bulge outward and form tiny pouches. Many people get diverticulosis as they age. In fact, diverticulosis affects about 58% of US adults over age 60. Getting enough fiber in your diet can help protect against diverticulosis. Most people are unaware they even have this condition. Often the diagnosis of diverticulosis is first mentioned in a report when a person has a colonoscopy or had an abdominal CT scan for another reason. Diverticulosis doesn't cause symptoms, but people who have irritable bowel syndrome or who are prone to constipation, bloating, and abdominal discomfort after eating are more likely to have it. ""While diverticulosis is very common, only a small percentage of people who have it will ever develop diverticulitis caused by inflammation or infection of one of the pouches,"" says Dr. Matthew Hamilton, a gastroenterologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Know the signs of diverticulitis The most common symptoms of diverticulitis are abdominal pain (usually on the lower left side) and fever. The pain is distinct and sharp, and may strike over a few hours. Other symptoms may include a combination of loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating and cramping, and not passing gas or stool. A mild case of diverticulitis that causes only minimal pain in the lower abdomen can resolve on its own within a day or two. However, you should seek immediate medical attention if your symptoms are not going away or you are feeling worse, such as having increasing pain, fever, bloody stools, or abdominal bloating with vomiting. Treatment depends on whether you have uncomplicated or complicated diverticulitis. Your doctor can determine this by using a combination of blood tests and imaging studies, such as a CT scan. How is uncomplicated diverticulitis treated? As the name implies, uncomplicated diverticulitis is the less serious of the two. It means that the inflammation or infection is confined to one section of the colon, and that there is no evidence of complicating factors. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is typically treated at home with oral antibiotics. You'll also be prescribed ""bowel rest"" for a few days, which often includes a clear liquid diet. This gives your bowel a chance to rest and heal, and may reduce pain. Additionally, you'll follow a low-fiber diet (about 10 to 15 grams of fiber a day) until your symptoms improve. Some people may need to be hospitalized to receive intravenous (IV) antibiotics. A hospital stay is more likely if you're 65 or older or have other medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. People usually begin to feel improvement from treatment after about three days. If you feel well enough and the symptoms have subsided, you can gradually resume your regular diet. If symptoms haven't responded to antibiotics after a week, you probably will undergo CT scans and other tests to see if you have complicated diverticulitis. How is complicated diverticulitis treated? Complicated diverticulitis means you have a specific complication that requires a longer course of IV antibiotics, and possibly surgery. Pope Francis had scarring in a segment of colon where he previously had diverticulitis, which had caused a narrowing in the colon called stenosis. In a case like this, the unhealthy part of the colon is removed, and the remaining colon is then reconnected. Other types of complications that may occur during an active diverticulitis infection include: Abscess. A diverticular abscess is a collection of pus (a fluid that can form at the site of infection) outside of the intestinal wall. If the abscess doesn't get better with antibiotics, a doctor will need to drain the pus using a needle, under guidance through images on a CT scan. Perforation. Diverticulitis can cause a hole in the colon that allows bowel contents to spill into the abdominal cavity. If you have a perforation, your abdomen may feel tender to touch, hard, or enlarged. Surgery repairs the hole. Sometimes part of the colon around the hole must be removed. Fistula. A fistula is an abnormal connection between the inflamed and infected segment of the colon and adjacent organs, such as other parts of the intestine or the bladder. Surgery consists of colon resection and removing the fistula. Can diverticulitis be prevented? Eating a high-fiber diet and managing stress may lower the risk of developing pouches in the colon known as diverticula. So it makes sense that these lifestyle interventions might help make diverticulitis less likely to occur. However, once you have diverticulosis, there is no proven way to prevent one of the diverticula from becoming infected or inflamed.",1,0.19161169,-0.037466228,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-05-23-nato-has-become-military-wing-of-globalist.html,NATO has become military wing of globalist cabal that promotes the self-destruction of all nations in a depopulated world,0,"One of NATO’s primary missions is to spread instability throughout the world, using the military-industrial complex to bully and intimidate countries non-compliant with a militant anti-family anti-God agenda flowing out of Western capitals and promoted by Western media. (Article by Leo Hohmann republished from LeoHohmann.Substack.com ) NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg asserted on Friday the alliance's commitment to defending the rights of LGBTQ individuals, aligning with numerous Western officials, institutions, and organizations in commemorating the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia. Author Jose Nino summed it up nicely in a piece for Big League Politics : “The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is committed to spreading degenerate values abroad. With Russia seemingly making major gains against NATO-backed Ukrainian forces in Eastern Ukraine, NATO leaders have been engaging in bizarre virtue signaling to divert attention away from the abject failure of this proxy war against Russia. “Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 24, 2022, NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg has been particularly vocal about NATO’s values and why it’s an institution that has to be trusted despite its long track record of causing instability abroad — from Serbia all the way to Libya.” On Friday, May 17, Stoltenberg, re-affirmed NATO’s priorities in a post on X that arrogantly proclaims the current Western value system and what it’s based upon: “ NATO exists to defend 32 nations, and our peoples’ right to live freely & in peace. On the International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia & Transphobia, and every day: all love is equal. LGBTQ+ people deserve respect & dignity, and I am proud to call myself your ally.” Nino reminds us of why NATO was founded in the first place, in the wake of World War II in 1949. It was to counter the Soviet Union’s influence on the European continent. “However, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO has worked to remake the world in America’s increasingly dysfunctional image. Its interventions in the Balkans all the way to Libya have brought nothing but harm and instability.” NATO is no longer seen by most nations of the world as a defensive alliance. NATO launched offensive wars against Yugoslavia in 1999 and Libya in 2011, as well as its protracted occupation of Afghanistan, leaving the country no freer and no better off in 2021 than when it was invaded 20 years prior, but rather much more dangerous with billions of U.S. and Western military weapons in the hands of the Taliban terrorists. But even more destructive is the fact that NATO teams up with an army of neo-Marxist and Cultural Marxist nonprofits to promote values antithetical to those found in the Bible, including gay ""marriage,"" abortion on demand up to birth, and children being able to choose their own gender, along with the whole idea of gender as a social construct meant to ""oppress"" the sexual deviants and mentally confused. Why do they promote ideas so destructive of society? Because they know no nation can survive for long without moral restraints and some sort of devotion to a higher authority above that of carnal man. Nino adds: “In effect, any country that gets in bed with NATO catches the STD of multiculturalism, sexual degeneracy, and societal decay. More importantly, NATO is an entangling military alliance with a crusading ideology that is a threat to world peace. “ No nation can survive without strong men. Transgendered females (biological men who pretend to be women) running around in skirts do not tend to make good military officers, but that's exactly the type of behavior that is now being promoted and encouraged by the military forces of the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada and Israel. This group of nations will all suffer catastrophic defeats at the hands of Russia and China if they continue with their plans to poke the bear and create a World War III scenario while at the same time indulging the lowest form of human behavior. At the heart of this Western globalist agenda lies a demonic attempt to depopulate the world in accordance with the principles laid out in the Georgia Guidestones and other globalist screeds. Because everyone knows that gay marriages don't produce children. Emasculated, mutilated and transgendered young people don't reproduce, either. Any nation that is truly free and independent should immediately exit this military alliance and even non-members should totally free themselves from NATO's Luciferian psychological clutches. Because NATO's psychopathic leaders base their speech and their actions on moral alchemy, warmongering and a Satanic lust for power over the free minds of people everywhere.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-you-should-move-even-just-a-little-throughout-the-day,Why you should move — even just a little — throughout the day,1,"Sitting for long, uninterrupted periods of time may leave you more prone to cardiovascular problems. How much time do you spend sitting each day? If you're like most people, more than half of your waking hours are spent parked on a chair or sofa. Even if you dedicate at least 30 minutes a day to structured exercise (such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming), it's still important to get up and move for at least a few minutes, many times throughout the day. ""The more you sit, the more your large muscles are not using glucose, the body's main energy source. Uninterrupted sitting can cause blood sugar levels to rise, triggering the release of insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar,"" says Dr. Hicham Skali, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Over time, sedentary habits cause the body to become less sensitive to insulin. The resulting insulin resistance promotes inflammation, a key player in the buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries, he explains. Preliminary evidence from studies in rats suggests that sedentary behavior may change the activity of dozens of genes, including the gene responsible for making lipoprotein lipase (LPL). This enzyme helps break down fat so it can be used for energy or stored in the body. When rats were prevented from moving, LPL levels decreased, a change that may also contribute to raising heart disease risk, Dr. Skali explains. Don't just sit there The evidence about the harms of uninterrupted sitting (and the benefits of breaking it up) has been piling up for years, aided by tools such as fitness trackers that reveal people's typical activity patterns. Here are just a few examples of supportive studies: More than 2,600 people ages 60 and older reported their typical sitting habits (including a weekday and weekend) and were followed for nine years. Those who sat for an average of about three hours a day were 33% less likely to die of cardiovascular disease during the follow-up period than people who sat for an average of about seven hours a day. Among 8,000 people followed for 10 years, those who did light activity instead of sitting for 30 minutes each day had a 17% lower risk of dying in that period, even if they split up that half-hour of activity into periods as brief as a minute each. In more than 5,600 women followed for five years, reducing sedentary time by one hour per day was linked to a 26% lower risk of heart disease. Again, the hour of non-sedentary time didn't have to occur all at once. Short, light-intensity interruptions to sitting were just as effective. Making the moves There are many ways you can add short bursts of movement to your daily routine. Whenever you notice you've been sitting for a while, do a short set of exercises — say five to 10 squats or leg lifts, Dr. Skali suggests. You can also keep a stretchy exercise band near your favorite chair to get some arm exercises in as well. Here are some other ideas: Set a reminder. Many fitness trackers feature alerts that remind you to get up at least once an hour. But you can also use a smartphone or a regular kitchen timer; use it during periods when you tend to sit for long stretches. Take care of your chores less efficiently. Put your groceries or other purchases in small bags and make multiple trips from your car to your home. Stand up while folding laundry, and put just a few items of clothing away at a time to get more steps in. Pace or tidy up during phone calls. Whenever you're on the phone, stand up. Try to walk back and forth or in circles while you talk. Or use a hands-free headset and do some light housework while you chat. Move a little while you watch TV. The average American watches close to five hours of television a day, and that amount increases as people age. At least once an hour, stand up and march in place, swing your arms, or do some easy stretches. Take the long way. Whenever you drive somewhere, park in a spot farther from the door to get in some extra steps. Take the stairs instead of the escalator or elevator, even if you climb only one or two of the total flights. Image: © SeventyFour/Getty Images",5,0.4662574,0.029179156,True

A study published April 11, 2023, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology counters this perceived connection. Researchers recruited 100 people (average age 65). Two-thirds were taking statins, mostly simvastatin (Zocor) or atorvastatin (Lipitor). The group participated in a walking event in which they trekked either 18, 25, or 31 miles on each of four consecutive days. Muscle pain, fatigue scores, and levels of enzymes associated with muscle injury were measured before and after the event. The researchers found that pain, fatigue, and enzyme levels increased similarly for all participants whether or not they took statins or had existing muscle pain. According to the researchers, the new findings suggest that the drugs won't exacerbate usual pain symptoms from moderate-intensity exercise.

These exercises mimic everyday actions (such as picking something up off the floor), thereby improving your physical functioning throughout the day. A–Starting position: Stand up straight with your right foot one to two feet in front of your left foot, hands on your hips. Shift your weight forward and lift your left heel off the floor. B–Movement: Bend your knees and lower your torso straight down until your right thigh is about parallel to the floor. Hold, then return to the starting position. Do eight to 12 lunges, then switch leg positions and do eight to 12 lunges with your left foot forward. This completes one set. You can repeat the set up to two more times, with a rest of 30 to 90 seconds between sets. Tips and techniques: Keep your front knee directly over your ankle. In the lunge position, your shoulder, hip, and rear knee should be aligned. Don't lean forward or back. Keep your spine neutral (not bent or arched) and your shoulders down and back.

(Article by Jose Nino republished from BigLeaguePolitics.com ) With Russia seemingly making major gains against NATO-backed Ukrainian forces in Eastern Ukraine, NATO leaders have been engaging in bizarre virtue signaling to divert attention away from the abject failure of this proxy war against Russia. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 24, 2022, NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg has been particularly vocal about NATO’s values and why it’s an institution that has to be trusted despite its long track record of causing instability abroad — from Serbia all the way to Libya. On May 17, 2024, Stoltenberg, reinforced NATO’s commitment to LGBT values by dropping an unhinged post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter: NATO exists to defend 32 nations, and our peoples’ right to live freely & in peace. On the International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia & Transphobia, and every day: all love is equal. LGBTQ+ people deserve respect & dignity, and I am proud to call myself your ally. #IDAHOBIT Founded in 1949, NATO was ostensibly founded to counter the Soviet Union’s influence on the European continent. However, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO has worked to remake the world in America’s increasingly dysfunctional image. Its interventions in the Balkans all the way to Libya have brought nothing but harm and instability. On top of that, NATO teams up with a consortium of non-profit organizations to promote values such as sexual deviancy through soft power means. In effect, any country that gets in bed with NATO catches the STD of multiculturalism, sexual degeneracy, and societal decay. More importantly, NATO is an entangling military alliance with a crusading ideology that is a threat to world peace. Rational nations, especially the US, would be wise to exit this alliance altogether and chart their own paths on the world stage. Read more at: BigLeaguePolitics.com",2,-0.17954795,-0.35773933,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/taming-travelers-tummy,Taming traveler's tummy,1,"Travel is meant to transport you far from the same-old, same-old. But when you're not eating the same foods and sleeping on the same schedule (or even in the same time zone), the ripple effects on digestion can be fierce. With more nerve cells than many parts of the central nervous system, including the spinal cord, our gut knows when we're off our routine, says Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Our bodies, including our gastrointestinal tract, respond to circadian rhythms — day-and-night cues,"" he says. ""Your colon will sleep when you sleep and wake up when you do. If those times are shifted by travel and changing time zones, digestion can get thrown off."" Factor in heavy meals, too much alcohol, or dehydration from flying, and ""it's sort of a perfect storm to cause digestive problems,"" Dr. Staller says. ""Even the stress of travel itself can trigger them."" The result? Diarrhea, constipation, and indigestion — the trifecta of travelers' tummy troubles — can potentially derail your trip. Foodborne dangers Travel took a hiatus during the pandemic, but today's packed airplanes, rental car shortages, and booked-solid hotels signal a turnaround. According to U.S. Travel Association predictions, pent-up demand will fuel a surge over the next few years in all types of travel, including to destinations across the globe. Far-off locales, however — especially in developing countries — pose the biggest threat of delivering an unpleasant souvenir dubbed traveler's diarrhea. Its abdominal cramps and loose stools stem from eating or drinking germ-laden foods and beverages. Traveler's diarrhea affects an estimated 30% to 70% of travelers, according to the CDC. It can occur anywhere, but the highest-risk destinations are in most of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America. The condition typically results from poor hygienic practices in food handling and preparation or a lack of refrigeration. You're also more likely to get it if you're an older adult or — as with traveler's tummy in general — if you already have a digestive problem, such as irritable bowel syndrome, that changes how you eat or eliminate food. Microbes aren't the only culprit. ""Some people get so-called adjustment diarrhea, when they haven't ingested anything that's infectious but they're adjusting to new foods or spices,"" Dr. Staller says. Keep digestion humming The first step in warding off traveler's tummy is to learn from past mistakes, especially if you're prone to digestive upsets. ""The tendency is to arrive somewhere new and embrace it in all aspects,"" Dr. Staller says. ""Instead, keep your food choices more in line with things you eat at home, drink plenty of water, and eat moderate portions."" Beyond that, Dr. Staller offers additional strategies to keep indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation at bay: Plan ahead. Scope out restaurants and menus beforehand to make sure at least one item seems both palatable and easy to digest. ""This is more difficult, though, if you're more of a spontaneous traveler or staying in someone's home,"" he says. Assemble a ""control kit."" Rather than scrambling to purchase remedies in unfamiliar locations, bring along a variety of over-the-counter products to counteract digestive woes on the road. Good choices include antacids (such as Tums) for heartburn; bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate) for indigestion or diarrhea; docusate sodium (Colace, Surfak), psyllium (Metamucil), or bisacodyl (Dulcolax) for constipation; and loperamide (Imodium) for diarrhea. But don't use loperamide if you also have signs of infection such as fever or blood in your stool, Dr. Staller says. Instead, see a doctor. Pack familiar snacks. Whether that's granola bars, nuts, trail mix, or dried fruit, these items should be filling. ""There's no one-size-fits-all recommendation, but pick things you might eat at home as a quick snack or even a meal substitute in case you notice that everything at your location is going to disagree with you,"" he says. Eat street food with caution. Local delicacies or food truck cuisine are more apt to contain harmful bacteria, especially in developing regions. ""This isn't fun, because some of the tastiest food is street food,"" Dr. Staller says. ""But if you indulge, know you're taking that risk. If you're easily derailed by digestive issues, street food is a no-go."" Skip local water and ice. ""In the developing world, assume the water isn't safe unless it's from a bottle,"" he says. Instead, drink only what comes in cans or bottles. Image: © Science Photo Library/Getty Images",1,0.36140028,-0.04335609,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/try-this-take-a-step-back,Try this: Take a step back,1,"Lunges are one of the best exercises for improving leg strength and balance. Most of the time, they're done with a forward motion, but don't neglect the power of going backward. A reverse lunge helps develop key hip muscles for better stability and teaches you to control your backward movement and coordination. Every time you do forward lunges, add an equal number of reverse lunges on each leg. You can also perform them on their own. Here's how: Starting position: Stand up straight with your feet together and your arms at your sides, holding a lightweight dumbbell in each hand. Movement: Step back onto the ball of your left foot, bend your knees, and lower into a lunge. Your right knee should align over your right ankle, and your left knee should point toward (but not touch) the floor. Keep your spine neutral when lowering into the lunge, and don't lean forward or back. Push off your back (left) foot to stand up and return to the starting position. Repeat, stepping back with your right foot to do the lunge on the opposite side. To make it easier, don't use weights, or place a hand on a chair or table for stability.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-mouth-taping-help-my-snoring,Can mouth taping help my snoring?,1,"Q. My daughter heard on social media that taping our mouths closed during sleep could improve snoring and lessen bad breath. Is this true? A. Unfortunately, social media is rife with so-called medical advice that has no basis in science, and this sounds like yet another example. While intentional nose breathing during waking hours can offer many benefits — including slowing breathing, filtering allergens, and easing anxiety — taping your mouth while sleeping to achieve this can prove risky, leading to hampered breathing, disrupted sleep, or skin irritation. There's no research to support the measure, which, in certain cases, could significantly reduce a person's oxygen levels while sleeping. If you find you consistently can't breathe through your nose while sleeping, you may have some type of nasal obstruction, such as a deviated septum or a nasal polyp. (Research has linked nasal obstruction with snoring.) You may also have allergies, asthma, or sleep apnea (meaning you briefly and repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping). Talk to your doctor, who may suggest tests to pinpoint the problem's cause. Image: © necoji/Getty Images",5,0.2067704,-0.13047707,True

Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital looked at health data for about 90,000 people in the United Kingdom who wore wrist accelerometers, or motion tracking devices, that recorded their total physical activity and when they did it. People in the study, published Thursday in the medical journal Circulation, were categorized as weekend warrior, regular, or inactive, with inactive people recording less than 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The research team examined health records for connections between physical activity and occurrences of 678 conditions across 16 types of diseases, including mental health, digestive, neurological, and other categories. They found that people classified as weekend warrior or active had similarly lower risks for over 200 diseases compared with people classified as inactive. The benefits were especially strong for conditions like high blood pressure, with a 23% and 28% lower risk over an average of 6 years for weekend warriors and regular exercisers, respectively, and diabetes, with the study showing a 43% and 46% lower risk, respectively. But the benefits were found among all conditions studied. “Because there appears to be similar benefits for weekend warrior versus regular activity, it may be the total volume of activity, rather than the pattern, that matters most,” co-senior author Shaan Khurshid, MD, a faculty member in the Demoulas Center for Cardiac Arrhythmias at Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a news release from Massachusetts General Hospital. Khurshid said the benefits of weekend exercise in lowering the risk of issues with the heart and blood vessels were already well known. The study shows weekend workouts can cut the risk of many other conditions, ranging from “chronic kidney disease to mood disorders and beyond,” he said. A study published in August in Nature Aging found that weekend warriors and regular exercisers had a similarly lowered risk of brain and mental health conditions, such a depression and anxiety.",5,0.22573373,0.12049009,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/understanding-statin-intensity,Understanding statin intensity,1,"Q. I'm 71 and have taken 20 milligrams (mg) of atorva­statin (Lipitor) since 2010, after an angiogram showed a 90% blockage of a small coronary artery. But I've never had angina or a heart attack. My LDL is 70 mg/dL. Should I switch to 20 mg of rosuvastatin (Crestor), which I understand is a higher-intensity statin? A. You're correct — a 20-mg dose of rosuvastatin is considered high-intensity statin therapy. Before getting into my advice, let me first explain what we mean by statin intensity. Currently, there are eight different cholesterol-lowering statins on the market, each available in different dosages. In general, the higher the dosage, the more they lower your LDL cholesterol. However, some statins (especially rosuvastatin) lower LDL cholesterol better than others. So experts have classified statin therapy into three categories (low, moderate, or high intensity) based on how much they can lower LDL. As you can see by the table below, a statin can fall into more than one intensity category, depending on the dosage. For example, 10 or 20 mg of atorvastatin daily is considered moderate intensity, while 40 to 80 mg is high intensity. The choice of a statin depends on a person's risk. For someone with high LDL but no other risk factors or evidence of coronary artery disease, moderate-intensity therapy makes sense. But for someone like you, with known coronary artery disease, the guidelines recommended high-intensity therapy, as several trials have documented a lower risk of heart attack and stroke for people on high-intensity therapy compared with moderate-intensity therapy. The guidelines also recommended lowering LDL by 50% or aiming for an LDL of less than 70 mg/dl. Since you are close to that goal and have not had a heart attack, stroke, or other major cardiovascular problem, switching to rosuvastatin is not essential. However, all trials of cholesterol-lowering medications have found that lower is better for LDL. Because rosuvastatin is the most potent statin, switching could provide more protection for you.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/dont-bomb-the-bowel-with-laxatives,Laxatives: What to know about choosing the right one,1,"Occasional irregularity is a fact of life, but you can minimize it with some basic steps. You should be sure you are eating a fiber-rich diet, drinking adequate fluids, and staying physically active. But when you have constipation, the best laxative is the gentlest and safest option, like a bulk-forming laxative. If laxatives don't work, ask for help. You should see your doctor and discuss it if you are constantly needing to take laxatives. How do stool softeners work? Stool softeners work by softening stools to make them easier to pass. They can be in capsule, tablet, liquid, and syrup form and are usually taken at bedtime. Be sure to take stool softeners exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. First choice: bulk-forming laxatives Bulk-forming laxatives draw water into stool, making it softer and easier to pass. But don't expect instant gratification: these can take a half-day to several days to provide relief. They are safe to use daily. They contain various ingredients, and you may have to try more than one to find the product that helps you with minimal side effects, such as flatulence and bloating. They may be marketed as laxatives or as fiber supplements. For stuck stools... Stool softeners add moisture to stools to make them softer and easier to pass. Mineral oil, a lubricant, helps stools ""slide on by"" if the stools feel stuck low in your bowels, if you have an internal tear or ""fissure,"" or if you have pain from hemorrhoids during bowel movements. Don't take mineral oil at the same time as stool softeners. Take 1 tablespoon at breakfast or lunch. But don't use it for more than a few days, because mineral oil interferes with absorption of some vitamins and if inhaled it can cause pneumonia. Consider wearing a protective pad in your undergarments to absorb any leakage. Other laxative options If stool softeners aren't providing enough help, the osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX or a generic version) is good next step. These products hold water in stool to soften it and increase bowel movements. Common side effects are gas, bloating, and nausea. Another option that works for some people is diet candies containing the sweetener sorbitol. These essentially trigger a mild case of the runs. You may experience bloating and gas along with the laxative effect, however. Another option would be a magnesium-based laxative, such as milk of magnesia or magnesium citrate. These are members of a larger class of laxatives called saline osmotics, which draw water into the bowels and trigger bowel movements. The active ingredients include magnesium, sulfate, citrate, and phosphate. But don't take more than the recommended amounts of these laxatives, or use them long-term, because they can throw off your chemistry. Combined with an underperforming kidney or heart failure, saline osmotic laxatives can be dangerous. Common laxatives and brands Active ingredient Common brands Bulk forming bran cereals and other foods calcium polycarbophil FiberCon dextrin Benefiber methylcellulose Citrucel psyllium Metamucil Stool softeners docusate Colace, Correctol, Peri-Colac e, Surfak Lubricants mineral oil Various branded and generic products Osmotics magnesium magnesium citrate, milk of magnesia polyethylene glycol MiraLAX or generic versions sodium phosphate Fleet Phospho-Soda sorbitol or lactulose ingredients in various products Stimulants Bisacodyl Correctol, Dulcolax, Ex-Lax Ultra Casanthranol Dialose Plus, Peri-Colace Cascara Naturalax castor oil various brand and generic products Senna Ex-Lax, Fletcher's Castoria, Senokot Stimulant laxatives Stimulant laxatives such as senna and bisacodyl trigger contractions in the bowels that push the stool along. But if you take stimulant laxatives too often, you could become dependent on them to have a bowel movement at all — possibly because the bowel has stopped functioning normally. When to talk to a doctor If you find yourself trying one laxative after another, see your doctor for an evaluation. Additional testing can lead to better therapy and rule out any possible serious malfunctions. And if it is just constipation, your doctor can offer other medications to you that may be more helpful than over-the-counter laxatives.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ibd-and-lgbtq-how-it-can-affect-sexual-health-202306282949,IBD and LGBTQ+: How it can affect sexual health,1,"Everyone who lives with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) knows their illness has a major impact on daily life. Many people are diagnosed in their 20s or 30s, a time when we might hope for few health challenges. Medications, and sometimes surgery, may be used to treat IBD. If you identify as LGBTQ+, you might wonder how all of this may affect you — your physical health, of course, but also your sexual health and pleasure. Below are a few things to understand and consider. What is inflammatory bowel disease? IBD is a condition that causes inflammation along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The two main types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: Crohn's disease: inflammation can occur anywhere along the GI tract (from the mouth to the anus) Ulcerative colitis: typically affects the large intestine (colon) only. IBD can cause diarrhea, bloody stool, weight loss, and abdominal pain, and is typically diagnosed with blood and stool tests, imaging, and colonoscopy. A diagnosis of IBD may increase the risk of developing anxiety or depression, and can also have an impact on sexual health. People with IBD may require long-term medical treatment or surgery for their condition. The starting point: Talking to your doctor Talking to your medical team about IBD and sexual health may not be easy. This may depend on how comfortable you feel disclosing your LGBTQ+ identity with your health care providers. Ideally, you should feel comfortable discussing sexuality with your medical team, including what types of sexual partners and activities you participate in and how IBD may affect this part of your life. Be aware that health care providers may not be able to address all LGBTQ+-specific concerns. Optimal care for people with IBD who identify as LGBTQ+ is not fully understood. However, this is an active area of research. How might medicines for IBD affect sexual health? Many effective IBD medications subdue the immune system to decrease inflammation. These immunosuppressive medicines may raise your risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV, chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhea. What you can do: Discuss these concerns with your doctor so you can take appropriate protective measures. This might include: ensuring that your vaccinations, such as hepatitis B and HPV, are up to date. engaging in sex using barrier protection to prevent STI transmission. taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This safe and effective medicine helps prevent the spread of HIV. Ask your primary care doctor or gastroenterologist if PrEP is appropriate for you. How might surgery for IBD affect sexual health? For some people with IBD, gut inflammation is severe enough to require surgery to remove part of the intestine. For example: Abscesses or fistulas (abnormal connections between two body parts) sometimes form when someone has Crohn's disease around the anus. This may require surgical treatment. Active inflammation in the rectum or anus may make sex painful, particularly for people who engage in anal receptive sex. We don't yet know whether anal receptive sex is safe for people who have had surgery to remove the colon and create a J-pouch, which is formed from small intestine to create an internal pouch that enables normal bowel movements. What you can do: Discuss your concerns with your gastroenterologist and colorectal surgeon. If you engage in anal sex, you may be confused about whether it is safe to do so. While you may feel uncomfortable discussing this concern and others with your doctor, try to be as honest and open as you can. That way, you'll receive the best information on how to engage in safe and enjoyable sex after an IBD diagnosis or surgery. What else to consider if you are transgender People with IBD who are transgender may have additional concerns to address. For example, there may be a risk for sexual side effects from gender-affirming surgery. These procedures may include vaginoplasty (surgical creation of a vagina) for transgender females, or phalloplasty (surgical creation of a penis) for transgender males. The safety of these procedures in people with IBD is not currently well understood. What you can do: If you identify as transgender, ask your doctor if any gender-affirming surgeries you've had or medicines you take, such as hormones, might affect your IBD, recommended treatments, or sexual health. If you're considering gender-affirming surgery, discuss your options with your medical team. Be aware that gender-affirming surgery may be more challenging, or may not be advisable, for people with complex or active IBD. It's important to discuss your specific risks with your doctor when pursuing gender-affirming care. Having access to a team of physicians, including a surgeon and a gastroenterologist, may improve outcomes. The bottom line Try to talk to your gastroenterologist about how your sexual practices and gender identity may affect — and be affected by — your IBD. A conversation like this may feel uncomfortable, but being candid about your symptoms and concerns will help you receive the best possible care. Often, a multidisciplinary approach to care is helpful. Your health care providers, including your gastroenterologist and surgeon, may suggest seeing additional specialists. Much remains unknown about sexual health and practices in LGBTQ+ people with IBD. While more research is needed, open communication on the impact of medications, surgery, and other aspects of living with IBD can do a lot to improve your quality of life.",1,0.23914522,0.06332904,True
https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/news/20240925/cm/popular-weight-loss-drugs-spark-teen-eating-disorder-concerns,Why Weight Loss Drugs Are Risky for Teens With Eating Disorders,1,"Sept. 25, 2024 -- As a psychiatrist specializing in eating disorders, Kim Dennis, MD, has seen firsthand the complex relationship between obesity treatment and mental health in adolescents. Now, with the rising popularity of medications like Ozempic for weight loss, she fears she will see more of these young patients. ""We haven't seen patients yet, but I'm sure they are on their way,"" said Dennis, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago. She is also the co-founder, CEO, and chief medical officer of SunCloud Health, an outpatient eating disorder treatment center in Illinois. Dennis's concerns reflect a growing unease among eating disorder specialists as newer obesity medications, known as GLP-1 drugs, gain traction for adolescent use. The FDA approved semaglutide (Wegovy) for weight loss in adolescents ages 12 and up in December 2022 and liraglutide (Saxenda) for ages 12 and up in December 2020. One study found that the number of adolescents prescribed GLP-1s for type 2 diabetes and weight management rose from 8,722 to 60,567 between 2020 and 2023 — a nearly sevenfold increase. ""The number of adolescents taking these medications is going up because they work,"" said Suzanne Cuda, MD, medical director of Alamo City Healthy Kids and Families, a medical weight management clinic in San Antonio. The medications have been shown to treat type 2 diabetes, lower blood pressure, and reduce the risk for cardiovascular diseases. ""The younger you are, the better the outcome,"" Cuda said. But experts like Dennis have expressed concerns for teens with eating disorders who are seeking these medications or who have developed a disorder while taking them. In one recent study,nearly 80% of teens in treatment for obesity reported symptoms of disordered eating. These included signs of binge eating and loss of control. The randomized clinical trial, conducted from 2018 to 2023, looked at 141 adolescents with obesity doing interventions like low-calorie diets or intermittent fasting. Almost half scored as having a risk for an undiagnosed eating disorder. At the end of the intervention, many continued to have symptoms of disordered eating. The findings illuminate a significant challenge: Balancing effective weight management with the risk of worsening or triggering eating disorders, said Hiba Jebeile, PhD, a research dietitian at The Children's Hospital at Westmead in Westmead, Australia, and the study's lead author. Adding weight loss medication on top of the equation can further complicate care. Treating Obesity in Adolescents: Why Weight Loss Drugs Are Different How GLP-1 drugs affect adolescents in the long run is not yet clear. Studies on GLP-1 medications in patients with eating disorders have shown mixed results. Some suggest that the drugs decrease binge episodes for those with binge eating disorder or bulimia nervosa. But these studies looked at a small number of people and measured only short-term effects, leaving long-term outcomes and risks unknown. Traditional treatments for eating disorders emphasize regular eating patterns, body acceptance, addressing weight stigma, and improving attunement to hunger and fullness cues. GLP-1s, on the other hand, suppress appetite, alter metabolic signals, and may unintentionally reinforce weight loss as a primary goal, creating a potential disconnect between the aims of recovery from eating disorders and the biologic effects of the medication, experts said. ""One of the concerns is the extreme reductions in calories that could be induced by [GLP-1s] in children and adolescents,"" said Cuda, who has cared for adolescents with eating disorders who are seeking GLP-1s. Unlike adults, adolescents use calories not just for physical activity but also for growing and developing. ""They can’t catch up on that growth and development,” she said. The National Eating Disorders Association raised concerns about the possible misuse of these medications and their potential to exacerbate eating disorder behaviors in people at a higher risk. That includes those with mental health disorders or stress, dieters, and people who’ve experienced weight-centric bullying. Also vulnerable are patients with less obvious eating disorder symptoms, such as picky eating, insomnia or difficulty sleeping, or, for girls, irregular menstrual periods, Dennis said. These patients may be more likely to go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed. Research also suggests that people of color are less likely to be diagnosed or receive specialty care for eating disorders. Obesity treatment is a crucial opportunity to screen and monitor for disordered eating. But Dennis said that does not universally occur. Validated screening tools like the EDE-Q and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised, 10-Item Version can help. But regular check-ins with your doctor throughout treatment are also important, Cuda said. Building Your Weight Loss Management Team The Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) has stressed the importance of a collaborative approach involving connections with mental health professionals specializing in eating disorders and dietitians. Consulting with an obesity medicine specialist may also be helpful, said Cuda, who co-authored the OMA statement.

https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/news/20240923/fda-approves-first-at-home-nasal-flu-vaccine,FDA Approves First At-Home Nasal Flu Vaccine,1,"Sept. 23, 2024 – The FDA on Friday approved FluMist, a nasal spray flu vaccine that you or a caregiver can now give at home – no health care provider needed. It’s the first flu vaccine of its kind, offering a needle-free option that’s both simple and convenient, and its maker hopes it will improve access and uptake. FluMist contains a weakened, harmless version of the flu virus and needs to be taken once a year. The flu, as you probably know, can cause symptoms like a fever, stuffy nose, sore throat, coughing, body aches, and fatigue. It tends to make the rounds in the fall and winter, affecting millions each year. FluMist protects against two common flu virus types, A and B, and is suitable for anyone age 2 to 49. You can still get it from a health care provider if you prefer, but now you can also opt for a caregiver who’s 18 or older to help at home. According to MedImmune, the AstraZeneca subsidiary that makes FluMist, studies have shown that people ages 18 to 49 can successfully give the vaccine, and it's just as effective as having a doctor or nurse do it. AstraZeneca Executive Vice President Iskra Reic hopes this approval will make it easier for families and communities to access the flu vaccine on their own terms – outside of the traditional health care setting. Peter Marks, MD, PhD, who leads the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said this approval opens more convenient options for people looking to protect themselves against the flu. Those interested in using FluMist at home will still need a prescription. But there’s good news: An online pharmacy will soon offer the vaccine. AstraZeneca said that after completing a screening process to confirm eligibility, patients will receive their prescription and have FluMist shipped directly to their door, along with detailed instructions on how to store and use it. FluMist will also continue to be available at doctors’ offices and pharmacies. For children between 2 and 17, the FDA recommends that a caregiver give the spray. Common side effects include a runny or stuffy nose, fever in younger children, and a sore throat in adults.",4,-0.23586017,0.23326357,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-05-17-top-japanese-oncologist-covid-vaccines-essentially-murder.html,Top Japanese oncologist says COVID-19 vaccines are “essentially murder”,0,"Japan's top cancer doctor recently made headlines for openly admitting what many American doctors have been too afraid to say out loud: the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are “the work of evil” and have amounted to what is “essentially murder.” The comments were made by Dr. Masanori Fukushima in a recent interview . The decorated oncologist set up the first outpatient cancer clinic at Kyoto University in Japan and was responsible for the first course at the school in pharmacoepidemiology. He cited one particularly alarming side effect that the mainstream media in the U.S. hasn't reported on – the prevalence of “turbo cancers” that were “previously unseen by doctors.” He said that these cancers started appearing after the rollouts of the vaccines and have been progressing so quickly that they are often in stage 4 by the time doctors diagnose them. He added that the jump in these cancers has been accompanied by increases in excess mortality from cancer in general to a degree that cannot be explained simply by missed treatments or screenings during COVID-19-related lockdowns. He also pointed to sudden deaths seen in individuals shortly after receiving the vaccines, such as a 28-year-old man whose wife found him dead five days after his second dose of Pfizer's mRNA vaccine. It’s a story that is all too common these days, even in people with no history of health problems. He said: “It’s serious. It’s essentially murder. In the end, I want to state clearly that this is my view.” For Dr. Fukushima, it is no surprise that the countries that launched the most aggressive COVID-19 vaccination campaigns are seeing the highest rates of both infections and deaths, like Israel.

The less aggressively vaccinated areas saw less harm,” he said, adding that “Israel was quick to halt the vaccine.” Increasing numbers of vaccinated people need medical care for health issues related to the jab He said that the Japanese government has already documented more than 2,000 deaths connected to the shot, an estimate that he believes is low, along with numerous others who need medical care for serious health issues related to the jab. “There are tens of thousands of people who must see a doctor because of vaccine-related issues,” he said. He estimates at nearly a third of them are dealing with issues like chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis, and the problem is only going to get worse as numerous diseases have been spiking since the vaccine rollout. Unfortunately, there’s a chance that some of these patients may not get the attention and care they need. “It’s as if we’ve opened Pandora’s box… We must take these damages seriously and address them earnestly. Any efforts to dismiss these damages as if they didn’t happen are frankly the work of evil. This is a quintessential example of the evil practice of science,” he asserted. Dr. Fukushima also had some harsh words for the mainstream media and its failure to report on the dangers of the vaccines . He also called out the media for calling vaccine critics anti-science “heretics” and said those who silenced these individuals are the ones going against science, adding that they are “more akin to faith, hysteria or even cult behavior.” He added: “I am now deeply concerned not only about a serious crisis in medicine but in science and democracy.”",6,-0.34630167,0.254794,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/irregular-sleep-patterns-linked-to-atherosclerosis,Irregular sleep patterns linked to atherosclerosis,1,"Go to sleep at 11 p.m. one night, and 2 a.m. the next? You may want to rethink that pattern. A study published online Feb. 15, 2023, by the Journal of the American Heart Association suggests that sleep irregularity — night-to-night variations in sleep duration and timing (when you sleep) — are linked to atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in the arteries). Researchers from Harvard and other institutions asked a diverse group of more than 2,000 people (average age 69), without any known atherosclerosis, to wear sleep trackers and keep sleep diaries for one week. Participants also underwent assessments of artery plaque and one night of sleep testing. Scientists found that people with the most variation in sleep duration (more than two hours a night in a week) and sleep timing (more than 90 minutes in a week) were more likely to have atherosclerosis, compared with people whose sleep was the most consistent. This is an observational study, and we can't make definitive conclusions about cause and effect. But we already know that other sleep problems, such as interrupted sleep and poor sleep quality, are associated with cardiovascular disease. So the connection is plausible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-best-sun-protective-clothing,The best sun-protective clothing,1,"Summer officially starts this month, and in addition to using a strong sunscreen when you go outside, it's a good idea to wear sun-protective clothing. That's not just any hat or long-sleeved shirt in your closet; sun-protective clothes are made of materials that effectively shield your skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Protective fabrics Loosely woven fabrics of summer (such as gauze and linen) do very little to keep UV radiation from reaching your skin. The best defense comes from tightly woven fabrics with high thread counts, in dark or bright colors (which absorb light). Examples include polyester, nylon, lightweight wool, or canvas. Many clothing manufacturers now use high-tech fabrics for sun-protective garments. High-tech fabrics offer at least as much protection as regular densely woven fabrics, and maybe more. Often these fabrics wick away moisture and dry quickly. Some are even embedded with chemicals used in sunscreens (such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide). Note, however, that such chemical protection may last for only a limited amount of wash cycles, such as 20 to 40. UPF protection You'll know for sure if clothes are sun-protective if they have an Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) rating on the label. That's a measure of how much UV radiation penetrates the fabric. ""Look for a UPF rating of 50, which should block about 98% of the sun's rays. It's comparable to sunscreen with a sun protection factor [SPF] of 30, so wearing the clothes is consistent with actually putting sunscreen on,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Can you skip sunscreen if you're wearing UPF-rated clothes? ""Yes, but only for areas covered by the clothes,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""Any exposed skin still needs sunscreen, such as your neck, ears, hands, and feet."" And keep in mind that all clothes, UPF-rated or not, provide less UV protection when they get wet or if they're stretched and light can peek between the fibers. ""So make sure clothing fits loosely. And it's not a bad idea to wear a waterproof sunscreen beneath sun-protective clothes if you know you'll be perspiring a lot or going into water,"" Dr. Waldman says. Options and costs If you're looking to buy UPF-rated clothing, you'll find a wide range of options to shield every inch of your skin, including hats, scarves, gloves, face masks, neck gaiters, shirts, hoodies, dresses, skirts, shorts, pants, leggings, shawls, swimwear, unitards, and more. Which items do you really need? ""The more skin you cover, the better, especially if you're doing yard work or going to the beach,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""A hat, long-sleeved shirt, and pants are preferable. That can be a challenge on a really hot day, so make sure the fabric feels breathable and has moisture-wicking properties."" UPF-rated clothing can be pricey. A man's long-sleeved tee from some of the largest retailers (such as Coolibar Sun Protective Clothing, Columbia Sportswear Company, Lands' End, or L.L. Bean) goes for about $50. Brimmed hats for men and women also start at about $50. To save some money, Dr. Waldman recommends using a laundry aid that adds sun-protective chemicals to densely woven clothes you already own (dry-fit nylon or polyester-blend tees are good candidates). The laundry aid is called Rit SunGuard, and it can give clothes a UPF of 30. ""It's a powder. You just throw it in with normal washing, and it lasts for 20 washes. The clothes look the same,"" Dr. Waldman says. A word about hats You need a hat that protects more than just the crown of your head from UV rays, and that means you need a wide brim. ""A lot of people fall short by using a baseball cap. But it doesn't cover the ears, the chin, or the back of the neck. So get as wide a brim as possible, at least three inches,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""If you're not wearing a hat with a wide brim, apply sunscreen on exposed areas. And that goes for when you wear bike helmets, too. They have slits that allow for sunburns."" A hat's materials and construction are also important considerations. ""You don't want a lot of mesh or large holes in the hat, because UV rays can reach your skin. The best material would be canvas, polyester, or nylon. They'll provide more protection than a straw hat,"" Dr. Waldman says. Remember why you're doing this Taking the time to wear protective clothes outside has a big payoff for your skin. ""Even one sunburn can result in skin cancer in a few years,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""If you can cover up and avoid burning now, you'll be better off later."" Image: © Westend61, Calin Hanga/Getty Images",0,0.06209637,-0.107856356,True

A new study by Harvard researchers suggests that one in five people with cardiovascular disease or diabetes declines to take a recommended statin drug. The study, which spanned 19 years, included more than 24,000 people who had suffered a stroke or had heart disease, vascular disease, diabetes, or very high cholesterol. Over all, about two-thirds of people advised to take statins eventually started them, but the other third never did. Over the entire course of the study, women were more likely than men to never start a statin.

Women who practiced five or six of a list of healthy lifestyle habits — including weight control, not smoking, regular exercise, adequate sleep, high-quality diet, and moderate alcohol consumption — were 49% less likely to develop long COVID compared with women who practiced none. Of the six lifestyle factors, healthy body weight and adequate sleep (defined as seven to nine hours nightly) were most strongly linked with lower risk.

But sometimes it seems elevated for no apparent reason. Why might this happen? A. When at rest, the average adult's heart beats between 60 and 100 times each minute. Your heart can speed up for many different reasons — including, as you've noted, physical activity. Other triggers are also temporary, such as stress, smoking, or caffeine or alcohol use. Certain medications, including those that treat colds, asthma, mood disorders, and high blood pressure, can also elevate your heart rate. But a higher-than-normal heart rate can also result from a serious health condition such as anemia, overactive thyroid, or heart disease. Seek immediate medical care if your heart rate seems high and you're also short of breath, dizzy, lightheaded, or weak, or if you have chest pain. In the absence of urgent symptoms, make an appointment to talk to your doctor about what else might be contributing to a higher heart rate. You might also be interested in...

While natural aging and genetics are part of the equation, lifestyle factors can play a significant role. Two recent studies further explored this connection by looking at how stress and diet might affect cognitive function and protect against Alzheimer's disease. One study found that perceived stress — the degree of stress people feel about their life — was linked to poor cognitive health among older adults. Researchers recruited more than 24,000 people (average age 64). They measured stress and cognitive function with the Perceived Stress Scale and the Mini-Mental State Examination. The results showed that people who scored highest on the stress level scale were more likely to have low cognitive test scores. The reverse was also true — lower stress levels went hand in hand with higher test scores. The results were published online March 7, 2023, by JAMA Network Open. In another study, published online March 8, 2023, by Neurology, researchers explored whether certain dietary habits may lower the risk of Alzheimer's. The researchers analyzed data on 581 people from the Rush Memory and Aging Project cohort, a prospective study of older adults who agreed to undergo annual evaluations and to donate their brain at death. Participants reported on their dietary habits and completed annual food questionnaires. The researchers found that people who regularly followed plant-based diets had lower amounts of beta-amyloid buildup in their brains, a marker for Alzheimer's. Among this group, people with the highest intake of green leafy vegetables — seven or more weekly servings — had less buildup than those who ate only one or two servings a week.

Even the basics of getting through your day, like getting into the car or carrying laundry to the basement, can become sharp reminders of your limitations. Keep on moving It is tempting to avoid the motions that cause you pain. But limiting your movements can weaken muscles and make compound joint trouble worse. And actually movement— in the form of the right exercises performed properly —can be a long-lasting way to subdue ankle, knee, hip, or shoulder pain. For some people, the right exercise routine can even help delay or sidestep surgery. Your goal should be to pair gentle, targeted joint workouts with a simple walking routine. Your doctor should advise you before you begin a new exercise program. Simple stretching tips If you start targeted joint exercises, these simple stretching tips are important to any workout: Warm up first. Muscles stretch more easily when warm. Try doing warm-ups before a workout, or take a warm shower or bath first. Feel no pain. Stretch only to the point of mild tension, never to the point of pain. If a stretch hurts, stop doing it. Reset your position carefully and try again. With time and practice, your flexibility will improve. Breathe. Breathe comfortably when stretching. Practice often. You'll see the best gains if you do gentle stretching frequently—several times a day on as many days of the week as possible.

https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20240917/you-could-be-eating-toxic-chemicals-from-food-packaging,You Could Be Eating Toxic Chemicals From Food Packaging,1,"Sept. 17, 2024 – People ingest tiny, chemical-containing bits of things that touch the food and drink we consume every day. There are a vast number of sources of these chemicals, ranging from plastic bags and bottles to take-out containers and shrink wrap to manufacturing and cooking equipment. Scientists have identified 14,000 distinct chemicals that come into contact with food, and now a new study has established that 3,601 of them have been detected in the human body. That works out to be 25% of known food contact chemicals, sometimes called FCCs. Among the worrying aspects of their findings was just how little is known about most of the chemicals, particularly if or how they affect human health. The researchers also found many that are already linked to cancer, permanent genetic changes, toxic effects on the reproductive system, and toxicity to essential body organs. Some FCCs are very well understood. One of the most well-known ones is bisphenol A (BPA), which has been banned from use in some containers like baby bottles due to health concerns that have prompted many products to advertise that they are “BPA-free.” Other chemicals have started being regulated further by the Environmental Protection Agency, including a handful of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water. The researchers also found metals, pesticides, volatile organic compounds that can be breathed in, and phthalates, which are used to make plastic, as well as fragrances and personal care products. The chemicals have technical names like triphenylphosphine oxide and di-n-propyl phthalate. When the team searched scientific literature to see what is known about the FCCs detected in humans, they concluded there is a broad lack of knowledge, such as for synthetic antioxidants that help keep products fresh and for oligomers, which are simply small molecules unintentionally added to food. “Many of these FCCs have hazard properties of concern, and still others have never been tested for toxicity,” the researchers wrote as to why they undertook the study. “Humans are known to be exposed to FCCs via foods, but the full extent of human exposure to all FCCs is unknown.” The study, published this week in the Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology, comprehensively searched biological data collections for detections of FCCs in humans, such as from samples of blood, urine, skin, and breast milk. The data is now assembled and available in a public listing with an interactive search tool. “Our research helps to establish the link between food contact chemicals and human exposure, highlights chemicals that are overlooked in biomonitoring studies and supports research into safer food contact materials,” lead author Birgit Geueke, PhD, senior scientific officer at the Food Packaging Forum, said in a news release.",8,-0.007968191,-0.004742071,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-you-worry-about-high-triglycerides,Should you worry about high triglycerides?,1,"Triglycerides are a type of fat that gets stored in adipose tissue and circulates in blood. Your body makes triglycerides or gets them from the foods you eat. High triglycerides Your body needs some triglycerides. However, high triglycerides in your blood is linked to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke. Until recently, triglycerides tended to get less attention when looking at cardiovascular risk compared to LDL and HDL cholesterol levels. There's no question that extremely high levels (1,000 mg/dL or more) spell trouble and can lead to acute pancreatitis. What level of triglycerides is dangerous? But what about treating lower levels of triglycerides? Recent evidence suggests you should work to reduce triglyceride levels if they are higher than normal, especially if you have heart disease or have other risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure or smoking. Triglyceride levels Normal Less than 150* Borderline high 150–199 High 200–499 Very high 500 or higher *All values in milligrams per deciliter Source: National Cholesterol Education Program. Triglycerides can be one of the signs of metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk for having a heart attack or stroke. People with metabolic syndrome are several times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. The risk of eventually developing diabetes is even greater. A syndrome is, by definition, a group of signs and symptoms that occur together because of an underlying condition. For metabolic syndrome, that group includes abdominal obesity (as measured by waistline), high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low HDL cholesterol — and, yes, high triglyceride levels. Triglycerides and HDL Triglycerides and HDL are metabolically connected and are often inversely related: As triglycerides go up, HDL tends to go down — and vice versa. But that isn't always so. People can have ""isolated"" high triglycerides without low HDL levels, and research is now showing that high triglycerides are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, no matter what the HDL is. What causes high triglyceride levels? Factors that can raise your triglyceride level include: Being overweight or having obesity Diabetes Cigarette smoking Excessive alcohol use Certain medicines An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) Some genetic disorders How to lower high triglyceride levels Many of the steps you should take to lower triglycerides are the same ones you should take to protect your heart and health overall. Your doctor will advise you of measures you can take to lower high triglycerides. Some of these steps may include: Exercise regularly Lose weight Avoid sugar/refined carbs Limit alcohol intake Quit smoking Get enough sleep Manage stress levels. How to lower triglyceride levels with medication If you're taking a statin to lower your LDL, one side benefit may be reduced triglyceride levels. Depending on the dose, statins can lower triglycerides by 20%–40%. The omega-3 fats in fish and fish oil capsules are another triglyceride-lowering option. For a very high triglyceride level, your doctor can prescribe a high-dose omega-3 medication. Image: udra/Getty Images",3,0.3720192,0.15808694,True

The European Medicines Agency (EMA), the agency in charge of regulating vaccines in the union, approved the request – which took effect on May 7 . Similar moves in the U.K. and other countries were expected. In an update on the EMA's website, it said the approval for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 injection had been withdrawn ""at the request of the marketing authorization holder.""

Billions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were distributed to poorer countries through a U.N.-coordinated program, as it was cheaper and easier to produce and distribute. However, studies later suggested that the pricier messenger RNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna provided better protection against COVID-19 and its many variants, and most countries switched to those. AstraZeneca claims withdrawal due to ""commercial reasons"" AstraZeneca claims that the decision was due to ""commercial reasons,"" with new injections having superseded its initial offering. But critics point out that the withdrawal followed an admission by the pharmaceutical company that its COVID-19 injection – sold under the names Vaxzevria and Covishield – can cause thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). The condition, which involves blood clots coupled with a low blood platelet count, is linked to 81 fatalities in the United Kingdom. ""It is admitted that the [AstraZeneca] vaccine can … cause TTS,"" the company indicated in recent court filings. Despite this, the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical firm insisted that TTS only happens ""in very rare cases."" The admission was in relation to a lawsuit alleging that AstraZeneca's COVID-19 injection was defective. (Related: AstraZeneca admits its COVID-19 vaccine CAUSES BLOOD CLOTS in U.K. court filings ). The lawsuit was filed by Jamie Scott, a 47-year-old who suffered permanent brain damage after being injected with the COVID-19 vaccine. His wife Kate responded to the news of the withdrawal, telling the Telegraph : ""They say it is for commercial reasons, but maybe it's because it can no longer be seen as being within the acceptable safety parameters, with 445 confirmed cases of [vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis], 81 of these fatal in the U.K. alone.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/lifestyle-changes-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-attacks,Lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of gout attacks,1,"Lifestyle measures, such as dietary changes, can help lower levels of uric acid, the chemical that causes gout by forming crystals that deposit in joints. However, for most people, changes in diet alone are not enough to prevent gout. To reduce uric acid levels enough to stop attacks, medication is usually needed. Still making changes in what you eat can lead to fewer gouty flares. In the past, doctors often handed their patients a list of foods high in purines and instructed them not to eat those foods. By itself, that hasn't been shown to be particularly helpful. More recently, experts have begun thinking about diet differently. Instead of trying to figure out which individual foods you should avoid, the focus is on following a healthy diet and trying to lose weight if you're overweight or obese. Just losing weight can lower uric acid levels. Drinking plenty of fluids is also helpful. It's also important to limit sweetened drinks and alcohol, as these can increase uric acid levels. In general, a healthy diet emphasizes plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and legumes. Whole grains are preferred over processed grains. Intake of fat, especially saturated fat (found in red meat), should be reduced. Lean sources of protein, including chicken, turkey, fish, and tofu, are better choices than beef or pork. Fish, which contains omega-3 fatty acids, is part of a healthy diet. But some seafood also contains high amounts of purines. People with gout don't have to steer completely clear of fish. But try to limit the amount of shellfish, sardines, and anchovies you eat, because they have the highest amounts of purines. A better choice is flaky white fish, such as cod, tilapia, or flounder. One pattern of healthy eating is the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. One study found that people following the DASH diet for eight weeks lowered their uric acid levels 0.25 mg/dL on average. The higher the starting uric acid level, the greater the decline. There are a few foods people with gout should limit as much as possible or avoid entirely. And some foods may be beneficial. For example, multiple studies have found lower uric acid levels among people who consume low-fat dairy products. Studies have found that vitamin C may lower uric acid levels. People with gout may be helped by adding citrus fruits and other foods rich in vitamin C (such as strawberries and peppers) to their diet. Some evidence suggests that eating cherries can reduce gout attacks and improve pain. These findings are not conclusive, but there's no harm in adding cherries to your diet. Remember: You aren't to blame for gout because you overdid the steak and lobster dinners or drank too much alcohol. Gout is a chronic form of arthritis caused by the effects of too much uric acid in the bloodstream. Certain factors can raise your risk of gout and contribute to triggering gout attacks. These include certain foods and alcohol. But just eliminating purine-rich foods and alcohol is not enough to prevent attacks for most people with gout. Medications are used to treat an acute attack, and you can take other medications over the long term to prevent further attacks. When it comes to diet, focus on an overall healthy eating pattern, drink plenty of fluids, and try to lose excess weight. Image: © GettyImage",3,0.43239003,-0.02985859,True

A randomized study published in the January 2023 issue of The Lancet Planetary Health found all of those benefits when participants grew their own produce. The trial involved about 300 people (average age 41) who wore activity monitors and took occasional surveys about their diet and health. None of them had kept a garden for at least two years. Half of the participants were given an introductory gardening course, seeds, and community garden plots to work in for one year. The other participants were told not to do any gardening for a year. Compared with non-gardeners, gardeners ate about two more grams of fiber each day (a 7% increase in their fiber intake), reported greater reductions in stress and anxiety, and did about six more minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per day (about 40 minutes per week). All of those changes are linked to better health, such as lower risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Image: © Steve Smith/Getty Images",3,0.3502389,0.112696245,True

But few studies have looked at healthy lifestyle effects on memory in particular, and none have considered the effects on memory in people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. Now a study from China offers insight. The study, published online Jan. 25, 2023, by BMJ, involved more than 29,000 people without dementia (average age 72). Participants initially underwent cognitive testing as well as genetic testing for genes known to raise risk for Alzheimer's, and reported how well they stuck to six healthy lifestyle habits (eating a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking, not drinking alcohol, being socially active, and engaging in brain-challenging activities). Participants were followed for 10 years, periodically reporting their lifestyle habits and undergoing cognitive testing. At the end of the study, people who stuck to at least four healthy habits showed significantly slower memory decline than people who didn't practice any healthy habits. This was true even among people with Alzheimer's-related genes. The habits associated with the biggest effects were diet, cognitive activity, exercise, and social contact. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that a healthy lifestyle protected memory. But a healthy lifestyle has many health benefits, and you'll only win by improving yours.

House Bill 4624, which passed following a 27-8 Senate vote, prohibits medical professionals from administering puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones or performing gender reassignment surgeries for all patients under 18 years old. Any physician, mental health provider or healthcare professional found guilty of providing gender transition procedures to minors could face severe consequences, including the loss of their medical licenses and criminal charges of ""inflicting great bodily injury upon a child."" Under HB 4624, minors who have already begun using puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones before August 1, 2024, must be gradually weaned off these medications by January 31, 2025. The bill also bans the use of public funds for gender transition practices and prohibits Medicaid from covering or reimbursing these procedures. (Related: Texas enforces BAN on gender-related medical procedures for teens .) The bill also contains provisions that reinforce parental rights on gender identity issues within schools. HB 4624 also mandates that school principals or vice principals should inform parents or guardians if a student requests to use a name, nickname or pronoun that differs from the sex assigned at birth. Additionally, the bill prohibits school employees from hiding information about a child's gender identity from their parents or encouraging children to withhold such information. Initially, the House of Representatives passed the bill in January. However, the Senate made changes so either the House can vote to adopt the Senate version or it will go to a conference committee of three members from each chamber to resolve the differences.

In the amendment, mental health counselors can discuss banned treatments and suggest where they might be legally obtained. Healthcare providers can also permit puberty blockers for conditions such as precocious puberty for children as young as four years old. The bill, which was approved on May 9, would take effect immediately once Republican Gov. Henry McMaster signs it. Study: Puberty blockers have irreversible effects Democratic Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto criticized the bill and argued that the government has nothing to do with the ""gender identities"" of children. ""Children are born who they want to be. Parents deal with the children that come to them. Doctors have been trained to deal with children who are having issues like this. Government really has no role in this,"" Hutto said. ""Let the children be who they are."" Doctors and parents who testified before legislative committees emphasized that minors in South Carolina do not undergo gender-transition surgeries, while hormone treatments only begin following extensive consultations with health professionals. They claimed that these treatments can be crucial to improving the mental health and overall well-being of transgender youth. But supporters of the bill said puberty blockers increase tendency to self-harm and can have irreversible effects. An analysis of a 2011 study revealed that at least 34 percent of children placed on puberty-blocking pharmaceutical drugs became ""reliably deteriorated."" The study was conducted by the University College London Hospitals (UCLH) and the Tavistock Center Gender Identity Development Service. The pool of those evaluated was only 44, so the sample size is small. Still, a good number of the kids aged 12 to 15 suffered greatly after being prescribed these poisons to become trans.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/appreciating-golfs-cardiovascular-perks,Appreciating golf's cardiovascular perks,1,"Golf is jokingly described as a good walk spoiled. But that walk is loaded with cardiovascular health benefits — maybe even more than you'd get from an hour of brisk walking or Nordic walking, suggests a small, randomized study published online Feb. 6, 2023, by BMJ Open Sport and Exercise Medicine. Researchers asked 25 healthy, experienced golfers (men and women ages 65 or older) to complete three different types of exercise within a five-day period (just one activity per day). The exercises included one 18-hole round of golf on foot (pulling golf clubs), one hour of brisk walking, and one hour of Nordic walking (which involves the use of poles). On exercise days, participants ate identical breakfasts and snacks; had their blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol measured before and after exercise; and wore activity trackers. All three activities lowered blood pressure and levels of blood sugar and cholesterol. But golf seemed to have slightly more effect on blood sugar and cholesterol, at least in the short term. Scientists speculate it's because of the game's long duration (three to four hours) and the extra energy required to drag heavy clubs around a golf course. In fact, golfing burned more than twice as many calories as the walking activities. Because the study was small, a larger, longer-term study would be needed to confirm the results.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-you-be-tested-for-sleep-apnea,Should you be tested for sleep apnea?,1,"Getting a good night's sleep on a regular basis is essential for cardiovascular health. That means everyone — especially people with heart problems — should address any issues that keep them from getting at least seven hours of restorative sleep every night. One common problem is obstructive sleep apnea, a condition marked by brief pauses in breathing, often triggering loud snoring, grunts, gasps, and choking noises. These repeated breathing disruptions cause your heart rate and blood pressure to rise, putting stress on your heart and circulation. ""Somewhere between 40% and 80% of people with cardiovascular disease may have sleep apnea,"" says Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Yet sleep apnea frequently goes undetected and untreated. Why? Often, people don't realize they are periodically gasping for air throughout the night unless a bed partner or family member notices. In addition, many people with sleep apnea (particularly those who have cardiovascular disease) don't report excessive daytime sleepiness, one of the most common symptoms of the disorder, says Dr. Javaheri. ""Some people are so accustomed to sleep deprivation that they don't realize they're sleepy,"" she says. Causes, risks, and other symptoms Sleep apnea occurs when tissue in the tongue or throat temporarily narrows or blocks the airway during sleep, sometimes as many as 100 times an hour. While people of all ages and sizes can develop sleep apnea, it's most common in older people and those who are overweight or obese, as well as people with heart problems, hard-to-control blood pressure, and diabetes. One way that doctors assess the likelihood of sleep apnea is with the STOPBANG questionnaire (see box). Other symptoms that may be caused by sleep apnea include nighttime restlessness; trouble with concentration or memory; mood changes; morning headaches; vivid, strange, or threatening dreams; and nighttime waking to urinate. Test yourself for sleep apnea with STOP-BANG A ""yes"" answer to three or more of these questions suggests possible sleep apnea. Ask your doctor if you should have a sleep study. S Snore: Have you been told that you snore? T Tired: Do you often feel tired during the day? O Obstruction: Do you know if you briefly stop breathing while asleep, or has anyone witnessed you do this? P Pressure: Do you have high blood pressure or take medication for high blood pressure? B Body mass index (BMI): Is your BMI 30 or above? (For a calculator, see /bmi.) A Age: Are you 50 or older? N Neck: Is your neck circumference more than 16 inches (women) or 17 inches (men)? G Gender: Are you male? Diagnosing sleep apnea If you think you might have sleep apnea, check with your doctor about an evaluation. If possible, start with a sleep specialist (or ask for a referral to one), as these experts are often better able to navigate insurance issues and recommend appropriate, timely testing and treatment. In the past, diagnosing sleep apnea always required an over-night stay in a sleep lab. Today, home-based tests (which are more convenient and less expensive) are the norm. They're recommended for people whose symptoms suggest they have moderate to severe sleep apnea and who have no other significant medical problems. For a home sleep study, you'll get a small, lightweight monitor; a belt you slip around your midsection; a small finger clip; and a sensor to place under your nose. These devices measure your oxygen saturation (the amount of oxygen in your blood), heart rate, and airflow, as well as the movements of your chest and abdomen and your position while you sleep. If you need to use the bathroom, you just take the equipment with you. Treating sleep apnea Lifestyle changes that can improve sleep apnea include losing weight if needed avoiding alcohol within three hours of bedtime not taking medications that relax your muscles in the evening treating nasal congestion with medications or home remedies sleeping on your side or elevating your head. People with moderate to severe apnea often need positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, which uses a small machine to deliver pressurized air through a mask covering your nose (and sometimes your mouth) to keep your airway open as you sleep. Even people with mild sleep apnea who feel sleepy during the day may benefit from PAP, which can help people feel more alert and rested and may also improve their mood and quality of life, says Dr. Javaheri.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/yoga-a-flexible-way-to-enhance-heart-health,Yoga: A flexible way to enhance heart health,1,"We tend to think of exercise as movement that either raises your heart rate (aerobic exercise) or builds muscles (strength training). But two other factors — flexibility and balance — are also important for a well-rounded fitness program, especially for older adults. A yoga practice has the potential to target all four factors at the same time. What's more, a recent study suggests that yoga has modest yet positive effects on several factors linked to cardiovascular health (see ""How yoga may help your heart""). ""The reason behind these benefits isn't entirely clear, but we believe that multiple, simultaneous mechanisms are probably at play,"" says Dr. Darshan Mehta, medical director of the Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. Yoga is more than simply stretching and moving into poses — it weaves together three interconnected threads: physical postures, controlled breathing, and meditation. Together, they help cultivate the relaxation response, which trains your body to be less reactive during times of stress. How yoga may help your heart To explore how yoga may affect cardiovascular health, a team of researchers pooled data from studies of yoga done over the past few decades. Their findings, reported in the May 2023 Current Problems in Cardiology, are summarized below. When: The analysis combined results from 64 randomized controlled trials of yoga published from 1989 to 2022. Most were done in Southeast Asia. Who: The analysis included nearly 17,000 people in all, roughly half of whom performed yoga. Those in control groups did other types of gentle exercise, stretching, or no exercise. Their average age was 56. Key findings: Compared with those in control groups, people who did yoga had systolic blood pressure values (the first number in a reading) that were 4.5 points lower and levels of harmful LDL cholesterol that were 7.6 points lower, on average. Yoga was also linked to slightly lower HbA1c levels (a measure of average blood sugar over the past few months) and a small drop in body mass index. How yoga helps The relaxation response not only slows the heart rate and lowers blood pressure, it may also tamp down inflammation and promote favorable changes in blood vessel function that protect the heart. As a mind-body practice, yoga encourages people to slow down and be more mindful about heart-healthy behaviors, such as eating well and getting enough sleep, says Dr. Mehta. Those habits — along with positive emotions that some forms of yoga aim to inspire, such as compassion and gratitude — may also help foster cardiovascular health. Finding your fit Think you can't do yoga because you aren't flexible? ""By practicing yoga, you become more flexible — that's another reason to do it,"" says clinical social worker and yoga teacher Laura Malloy, director of yoga programs at the Benson-Henry Institute. If you're new to yoga, seek out a beginner or ""gentle"" class, especially if you're over 65 or have any medical conditions. Several forms are well suited to beginners, such as Hatha yoga, which features gentle, smooth movements that are integrated with your breathing. Iyengar is similar but places more emphasis on body alignment and balance and uses props such as straps, blankets, and blocks. Yin yoga, which is done mostly sitting or lying down, encourages people to go deeper into poses by holding them longer. Another option is chair yoga, practiced sitting in a chair or standing using a chair for support. It's good for older people or anyone who feels less steady or has trouble getting up from the floor, says Malloy. Though gentle, chair yoga still provides results. ""After I teach a 20-minute chair yoga class, I've heard people say ""Wow, that made such a difference in how I feel!'"" says Malloy.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/winning-the-skin-game,Winning the skin game,1,"The saying goes that the past always comes back to haunt you. Nowhere is this more apparent than with your skin. ""As you get older, the sun damage to your face and neck you experienced when you were younger shows up as dry skin, wrinkles, and age spots,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, a dermatologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. While much of this sun damage occurred in the past, you can take steps now to reverse some of it. ""Adopting a daily skin care routine is the best way to treat existing skin problems, maintain healthy skin, and protect against future harm,"" says Dr. Waldman. You don't need to follow an elaborate process. Keep it simple, and focus on three steps: wash, moisturize, and apply sunscreen. Then do it every day. Step 1: Wash Wash your face and neck twice a day — when you wake up and before bedtime. (You can do this once daily if your skin tends to be dry, and preferably in the evening so you sleep with clean skin.) ""Avoid using regular bar soap,"" says Dr. Waldman. ""It strips the skin of its outer layer and makes it harder to keep in moisture, which can lead to dry skin."" Instead, choose an over-the-counter product labeled as a gentle cleanser for sensitive skin. Avoid products that contain sulfates or are labeled ""foaming,"" as they can be drying. Also, don't use facial scrubs with small particles, which can irritate the skin. Massage a pea-sized amount of the cleanser onto your damp face and neck for about 20 seconds, or the amount of time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice, and then rinse with warm water. ""If you don't have oily skin, washing only with warm water also can work,"" says Dr. Waldman. Give your skin an A — and maybe a B Another way to help restore aging skin is to use a lotion or cream that contains a retinoid, a compound derived from vitamin A. Retinoids increase collagen (the most abundant protein in the body) and help strengthen skin and restore elasticity. ""Regular application can improve the appearance of wrinkles, sun spots, and overall skin texture,"" says dermatologist Dr. Abigail Waldman with Brigham and Women's Hospital. Choose over-the-counter anti-aging creams or lotions with retinol as the active ingredient, or get a prescription for a stronger retinoid from your doctor. Take it slow, as these products can irritate the skin if overused. Dr. Waldman suggests an every-three-day routine at first. Use a pea-sized amount over your entire face before bedtime. Retinoids make skin sensitive to light, so don't use them during the daytime. ""Monitor how your skin reacts, and look for redness, significant peeling, or irritation,"" says Dr. Waldman. ""As your skin builds tolerance, increase applications to every night."" Oral nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3, has protective effects against ultraviolet damage caused by sun exposure. Research has shown it can lower the risks of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma — the two most common skin cancers — in people vulnerable to skin cancer. Speak with your doctor or dermatologist about whether you are a candidate. Step 2: Moisturize After washing, while your skin is still damp, apply a moisturizing lotion or cream. (People with oily skin can skip this step.) ""Moisturizing recreates the skin's outer barrier to prevent moisture from escaping and to stop foreign substances from getting in,"" says Dr. Waldman. Use a dollop for your entire face and another for your neck, and massage in until fully absorbed. Choose a lotion or cream that contains fewer than 10 ingredients or is labeled for sensitive skin. ""Fewer ingredients mean fewer chemicals or additives, especially fragrances that could irritate skin,"" says Dr. Waldman. Key ingredients to look for include hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, glycolic acid, and squalene, which help keep skin hydrated. Vitamin C and azelaic acid can help lighten dark spots. Step 3: Apply sunscreen Finally, apply sunscreen to your face, especially under the eyes, as well as your entire neck and ears. ""Sunscreen not only guards against skin cancer and the aging effects from sun exposure but also helps to prevent brown spots and to keep existing ones from worsening,"" says Dr. Waldman. Use sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Avoid spray sunscreens, which contain alcohol that can burn. For efficiency, a combination moisturizing and sunscreen product also works well. ""The best sunscreen is the one you enjoy wearing, so experiment until you find one that has a pleasant smell and texture and is easy to apply,"" says Dr. Waldman. When you're outside for an extended period, make sure to reapply your sunscreen every two hours. Image: © PeopleImages/Getty Images",0,0.12746595,-0.046003804,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/6-natural-ways-to-lower-blood-pressure,6 natural ways to lower blood pressure,1,"Taking medication to lower high blood pressure is a proven way to reduce your risk for heart disease. But adopting lifestyle changes may let you maintain healthy readings and perhaps even avoid drug therapy. ""Unless a person's blood pressure is very high, medication most often does not start immediately,"" says Dr. Howard LeWine, editor in chief of Harvard Men's Health Watch. ""For people with elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension, the first order of business is to get serious about modifying their lifestyle."" By the numbers Normal blood pressure is defined as a reading of less than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Elevated pressure means systolic blood pressure (the first number in a reading) is 120 to 129 mm Hg with a diastolic pressure (the second number) of less than 80 mm Hg. People who have consistent readings of 130 to 139 for systolic pressure or 80 to 89 for diastolic pressure are said to have high blood pressure (stage 1 hypertension). ""But your target numbers may differ based on your health and individual goals, as determined in consultation with your doctor,"" says Dr. LeWine. Healthy lifestyle habits are the cornerstone of managing blood pressure, whether or not you require medication. A lifestyle approach to management also helps people feel more in control of their health. ""Understandable, sometimes people are reluctant to start a drug because they don't want to be dependent on medication,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""And this resistance can provide extra motivation for making the necessary changes."" Still, don't be discouraged if your doctor wants you to begin taking a low dose of medication. Once you reach your blood pressure goals, maintaining a healthy lifestyle may mean you can take a drug holiday (with your doctor's approval). ""And even if you still need medication, your healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent dose increases or additional blood pressure drugs,"" says Dr. LeWine. The big six Six lifestyle changes have the most significant influence on blood pressure, according to Dr. LeWine. They include the foundation for healthy living — diet, exercise, and weight control — as well as limiting sodium and alcohol and managing stress. ""While all of these are important, don't try to change them all at once,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""In consultation with your doctor, you first want to concentrate on the one or two most important modifications, based on what's likely to have the greatest impact."" Diet. While most experts advocate plant-based diets to help lower blood pressure numbers, a recent study found that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may have the most significant impact. The researchers found that adopting the DASH diet could prevent an estimated 15,000 annual heart attacks and strokes among men with high blood pressure. DASH emphasizes fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, nuts, seeds, and grains and limits consumption of red meat, sodium, and sugar-sweetened foods and drinks. Exercise. Guidelines call for a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. A reasonable starting goal is 20 to 30 minutes every other day. Any kind of exercise is always better than nothing. But if you need motivation, join a walking club or sports league (like golf, bowling, basketball, or pickleball), hire a personal trainer, or sign up for fitness classes at a gym or community center. You can also increase your daily movements, like walking for five minutes every hour, doing two sets of five to 10 push-ups on the floor or against the kitchen counter, or 20 minutes of yoga or stretching. Weight. While it's natural for men's weight to increase somewhat with age, even five to 10 pounds over their ideal number can raise blood pressure. ""In fact, for overweight men, every pound lost could lower systolic blood pressure by up to 1 mm Hg,"" says Dr. LeWine. Your doctor can determine your target weight for your age and body type. Investing in a healthy diet and increasing exercise can help reduce weight. Sodium. ""People with high blood pressure sometimes have a significant improvement by avoiding sodium,"" says Dr. LeWine. Processed foods account for much of the sodium that people consume. These include foods like canned vegetables and soups, frozen dinners, lunch meats, instant and ready-to-eat cereals, salty chips, and other packaged snacks. Cut back on these items, or select low-sodium options. Alcohol. Drinking more than moderate amounts of alcohol can raise blood pressure. Guidelines says men should consume no more than two standard drinks per day, with a single drink defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits. However, cutting back on alcohol as much as possible is ideal. Stress. Reducing stress is also a priority. Stress can lead to chronic inflammation that damages artery walls, making them less elastic. In addition, ongoing stress can trigger the adrenal glands to release hormones that raise blood pressure. ""Uncontrolled stress often manifests as poor sleep, overeating, and physical inactivity,"" says Dr. LeWine. To manage stress, practice relaxation breathing and meditation, or perhaps just set aside time every day to do whatever you wish, even if it's nothing at all.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sleep-apnea-may-lead-to-weaker-bones-and-teeth,Sleep apnea may lead to weaker bones and teeth,1,"People with sleep apnea — meaning they briefly and repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping — are more likely to have low bone density, a small new analysis suggests. The study, published online Nov. 11, 2022, by The Journal of Craniomandibular and Sleep Practice, used a type of imaging called cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to measure bone density in the head and neck of 38 adults undergoing orthodontic treatment, half of whom had sleep apnea. The researchers found that participants with apnea had significantly lower bone density in the head and neck than those who didn't have the condition. Sleep apnea can trigger low oxygen levels and inflammation in the body, which may interfere with the continual cycle of bone breakdown and renewal, researchers said. This could ultimately lower bone density levels, increasing the risk of broken bones and causing teeth to become loose. Screening tests for bone density are an important part of routine care for many people, including all women 65 and older. Image: Somsak Bumroongwong/EyeEm/Getty Images",5,0.2344094,-0.018096194,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-humble-gallbladder,The humble gallbladder,1,"In the hierarchy of digestive organs, you might first list the stomach, liver, or colon. But there's a pear-shaped sac tucked under your liver that barely gets a second thought: the lowly gallbladder. This small but mighty organ plays an important role in helping us digest food, but we often don't acknowledge it unless something goes wrong — which happens in about 15% of American adults, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Yet gallbladder disease — which includes stones, inflammation, infection, or blockage — can lead to excruciating pain or even life-threatening complications down the line. The gallbladder essentially serves as a storage room for bile, squeezing the fluid into the small intestine to help digest the fats we consume. It makes sense, then, that the organ might struggle when our diet is heavy in fatty or fried foods. We can live without a gallbladder, but it can't stay in peak performance mode without diligent care, says Dr. William Brugge, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""I think people generally try to ignore their gallbladder,"" Dr. Brugge says. ""It doesn't have as squeamish a reputation as the colon or rectum, but it's down there on the list."" Tactics to promote gallbladder health Keeping your gallbladder healthy involves a similar approach to keeping the rest of your body in optimal shape. These familiar suggestions include: Eat more fruits and vegetables. They're rich in nutrients such as vitamin C, folic acid, and magnesium, which may lower the risk of gallbladder disease. Fiber-filled fruits and vegetables also don't strain the gallbladder, since they contain little or no fat. Favor lean proteins. Opting for poultry, lean meat, and fish dishes that are baked or broiled — not fried — can lower your gallstone risk. Limit or avoid full-fat dairy products and red or processed meats. Maintain a healthy weight. Overweight or obesity can make you prone to gallstones. Risk factors Aside from a high-fat diet, other risk factors for gallbladder disease include overweight or obesity, a family history of gallbladder issues, Native American or Latino heritage, and being 40 or older. Women are twice as likely as men to develop gallstones, which top the list of gallbladder problems. Extra estrogen, particularly during pregnancy, slows the gallbladder's ability to empty, letting bile pool, Dr. Brugge says. Gallstones develop when bile or related fluids form hardened stonelike lumps that can grow and multiply. Attacks of agonizing pain result when gallstones get larger or block bile ducts. Other symptoms include pain between the shoulder blades, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, bloating, indigestion, and sweating. About a quarter of people diagnosed with gallstones each year need treatment, which is usually surgery. ""After eating a particularly heavy or fatty meal, you may have severe pain — far more than gas or cramps — that might last for an hour or two,"" Dr. Brugge says. Serious complications Because bile ducts connect the gallbladder to other digestive organs, these surrounding structures can also suffer complications from gallbladder disease. Problems include cholangitis (bile duct inflammation), cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), and pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). But the most dangerous complication, Dr. Brugge says, is gallbladder inflammation called cholecystitis. It results from a gallstone getting stuck in the gallbladder, which becomes infected and causes searing pain. ""It's a pretty dramatic illness,"" he says. ""The gallbladder can rupture or leak infected bile, and the infection can spread through the body. It can be fatal."" New evidence suggests gallstones may also raise the risk of developing cancers of the liver, bile duct, and pancreas. A study published online June 17, 2022, by the British Journal of Cancer tracked more than 115,000 women and nearly 50,000 men for up to 30 years, asking about their history of gallstones at the study's start and every other year afterward. Compared with people without gallstones, those who got them were 60% more likely to develop liver cancer, more than four times as likely to develop bile duct cancer, and 13% more likely to develop pancreatic cancer. Gallbladder cancer itself is relatively rare, diagnosed in about 12,200 Americans each year. ""It's very deadly, but not very common,"" Dr. Brugge says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/supplements-for-three-common-conditions,Supplements for three common conditions,1,"Certain herbs, vitamins, minerals, and other compounds may help control cholesterol, blood pressure, and anxiety. High cholesterol, high blood pressure, and anxiety are three common conditions that are often treated with medication. But sometimes people can't tolerate those drugs or are reluctant to use them. In these instances, dietary supplements may be an option. Studies have shown that some herbs, vitamins, minerals, and other substances, alone or in combination with traditional treatments, may be effective in treating these conditions, and are largely safe to use — provided your doctor approves. High cholesterol Vitamin D3. If you cannot tolerate a statin medication and have a low vitamin D level, a vitamin D3 supplement could help. After taking the supplement, some people are then able to tolerate statins when they couldn't in the past. Phytosterols. Phytosterols (also called plant stanols or sterols) are derived from the cell membranes of plants and can be taken in pill form. They are also found naturally in foods such as nuts, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Studies show that phytosterol supplements can lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by up to 14% in people taking 2,000 to 3,000 milligrams (mg) a day. When choosing a product, look for a quality seal (see ""Worried about supplement safety? Here's what you should consider""), and also look for a product that contains phytosterol esters. Red yeast rice. Red yeast rice supplements are made from a type of yeast that is grown on white rice. Red yeast rice has long been used in Chinese medicine. But a recent study comparing red yeast rice to a low dose statin found the statin was much more effective at lowering LDL cholesterol levels. If you still decide to use it, look for a high-quality product, because red yeast rice can contain a dangerous contaminant, citrinin, which is a toxin produced by fungus that can cause food poisoning, kidney damage, and immune system problems. Worried about supplement safety? Here's what you should consider While some supplements are potentially helpful (or at least harmless), a lack of regulatory oversight of these products means that others might be ineffective or dangerous, or might contain hazardous contaminants. Identifying the safe choices requires a little detective work. Before taking a supplement, always talk to your doctor to make sure that it's safe for any medical conditions you may have and that it won't interact with any medications you are taking. Although supplement makers must follow FDA rules for good manufacturing practices, the agency does not require testing the estimated 9,000 products on the market to make sure they do contain the ingredients they claim, and don't contain contaminants, such as dangerous bacteria, arsenic, cadmium, or lead. This means there is no guarantee that any particular product is effective or safe. To add a degree of protection, look for products that have voluntarily gone through quality testing, which is certified by a seal on the packaging. Some good ones to look for are those from U.S. Pharmacopeia, ConsumerLab.com, and NSF International. High blood pressure Magnesium citrate or glycinate. Some people are deficient in the mineral magnesium. But blood tests aren't good at detecting total magnesium levels inside the body, because much of your body's magnesium is stored within cells. Many people find the deficiency only after a nutritionist analyzes their diet. In those individuals, supplements can boost magnesium levels and help reduce high blood pressure when taken along with traditional blood pressure treatments. It typically takes up to six weeks for the supplements to show an effect. However, not everyone should take magnesium, particularly those with kidney disease, so be certain to consult with your doctor before taking it. Lycopene. An antioxidant supplement that may also help reduce high blood pressure is lycopene, which gives vegetables like tomatoes their red hue. While tomato-based products, including canned sauces, contain lycopene, those foods often have a lot of sodium. So, it's better in many instances to opt for a supplement. Look for one that also contains tomato extract for an added benefit. Typically, people need to take 15 to 25 mg of lycopene daily to see a reduction in blood pressure. Anxiety Chamomile extract. This extract, which comes from a flower, has long been used as a therapy for anxiety. Anxiety often goes hand in hand with sleeplessness, so it's no surprise that chamomile is also often recommended as a sleep aid. Many people drink chamomile tea, but taking a supplement may be more convenient (and require fewer late-night trips to the bathroom if taken before bed).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-running-cause-arthritis-202304262930,Does running cause arthritis?,1,"When I took up running in college, a friend of mine scoffed at the idea. He hated running and was convinced runners were ""wearing out"" their joints. He liked to say he was saving his knees for his old age. So, was he onto something? Does running really ruin your joints, as many people believe? Runners can get arthritis, but is running the cause? You may think the answer is obvious. Surely, years of running (pounding pavements, or even softer surfaces) could wear out your joints, much like tires wear out after you put enough miles on them. And osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, usually affects older adults. In fact, it's often described as age-related and degenerative. That sounds like a wear-and-tear sort of situation, right? Maybe not. Sure, it's easy to blame running when a person who runs regularly develops arthritis. But that blame may be misguided. The questions to ask are: Does running damage the joints and lead to arthritis? Does arthritis develop first and become more noticeable while running? Is the connection more complicated? Perhaps there's no connection between running and arthritis for most people. But maybe those destined to develop arthritis (due to their genes, for example) get it sooner if they take up running. Extensive research over the last several decades has investigated these questions. While the answers are still not entirely clear, we're moving closer. What is the relationship between running and arthritis? Mounting evidence suggests that that running does not cause osteoarthritis, or any other joint disease. A study published in 2017 found that recreational runners had lower rates of hip and knee osteoarthritis (3.5%) compared with competitive runners (13.3%) and nonrunners (10.2%). According to a 2018 study, the rate of hip or knee arthritis among 675 marathon runners was half the rate expected within the US population. A 2022 analysis of 24 studies found no evidence of significant harm to the cartilage lining the knee joints on MRIs taken just after running. These are just a few of the published medical studies on the subject. Overall, research suggests that running is an unlikely cause of arthritis — and might even be protective. Why is it hard to study running and arthritis? Osteoarthritis takes many years to develop. Convincing research would require a long time, perhaps a decade or more. It's impossible to perform an ideal study. The most powerful type of research study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Participants in these studies are assigned to a treatment group (perhaps taking a new drug) or a control group (often taking a placebo). Double-blind means neither researchers nor participants know which people are in the treatment group and which people are getting a placebo. When the treatment being studied is running, there's no way to conduct this kind of trial. Beware the confounders. A confounder is a factor or variable you can't account for in a study. There may be important differences between people who run and those who don't that have nothing to do with running. For example, runners may follow a healthier diet, maintain a healthier weight, or smoke less than nonrunners. They may differ with respect to how their joints are aligned, the strength of their ligaments, or genes that direct development of the musculoskeletal system. These factors could affect the risk of arthritis and make study results hard to interpret clearly. In fact, they may explain why some studies find that running is protective. The effect of running may vary between people. For example, it's possible, though not proven, that people with obesity who run regularly are at increased risk of arthritis due to the stress of excess weight on the joints. The bottom line Trends in recent research suggest that running does not wear out your joints. That should be reassuring for those of us who enjoy running. And if you don't like to run, that's fine: try to find forms of exercise that you enjoy more. Just don't base your decision — or excuse — for not running on the idea that it will ruin your joints.",0,0.29563656,-0.0911229,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/quick-start-guide-to-an-antiinflammation-diet,Quick-start guide to an anti‑inflammation diet,1,"There are no complicated rules to follow. Just be mindful of general dos and don'ts. Chronic inflammation — a state of persistent activation of the immune system — is an important part of many diseases, and diet is a big contributor to inflammation. It would make sense, then, to follow what's becoming known as the ""anti-inflammation diet."" Just one problem: ""There isn't 'one' diet, although many people love to throw that term around. The diet in general is almost as much about what you don't eat as what you do eat,"" says Eric Rimm, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. For a quick start, let's boil it down to some dos and don'ts. Don't eat these Stay away from ""ultra-processed"" foods, which include just about anything that comes in a package — like microwaveable dinners, hot dogs, chicken nuggets, dehydrated soups, baked goods, sugary cereals, processed meats, biscuits, and sauces. These foods have little nutritional value. Worse, they're high in salt, added sugars (which can spike your blood sugar), and saturated fat (which can increase your ""bad"" LDL cholesterol). All of these ingredients are associated with promoting inflammation in the body. ""The biggest offender is anything with added sweeteners, whether that means cane sugar or any compounds used to add sweetness,"" Rimm says. A report published in December 2019 in Nature Medicine notes that sugars, grains, and extra salt in ultra-processed foods can change the bacteria in your gut, damage the gut's lining, and switch on inflammatory genes in cells. Other studies have linked ultra-processed foods to shorter life spans, cancer, heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes. Inflammation-promoting foods include white breads, cereals, white pasta, and other products made with refined flours, as well as white rice. ""White flour leads directly to a pro-inflammatory state,"" Rimm says. Other offenders include soda, juices, cookies and other baked goods, butter, cheese, ice cream, coconut products, candy, salad dressings, jarred tomato sauces, and processed and cured meats. Do eat these To fight inflammation, go for whole, unprocessed foods with no added sugar: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (beans, lentils), fish, poultry, nuts, seeds, a little bit of low-fat dairy, and olive oil. ""To these, many people add herbs and spices like cinnamon, ginger, and turmeric. There are a few studies that suggest modest benefits,"" Rimm says. How do they help? ""It's believed that antioxidants in brightly colored fruits and vegetables [cooked tomatoes, carrots, squash, and broccoli] may lessen the effect of free radicals, which damage cells,"" says Liz Moore, a registered dietitian at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Other food components that may help fight inflammation include fiber found in fruits, vegetables, and especially legumes and whole grains such as barley, oats, and bran omega-3 fatty acids found in fish (such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna), vegetable oils (flaxseed and canola), walnuts, flaxseeds, and leafy green vegetables (spinach and kale) polyphenols (plant chemicals) found in berries, dark chocolate, tea, apples, citrus, onions, soybeans, and coffee unsaturated fats found in almonds, pecans, walnuts, flaxseeds, pumpkin and sesame seeds, and plant oils (olive, peanut, canola). The evidence that trying to minimize inflammation through dietary changes reduces the risk of diseases ""is strongest for arthritis, gastrointestinal and heart health, and possibly auto­immune diseases,"" Moore says. Making the shift Don't try to suddenly switch to a new eating style. ""Start by slowly making changes so that these become more of a lifestyle shift rather than 'going on a diet,'"" Moore says. ""Try to eat fewer foods that come from packages and more that come from the ground."" Apply that approach to each meal. For breakfast, you might have a fruit smoothie or oatmeal with a few berries; for lunch, a salad of dark leafy greens with colorful vegetables topped with beans, nuts, and seeds; for dinner, a lean protein and more colorful vegetables, with fruit for dessert. The more color and variety you add to a meal, the more natural inflammation-fighting compounds you'll consume. If you're more comfortable following a particular diet plan, consider a Mediterranean diet or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet; they follow lots of the dos and don'ts we've outlined.

The reasons given have nothing to do with the health issues linked to the shot. Instead, scientists are claiming that newer versions of the jab targeting the latest ""strains"" and ""variants"" are now so widely available that AstraZeneca's injection is obsolete. Back in March, AstraZeneca voluntarily pulled its COVID injection from the entire European Union (EU) market. Now, a couple months later, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has officially unauthorized the shot's continued use. AstraZeneca says demand for its COVID injection has plummeted – not because much of the world realizes that COVID and Operation Warp Speed were a fraud, mind you, but because of the supposed ""newer options"" of the jab that are now widely available. Like the other Big Pharma companies that hawked COVID injections on the masses, AstraZeneca is taking credit for the alleged ""millions of lives saved"" by its injections, which were included among the more than three billion COVID jabs administered throughout the ""pandemic."" (Related: Did you know that the leading cause of death in America today is pharmaceuticals ?) AstraZeneca's rebranding scheme failed to drum up new sales It should be noted that at one point AstraZeneca attempted to rebrand its shot under a new name, changing it from CoviShield to Vaxzevria in an attempt to garner more business. The company also tried to persuade more people that the shot was ""safe and effective,"" an effort that also failed. Human knowledge is under attack!

After eight European countries decided to pull the AstraZeneca shot due to safety concerns such as serious blood clots, the EU held an Emergency Vaccine Summit to decide how to proceed. It was around the time of this meeting that Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), a nerve disorder, was officially labeled as a side effect of CoviShield / Vaxzevria. Here in the United States, federal health officials were also probing AstraZeneca for providing ""outdated information"" about its shots with package inserts, including misleading data claiming that the shot is highly effective at stopping COVID. ""According to independent estimates, over 6.5 million lives were saved in the first year of use alone and over 3bn doses were supplied globally,"" reads a statement from AstraZeneca about its jab. ""Our efforts have been recognised by governments around the world and are widely regarded as being a critical component of ending the global pandemic. We will now work with regulators and our partners to align on a clear path forward to conclude this chapter and significant contribution to the Covid-19 pandemic."" China also got involved by ordering the arrest of AstraZeneca officials for their involvement in fraud. Though the company reportedly took disciplinary action against the employees involved, China went a step further by seeking criminal charges. As for the mRNA (modRNA) COVID injection produced by Pfizer and BioNTech, it was recently reported that a young boy participating in a new company gene therapy trial died from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) after taking a new experimental gene therapy manufactured by the company. That trial, called Daylight, aimed to investigate the effects of the new drug, called fordadistrogene movaparvovec, on young boys between two and three years of age. In a statement about AstraZeneca's now-deleted COVID jab, Prof. Catherine Bennett, chair of epidemiology at Deakin University , had this to say in praise of the defunct shot: ""It has saved millions of lives and that should not be forgotten.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/11-foods-that-can-help-lower-your-cholesterol,11 foods that can help lower your cholesterol,1,"Focus on fiber-rich foods and avoid saturated fats. If your cholesterol level has crept up over the years, you may wonder whether changing your diet can help. Ideally, your total cholesterol value should be 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or lower. But it's the harmful LDL cholesterol value that experts worry about the most. Excess LDL builds up on artery walls and triggers a release of inflammatory substances that boost heart attack risk. ""To prevent heart disease, your LDL should be 100 mg/dL or lower,"" says Dr. Jorge Plutzky, director of preventive cardiology at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. But many Americans have LDL values that are less than optimal (100 to 129 mg/dL) or borderline high (130 to 159 mg/dL). If you fall into either of those categories, you may be able to nudge down your LDL to a healthier level by changing what you eat, particularly if your current diet could use some improvement. However, most people with higher LDL values likely will also need to take a cholesterol-lowering drug, such as a statin, says Dr. Plutzky. Dietary directives Avoiding foods that are high in cholesterol isn't the best way to lower your LDL. Your overall diet — especially the types of fats and carbohydrates you eat — has the most impact on your blood cholesterol values. ""As the American Heart Association has noted, you'll get the biggest bang for your buck by lowering saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fat,"" says registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Brigham and Women's Hospital. That means avoiding meat, cheese, and other high-fat dairy products such as butter, half-and-half, and ice cream. Equally important is replacing those calories with healthy, unsaturated fats (such as those found in vegetable oils, avocados, and fatty fish) rather than refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta, and white rice. Unlike healthy fats, these starchy foods aren't very filling, and they can trigger overeating and weight gain. The other big problem with refined carbs? They're woefully low in fiber, which helps flush cholesterol out of the body (see ""The fiber factor""). The fiber factor Your body can't break down fiber, so it passes through your body undigested. It comes in two varieties: insoluble and soluble. Fiber‑containing foods usually feature a mix of the two. Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water. While it doesn't directly lower LDL, this form of fiber fills you up, crowding other cholesterol-raising foods out of your diet and helping to promote weight loss. Soluble fiber dissolves in water, creating a gel. This gel traps some of the cholesterol in your body, so it's eliminated as waste instead of entering your arteries. Soluble fiber also binds to bile acids, which carry fats from your small intestine into the large intestine for excretion. This triggers your liver to create more bile acids — a process that requires cholesterol. If the liver doesn't have enough cholesterol, it draws more from the bloodstream, which in turn lowers your circulating LDL. Finally, certain soluble fibers (called oligosaccharides) are fermented into short-chain fatty acids in the gut. These fatty acids may also inhibit cholesterol production. The ""best"" foods The following 11 foods are good sources of fiber or unsaturated fat (or both). But they're not in any particular order and are simply suggestions. Most whole grains, vegetables, and fruits are good sources of fiber. And most nuts and seeds (and the oils made from them) provide monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats. 1. Oatmeal. This whole grain is one of the best sources of soluble fiber, along with barley (see ""Grain of the month,"" at right). Start your day with a bowl of steel-cut or old-fashioned rolled oats, topped with fresh or dried fruit for a little extra fiber. 2. White beans. Also called navy beans, this variety ranks highest in fiber content. Try different types of beans as well, such as black beans, garbanzos, or kidney beans, which you can add to salads, soups, or chili. But avoid prepared baked beans, which are canned in sauce that's loaded with added sugar. 3. Avocado. The creamy, green flesh of an avocado is not only rich in monounsaturated fat, it also contains both soluble and insoluble fiber. Enjoy this fruit sliced in salad, pureed into dip, or mashed and spread on a slice of whole-grain toast. 4. Eggplant. Although not everyone's favorite, these deep purple vegetables are one of the richest sources of soluble fiber. One idea: oven-roast or grill whole eggplants until soft and use the flesh in a Middle Eastern dip called baba ghanoush. 5. Carrots. Raw baby carrots are a tasty and convenient snack — and they also give you a decent dose of insoluble fiber. 6. Almonds. Among nuts, almonds are highest in fiber, although other popular varieties such as pistachios and pecans are close behind. Walnuts have the added advantage of being a good source of polyunsaturated, plant-based omega-3 fatty acids. 7. Kiwi fruit. Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to peel these fuzzy, brown fruits. But to avoid the skin, slice one in half and scoop out the inside with a spoon for an easy, fiber-rich, sweet snack. 8. Berries. Because these fruits are packed with tiny seeds, their fiber content is higher than most other fruits. Raspberries and blackberries provide the most, but strawberries and blueberries are also good sources. 9. Cauliflower. This cruciferous veggie not only provides fiber, it can also serve as a substitute for white rice. Just shred or whirl in a food processor until it resembles rice, then sauté with a little olive oil until tender. 10. Soy. Eating soybeans and foods made from them, such as soy milk, tofu, and tempeh, was once touted as a powerful way to lower cholesterol. More recent analyses showed the effect is modest, at best. Still, protein-rich, soy-based foods are a far healthier choice than a hamburger or other red meat. 11. Salmon. Likewise, eating cold-water fish such as salmon twice a week can lower LDL by replacing meat and delivering healthy omega-3 fats. Other good fish options include chunk light canned tuna and tinned sardines. Image: © marilyna/Getty Images",3,0.3845664,0.20667095,True

That means an eating style that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans, along with only modest or small amounts of meat, dairy, eggs, and sweets,"" says Dr. Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The reality is that eating more whole or minimally processed, plant-based foods will naturally lower your intake of fat, especially saturated fat. Found mainly in meat and dairy products, saturated fat can boost levels of harmful LDL cholesterol, a key contributor to heart disease. But simply cutting back on all types of fat does not necessarily translate into a diet that lowers cardiovascular risk. Low-fat diet fails Starting in the 1980s, when food manufacturers and consumers cut the fat from their products and diets, they replaced it with refined carbohydrates. People filled up on bread, pasta, low-fat chips and cookies, and low-fat sweetened yogurt. Eating lots of these highly processed carbohydrates floods your bloodstream with sugar, triggering a release of insulin to clear the sugar from your blood. But that can push your blood sugar too low, leaving you hungry again after just a few hours, which encourages overeating and weight gain. What's more, a steady diet of these unhealthy carbs can eventually impair your body's ability to respond to insulin, which can lead to diabetes. Both obesity and diabetes are closely linked to a heightened risk of heart disease. You might also be interested in...

Learn in our course about simple lifestyle changes you can make to optimize your cognitive fitness—and stay mentally sharp! Learn More! But eating too many refined carbs wasn't the only problem. Avoiding unsaturated fats — those found in nuts, seeds, olives, avocados, and fish — isn't necessary. Not only do these foods make your meals more satisfying and tasty, unsaturated fat promotes cardiovascular health. What about ultra-low-fat diets? Some physicians advocate an ultra-low-fat diet, which includes just 10% of calories from fat. This diet excludes all animal-based products (such as meat, poultry, dairy, and fish), as well as refined carbohydrates (including white flour, white sugar, and even fruit juice). But it also shuns some healthier unsaturated fats, including added oils and high-fat, plant-based foods such as avocados and nuts. Small studies have shown that this eating pattern may actually reverse the buildup of cholesterol-clogged plaque in the arteries. At least some of that benefit may stem from the abundant fiber and other nutrients in the diet's copious amounts of vegetables, beans, and whole grains, all of which are fairly scarce in the typical American diet. The only problem with an ultra-low-fat vegan diet is that it's very challenging for most people to stick to over the long term. ""If you are among the 1% of people who can, may the Force be with you,"" says Dr. Rimm. For everyone else, a Mediterranean-style diet offers the best of both worlds — a plant-centric diet that's not overly restrictive (see ""Simple steps to a Mediterranean-style eating plan""). ""The Mediterranean diet doesn't require extreme eating habits that make it difficult to socialize with other people,"" he says. What's more, he adds, it tastes good and has the best evidence from long-term clinical studies for lowering a person's risk of heart disease. Simple steps to a Mediterranean-style eating plan To ease into this eating style, look over these suggestions from registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Choose one, try it for a week, then gradually add more changes over time, she advises. Switch from whatever fats you use now to extra‑virgin olive oil. Start by using olive oil when cooking, including in salad dressings. Try swapping olive oil for butter on crusty bread. Have salad every day. Choose crisp, dark greens and whatever vegetables are in season. Go nuts. Instead of a bag of chips or cookies, have a handful of raw nuts as a healthy snack. Add more whole grains to your meals. Experiment with bulgur, barley, farro, brown rice, and whole-grain pasta. Select dense, chewy, country-style bread without added sugar or butter. Add a variety of vegetables to your menus. Add an extra serving of vegetables to both lunch and dinner, aiming for three to four servings a day. Try a new vegetable every week. Eat at least three servings of legumes a week. Options include lentils, chickpeas, pinto beans, and black beans. Eat less meat. Choose lean poultry in moderate, 3- to 4-ounce portions. Save red meat for occasional consumption or use meat as a condiment, accompanied by lots of vegetables, as in stews, stir-fries, and soups. Eat more fish, aiming for two servings a week. Both canned and fresh fish are fine. Cut out sugary beverages. Replace soda and juices with water. Eat fewer high-fat, high-sugar desserts. Fresh fruit or poached fruit is best. Aim for three servings of fresh fruit a day. Save cakes and pastries for special occasions. You might also be interested in...

https://naturalnews.com/2024-05-08-chris-cuomo-suddenly-becomes-anti-vaxxer.html,"Former CNN anchor Chris Cuomo suddenly becomes an anti-vaxxer, speaks up about his vaccine injury for the first time",0,"Former CNN news anchor Chris Cuomo has suddenly become an anti-vaxxer. On an episode of News Nation , Cuomo opened up about his vaccine injury while interviewing a nurse who was also seriously injured by the COVID-19 vaccines. This is the first time Cuomo has spoken publicly about his ongoing vaccine injury. On air, Cuomo referred to himself as being “sick” from the vaccine and is undergoing extensive blood work to find out what is wrong with him. This is a shocking confession, especially since he spent time on air marginalizing “antivaxxers” and feeding into the narrative that they do not deserve to live or have basic rights in society. Vaccine-pushing Chris Cuomo is suddenly talking about vaccine injury Cuomo interviewed Nurse Practitioner Sean Barcavage - who was featured in a recent NYT article about vaccine injuries . Cuomo's introduction: “We know that vaccines can have unintended consequences, aka side effects, but nobody’s really talking about it, because they’re too afraid of blame. They just want it to go away. But the problem is, people like Sean and me and millions of others who still have weird stuff with their blood work, and their lives and their feelings, physically, are not going away.” This is the same Chris Cuomo who pushed for lockdowns, bodily restrictions and vaccine mandates, while partaking in narratives that were used to manipulate and harm millions of people. His brother, former NY Governor Andrew Cuomo, was not only embroiled in sexual abuse allegations, but he also commandeered policies ( and attempted to coverup the consequences of those policies ) which ended up getting elderly people killed in nursing homes and leading to mass iatrogenic error in New York hospitals.

Just like he tried to cover for his brother Andrew on the sexual abuse allegations, (and was subsequently fired from CNN for doing so) Chris Cuomo also used his CNN propaganda slot to cover up the government’s unlawful vaccine mandate abuses, their horrendous censorship and all the other human rights abuses carried out in the name of “safety.” CNN has ignored millions of vaccine injuries that were the result of a global vaccination agenda that leveraged corporate media puppets like Cuomo to propagate bio-terror, to inflict human rights abuses and to enforce deadly experimentation with bioweapons disguised as vaccines. Chris Cuomo could interview more vaccine injured people Chris’s brother Andrew, the disgraced former governor of New York, propagated vaccine lies and was unchallenged in his wild assertion that the “unvaccinated” are somehow spreading infections and killing old people. “Maybe you go home and kiss your grandmother and wind-up killing your grandmother,” he said infamously, before launching a series of vaccine mandates and passports systems that segregated innocent people. His brother Chris Cuomo amplified the messages on CNN and stood by silently as people were harmed en masse. But now Chris Cuomo is opening up his eyes and admitting that COVID jab injuries are real. However, if he wants to be taken seriously on this issue, he could start by offering a formal apology for previously driving home narratives that caused mass vaccine injury and segregation, which cost people their lives and livelihoods. Instead, he will likely use the issue of vaccine injury to appear compassionate and garner sympathy, in a pitiful, last-ditch effort to save his reputation and rebuild trust with viewers. Watch the interview here . There are millions of people who suffered, died or continue to suffer from COVID-19 vaccine injuries. The NYT article that preceded this interview was disingenuous when the errant journalists referred to the “thousands” of people being injured by COVID-19 vaccines. Lawyers have had to sue to get the data on COVID-19 vaccine injuries from the government, and the data reveals that tens of millions have been injured -- not mere thousands. Worse, millions more people have been gaslighted by the media and the medical system about their vaccine injuries and the vaccine's relationship to “long COVID.” These vaccines, the unlawful mandates and the suppression of efficacious early treatment were a horrendous crime against humanity . Chris Cuomo's coverage of this issue better be just as aggressive and enduring as his lockdown and vaccine push was in 2020-2o21.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-foods-that-fight-high-cholesterol,5 foods that fight high cholesterol,1,"Your diet clearly plays a role in determining your cho­lesterol levels. In fact, changing what you eat can lower your cholesterol and improve the composition of the armada of fats floating through your bloodstream. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and ""good fats"" are all part of a heart-healthy diet. But some foods are particularly good at helping bring down cholesterol. How? Some cholesterol-lowering foods deliver a good dose of soluble fiber, which binds cholesterol and its precursors in the digestive system and drags them out of the body before they get into circulation. Others provide polyunsaturated fats, which directly lower LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol. And those with plant sterols and stanols keep the body from absorbing cholesterol. Here are five of those foods: Oats. An easy way to start lowering cholesterol is to choose oatmeal or an oat-based cold cereal like Cheerios for breakfast. It gives you one to two grams of soluble fiber. Add a banana or some strawberries for another half-gram. Beans. Beans are especially rich in soluble fiber. They also take a while for the body to digest, meaning you feel full for longer after a meal. That's one reason beans are a useful food for folks trying to lose weight. Nuts. Studies show that eating almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and other nuts is good for the heart. Eating two ounces of nuts a day can slightly lower LDL, on the order of 5%. Nuts also have additional nutrients that protect the heart in other ways. Foods fortified with sterols and stanols. Sterols and stanols extracted from plants interfere with the body's ability to absorb cholesterol from food. Companies are now adding them to a wide variety of foods. They're also available as supplements. Getting two grams of plant sterols or stanols a day can lower LDL cholesterol by about 10%. Fatty fish. Eating fish two or three times a week can lower LDL in two ways: by replacing meat, which has LDL-boosting saturated fats, and by delivering LDL-lowering omega-3 fats. Omega-3s reduce triglycerides in the bloodstream and protect the heart by helping prevent the onset of abnormal heart rhythms.

Sadie Schreiner of the Rochester Institute of Technology was representing the university as part of its outdoor track and field team in the Liberty League, a New York-based Division III intercollegiate athletic conference. Schreiner clinched victories in the 400-meter dash with 55.07 seconds and the 200-meter dash with a remarkable 24.14 seconds at the Liberty League championship meet on May 5. Schreiner's 200-meter time also set a new school record and a Liberty League conference women’s record , surpassing his previous personal best of 24.50 seconds earlier in the season. (Related: 5 TRANS ATHLETES dominate women’s collegiate volleyball game, sparking OUTRAGE .) Adding to the accolades, Schreiner served as the anchor leg of the winning 4 x 400 meters relay team, propelling them to victory with an impressive finish. Despite starting in fourth place when receiving the baton, Schreiner's lightning-fast anchor leg clocked at 54.91 seconds and secured a commanding lead for the team, clinching the win by nearly three seconds. However, statistical analysis from his own records reveals that Schreiner's performances would have placed him at the bottom of the rankings in the men's divisions. For instance, his 100-meter time of 11.72 seconds ranked him 20th among male athletes when he competed as a boy at Hillsborough High School but would have positioned him as the leader in the girl's category. Similarly, his present recorded times at the Liberty League championship meet would have left him in the last position among male competitors. Human knowledge is under attack!

Several studies prove that MTFs possess an ""automatic advantage"" in women's sports In a recent Instagram post, Schreiner addressed the criticisms labeling him a ""cheater."" He also argued that he does not possess an ""automatic advantage"" as a transgender athlete . ""Out of all the hate that’s been shared of me, 'cheater' is the most common word used… In my eyes, the discussion of trans inclusion in athletics shouldn’t even be a debate,"" Schreiner wrote on Instagram. ""As more research is done the more evident this becomes. There's a reason I'm only as fast as I was in middle school, and the only variable that's changed over my nine years of running is my medication."" ""Even as Olympic studies prove the disadvantages of trans athletes, it's not enough,"" he claimed. ""Policies are being changed before research is done, and the only way to stay educated in this process is to talk to the few trans athletes that are competing and hear their stories, bring them into the conversation. The only way to make an educated decision on a small handful of athletes is to hear their voice, not speak for them."" However, several studies oppose his claims. For instance, a study conducted by Emma N. Hilton and Tommy R. Lundberg and published in Sports Medicine concluded that despite testosterone suppression following current sporting guidelines for transgender athletes, the biological advantages in terms of muscle mass and strength gained during male puberty are only marginally diminished for most transgender women. The study suggests that transgender women may retain a 10 to 50 percent advantage over cisgender women in sports, irrespective of testosterone levels. Similarly, research by Timothy A. Roberts, Joshua Smalley and Dale Ahrendt, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine , reveals that even after transitioning, individuals who were assigned male at birth maintain some physical advantages over cisgender women. Furthermore, another study underscores that transgender women exhibit greater muscle strength, size and composition compared to cisgender women for at least a year following gender-affirming treatment.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/ibs-a-low-fodmap-diet-may-help,IBS? A low-FODMAP diet may help,1,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that affects at least one out of 10 people in the United States each year. With symptoms like cramping, diarrhea, gas and bloating, it's no surprise that living with IBS can have a significant effect on a person's quality of life. Diet is one way people manage IBS symptoms. A common treatment approach is to avoid the foods that trigger symptoms. But if you have trouble identifying your trigger foods, you may benefit from adopting an elimination diet. One of the best ones for people with IBS is a low-FODMAP diet. FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. These are poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates. They are found in many foods and are associated with IBS problems, like diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and flatulence. The following foods contain FODMAPs: oligosaccharides, including fructans (in wheat, onions, garlic) and galactans (in beans, lentils, soybeans) disaccharides, including lactose (in milk and other dairy products) monosaccharides, including fructose (in apples, honey) polyols, including sorbitol and mannitol (in some fruits, vegetables, artificial sweeteners). The Low-FODMAP diet works in two phases. First, you eliminate most dietary FODMAP foods for two to four weeks. Then you replace them with low-FODMAP alternatives. You monitor your symptoms for changes and then reintroduce specific FODMAPs one by one over a six- to eight-week period, according to your tolerance. (Your doctor or nutritionist may advise you to keep a food diary and symptom chart to help identify problem foods as well as track amounts.) The goal is to find which foods trigger your IBS symptoms, so you can limit or eliminate them in your diet. Keep in mind that everyone reacts differently to FODMAPs, and some people with IBS can consume small amounts without having symptoms.

The potentially life-saving cervical cancer screening can be painful, and nearly 1 in 4 women don’t get screened as often as they should, if at all. But the FDA is currently reviewing an at-home screening test under its fast-track program that would involve a simple vaginal sample collection. The federal agency could make its decision about the at-home test as early as next year, The New York Times reported. Later this year, women in the U.S. will likely be able to benefit from some of the technology involved in at-home tests and simply swab themselves at the doctor’s office or clinic to collect a cervical cancer screening sample. Similar tests that involve self-collection are already in use in other parts of the world, such as Europe and Australia. In Canada, people can simply fill out an online questionnaire to see if they are eligible to have a self-screening kit mailed to their home. The key to the self-collection and at-home options is that samples from the vagina, rather than the much deeper cervix, can now be analyzed. For a Pap smear, a medical professional inserts a speculum into the vagina to widen it and then a brush that is often more than 7 inches in length is inserted to collect a sample. The swabs used for self-administered vaginal tests are similar to those used for COVID testing and inserted about 3 inches. Currently, women ages 21 to 65 are advised to be screened for cervical cancer every 3 to 5 years using one or both of two methods. The Pap test involves collecting a sample from the cervix that is examined to detect abnormal cells. Another screening procedure is the HPV test, which can detect infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is responsible for nearly all cases of cervical cancer, and specialized testing can detect whether a person is infected with any of the strains that are considered high risk. In May, the FDA approved HPV self-collection kits in the U.S. to be used in health care settings, making it possible for women to swab their own vaginas to collect samples. Those kits should begin shipping to medical facilities this fall, the Times reported. There are 11,500 new cervical cancer cases annually in the U.S., and 4,000 women die from the disease each year. It is considered highly preventable due to the capability to detect treatable precancerous conditions. But 23% of women were overdue for screening, according to 2019 data from the National Cancer Institute. That’s up from a rate of 14% overdue in 2005. An analysis published in JAMA Network Open in 2022 showed that Asian and Hispanic women were more likely than white women to be overdue for screening, as well as people without insurance, who lived in rural places, or who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, other, or unsure (LGBQ+). A federal program offers free or very low cost breast and cervical cancer screenings for women who have low incomes or have insurance barriers, such as being uninsured or underinsured.",8,-0.14880255,0.013586238,False

Also known as pertussis, it’s back with a vengeance and could even threaten people who are vaccinated against the disease, since protection fades over time. More than 10,000 cases of whooping cough have been reported in the U.S. so far this year, and weekly reports say cases have more than tripled 2023 levels as of June, according to the CDC. In 2023, there were 2,815 cases reported during the entire year. “The number of reported cases this year is close to what was seen at the same time in 2019, prior to the pandemic,” the CDC reported. There were 18,617 cases of whooping cough in 2019. There were 259 cases reported nationwide for the week ending Aug. 3, with nearly half occurring in the mid-Atlantic region. Public health officials believe the resurgence of whooping cough is likely due to declining vaccination rates, mainly due to the missed vaccines during the height of the COVID pandemic. The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines (DTaP) have been given together since the 1940s, typically during infancy and again during early childhood. In 1941, there were more than 220,000 cases of whooping cough. Whooping cough is caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. The bacteria attach to tiny, hair-like extensions in the upper respiratory system called cilia, and toxins released by them damage the cilia and cause airways to swell. Early symptoms are similar to the common cold, but the condition eventually leads to coughing fits and a high-pitched “whoop” sound made when inhaling after a fit subsides. Coughing fits can be so severe that people can fracture a rib. Vaccinated people may get a less severe illness, compared to unvaccinated people, the CDC says. Babies and children are particularly at risk for severe and even potentially deadly complications. About 1 in 3 babies under age 1 who get whooping cough will need to be hospitalized, and among those hospitalized babies, 1 in 100 die from complications.",4,-0.40008044,0.30636662,False

There are many things in life that can be categorized as coming in both good and bad versions. The same applies to bacteria. Bad bacteria like salmonella and E. coli can make you sick. Good bacteria like the kind in probiotics play an important role in keeping us healthy. These good bacteria interact with the intestinal lining to protect the body from harmful invaders. They help the immune system function properly, which means better ability both to fight infections and to dampen chronic inflammation. Know your bacteria Some research suggests that certain probiotics help relieve symptoms of gut-related conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. ""Many people could probably benefit by increasing their intake of probiotics,"" says Dr. Allan Walker, a professor of nutrition at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""The problem is the unsubstantiated hype that probiotic supplements have far-reaching health potential, which can keep people from choosing the best sources."" There are hundreds of bacteria classified as probiotics, but most come from two main species: Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Within each of these are various strains. There are two ways to get probiotics: fermented foods and over-the-counter products. According to Dr. Walker, fermented foods are the better choices primarily because over-the-counter supplements and formulas aren’t subject to the necessary oversight. (See ""Take care with supplements."") Take care with supplements Probiotics are also found in over-the-counter probiotic supplements and formulas. Most use Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, or a combination. The bacteria are concentrated and then dried to use as powders or in capsules, tablets, lozenges, and even gums. The issue with these products is that they are sold as dietary supplements and therefore don’t require FDA approval. ""So you can never be sure that the label claims about health benefits or the type and number of bacteria per serving are accurate,"" says Dr. Allan Walker, a professor of nutrition at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He advises you to avoid them unless recommended by your doctor. Eat more fermented foods Foods contain probiotics after going through lactofermentation, a process in which bacteria feed on the food’s sugar and starch to create lactic acid, which helps preserve it. Another way to think of lactofermentation is that it transforms one type of food into another kind—for instance, cabbage into sauerkraut, cucumbers into pickles, soybeans into miso, and milk into yogurt. The exact amounts and specific strains of bacteria in fermented foods vary depending on how they are made. Besides probiotics, fermented foods may also contain other valuable nutrients like enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids. How much fermented food do you need to eat for optimal gut health? Unfortunately, there is no recommended daily allowance for probiotics, so it’s uncertain which fermented foods or what amount is ideal, according to Dr. Walker. ""The general recommendation is simply to add more fermented foods to your diet,"" he says. Probiotic Smoothie Smoothies are a quick and easy way to get probiotics. Here is a recipe that is ideal for a breakfast, snack, or post-workout drink. Combine all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth.

Many choices There are many fermented foods to choose from. Here are some common ones you can try. Kefir. The tart yogurt-like drink is often made with dairy milk, but also comes in nondairy alternatives, like coconut water, coconut milk, and rice milk. Kefir also comes in fruit and vegetable flavors. Kimchi. Kimchi is a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish. You can find jars of it at most grocery stores or Asian markets. Kombucha. This tangy fermented tea drink is found in many grocery and specialty food stores. Some brands have added sugar, so make sure the label lists no more than 5 grams per serving. Miso. The paste is a staple in Japanese cuisine, especially in soup. It’s made from soybeans fermented with brown rice and has a strong, salty flavor. Pickles. Choose brands brined in water and sea salt instead of vinegar. Vinegar stops good bacteria from growing. Sauerkraut. Select raw or nonpasteurized sauerkraut, which contains more bacteria strains. You can find them in specialty grocery stores. Sourdough bread. This kind of bread is baked with fermented flour.

https://www.webmd.com/allergies/news/20240809/fda-approves-first-nasal-spray-for-allergic-reactions,FDA Approves First Nasal Spray for Allergic Reactions,1,"Editor's note: This story has been updated to include details on availability and pricing. Aug. 9, 2024 – An epinephrine nasal spray to treat serious allergic reactions may soon be available in the U.S. The FDA announced its approval of the nasal spray, called neffy, on Friday. It's for adults, and for children who weigh at least 66 pounds, who have what are known as type 1 allergic reactions, which include the potentially life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis. Signs are trouble breathing or swallowing, skin symptoms like hives and swelling, stomach problems like cramps or nausea, and heart issues like a drop in blood pressure and rapid heartbeat. Allergic reactions are triggered by an abnormal immune system response, usually to something like food or medication, or from an insect sting. Until now, the only treatment for anaphylaxis was an epinephrine shot in the thigh, usually through an automatic injector pen like the EpiPen. Up to 2% of people in the U.S. are estimated to have a lifetime chance of having anaphylaxis. Neffy's manufacturer, ARS Pharma, said it expects the drug to be available within 8 weeks. For patients with commercial insurance, neffy will cost $25 for two, single-use devices. For those without insurance or whose insurance won't cover neffy, ARS will offer it for a cash price of $199. Those without insurance who have exhausted all other options could receive it at no cost, the company said in a statement. Neffy is taken as a single dose sprayed into one nostril, and a combination of four studies among 175 healthy adults showed the product could achieve a blood epinephrine level similar to what you'd get from a shot, as well as a similar increase in blood pressure and heart rate. In a study of children weighing more than 66 pounds, blood concentration levels after taking neffy were similar to levels seen in adults who used the product. When a person’s blood pressure drops too low, they can go into anaphylactic shock, and swollen bronchial tissue can lead to loss of consciousness. Life-saving treatment is needed right away in cases of anaphylactic shock. People with some nasal conditions or a history of nasal surgery should talk to a health care professional about whether they should use neffy, the FDA advised, and the product also may not be safe for some people with certain other conditions or sulfite allergies. A previous announcement from ARS Pharma about its efforts to get neffy FDA-approved emphasized the importance of offering a needle-free treatment option. “While epinephrine autoinjectors have been shown to be highly effective, there are well published limitations that result in many patients and caregivers delaying or not administering treatment in an emergency situation,” the company said. Those limitations include a fear of needles, lack of portability, safety concerns, and more. The company said there are about 40 million people in the U.S. who have type 1 reactions, and last year, only 3.2 million of them had a prescription for a epinephrine injection pen. “Even if patients or caregivers carry an autoinjector, more than half either delay or do not administer the device when needed in an emergency,” the company said.",8,-0.08994168,0.0791779,False

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/feed-your-gut,Feed your gut,1,"Nourish the healthy bacteria in your digestive tract with a mix of probiotics and prebiotics. If you want a healthy gut, you have to feed it well. This nourishment should include both probiotics and prebiotics — two dietary components that are increasingly being recognized as essential to your intestinal and overall health, says Teresa Fung, adjunct professor in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. There’s been a lot of buzz recently about the need to eat probiotics — ­living microorganisms found in foods such as yogurt and fermented vegetables. Probiotics add to your gut microbiota, the collection of 100 trillion or so bacteria and other critters living in your gut. Having a healthy microbiota may help foster a healthy immune system and reduce damaging inflammation in the body. Eating probiotics regularly may also help to prevent the intestinal environment from being overrun by unhealthy bacteria, which have been linked to everything from mood disorders and obesity to diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. But probiotics are much like pets, says Fung. It’s not enough to just get one; you also have to take care of it, she says. This means feeding the population of microorganisms with prebiotics — foods that will help all of these desirable gut bugs grow and thrive inside your digestive tract. Understanding your gut To understand how to keep your intestinal environment healthy, it’s important to understand how your microbiota evolves. Everyone has a unique mix of microorganisms living inside them. Some of these come from your mother, conferred during pregnancy, delivery, and, potentially, breastfeeding. Others are introduced by the foods you eat, and your environment. Probiotics found in fermented foods and drinks — such as yogurt, cheese, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut — can add desirable organisms to your gut. But not all varieties of these foods have probiotics; it depends on how they are processed. Sometimes foods that naturally contain probiotics are then cooked or heated, killing the microorganisms and any potential health benefits along with them, says Fung. Slipping an occasional food with probiotics into your diet won’t do much to help you improve your microbiota, says Fung. ""Eating probiotics needs to be a regular thing,"" she says. (Research hasn’t yet determined the ideal frequency.) Try adding them into one or more daily meals for the biggest benefit. Sip a yogurt smoothie for breakfast, or put a forkful or two of sauerkraut alongside your sandwich at lunch. The need for prebiotics Even if you eat a lot of foods that contain probiotics, it won’t do you much good if your intestinal environment doesn’t allow them to prosper, says Fung. Research has shown that a traditional Western diet — heavy on fat, sugar, and animal meat — creates a toxic environment for healthy microbes and can even change the proportion of different types of bacteria inside your body, she says. In short, your healthy gut microbes will suffer on a diet of hot dogs and French fries. What beneficial bacteria love, says Fung, is fiber. When fiber enters your digestive system, enzymes from the microbiota help to break it down, producing substances called short-chain fatty acids. Experts think that having more of these fatty acids changes the pH inside your colon, making it less hospitable to some damaging types of microorganisms. Some good prebiotic options are beans and whole grains. ""Whole grains can include everything from oats to wheat,"" says Fung. Vegetables and fruits also contain healthy fiber. Other good prebiotic sources include garlic, bananas, onions, asparagus, and seaweed. Over all, the goal should be to make sure your diet contains a good balance of probiotics and prebiotics. If you feed your gut well, it may repay you in better health. Image: © SDI Productions/Getty Images",1,0.30042264,0.07735275,True

New CDC data published late Monday show the positive COVID test rate edged up 2 points to 16% for the week ending July 27. Emergency room visits involving a COVID diagnosis also ticked up (accounting now for 2% of all ER visits), and wastewater detections of the virus that causes COVID continue their unrelenting climb since early May. The nation’s wastewater viral activity level is currently more than twice as high as it was this same time last year. Testing for viral traces in sewage is considered an advanced indicator of whether COVID community impacts are heading upward or downward. All but seven U.S. states currently are reporting “high” or “very high” SARS-CoV-2 wastewater levels as of Aug. 1, according to the CDC’s monitoring program (SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID). New York and West Virginia levels remained “low,” while moderate levels were observed in New Jersey, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Arizona. There was no data reported for North Dakota. COVID-19 deaths jumped by 25% during the latest week of reporting, although the overall rate of deaths that week due to COVID was 1.5% when all other causes of death are considered. The total number of weekly COVID deaths has remained less than 500 nationally since mid-April. The current dominant variants are still Omicron descendants, called KP.3 and KP.3.1.1, the latter of which recently unseated KP.3 for the top prevalence spot. The CDC estimates that for the week ending Aug. 3, KP.3.1.1 accounted for nearly 28% of U.S. infections, up from 14% 2 weeks prior. The variant KP.3 slipped to the second position, now accounting for about 20% of infections, down from about 24% during the prior 2-week reporting period. COVID expert Eric Topol, MD, tweeted recently that KP.3.1.1 is moving toward being “more of a challenge to our immune response than KP.3 and prior variants.” Updated COVID vaccines are expected to become available later this month or in September.",4,-0.3123567,0.1654179,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/preventable-liver-disease-is-rising-what-you-eat-and-avoid-counts-202304032908,Preventable liver disease is rising: What you eat — and avoid — counts,1,"In today's fast-paced world, our waking hours are filled with decisions — often surrounding what to eat. After a long day, dinner could well be fast food or takeout. While you may worry about the toll food choices take on your waistline or blood pressure, as a liver specialist, I also want to put fatty liver disease on your radar. One variant, officially called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now affects one in four adults globally. Sometimes it progresses to extensive scarring known as cirrhosis, liver failure, and higher risk for liver cancer. The good news? Fatty liver disease can be prevented or reversed. What is fatty liver disease? Fatty liver disease is a condition caused by irritation to the liver. Liver tissue accumulates abnormal amounts of fat in response to that injury. Viral hepatitis, certain medicines (like tamoxifen or steroids, for example), or ingesting too much alcohol can all cause fatty liver disease. However, NAFLD has a different trigger for fat deposits in the liver: a group of metabolic risk factors. NAFLD is most common in people who have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, insulin resistance (prediabetes), or type 2 diabetes. It is also common among people who are overweight or obese, though it is possible to develop NAFLD even if your body mass index (BMI) is normal. What helps prevent or reverse NAFLD? Diet can play a huge role. Because NAFLD is so closely tied to metabolic health, eating more healthfully can help prevent or possibly even reverse it. A good example of a healthful eating pattern is the Mediterranean diet. Overweight or obesity is a common cause of NAFLD. A weight loss program that includes activity and healthy eating can help control blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. Among the many healthful diet plans that help are the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet. Talk to your doctor or a nutritionist if you need help choosing a plan. To vigorously study any diet as a treatment for fatty liver disease, researchers must control many factors. Currently, no strong evidence supports one particular diet over another. However, the research below highlights choices to promote a healthy liver. Avoid fast food A recent study in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology linked regular fast-food consumption (20% or more of total daily calories) with fatty liver disease — especially in people who had type 2 diabetes or obesity. Fast foods tend to be high in saturated fats, added sugar, and other ingredients that affect metabolic health. Steer clear of soft drinks and added sugars Soft drinks with high-fructose corn syrup, or other sugar-sweetened beverages, lead directly to large increases in liver fat deposits, independent of the total calories consumed. Read labels closely for added sugars, including corn syrup, dextrose, honey, and agave. Instead of sugary drinks, sip plain water. Black coffee or with a splash of cream is also a good pick; research suggests coffee has the potential to decrease liver scarring. Avoid alcohol Alcohol directly damages the liver, lacks nutritional value, and may affect a healthy microbiome. If you have NAFLD, it's best to avoid any extra cause for liver injury. We simply do not know what amount of alcohol is safe for those with fatty liver disease — even social drinking may be too much. Eat mostly whole foods Vegetables, berries, eggs, poultry, grass-fed meats, nuts, and whole grains all qualify, but cutting out red meat may be wise. An 18-month trial enrolled 294 people with abdominal obesity and lipid imbalances such as high triglycerides. Regular activity was encouraged, and participants were randomly assigned to one of three diets: standard healthy dietary guidelines, a traditional Mediterranean diet, or a green-Mediterranean diet. (The green-Med diet nixed red and processed meats and added green tea and a dinner replacement shake rich in antioxidants called polyphenols.) All three groups lost some weight, although the Mediterranean diet groups lost more weight and kept it off for a longer period. Both Mediterranean diet groups also showed reduced liver fat at the end of 18 months, but liver fat decreased twice as much in the green-Med group as in the traditional Mediterranean diet group. Healthy fats are part of a healthy diet We all need fat. Dietary fats help your body absorb vitamins and are vital in the protection of nerves and cells. Fats also help you feel satisfied and full, so you're less likely to overeat. Low-fat foods often substitute sugars and starches, which affect blood sugar regulation in our bodies. But all fat is not created equal. It's clear that Mediterranean-style diets can help decrease liver fat, thus helping to prevent or possibly reverse NAFLD. These diets are high in healthful fats, such as monounsaturated fats found in olive oil and avocados and omega-3 fats found in walnuts and oily fish like salmon and sardines. With so many choices, it's hard to know where to start in the healthy eating journey. Let's strive to eat whole foods in their natural state. Our livers will thank us for it.",3,0.29244453,0.17455791,False
https://www.webmd.com/obesity/news/20240805/lab-tests-of-semaglutide-bought-online-raise-red-flags,Lab Tests of Semaglutide Bought Online Raise Red Flags,1,"Aug. 5, 2024 – Researchers who bought the weight loss drug semaglutide online without a prescription were scammed or sent potentially toxic liquids that did not contain the labeled amount of the drug. Semaglutide is the active ingredient in the weight loss drug Wegovy, and also in the diabetes drug Ozempic that is often used off-label for weight loss. In clinical trials for Wegovy, weight loss averaged between 6% and 12%, but the medicines are very expensive without insurance coverage, and the maker of the brand-name drugs has struggled to keep pace with rising demand. Wegovy is currently listed on the nation’s official drug shortage list. The researchers paid between $113 and $360 for a single dose of the products they ordered online. The retail price for a comparable dose (one 0.25-milligram pen of Wegovy) is about $325, and the drug is meant to be taken weekly. “Illegal online pharmacies, which operate without valid licenses and sell medicines like semaglutide without prescription, represent a consumer risk for ineffective and dangerous products,” the authors warned in a study. For their study, published this month by JAMA Network Open, the researchers searched the internet for websites advertising semaglutide without a prescription and found that 42% of their search results were for online pharmacies operating illegally. The researchers ordered two injection pens or vials of the product from six online pharmacies deemed “not recommended” or “rogue” by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy or a third-party verifying body called LegitScript. The team, made up of medical researchers from Hungary and the University of California, San Diego, compared the products received to actual Ozempic pens visually, and they did lab tests for sterility, germ contamination, and to measure the amount of semaglutide. The products were purchased and tested between August 2023 and March 2024. The six vendors confirmed the sale either via email or the messaging service WhatsApp, but three purchases were later found to be scams. Those three sellers never delivered the products and asked for more payments ranging from $650 to $1,200, claiming the money was needed to clear customs. The researchers reported that customs agencies confirmed these claims were fraudulent. The results of the quality testing of the remaining three products that were delivered raised many concerns: Starting last year, regular warnings have been issued about fake pens purported to contain the injectable medicines, some of which were found in U.S. drugstores. The warnings have spanned the globe, issued by the FDA, , the World Health Organization, and the Danish company, Novo Nordisk, that makes Wegovy and Ozempic. Authorities are trying to crack down on fakes by sending warning letters to online sellers and partnering with the distribution groups. On a webpage devoted to supply issue updates, Novo Nordisk said it has served more than 1 million U.S. patients in the time spanning FDA approval of Wegovy in 2021 to April 2024, and at least 25,000 new U.S. patients are starting the medicine each week. “While we will do our best to support those who want to start taking Wegovy, it is important to recognize that overall demand will continue to exceed supply and some patients may still have difficulty filling Wegovy prescriptions,” Novo Nordisk wrote on its website. “We will continue to closely monitor market dynamics and prescribing trends, and are doing everything we can to manufacture more Wegovy, including running our manufacturing lines 24 hours a day, seven days a week.” The company added: “We recommend that those who experience challenges filling their prescriptions speak with their healthcare professional about the best approach to their treatment, so this does not halt their pursuit of obesity care.”",8,-0.012581445,0.13070159,False

The four patterns, all recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, were the Healthy Eating Index 2015, Alternate Mediterranean Diet, Healthful Plant-based Diet, and Alternate Healthy Eating Index. While they differ somewhat, all four encourage high consumption of plant-based foods like grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes. The participants filled out dietary questionnaires every four years for over three decades. The data showed that those who closely followed one or more of the four healthy eating patterns were less likely to die from cardiovascular disease, cancer, or respiratory disease during this period compared with those who did not follow any of the four patterns or did so less often. The results suggest that the ideal healthy eating pattern need not always be one particular diet but could be a combination that shares similar traits.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-05-02-european-commission-president-conspired-with-pfizer-ceo.html,European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen conspired with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to defraud the European people,0,"During the past four calamitous years, as global leaders sought to restrict, threaten and undermine the rights of citizens, there was, and still is, a war against the values and principles that protect human rights and human dignity. During the more challenging phases of this war , Ursula von der Leyen presided over the European Commission, one of the three branches of the European Union (EU). According to her own confessions, she privately conspired with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to secure 11 contracts, 4.6 billion in vaccines, while transferring €71 billion of public money to Big Pharma. In 2020, Ursula told the New York Times she was texting Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to secure 1.9 billion doses of their COVID-19 vaccine for the EU population, which is just 448 million. These contracts with Pfizer defrauded the public, leading to policies that suspended civil liberties, while misleading and coercively harming individuals amid the implementation of a global vaccine agenda and a biosecurity police state. This war utilized some of the darkest forms of bio-terror propaganda and unleashed mass medical fraud to experiment on populations with bioweapons disguised as “vaccines.” Today, these vaccine contracts, which guaranteed protections for the vaccine makers, are being concealed or made highly redacted, as EU leaders try to hide the evidence of their crimes against their people, and humanity in general. Ursula von der Leyen orchestrated mass violations of human rights to enforce a global vaccine agenda It's important to note that President Ursula von der Leyen is not an elected official. She was appointed in December 2019 by the heads of state of the EU and then approved by a European Parliament. These people and their appointees are not accountable to any real form of democracy, nor held in check by a true republic. Yet, “President” Ursula von der Leyen went on to represent the Commission in European Council meetings, G7 and G20 summits and summits with non-EU countries, calling for restrictions on travel, assembly and personal freedom. These restrictions were then used to install a medical Apartheid state, one where people could not participate in society without a QR code indicating their subservience to the injections and swabs demanded of them at the time.

Ursula went on to participate in major debates in the European Parliament and the council, while giving political guidance to the Commission. She led the Commission’s work in implementing EU policies. Her policies, which included lockdowns and vaccine passports, were a threat to the body autonomy, movement, assembly, livelihood and property rights of free individuals. Her policies threatened medical ethics and human rights, leading to widespread discrimination, segregation and abuse in the workplace, and throughout all society. According to French NGO Global Health Advocates , and the UK based health nonprofit, StopAids, the European Commission “agreed to extensive confidentiality requirements with pharmaceutical corporations that may not be fully consistent with EU legislation."" Their research also found the ""Pfizer contract was the most significantly redacted.” They also noted that the EU Commission redacted the most information about product safety and indemnification in the Pfizer and Moderna contract,” concluding that “it looks like most of the risk was borne by the EU in a desperate attempt to get access to these vaccines.” Disbanding and prosecuting the EU Commission will prevent future wars against the people Going into 2024, Ursula von der Leyen appears unfazed by any of the wars she waged against the people and the damage she inflicted on the integrity of longstanding governments, institutions, treaties and alliances. Because she carried out the depopulation plans of globalists – spearheading the global vaccine agenda and installing surveillance and control systems – she will most likely be appointed yet again to her puppet role in the EU, although she is dangling from strings that are wearing thin. Ursula views herself as a bastion of transparency and foresight , but she continues to conceal the crooked deals she made between the EU and Pfizer – deals that sent billions in taxpayer dollars to Big Pharma, while stripping the people of their rights and injuring the masses in phony vaccine experiments. During the war, Ursula rolled out a bloc-wide QR code system, demanding that individuals provide proof of vaccination for travel, leisure and employment. The strongest individuals fought back against the propaganda and proved that the experimental jab did not stop infection, transmission or death. It did the opposite, and those behind the vaccine rollout are liars, scammers and thieves, responsible for mass murder and a barrage of crimes against humanity. The digital identity system faltered as more people fought back against booster requirements and the outright segregation that the system fostered. Now, the only way to restore global security and freedom is to disband the EU and subject its leaders to trials and tribunals, in accordance with the Nuremberg Code .

Millennials and Generation Xers are now more likely to be diagnosed with 17 types of cancer, compared to Baby Boomers, during early adulthood and middle age. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Lancet Public Health, and the authors warned that the numbers suggest an eventual halt or reversal of decades of progress in cancer rates. They called the reasons for rising cancer rates among young people “poorly understood” but pointed to other research that has linked some cancers earlier in life with obesity, poor diet, environmental impacts, changes in reproductive patterns, and lifestyle factors such as lack of exercise and poor sleep. While the risk of getting certain cancers rose among young people, the risk of dying from most of those cancers did not follow in lockstep, perhaps pointing toward effective screenings and treatments. But young people were more likely to die of cancers of the gallbladder, testes, colon or rectum, uterus, and (among women only) liver. “The data highlights the critical need to identify and address underlying risk factors in Gen X and Millennial populations to inform prevention strategies,” said study author Ahmedin Jemal, DVM, PhD, of the American Cancer Society, which partnered with researchers at the University of Calgary in Canada on the project. His comments were part of a news release. Specifically, the study examined how common it was for people to be diagnosed with 34 types of cancer, as well as how likely they were to die from most of those cancer types from the year 2000 to 2019. During that time period, there were more than 23 million people in North America diagnosed with those cancers, and more than 7 million deaths. Five of the 34 cancer types in the study increased at a concerning and steep rate among young people, starting with those born in 1990, compared to people born in 1955. The rates for the following cancer types doubled or tripled every 5 years among young people: Other cancer types flagged for worrying increases among young people included: “Because most existing cancer care systems in the USA are not tailored to the unique needs of young adults with cancer, targeted [programs] and services are needed,” the authors wrote, adding that more focus is needed to prevent health risks beginning in childhood, infancy, and even prenatal stages.",7,0.04383614,0.22292022,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/dietary-changes-to-help-reduce-ulcerative-colitis-symptoms,Dietary changes to help reduce ulcerative colitis symptoms,1,"Since ulcerative colitis (UC), a condition that causes inflammation in the colon and rectum, is never medically cured, certain lifestyle behaviors can help you manage symptoms and better cope with your condition. In addition to managing stress, paying attention to what you eat can have a big impact on your quality of life. There is no single diet that works best for managing UC. In fact, no studies have shown that any specific diet improves symptoms or that any specific foods cause UC flare-ups. The best approach is to avoid or reduce the foods that aggravate your symptoms. You should eat a well-balanced, healthy diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, such as a Mediterranean style diet. Avoid preservatives and emulsifiers, such as carrageenan, carboxymethylcellulose, and polysorbate-80. Having a nutritionist design a specialized diet plan for you may be helpful. The nutritionist will first want to identify foods that may trigger flare-ups or make your symptoms worse. There is no strong evidence that following any particular specialized diet diet—such as low-carb, vegetarian, or paleo—has any effect on keeping UC in remission. If you have inflammatory bowel disease and also irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a low-FODMAP diet may be helpful. FODMAP stands for the short-chain carbohydrates known as fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. Some people who eat high-FODMAP foods have an increased risk of problems like diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and flatulence. FODMAPs include the following: disaccharides, such as lactose (in milk and other dairy products) monosaccharides, such as fructose (for example, in apples and honey) oligosaccharides, such as fructans (in wheat, onions, and garlic, for example) and galactans (commonly found in beans, lentils, and soybeans) polyols, such as sorbitol and mannitol (in some fruits, vegetables, and artificial sweeteners). A low-FODMAP diet can help reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea and improve stool consistency in people with IBS who also have well-controlled IBD. Consult with your doctor and a nutritionist about how FODMAP reduction may fit into your dietary plan.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/ibs-in-the-crosshairs,IBS in the crosshairs,1,"Up to 45 million Americans have a condition that people affected may only reluctantly mention: irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. Despite its prevalence, IBS is still somewhat mysterious when it comes to who gets it — two-thirds of patients are women — and why. But scientists are steadily peeling this proverbial onion, with newer treatment approaches targeting pathways that appear to be involved in the cramping, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and/or constipation that disrupt patients' everyday lives. Marked by chronic belly pain and altered bowel habits, IBS is categorized into three types according to which symptoms dominate: diarrhea (IBS-D), constipation (IBS-C), or a combination. It's one of the most common gastrointestinal conditions, affecting up to 15% of Americans, according to the International Foundation for Gastrointestinal Disorders. IBS is what doctors call a functional bowel disorder, since it affects the way the digestive system works but isn't due to any apparent structural problem. But that label is problematic, Harvard experts say. ""To say nothing's wrong is just wrong, because clearly something is different,"" says Dr. Anthony Lembo, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""It's just that our standard clinical testing can't show it."" Compelling effects on daily life The causes of IBS remain frustratingly unclear, but symptoms are believed to stem from any of a wide range of factors. Among them: Changes in the gut microbiome. This array of microbes in the gut is influenced by what we eat and drink as well as by illness. ""About 10% of people who develop a gastrointestinal infection, whether viral, bacterial, or parasitic — even COVID — show a higher rate of IBS,"" Dr. Lembo says. Skewed intestinal muscle contractions. Normally rhythmic, these contractions push food through the digestive tract faster or slower than normal in IBS patients. Faulty nerve signals. Normal digestion relies on clear communication between the brain, gut, and nervous system. These signals are disrupted in IBS. Pelvic floor problems. This is especially true for women whose pelvic muscles don't relax normally, which can lead to chronic constipation. Early life stress. This can include traumatic events during childhood. Genetics. People with a family history of IBS are more likely to have it as well. At best, IBS is inconvenient, forcing people to shape their schedules around their bathroom needs. At worst, it can be incapacitating, causing extreme distress and controlling people's ability to work and travel. ""All the data show the suffering is pretty significant,"" Dr. Lembo says. ""It's a disorder we know can really debilitate people."" Tailoring treatments For the first time, IBS treatment guidelines, updated in June 2022 by the American Gastroenterological Association, steer doctors on how to personalize patients' treatment with a widening assortment of medications. Over-the-counter options — including fiber supplements, laxatives (in limited amounts), and anti-diarrheals — can help control symptoms. But recent years have brought an influx of IBS-specific drug options that don't just address symptoms, but instead target specific biochemical or cellular pathways to slow food movement through the bowel or push fluids into the intestine to soften stools and speed their passage. For IBS-D, these drugs include alosetron (Lotronex) and eluxadoline (Viberzi). For IBS-C, they include lubiprostone (Amitiza), linaclotide (Linzess), plecanatide (Trulance), and tenapanor (Ibsrela). The antibiotic rifaximin (Xifaxan) appears to benefit the gut microbiome, suppressing ""bad"" organisms that contribute to IBS symptoms, says Dr. Lawrence Friedman, assistant chief of medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital and chair of the Department of Medicine at Newton-Wellesley Hospital. ""It's one of the more exciting newer developments,"" he says. Doctors are also tapping older drugs for new purposes. Various antidepressants can alter nerve signal activity in the intestines or lessen pain in IBS, Dr. Lembo says. While a variety of medications can help relieve symptoms, effective IBS management depends on diet and life-style changes. For many people, avoiding trigger foods, eating more fiber, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising regularly, and getting sufficient sleep can help control mild symptoms. Symptoms may also worsen depending on the foods you eat. Wheat, dairy products, citrus fruits, beans, cabbage, and carbonated drinks are known culprits. Meanwhile, peppermint oil supplements, taken as coated tablets, can ease bloating and pain. ""Many people also figure out that lactose can be a trigger and if they drink a glass of milk or consume other dairy products, their symptoms worsen,"" Dr. Lembo says. ""But sometimes it's more subtle than that. Even drinking a glass of diet soda can cause gas and bloating."" For those in whom gas and bloating are severe, a low-FODMAP diet may help. FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols) are foods that increase gas production. They include beans, onions, celery, carrots, raisins, bananas, apricots, prunes, Brussels sprouts, wheat germ, pretzels, and bagels. Dr. Lembo suggests eliminating FODMAPs temporarily and then slowly adding each food back into your diet to pinpoint the worst offenders. Over all, Dr. Friedman says, ""the spectrum of treatments has expanded. We have more tools to work with and there's a higher likelihood of success, but there may still be an element of trial and error involved.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-i-take-afternoon-naps,Should I take afternoon naps?,1,"Q. I retired earlier this year and have begun to enjoy taking afternoon naps. But is regular napping good for my health? A. The first thing to consider is the possibility that you nap because you have daytime sleepiness. If so, what is the cause? For example: Do you take any medicine that might make you sleepy? Review your prescriptions with your pharmacist or during your next doctor's visit. Have you started having problems sleeping at night? If you sleep well at night and wake up refreshed, don't worry. But if you feel groggy or have early-morning headaches, you may have sleep apnea or some other cause of interrupted sleep. Could you be depressed? Ask yourself if you no longer enjoy activities that previously gave you pleasure and whether you feel low. If you feel your napping may be related to these issues or other health concerns then see your doctor. However, it sounds as if your nap is voluntary and enjoyable. It probably does not reflect an underlying sleep disturbance. If it refreshes your day without making it hard to sleep at night, snooze away. For most people, napping in the early afternoon when your body experiences a natural circadian dip, is the best way to catch a few winks without disturbing the sleep-wake cycle. There is no consensus on how long you should nap. Some experts recommend naps should last no more than 30 minutes. The limit is 60 minutes, because longer naps have been linked to a higher risk of health problems like cardiovascular disease. Try to schedule your naps and not wait until you get sleepy, which will prevent you from napping too late in the day. Keep your napping space dark, cool, and free from distractions. (But there is nothing wrong with the standard couch nap if that's most comfortable.) Remember to give yourself 10 minutes after napping before engaging in mentally or physically demanding tasks. There is still some stigma about naps at work in America because of the lingering notions of decreased productivity and even laziness. But there is solid evidence that an afternoon nap can improve a worker's cognitive performance, especially for complex tasks, and may stimulate creativity. When NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration studied the effects of napping on pilots, they found that naps improved mental alertness and performance. Many night shift workers reportedly perked up after taking naps as brief as 15 to 20 minutes. So, enjoy your nap. Even if you return to work, maintaining an afternoon nap as part of your daily routine can be beneficial. Image: © Westend61/Getty Images",5,0.24195488,-0.19621003,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/fighting-the-most-common-skin-cancers,Fighting the most common skin cancers,1,"Heading outside on a sunny day is a bit like going into battle. To protect your skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, you’ll need armor (sunscreen or sunblock, and sun-protective clothing), tactical strategy (avoiding peak sun hours), and a place to retreat (the shade) — especially during the summer months, when UV intensity is highest. Mind you, we need a little sunshine on our skin to trigger the production of vitamin D, keep bones strong, and possibly help regulate mood and ward off illness. But unprotected UV exposure can cause skin cancers. The most common of these are non-melanoma skin cancers. What are they? To put it simply, non-melanoma skin cancers aren’t melanomas — the aggressive skin cancers that account for just 1% of all skin cancer cases, yet cause the majority of skin cancer deaths in the United States. Extremely aggressive non-melanoma skin cancers are rare. Instead, the most common types, affecting millions of people per year, are slow-growing. They develop in basal cells (basal cell carcinomas, or BCCs) or squamous cells (squamous cell carcinomas, or SCCs). These cancers don’t usually spread to other parts of the body, and they aren’t usually life-threatening. But they can be quite dangerous. ""Small skin cancers can bleed, hurt, and eat away at your skin. If left untreated, they can erode through important structures like your nose, eyes, bones, or muscles. If they become very large, they can spread, and in rare cases cause death,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Symptoms While non-melanoma skin cancers can develop anywhere on the body, they typically show up in areas that have been exposed to the sun, such as the head, face, neck, ears, lips, arms, legs, or hands. The cancers may look like flat areas that differ only slightly from healthy skin, or they may have distinguishing features. SCCs can be scaly patches, crusty sores, or wart-like bumps. BCCs often have raised edges, a sunken center, and visible blood vessels. They also can look like a pale scar, a sore that won’t heal, a reddish patch, or a bump that might have a number of colors (red, blue, brown, or black). Melanomas usually have brown, black, or blue pigment of uneven color, jagged edges, and an asymmetrical shape. They can be flat or lumpy. Many people have small brown, black, or blue spots on their skin (lentigos), but their color is even, their edges are smooth, and their shape is symmetrical. Lentigos can turn into melanomas, so pigmented spots that start to change color or shape need to be evaluated. Diagnosis BCCs and SCCs are often found early (by you or your doctor), when they are easiest to treat. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will take a look at a new or changing skin growth under a powerful magnifier. If the area looks suspicious, your doctor might remove a sample of the tissue (a biopsy) and send it to a lab for analysis. If the sample is positive for BCC or SCC, the cancer will need to be removed. For large tumors, ask your doctor about additional testing. ""For SCCs that are bigger than a quarter, my recommendation is to ask your doctor about getting your lymph nodes checked to make sure the cancer hasn’t spread,"" Dr. Waldman says. Treatment Non-melanoma skin cancer treatment depends on a cancer’s specific type and features. ""For instance, an in situ [contained and not spreading] SCC on the cheek may be treated with a prescription cream. But an invasive SCC on the cheek would need to be removed with Mohs surgery,"" Dr. Waldman says. Mohs micrographic surgery involves removing cancer a little bit at a time, to preserve as much healthy skin as possible. Each piece is checked immediately under a microscope. Once the edges are free of cancer, the surgery is complete. ""Mohs surgery is usually reserved for invasive skin cancers in areas that are cosmetically sensitive — on the face, scalp, neck — or on functional areas like the hands, feet, and genitals, or with very aggressive or large tumors on the trunk or extremities,"" Dr. Waldman says. If Mohs surgery isn’t necessary, the skin cancer may be cut or scraped out with surgical tools, frozen, or destroyed with radiation. The encouraging news is that most SCCs and BCCs can be cured when they’re treated early. Develop your battle plan The best weapon to fight skin cancer is a strict regimen of prevention and detection. It should include the following steps. Cover up. Apply sunscreen or sunblock with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 to 50 before you go outside. Protect your lips with a sun protection product made for them. If possible, wear a long-sleeved shirt, pants, a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, shoes, and socks. Avoid direct sunlight. Stay out of the sun when it’s strongest (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), and seek the shade as much as possible. Be vigilant about detection. Schedule annual skin check-ups with your doctor, and conduct your own exams at home each month. Don’t forget your scalp and all the back surfaces of your body. A mirror (or a loved one) can help you check your back and other areas you can’t see well. Be proactive. Call your doctor if you find any new skin growth that looks suspicious. ""We need to see you before tumors grow and become a problem,"" Dr. Waldman says. Image: © Jim Bastardo/Getty Images",0,0.05303568,-0.09206138,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/was-it-something-you-ate-follow-these-steps-when-food-makes-you-sick,Was it something you ate? Follow these steps when food makes you sick,1,"Foodborne illness outbreaks occur frequently in the United States. Invisible microbes in food sicken an estimated 48 million people in our country each year, landing 128,000 in the hospital and killing about 3,000, according to the CDC. Culprits are usually viruses (such as norovirus), bacteria (such as Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, or Campylobacter), parasites (such as Toxoplasma gondii), or toxins (such as those that can accumulate in shellfish). If you ingest them and get sick, you'll need to know how to respond. Recognizing symptoms Sometimes food-related illness shows up within a few hours of eating contaminated food. But some bugs (such as norovirus and Escherichia coli) don't trigger symptoms for days. Either way, the signs are usually intense: nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, or diarrhea, and possibly a low-grade fever (below 101° F). If you get dehydrated due to fluid loss from vomiting or diarrhea, you may feel lethargic, dizzy, or faint. Symptoms typically last for a couple of days. If they continue after a week, it may be less likely that food-related illness is making you sick. You should call your doctor to figure out what the problem is. In the throes of symptoms If you suspect you have food-related illness, you'll need to rest as much as possible and avoid sugary drinks or alcohol (which can make symptoms worse). Stay away from others (and try not to use the same bathroom), so you don't spread any bugs you're carrying, and keep taking any prescribed medications for chronic illnesses. You'll also need to stay hydrated. ""If it's hard to keep fluids down, take small sips. It's challenging, but important. Standing too suddenly when you're dehydrated can lead to fainting and injury. Severe dehydration can cause chemical imbalances in the body and even lead to kidney failure,"" says Dr. Christopher Baugh, an emergency medicine physician at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. If your symptoms don't include a high fever or bloody stool, Dr. Baugh says it's probably okay to take an antidiarrheal medication such as loperamide (Imodium). If you can stand the symptoms, however, it may be wise to avoid medications and let your body expel the invaders. ""If you take the medication, there's a risk that it might improve the symptoms but prolong or worsen the illness,"" Dr. Baugh says. Avoiding food-related illness Many cases of food-related illness result from improper food handling, preparation, and storage. For example, food can become contaminated if the cook doesn't wash his or her hands before preparing it; if fluids from raw meat, seafood, or poultry get onto fresh produce or cooked food; if food isn't cooked at temperatures high enough to kill microbes; or if food has spoiled. Avoiding those problems will help you ward off food-related illness. You have a lot of control over this at home. But what if you're eating at a restaurant? It's safest to order cooked foods, ask when stews and soups were initially prepared (if it wasn't that day, skip it), and tell your server that you'll need your food to be piping hot. If food doesn't arrive steaming or sizzling, request that it get a quick nuke in the microwave. When to seek emergency care Sometimes food-related illness requires a trip to the emergency room. ""The biggest warning signs are high fever or bloody stool,"" Dr. Baugh says. ""You should also seek emergency care if you have severe dehydration or abdominal pain, if you're unable to keep medications down, or if you have a weakened immune system."" This isn't the time to try to avoid care because you don't want to be a bother to anyone. ""Untreated bacterial food poisoning may progress into a life-threatening condition without antibiotics and intravenous fluids,"" Dr. Baugh says. ""If you're caring for someone with a food-related illness, be on alert for signs and symptoms that suggest they need medical attention.""

https://www.webmd.com/obesity/news/20240730/weight-loss-drugs-also-effective-for-quitting-smoking,Weight Loss Drugs Also Effective for Quitting Smoking,1,"July 30, 2024 – Drugs for diabetes and weight loss like Ozempic and Wegovy show promise in helping people quit smoking, offering a surprising extra benefit for users. Compared to people who took other anti-diabetes drugs, like insulin, those who took semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic) were up to 32% less likely to have medical visits that have to do with tobacco use disorder, according to results published Tuesday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine. Tobacco use disorder is the scientific term for a pattern of tobacco use that indicates dependence or addiction. For the study, researchers analyzed electronic health records of about 6,000 people with type 2 diabetes taking semaglutide, which is marketed under the brand name Ozempic to treat type 2 diabetes, and under the name Wegovy for overweight and obesity-related conditions. To gauge semaglutide’s impact on tobacco addiction, the researchers looked at whether people were diagnosed with tobacco use disorder during medical visits, were prescribed medication for smoking cessation, or whether they were referred to smoking cessation counseling. Besides being less likely to have a medical appointment related to a tobacco use disorder diagnosis, people taking semaglutide were also less likely than those on other anti-diabetes medicines to be prescribed smoking cessation drugs or to be referred for smoking cessation counseling. People with and without obesity appeared to have the benefits similarly. All of the people in the study newly began taking semaglutide between December 2017 and March 2023, and had not used any other anti-diabetes medicines in the year before starting semaglutide. The greatest effects were seen within 30 days of people starting semaglutide, but they continued for about 180 days, after which they typically plateaued. The researchers decided to examine the topic after numerous reports of people taking the medicine saying they had less desire to smoke. The findings are limited in that it was an observational study of people’s health care information and doesn’t reflect actual tobacco usage, cravings, or whether people quit smoking. Quitting smoking is also often linked to weight gain. But the authors noted that their findings are important because smoking is the top preventable cause of early death and contributes to some of the most of common diseases in the world, like heart disease and cancer. Nearly 12% of U.S. adults smoke. The reason that drugs like semaglutide may help people quit smoking is unclear, the authors wrote, but early research points toward the drug’s impact on the brain’s reward system. Other recent studies have linked semaglutide with benefits for people with alcohol use disorder and for people with cannabis use disorder. Further study of the impact of semaglutide on tobacco use is warranted using more rigorous randomized controlled trials, the authors said, noting that these latest findings are not concrete enough to justify off-label use of semaglutide to help people quit smoking.",8,0.12940824,0.21938972,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-i-get-a-calcium-score,Should I get a calcium score?,1,"Q. I'm wondering if I should get a test to check my calcium score. I'm 52 and in good health. My LDL cholesterol level is normal (97 mg/dL), but my father had a heart attack in his late 40s. A. The artery-clogging plaque that builds up inside the heart's arteries contains cholesterol, inflammatory cells, scar tissue, and calcium. A coronary artery calcium scan (often called a calcium score) uses a special type of CT scan to look for that calcium, which is then quantified on a scale from zero to over 1,000. A score of zero indicates no calcified plaque. The higher the score, the more plaque is present. Findings from large studies link higher calcium scores to a higher risk of a heart attack or stroke. While a calcium score can be informative, the scans don't make sense for everyone. Not all cholesterol plaques have become calcified in younger people, so the scans aren't usually recommended for people under 40. Anyone who already has known heart disease doesn't need a calcium scan. That's because the results likely wouldn't change a doctor's treatment recommendations, which would very likely include a statin. However, if you're at risk for heart disease but don't have any symptoms, knowing your calcium score can help you decide whether to start taking a statin. Statins can help lower your risk of heart disease even if your LDL cholesterol is in the normal range. Current guidelines suggest that people estimate their 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease with a calculator from the American College of Cardiology, available at /ascvd. Statins are recommended for people with a score of 7.5% or higher. However, the score doesn't capture other possible situations that may elevate your risk — which include a family history of premature heart disease (defined as coronary artery disease occurring in men younger than 55 or women younger than 65). Calcium scans are readily available, quick, and painless. For the test, you simply lie on your back. The scanner then takes multiple pictures of your heart over the course of about five minutes. It involves some radiation exposure, although not as much as a standard CT scan. The cost (around $100) is usually covered by insurance. But keep in mind that the test isn't mandatory. Another option is to skip the test and simply start taking a statin. But for someone like you, who may have inherited a higher-than-normal heart disease risk, a calcium scan can give you a better sense of your risk and inform your doctor's advice.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/are-you-napping-too-much,Are you napping too much?,1,"A quick catnap can be refreshing and provide just the right reset to keep up your energy and concentration. But what about a lot of little catnaps — or even a great big snooze after every meal? Too much daytime sleeping can indicate a serious health problem. How much is too much? The optimal amount of sleep we need each night is seven to nine hours. Getting more or less than that is linked to cognitive decline, obesity, heart disease, and premature death. A direct cause hasn’t been established conclusively, but there’s growing evidence to suggest that possibility. The same is true of regular napping for long periods. For example, 90-minute daily naps are tied to increased risks for stroke, and two-hour daily naps are associated with an increased risk for dementia. Again, it is unclear whether naps actually cause these problems. Causes of daytime sleeping Many things can lead to excessive daytime sleeping. ""It could simply be that you’re bored because there isn’t much to do. Or maybe you’re bored because you have hearing loss and you’re avoiding group activities,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, associate chief of gerontology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Here are some other reasons that might lead you to sleep more during the day. You’re not sleeping well at night. You may be drowsy in the day if you have insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep) or another condition that keeps you from getting enough rest at night, such as chronic pain, depression, anxiety, an overactive bladder, restless legs syndrome, or sleep apnea (frequent pauses in breathing during sleep). You have an underlying condition. Many conditions can make you tired during the day regardless of how well you slept at night. Examples are very low blood pressure (especially after eating), low thyroid activity, vitamin D or B12 deficiency, anemia, low blood sugar, depression, narcolepsy (sudden episodes of deep sleep), and even obesity. You have frailty syndrome. Frailty includes a loss of muscle mass, stamina, endurance, weight, and general fitness. ""It affects about 25% of people ages 90 or older, and 50% of those 90 or older in nursing homes. One key symptom is fatigue, caused by lower energy production in cells. Eventually, doing any activity can be really exhausting, and the frail person sleeps more and more,"" says Dr. Dae Hyun Kim, a frailty researcher and geriatrician with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Your medication is making you drowsy. Common offenders include prescription medications to treat allergies, depression, high blood pressure (such as alpha blockers and beta blockers), insomnia, nausea, Parkinson’s disease, or seizures, as well as over-the-counter remedies for insomnia, allergies, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. ""And if you’re taking a lot of medications, there might be a drug interaction that’s making you tired,"" Dr. Salamon says. You’re not eating or drinking enough. You need food and fluids to keep up your energy. What you should do Dr. Salamon says you don’t have to do anything about excessive daytime napping if it isn’t bothering you and you’re unconcerned about potential health effects. But if you (or your family) would like to address it, talk to your doctor about hunting for causes. ""It could be that you just need to take your medication at a different time of day,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""For example, if you’re on a diuretic that makes you go to the bathroom a lot at night, you might be able to take it in the morning or afternoon instead of the evening."" If your doctor can’t find any medical causes of daytime sleepiness, you might just need a little more nourishment and activity in your life. ""Try to eat three meals and a couple of snacks each day, and drink four to six cups of fluid,"" Dr. Salamon suggests. ""And figure out a way to stay more engaged. Join a club, take an exercise class, go for a daily walk, or get together with friends,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""Even talking on the phone with someone each day can perk you up."" It will also help to go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day; keep your room cool and dark at night; and avoid caffeine, alcohol, and electronic screens close to bedtime. ""If you need to nap, try to limit it to up to 30 minutes,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""A little napping is normal as we get older, and quick catnaps can recharge your batteries.

This recall follows a warning from the CDC last week that meat from deli counters appeared to be linked to a listeria outbreak, though the agency did not issue a recall at that time. As of July 25, the outbreak had sickened 34 people in 13 states, the USDA said in a news release. Most of those people were hospitalized and two of them died. The USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service was notified that a liverwurst sample collected by the Maryland Health Department as part of the investigation into the outbreak had tested positive for listeria. Testing has not determined if the sample is connected to the multistate outbreak, the USDA said. The ready-to-eat liverwurst products being recalled were produced between June 11 and July 17 and have a 44-day shelf life. The products are: The other ready-to-eat deli meat products were produced on June 27. These deli meat products are being recalled are: The USDA said the products were distributed to retail deli locations nationwide and bear establishment number “EST. 12612” inside the USDA mark of inspection on the labels. Delis owners who purchased the products should not sell them and should discard all opened meat and cheese in the deli, in addition to cleaning surfaces. Consumers who bought the products should not use them and should clean the inside of their refrigerators, the USDA said. Listeria is usually a mild intestinal illness, but sometimes the bacteria spread beyond the gut and cause a severe condition called invasive listeriosis. People ages 65 and older, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Symptoms among pregnant people include fever, muscle aches, and tiredness. Other people may experience those symptoms, too, plus headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or seizures.",4,-0.23804519,0.088022456,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-our-microbes-affect-our-behavior,Do our microbes affect our behavior?,1,"We've known for almost 200 years that trillions of microbes live on our skin and deep inside us, particularly in our gut. Until recently, we thought they were just freeloaders using our bodies to get food and shelter, causing us no trouble. However, we now know that the genes of these microbes (our microbiome) make many chemicals that affect our body and may influence our vulnerability to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, and several degenerative neurological diseases. Recent studies suggest the microbes within us may also influence our behavior. A study published online Dec. 14, 2022, by the journal Nature compared mice that began exercising when given a running wheel to mice that didn't. There were no differences in their genes. However, there were differences in their gut microbiomes. In the exercisers, there were more bacteria that produced a certain chemical. Whenever these mice ran, that chemical sent signals from the gut up to the brain and ignited the brain's reward centers: they got a ""runner's high,"" and took every opportunity to run. Because of their different microbiome, the ""lazy"" mice got no such reward and remained couch potatoes. But when the microbiome of the exercisers was placed inside the lazy mice, they began exercising. If the gut microbiome can influence an animal's motivation to exercise, could that be true in humans? If so, could microbes in our body also affect our motivation to do other things — to use or avoid addictive substances, eat healthier foods, or socialize more readily? Or consider another microbe within us. When various animals are infected with a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii, they are much more likely to engage in risky behaviors. For example, infected gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park are much more likely than uninfected wolves to strike out on their own or to become dominant in the pack — or to die trying. The same fearlessness is seen in other infected animal species. Infected mice, for example, are less likely to avoid cats. Roughly 30% of humans are also infected with this same parasite. Could it possibly affect us the way it affects other animals, turning us into fearless risk takers? Studies have found that infected business school students are considerably more likely to aspire to be entrepreneurs (rather than, say, accountants), and that infected professionals attending events for entrepreneurs are much more likely to have already started their own business. So while the idea is still a long way from being proven, it is possible that the microbes within us not only influence our risk of various diseases but also influence our behavior. Scientists now even consider it conceivable that the microbes within us may influence things like intelligence, attitudes, empathy, who we are attracted to — in short, who we are. image: © Double Brain/Adobe Stock",3,0.2649239,0.043387786,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/gene-editing-a-one-time-fix-for-dangerously-high-cholesterol,Gene editing: A one-time fix for dangerously high cholesterol?,1,"Among your more than 20,000 different genes, one provides instructions for a protein called PCSK9, which helps regulate levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in your bloodstream. About one in 250 people has a variant in this gene that causes LDL cholesterol to skyrocket, sometimes to more than three times the optimal ceiling of 100 mg/dL. This genetic condition, called familial hypercholesterolemia, is the leading cause of premature heart attacks in America. But other people have different PCSK9 gene variants that have the exact opposite effect. Their LDL cholesterol is extraordinarily low—and their risk of heart attack is also far below average. This discovery, made by Dallas Heart Study researchers in 2005, spurred industry scientists to develop drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors (see ""How does PCSK9 affect your cholesterol level?""). ""From a drug development perspective, it was very exciting, because just 10 years later, there were two FDA-approved medications that could dramatically lower LDL,"" says Dr. Pradeep Natarajan, director of preventive cardiology at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. The drugs, alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha), can slash LDL levels by 50%. Taking one of these drugs with a cholesterol-lowering statin can further de-crease a person’s risk of heart attack and related problems by approximately 15% compared with taking a statin alone. How does PCSK9 affect your cholesterol level? The PCSK9 protein acts like a tag that signals LDL receptors to be broken down in liver cells, which means there are fewer receptors to clear LDL from the bloodstream. As a result, LDL levels rise. High LDL accelerates the buildup of fatty plaque in the heart’s arteries, raising heart attack risk. But therapies that either block or prevent the creation of PCSK9 have the opposite effect. More LDL receptors remain active in the liver to remove LDL. Blood levels of LDL plummet, lowering the risk of a heart attack. From inhibition to suppression While taking a statin means swallowing a pill every day, the PCSK9 inhibitors are given by self-injection once or twice a month. But inclisiran (Leqvio), an equally effective drug approved last year, requires an injection just once every six months. Instead of blocking PCSK9 after it’s made, inclisiran prevents the protein from being made in the first place, using a technique called RNA interference. Now, a cutting-edge therapy that uses gene editing to permanently shut down PCSK9 production is being tested in people with familial hypercholesterolemia who’ve already had a heart attack. The CEO of Verve Therapeutics, the company leading the trial, is former Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Sek Kathiresan. To create the therapy, scientists relied on a modification of the powerful gene editing tool called CRISPR, which Dr. Kathiresan describes as ""a molecular pencil and eraser"" that changes a single letter in the instructions for making PCSK9. The one-time infusion contains tiny lipid particles that contain the editing tools, which travel through the blood to the liver. Once there, the particles release their contents, and the editor goes to work in liver cells. Studies in monkeys show that a single infusion lowered blood levels of PCSK9 by 89%, with a corresponding drop in LDL of 61%. Early data from the first human trial should be available later this year. Future possibilities? If the therapy proves to be safe and effective, it could also potentially treat people who don’t have familial hypercholesterolemia but who instead have ""garden variety"" high cholesterol, says Dr. Natarajan. ""People with inactivating PCSK9 variants in both gene copies that lead to LDL values as low as 15 mg/dL are alive and well, which suggests such levels are safe,"" he says. And so far, evidence suggests that PCSK9 gene editing is very specific and without identified ""off-target"" effects in other places on the genome. Despite the many available treatments to reduce LDL, many people don’t take these drugs consistently over the long term for a variety of reasons, such as insurance and access issues. That makes the ""one and done"" option of gene editing especially appealing, particularly since high LDL is very common and an important contributor to cardio-vascular disease, the leading cause of death in this country, Dr. Natarajan says. As the Verve trial moves forward, investigators at Harvard and elsewhere are developing gene editing therapies for other inherited heart conditions, including cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which currently have only limited treatment options.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-beep-program-keep-your-balance-2020031019038,The BEEP program: Keep your balance,1,"Balance is a skill you don't think about until you really need it — like when you lose your footing and have to perform an exotic improv dance to keep from hitting the ground. But don't wait until your sense of balance fails before you give it proper attention. As we age, balance can sharply decline, often with little warning. An exercise program called BEEP can help. How you keep your balance While keeping proper balance may seem simple, it involves a complex system with many moveable parts. Whenever you move, your eyes and brain process information about your surroundings. Your feet detect changes in the terrain. Your arms swing to keep you stable, and your lower-body muscles and joints generate rapid power so you can move forward, stop, and change directions. Unfortunately, this system works less effectively over time. The sensation of our bodies moving through space is not as crisp, and information travels more slowly between the body and brain. Muscles become weaker, and joints lose flexibility. Any breakdown in your balance system increases your risk of falls, which can cause hip fractures, broken bones, and head injuries. ""Doing more balance exercises and activities can keep your sense of balance in good shape, but you also want to focus on multifaceted movements that work on all the elements of your balance system,"" says Dr. Brad Manor, associate director of the Mobility and Falls Translational Research Center with Harvard-affiliated Hebrew SeniorLife. There are many kinds of balance exercises. Science has not tapped any specific ones as the best; however, some have stood out in many balance-related studies. For instance, a 2016 study in the journal Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine found that a specific Balance-Enhancing Exercise Program (called BEEP for short) improved balance skills among adults ages 60 to 80. Study participants did better on both solid and uneven surfaces, and increased their walking speed and overall confidence. Focus on three exercises to improve balance The BEEP program focused on three exercises: squats, heel and calf raises, and one-legged standing. ""These types of exercises increase both the physical and cognition skills needed for better balance,"" says Dr. Manor. ""Plus, they mimic movements of everyday life."" He recommends adding these to your regular workouts or doing them daily on their own. Squats. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and imagine you are sitting down on a stool. Lower down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as far as is comfortable. Keep your weight on your heels. Extend your arms forward or place your hands on a chair, counter, or table for stability. Pause for a second or two, then rise back to the starting position. Do this up to 10 times. Heel and calf raises. Stand with your arms crossed over your chest and lift your heels, so you rise up on your toes. Hold this position for up to 10 seconds, or as long as possible, and then lower your heels. Do this five to 10 times. If you need support, hold on to a door frame, a table, or another sturdy object. You also can place your hands flat on a wall. One-legged standing. Stand tall and place your hands on your hips or hold on to a table or chair for stability. Then raise one leg, so your foot is about six to 12 inches above the floor. Keep your gaze straight ahead. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds. Repeat on the other leg. Go back and forth three to five times. You also can perform these exercises with your eyes closed to work on coordination and concentration. Another option is to ""distract"" yourself by doing unrelated cognitive tasks — count backward, name words that begin with the same letter, or make a mental supermarket list. ""Balance is definitely a use-it-or-lose-it skill,"" says Dr. Manor. ""But if you work on your balance continuously, you are almost guaranteed to see improvements.""",5,0.41276416,-0.12763178,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-04-29-us-birth-rates-record-low-fertility-drops.html,DEPOPULATION: American women are giving birth at record-low rates as fertility falls to 1.62 births per woman in 2023,0,"The United States' fertility rate fell to 1.62 births per woman in 2023 , a two percent decline from a year earlier, according to federal data. This is the lowest fertility rate ever recorded since the government began tracking it in the 1930s. The decline reflects a continuing trend as American women navigate economic and social challenges that have prompted many to delay or outright forgo having children. Those who do get pregnant have fewer children and later in life. At the same time, young people are also more uncertain about their futures and spending more of their income on rent or home ownership, student debt and other essentials. Women in their 20s who are currently delaying having children might have fewer than they would have otherwise wanted to have for reasons economic reasons rather than declining fertility. (Related: Hospitals across the U.S. closing down MATERNITY WARDS due to staff shortages, low birth rates .) “People are making rather reasoned decisions about whether or not to have a child at all,” said Karen Benjamin Guzzo, director of the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . “More often than not, I think what they’re deciding is ‘Yes, I’d like to have children, but not yet.’” Number of births in 2023 lowest in the U.S. since 1979 The number of births last year was the lowest since 1979, according to provisional data. About 3.59 million children were born in the U.S. in 2023, a two percent drop compared with 3.66 million in 2022. The figures are provisional and likely to adjust slightly when final data are released later this year. Human knowledge is under attack!

The total fertility rate peaked during the baby boom after World War II, with a rate of more than three births per woman before falling through the 1960s and 1970s. More recently, the total fertility rate has declined steadily since hitting 2.12 births per woman in 2007, before the financial crisis. The rate in the U.S. has remained generally under or around 2.1 children per woman, or what is known as the “replacement rate,” since the 1970s. A rate of 1.62 in 2023 marks a new low and a sign of years of decline. Births in 2023 were lower than any year since 1979, the data show. U.S. births edged up slightly during and after the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Birthrates declined more for younger women between 2022 and 2023, according to the provisional data, while the rates for women in their 40s were unchanged. Women in their mid- to late-30s are having children at similar rates to those in their early- to mid-20s. Birthrates for women 35 to 39 fell to 54.7 births per 1,000 women – closer to the rates for women ages 20 to 24, which dropped four percent to 55.4 births per 1,000 women in 2023. Some women in their 20s might postpone having children. Despite fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization, egg freezing and artificial insemination, trying to have children later in life can carry lower odds of success and health risks. While birthrates for teenagers aged 15 to 19 continue to decline, they fell just three percent last year – a lower rate than the average seven percent annual decline researchers recorded between 2007 and 2022.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-long-covid-affect-the-gut-202303202903,Can long COVID affect the gut?,1,"Low energy, brain fog, and lung problems are a few of the lingering aftereffects reported by some people who have had COVID-19. Could gut troubles also fall among the constellation of chronic symptoms that people with long-haul COVID experience? And if so, what do experts suggest to help ease this? What happens to the gut during a COVID infection? As we head into the fourth year since COVID-19 became a global health emergency, hundreds of millions of people around the globe have been infected with the virus that causes it. Since 2020, we've known that the virus particles that cause lung illness also infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract: the esophagus, stomach, small intestines, and colon. This can trigger abdominal pain and diarrhea, which often — but not always — clear up as people recover. We know chronic gut problems such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) sometimes occur even after illness caused by microorganisms like Campylobacter and Salmonella are cured. Could this happen with COVID-19? What is long COVID? While most people who get COVID-19 will survive, medical science is becoming aware of a group of people suffering from lasting declines in health. Well-reported long COVID aftereffects include tiredness, breathing difficulty, heart rhythm changes, and muscle pain. But few people, even in the medical field, are aware that long COVID symptoms may include chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain. Why might the gut be involved in long COVID? It is not clear why chronic gut symptoms might occur after a COVID-19 infection. One possible insight is a well-known syndrome called post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that may occur after a stomach flu (gastroenteritis). Long after the bug causing the illness is gone, a change in gut-brain signaling may occur. A complex network of nerves connects the gut and the brain, and controls communication between different parts of the gut. These nerves tell body organs to produce digestive juices, alert you to the need to go to the bathroom, or prevent you from having another serving of stuffing at the Thanksgiving table. The nerve network of the gut is so complicated that it is sometimes called the second brain. When the nerves are working well, you won't notice a thing: you eat without pain, you move your bowels with ease, you have no GI worries. But what if the nerves are not working well? Then, even if the process of digestion remains normal, you may frequently have symptoms like pain or a distressing change in your bowel movements, such as diarrhea or constipation. Once known as functional GI disorders, these health problems are now called disordered gut-brain interactions (DGBIs). When viruses and bacteria infect the gut, experts believe they may prompt a change in gut-brain signaling that can cause a DGBI like IBS to develop. What to do if you're noticing long-lasting gut problems after COVID-19 infection We still do not know conclusively if COVID-19 can cause a long-term change in gut-brain messaging that leads to IBS or other disordered gut-brain interactions. But increasing evidence suggests that GI distress lasting six months or longer might be a symptom of long COVID. While we wait for more evidence, some GI specialists, including myself, recommend trying approaches that help relieve irritable bowel syndrome and other DGBIs. If you are suffering from chronic abdominal pain and a change in your bowel movements after having had COVID-19, talk to your primary care doctor. Many health conditions have similar symptoms, including viral or bacterial infections, inflammation, or even cancers. A thorough exam can help to rule out certain conditions. If the problem persists, do not suffer alone or feel embarrassed to act! Seek help if severe pain or changes in bowel movements are harming your quality of life or affecting daily activities. Talk with your doctor about the possibility that your chronic gut symptoms might be a form of long COVID. Find out if they can recommend helpful treatments or suggest a referral to a GI specialist.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/slowing-down-racing-thoughts-202303132901,Slowing down racing thoughts,1,"Everyone has moments when their brain suddenly goes haywire. They repeatedly fixate on the same thought, like being stuck on a hamster wheel. Or their thoughts aimlessly bounce from one random topic to the next like a pinball. People often refer to these thought patterns as racing thoughts, and the most common cause is anxiety, says Fairlee Fabrett, PhD, a psychologist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""People who struggle with racing thoughts are constantly worried about what needs to be done, what hasn't been done, and what is next,"" says Fabrett. ""Or they obsess about past, present, or future situations."" For example, you replay a conversation with different versions of dialogue, ruminate about an upcoming meeting with your boss or medical appointment, or worry about an unlikely doomsday scenario. ""When racing thoughts take over your mind you can't stay focused, and you feel trapped, which makes you even more anxious and stressed, and the cycle continues,"" says Fabrett. Breaking the cycle of anxiety and racing thoughts How can you break this cycle and keep racing thoughts from controlling you? Here are five strategies to try. Give yourself permission Racing thoughts are often made worse by the anxiety over having racing thoughts. To escape this, give yourself permission to experience them. ""Acknowledge that racing thoughts are just noise, it is what our minds sometimes do, and that's okay,"" says Fabrett. ""This gives you a sense of control so you don't feel helpless. When you put racing thoughts in their proper context, they feel less threatening and easier to manage."" Get mindful Practicing mindfulness can help change your thought patterns. For instance, try counting your breaths. Close your eyes and count to yourself as you take slow, steady breaths: count one on the inhale, two on the exhale, etc. When you reach 10, start over and repeat the process until you calm down. ""This is also a great remedy before sleep when most people's minds begin to ruminate,"" says Fabrett. Also, practice this breath work at times when your thoughts are not racing, so you will have the skill when you need it. Distract yourself You can sometimes break the cycle by distracting your mind. ""As soon as you notice yourself worrying again or thinking about things over and over, make an internal comment to yourself, like 'here I go again, with my list of thoughts that never ends,"" says Fabrett. Then make a conscious decision to do something else, like reading, listening to music, or calling a friend. Get moving It sounds like token health advice — exercise more — but movement is helpful for defusing anxiety. For instance, when an episode of racing thoughts strikes, do a set of push-ups, 10 jumping jacks, take a five-minute walk, or do household chores. ""These not only help break the cycle of racing thoughts but give your mind something else to focus on,"" says Fabrett. Also, try to build regular exercise into your life as well as these short bursts of activity. That can help relieve anxiety and stress. Schedule worry time Sometimes it's best to let racing thoughts run their course; otherwise, they may linger indefinitely. To do this, schedule worry time. When anxious racing thoughts occur, recognize them, but tell yourself that now is not worry time and you will deal with them later. Then at a fixed time of your choosing, do nothing but explore those thoughts and work through them. For example, write down the thoughts that come to mind without editing, including all the worst-case scenarios you can think of. ""You can also talk about them aloud and ask what makes you nervous and why,"" says Fabrett. ""This allows you to confront your anxiety head-on, but on your schedule without taking away from other activities,"" says Fabrett. Set a limit to worry time, like 10 to 20 minutes. When the time is up, you move on. If racing thoughts regularly affect your life or interfere with sleep, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. ""Frequent racing thoughts may be related to anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), trauma, or other mental health issues that need exploring,"" says Fabrett.",7,0.1303558,-0.2118534,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-electrical-brain-stimulation-boost-attention-memory-and-more-202303032898,"Can electrical brain stimulation boost attention, memory, and more?",1,"Imagine this as a morning routine that replaces your first cup of coffee: You wake up feeling a bit foggy, so you slip on a wearable device that looks like an extra-thick headband. You turn on the power source and settle in while electrical current flows into your brain. Twenty minutes later, feeling more focused and energized, you start your busy day feeling grateful for this new technology. If this scenario sounds strange to you, I'm with you. And yet, hype around transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is growing for an expanding list of conditions such as depression, ADHD, and even Alzheimer's disease. A recent ad for one tDCS device urges you to ""elevate your performance."" But before you give this a try, read on. What is transcranial direct current stimulation? Brain stimulation therapies aim to activate or inhibit parts of the brain. tDCS has been around for years, but its popularity has spiked over the last decade. tDCS devices use headgear that may look like a swim cap or headband to position electrodes against the scalp. When a power source is switched on, the electrodes deliver low levels of electrical current to the brain. A typical session lasts 20 to 30 minutes and may be repeated over days or weeks. Three better-known brain stimulation therapies are: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): A device worn over the forehead stimulates specific areas of the brain by changing nearby magnetic fields. TMS is cleared by the FDA to treat depression that hasn't responded to standard medicines, and for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): An electric current flowing through electrodes placed at specific locations on the scalp causes a brief seizure while a patient is under anesthesia. In use since the late 1930s, ECT can be highly effective for severe depression that hasn't responded to standard therapies. It uses higher levels of electrical current than tDCS. That's why it requires close medical supervision and is generally administered in a hospital or specialized clinic. Deep brain stimulation (DBS): Electrodes surgically implanted in specific areas of the brain generate electrical pulses. DBS is used to treat conditions such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, or tremors that don't improve with medicines. What claims are made for tDCS? The brain normally functions by sending and receiving tiny electrical signals between nerve cells. Stimulating specific regions of the brain with low levels of electricity might improve focus or memory, mood, or even dementia, according to tDCS advocates. Some claims say tDCS can improve mental clarity, focus, and memory increase energy and motivation relieve so-called brain fog following COVID-19, Lyme disease, or other conditions reduce depression or anxiety reduce cravings among smokers or people with drug addiction improve symptoms of ADHD or Alzheimer's disease. Does tDCS work? The jury is still out. Research suggests that tDCS holds promise for certain conditions, but techniques tested through research may differ from devices sold commercially for at-home use. For example, electrodes may be positioned more precisely over an area of the brain, and how current is delivered, session length, or number of sessions may differ. Currently, small, short-term studies show that tDCS may benefit people with: Depression: An analysis of 10 randomized trials found some participants were more likely to report fewer symptoms of depression, or remission of depression, after a course of tDCS treatment compared with sham treatment. Alzheimer's disease: A review of seven studies found that tDCS lasting 20 to 40 minutes improved memory and other cognitive measures in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. ADHD: One randomized trial of 64 adults with ADHD found improved attention after 30 minutes of tDCS daily for a month. The FDA has not cleared tDCS for any health condition, and it is considered investigational. More research with positive results and reassuring safety data are needed before tDCS gets a thumbs-up from regulators. That's probably why some ads for tDCS note in fine print that it is not a medical device and is only for recreational use. Does tDCS have downsides? While the FDA assesses tDCS as safe for adults, there are downsides to consider. For example, treatment may cause itching, irritation, or small burns at the sites of the electrodes. Some users complain of fatigue or headache. There are no large, long-term studies of tDCS, so overall safety is uncertain. Some experts believe at-home use raises many questions, such as how much of the brain beyond targeted areas is affected, what inconsistent approaches to tDCS use might do, and how long changes in the brain — intended or not — could last. Very limited research has been done in children. So, the consequences for a child's developing brain aren't clear. Finally, tDCS devices can be expensive (several hundred dollars or more), and generally are not covered by health insurance. The bottom line It's not yet clear how tDCS should be used, or who is most likely to benefit from it. If you're interested in pursuing tDCS, understand that there's still a lot we don't know. If you're more skeptical and risk-averse (like me), you may want to wait for more definitive research regarding its benefits and risks — and for now, stick with your morning coffee to clear your mind.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/short-on-slumber,Short on slumber,1,"If you use an alarm clock to wake up, it's a good bet you're sleep deprived. But what if you feel fine when that buzzer, bell, or blast of music rouses you? You're probably still not getting all the sleep you need — the fundamental definition of sleep deprivation — or you wouldn't have required the jolt. You would have woken up by yourself already. ""You can keep eating when you're not hungry, but you can't keep sleeping if you're not tired,"" says Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night, according to the National Sleep Foundation, but more than 35% of American adults report consistently sleeping less than seven hours. Moreover, nearly half of Americans say they feel sleepy during the day between three and seven days a week — meaning they're likely not getting enough nighttime rest. Women have particular problems with getting sufficient sleep, regardless of how much time we spend in bed; our lifetime risk of insomnia (difficulty falling or staying asleep) is up to 40% higher than that of men. And things are only getting worse. ""When we examine the data that tell us how much people have been sleeping over the last century, it's clear we're sleeping less and less,"" says Dr. Ina Djonlagic, a neurologist at the Sleep Disorders Center at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Being short on slumber can make us dopey, sluggish, cranky, and forgetful. But consistently getting less sleep than we need can lead to serious health problems that go far beyond a day's bad mood. ""Sleep deprivation affects basically everything,"" Dr. Klerman says. Reasons for poor sleep Why aren't many of us sleeping enough? Some reasons are habit-based and therefore controllable. Often, Harvard experts say, we simply don't set aside enough time for sleep and allow work or other commitments to intrude. ""For some parents, bedtime is finally their 'me' time when they start to watch movies and do things they enjoy at the expense of sleep,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. ""And it's not just bedtime procrastination; some people get up really early to go to the gym to have time for themselves."" Some also carry a misguided sense of pride in not ""needing"" sleep, boasting about how little they get — as if it's a virtue. ""It's almost like a competition, and there's certainly this idea that if you sleep a lot you're a bit lazy and less productive,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. But some contributors to a lack of shuteye are indeed out of our control, making sound sleep an unattainable dream. They include pregnancy menopause-related night sweats certain medications sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome ailments such as chronic pain, cancer, depression, or dementia. Threats to health and safety Whatever the cause, skipping shut-eye can be disastrous. ""The immediate effect of sleep deprivation is a lack of alertness that can translate into more accidents in cars and other situations,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. About one in 25 adults falls asleep at the wheel each month, according to the CDC, while 6,000 fatal car crashes per year are due to drowsy driving. And a new analysis provides eye-popping insight into how our health can suffer for decades to come. Published online Oct. 18, 2022, by the journal PLOS Medicine, the study showed that healthy 50-year-olds who sleep five hours or less each weeknight have a 30% higher risk of developing two or more chronic health conditions over the next 25 years compared with peers who sleep seven hours. By age 70, that risk climbs to 40% in those with the same scanty sleep pattern. The study tracked nearly 8,000 British people from 1985 to 2016, none of whom had multiple chronic diseases at the start. A quarter-century later, researchers observed far higher risks of multiple conditions such as diabetes, cancer, coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney or liver disease, depression, dementia, Parkinson's disease, and arthritis in those who logged five hours of sleep or less. Other recent research has zeroed in on sleep deprivation's effects on specific conditions. A study published online Nov. 2, 2022, by The Science of Diabetes Self-Management and Care suggests that people who report trouble sleeping are likelier to have markers—including higher cholesterol, greater body weight, and more inflammation—that contribute to diabetes. The study involved more than 1,000 Australian adults (average age 45). There's also a higher risk of obesity among people averaging less than seven hours of sleep each night, according to a 2018 study in the journal BMJ Open Sport and Exercise Medicine. ""Hunger hormones are involved, but when we're tired or sleepy we gravitate more to foods that give us energy, such as carbohydrates,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. Our brains suffer, too. A study published in the November 2022 issue of Sleep that tracked more than 26,000 people ages 45 through 85 over three years showed those with insomnia faced greater risks of memory decline and dementia. ""We know there's a link between sleep and our ability to flush out brain toxins, such as amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. ""Sleep deprivation may also speed up the process for those destined to develop the disease."" Don't despair if you tend to operate on a sleep deficit. It might not be too late to turn around any deprivation-driven health trends, Dr. Klerman says. ""I want to believe if you start getting more sleep now, your body will begin repairing all the things that happened when you didn't sleep enough,"" she says. Tactics for sounder sleep Sleep feels good, so deciding to get more should theoretically be easy. But many of us don't cultivate the environment and set of habits known as sleep hygiene that promote sounder slumber. To accomplish that, Harvard experts offer these tips. Keep a consistent schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. But if there are nights you haven't slept enough before rising for school or work, it's okay to allow yourself to sleep longer on mornings when that's possible, Dr. Klerman says. Exercise earlier in the day. For some, exercising too close to bedtime can keep them up or fuel insomnia. Ease into sleep. ""We're good at helping little children do this by reading books and taking warm baths, but it's helpful for adults too,"" says Dr. Djonlagic. ""Light and stimulation are the biggest enemies to getting to sleep on time. Put everything aside and read a book in dim light or do something relaxing."" Use your bed for only two things. ""You should associate your bed with sleep or sex, not paying the bills,"" Dr. Klerman says. Ramp down caffeine use. This stimulant has a half-life of five hours in most adults, meaning your body will eliminate about half the caffeine you've consumed in that time, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. It's wise to avoid it after lunchtime. Why do we sleep? If sleep isn't a biological necessity, it's the biggest mistake evolution ever made. So said Allan Rechtschaffen, a pioneer of modern sleep research. His musings make sense, since by sleeping we spend about one-third of our lives inert, not reproducing or being productive in any other way. So why do we sleep? Scientists don't yet fully know the answer. But they do know that while we lie quiet, our brain and body are busy. Research has shown that this period of seeming inactivity serves to fine-tune physiological fundamentals such as metabolism, immune function, and more. We also process memories and wake feeling ready to focus on the day ahead. ""We think sleep serves multiple purposes,"" says Dr. Ina Djonlagic, a neurologist at the Sleep Disorders Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""It's almost like your body is processing things on a deeper level."" Skip the nightcap. Alcohol's sedative effects help us fall asleep quickly — but that effect wears off later in the night, making us more likely to toss and turn. More than one alcoholic drink each day lowers sleep quality in women by nearly 40%, according to the National Sleep Foundation. Put away devices. Blue light from cellphones, tablets, and computers can interfere with our circadian rhythm, the internal body clock that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Blue light–filtering glasses can help stem these effects, as can built-in filters available on some devices. Better yet, avoid using electronic devices for an hour or longer before bedtime. Let natural light in. Don't use blackout shades in your bedroom, Dr. Klerman advises. ""If you want to stay in sync with the world, you want the morning light to help you wake up,"" she says. Room-darkening shades can be helpful for people with chronic insomnia, however. Avoid using sleep aids for more than a night or two. It's tempting to take sleeping pills, but they carry major risks—especially as we age and are more prone to falls. They should only be used for a specific short-term reason (such as problems sleeping after a stressful event). Taken for longer, sleep aids tend to lose effectiveness within a few weeks and can backfire, disrupting sleep. People with chronic sleep problems can try a form of cognitive behavioral therapy that's geared toward insomnia (called CBT-i), ""which has been shown to work better than drugs,"" Dr. Klerman says. Another proactive step: try tracking your vacation sleep habits — the amount of shut-eye you log when you're not working for a week or two and are unencumbered by normal routines. ""That's usually how much sleep you actually need,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. ""Unfortunately, few people will make it a priority to get that amount during normal times.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-wont-my-hives-go-away,Why won't my hives go away?,1,"Q. I've gotten hives from time to time when I've been overly stressed. But now I have a case that won't quit after six weeks. What's going on? A. No one welcomes these red, itchy welts that crop up on our skin. Many things can lead to a temporary case of hives, including allergic reactions to food, medications, bug bites, pollen, latex, or animal dander. Like you, some people also develop them when they're stressed, or in response to ultraviolet light or excess skin pressure. Hives are more common in women than men, especially from our 30s to 50s. Most cases of hives go away within several days to a couple of weeks. If they last six weeks or longer, you may have autoimmune hives. This happens when your immune system mistakenly targets healthy tissue — in this case, triggering a skin reaction. Autoimmune hives are more common in people with other autoimmune conditions, such as lupus, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or celiac disease. Anyone whose hives last longer than a few weeks should see a doctor. Image: © chokja/Getty Images",0,0.10046582,-0.1404974,True

Researchers recruited 60 people diagnosed with high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that raises the risk of heart problems and stroke. Participants were randomly divided into two groups. For three months, everyone did 30 minutes of aerobic exercise five days a week followed by either 15 minutes of yoga or 15 minutes of regular muscle stretching. Over the course of the study, people in both groups improved their resting blood pressure and resting heart rate (the number of heartbeats in a minute), although the yoga practitioners did better. Those in the yoga group also lowered their systolic blood pressure (the top number in a reading) by 10 points, compared with just 4 points for the stretching group. And they significantly reduced their 10-year risk for a heart attack or stroke compared with the stretching group. The investigators speculated that yoga's calming effect may be its advantage. They noted that other research has shown yoga helps decrease levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The results were published in December 2022 in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology.

Here is a simple meditation to get you going. Try it every other day for five to 10 minutes. and build toward a daily practice: Sit quietly in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take a full, deep breath, hold it briefly, and then exhale completely. Repeat several times until you reach a steady, calm breathing pattern. Relax all your muscles in sequence, beginning with your feet, lower legs, and thighs. Shrug your shoulders and roll your neck to the left and then right. Then on each exhalation, say to yourself or out loud the word ""peace,"" ""love,"" or any other short, positive mantra. Don't get discouraged when your thoughts wander (they will). Go back to the pattern of repeating the mantra each time you exhale. You can also practice brief meditation throughout your day. For example: Be mindful during chores. Focus your complete attention on doing routine tasks. Do walking meditation. Match your footsteps to your inhalations and exhalations. For example, take four steps as you inhale and four steps as you exhale. Take a moment. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths before starting your car or heading into a store.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-skinny-on-fatty-liver,The skinny on fatty liver,1,"The liver is your body's largest internal organ. About the size of a football and weighing around 3 pounds, the liver performs more than 500 functions. Some of its daily tasks include producing cholesterol, creating bile to help digest fats, and filtering deadly toxins from the blood. (Also, the liver holds about a pint of your body's blood supply at any given moment.) Despite its prowess, the liver is not invulnerable to illness. One of its greatest threats is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common liver disease worldwide. ""NAFLD affects about 24% of U.S. adults, but most of them are unaware of the condition, in part because it rarely causes symptoms early on,"" says Dr. Howard LeWine, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief medical editor of Harvard Health Publishing. Diabetes and obesity are the main risk factors for all forms of fatty liver disease. In fact, about 75% of people with one or both of these conditions have some form of NAFLD. Types of NAFLD NAFLD is an umbrella term that includes several forms of liver disease. Most people with NAFLD have a type known as simple fatty liver, or steatosis — excessive fat buildup in the liver not caused by overuse of alcohol, medication side effects, or genetic disease. However, up to 20% of people with NAFLD develop inflammation in the liver known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Left unchecked, this more dangerous form can progress into fibrosis (scarring) and potentially cirrhosis (severe scarring and liver damage). ""The exact reasons why some people progress to this inflammation stage is unknown,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""However, an abnormally large waist size reflecting greater amounts of visceral fat — belly fat that surrounds our abdominal organs — appears to be an important risk factor."" Simple fatty liver and NASH are often detected not from the appearance of symptoms, but rather from an imaging test, such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan, conducted for another reason, like gallstones. Other times routine blood work shows abnormal liver values, which usually means there is inflammation characteristic of NASH. But up to 50% of people with NASH have normal blood tests for liver function. Primary care clinicians now have readily available, noninvasive ways to identify people at higher risk for NASH and early fibrosis. These include biomarker measurements and scoring systems based on blood tests (like the NAFLD fibrosis score and the Fibrosis-4 index). ""The Fibrosis-4 index is a simple calculation based on common blood test results and a person's age,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""The index provides guidance regarding treatment and when to refer to a liver specialist."" Another technology, called elastography, uses sound waves to estimate fibrosis based on the stiffness of the liver. A weighty issue There are no specific FDA-approved medicines for any stage of NAFLD. Therefore, lifestyle modifications are the best approach. Because a majority of people with NAFLD are overweight or even obese, weight management is the No. 1 action people can take to avoid NAFLD and keep simple fatty liver from turning into NASH, says Dr. LeWine. Weight loss can also protect people from other health risks common in people with NAFLD, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease. ""Even men who are slightly overweight should be mindful about their weight, as any gradual increase can send them in the wrong direction and increase their risk for NAFLD,"" says Dr. LeWine. If you are overweight, weight loss of roughly 5% of your body weight might be enough to decrease the fat in the liver. Losing between 7% and 10% of body weight can reduce the amount of inflammation and injury to liver cells, and it may even reverse some of the fibrosis. Target a gradual weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week. For people with diabetes and those unable to attain their goal weight, your doctor may recommend drugs known to induce weight loss, such as the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide (Wegovy). Keep in mind that normal-weight people also can get NAFLD. ""Where your body fat lies, especially around the belly, is also a strong indicator of NAFLD risk,"" says Dr. LeWine. One way to measure potential risk is waist size. ""An ideal waist size for men is no more than half their height, so a six-foot man's waist should not exceed 36 inches,"" says Dr. LeWine. What you eat, how you move Although any diet that promotes weight loss helps NAFLD, a low-calorie Mediterranean-style diet is an excellent choice. This nutrition plan emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and olive oil. Limit red meat; eat more fatty fish and lean poultry instead. While you're considering which foods to add to your diet, follow the motherly advice to eat your vegetables. A 2020 study found a link between eating a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables (such as kale, cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts) and a reduced risk of NASH. Drinking coffee also may offer some protection from NAFLD. Some studies have found an association between regular coffee consumption (about three to four daily cups) and a lower risk of progression from simple fatty liver to NASH and fibrosis. Research shows that regular exercise, independent of weight loss, also can directly help prevent and manage NAFLD. An analysis in the October 2021 issue of Frontiers in Nutrition found that exercise can reduce fat throughout the body, and especially visceral fat, the more dangerous deep layer of fat associated with liver inflammation. Research suggests that both aerobic and anaerobic exercise (like high-intensity interval training and strength training) are good for people with NAFLD. One study found that 20 to 60 minutes of moderate aerobic and anaerobic exercise, done three to four days per week, helped reduce liver fat and reverse liver damage in NASH patients.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-04-26-covid-vaccine-protection-children-plummets-within-months.html,CDC study: COVID-19 vaccine claimed protection of children PLUMMETS within months,0,"Children injected with the original version of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine have ended up having little protection against hospitalization within months , according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study, which the CDC published in the April 18 edition of its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), focused on children five to 18 years old injected with two or more doses of the original Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines from Dec. 19, 2021 through Oct. 29, 2023. The vaccinated children who were hospitalized with acute COVID-19 and tested positive for the illness were compared to a control group of children hospitalized with COVID-19-like symptoms, but who tested negative. According to the paper, children initially have 52 percent protection against hospitalization after being injected with the COVID-19 vaccine. But that estimated effectiveness plummeted to 19 percent after four months. Protection against so-called critical illness also dropped from 57 percent to 25 percent in the same period, the paper added. The researchers asserted that the results highlight the current CDC guidance that all people aged six months and older should receive one of the newest COVID-19 vaccines. The injections were introduced in the fall of 2023 with clinical data from just 50 humans, and no efficacy estimates. (Related: Study links Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to VAIDS in children .) ""The CDC only publishes papers in its weekly digest, the [MMWR], after they're shaped to 'comport with CDC policy,'"" according to the Epoch Times . ""The papers are not peer-reviewed.""

CDC Senior Epidemiologist Laura Zambrano served as the first author of the study. However, she did not issue a response when asked for data suggesting that the currently available vaccines provide longer-lasting protection than the original versions. Study contradicts CDC claims of COVID-19 injections being effective In its bid to promote vaccination, the public health agency's website states that COVID-19 injections are ""effective at protecting people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized and dying."" However, the page that ostensibly supports the statement is no longer live. That, alongside the April 18 MMWR study, contradicts the CDC's claim of COVID-19 vaccines being effective. U.S. authorities have been moving COVID-19 vaccines to a once-a-year model, similar to influenza vaccines. The model features updating the formulation of the vaccines on an annual basis – an acknowledgment that any protection the vaccines give quickly wanes. The formulation is typically updated in the fall, when cases often see a surge due to the colder weather the following winter season. Just 14 percent of children and 23 percent of adults have received one of the newest vaccines as of April 6, according to CDC estimates. The available vaccines are messenger RNA (mRNA) shots from Pfizer and Moderna and an alternative from Novavax. Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) Executive Director Dr. Jane Orient noted that the maximum effectiveness against hospitalization is estimated at 61 percent. The paper also mentioned that more deaths were recorded among the case patients, and that the median hospitalization duration was four days for both groups. ""I do not see how a clinician whose concern is treating patients and whose job does not depend on pushing mRNA vaccines would find this a basis for recommending shots – quite the contrary,"" Orient told the Epoch Times in an email.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/a-closer-look-at-good-cholesterol,A closer look at good cholesterol,1,"Managing blood cholesterol levels is one way to avoid cardiovascular disease and protect against heart attacks and strokes. Doctors concentrate on helping men lower their blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol. Too much LDL in the bloodstream can create plaque buildup inside arteries. If this buildup blocks blood flow to the heart or brain, the result is a heart attack or stroke. Your goal level for LDL depends on your risk factor profile. In general, the lower the number, the better. If you already have cardiovascular disease or are at high risk for it, you should aim for an LDL of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). For people at average risk, achieving a level of less than 100 mg/dL with lifestyle changes is excellent. You and your doctor can decide if you need a statin or other medication to lower your LDL further. But what about LDL's cholesterol counterpart, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the ""good"" cholesterol? ""HDL tends to get lost in the cholesterol conversation, but it plays a vital role in heart health, so it's important to also monitor HDL while you manage LDL,"" says Dr. Frank Sacks, professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. When is good HDL too good? HDL is considered ""good"" because it does the good work. It patrols blood vessels, collects excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and artery walls, and delivers it to the liver, where it's removed from the body. This ongoing action prevents dangerous plaque buildup. Guidelines recommend an HDL level of 40 mg/dL to 60 mg/dL for adult men. ""A level below 40 mg/dL could mean that there is not enough HDL to do its job properly,"" says Dr. Sacks. Since HDL is deemed ""good,"" it would make sense that higher amounts equal extra protection. But research has found that this is not necessarily true, and that HDL levels beyond 80 mg/dL don't offer additional benefits. Higher HDL might not always be effective because it needs help to do its job. Research suggests that HDL's protective role depends partly on the levels of LDL and triglycerides (a type of blood fat that helps make up your lipid profile). One study that looked at people with both low and high HDL levels and those with normal and high levels of LDL and triglycerides discovered that for optimal protection against cardiovascular disease, there needs to be healthy levels for all three. Do you need advanced lipid testing? Doctors use lipid panels to measure cholesterol levels, screen people for cardiovascular disease risk, and monitor treatments. Yet, sometimes more detailed cholesterol information is needed. This requires advanced lipid testing to measure apolipoprotein B (apoB), the main protein in LDL. Research has suggested that higher amounts of apoB can signal greater risk. But not everyone needs this test. ""For the average person with high LDL or total cholesterol, the additional details won't materially alter their diagnosis or treatment,"" says Dr. Frank Sacks, professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. However, specific individuals may benefit, he adds. These include people who've had a recent stroke or heart attack without any apparent risk factors, such as high LDL, high blood pressure, diabetes, or smoking, and men diagnosed with cardiovascular disease before age 55. On the rise A standard blood test called a lipid panel measures a person's total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. Specific individuals may benefit from advanced lipid testing (see ""Do you need advanced lipid testing?""). The results help assess cardiovascular disease risk and dictate if treatment is needed. Addressing high LDL is always the first priority, but if you have concerningly low HDL levels — less than 40 mg/dL — your doctor likely will recommend lifestyle changes, according to Dr. Sacks. ""While a person's HDL level is predominantly determined by genetics, certain habits can cause HDL levels to drop,"" he says. Here are some strategies that people with low HDL should adopt. Exercise more. Moderate-intensity exercise, like brisk walking for at least 30 minutes three times a week, can help boost HDL. High-intensity interval training also can help. Lose weight. If overweight, aim to lose 5% to 10% of your current weight. Cut back on refined carbohydrates. Switch from refined carbohydrates (white bread, white pasta) to whole grains (oats, whole-wheat pasta, brown rice) and add lean protein to your diet, like poultry, tofu, beans, and lentils. Limit alcohol. Keep your intake, if any, to one to two drinks daily. Stop smoking. If needed, seek out medical assistance to quit.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-dark-side-of-daylight-saving-time,The dark side of daylight saving time,1,"On March 12, most Americans will observe the start of daylight saving time (DST) and ""spring forward"" by setting their clocks one hour ahead. (The exceptions are people living in Arizona and Hawaii.) DST lasts from mid-March until early November when the clocks turn back an hour and return to standard time. During DST, people can enjoy more time in the sunlight in the evenings. But that convenience comes at a price. ""That one-hour change may not seem like much, but it can wreak havoc on people's mental and physical well-being in the short term,"" says Dr. Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School's Division of Sleep Medicine. Go toward the light Research suggests that changing our clocks twice a year can have various health consequences. Of the two, springing ahead one hour tends to be more disruptive. That hour change can upset our circadian rhythms, the body's natural 24-hour cycles regulating key functions like appetite, mood, and sleep. Circadian rhythms largely depend on light exposure. The hour transition in the spring initially causes darker mornings and lighter evenings. Less morning light can decrease levels of the mood-boosting hormone serotonin. In contrast, exposure to light later in the evening can delay the production of melatonin, the hormone that helps you fall asleep. Many people also have trouble adjusting their sleep schedule to the new time. For the first few days or even a week, they may go to bed later or wake up earlier than usual, which can cause sleep deprivation. One study found that the average person gets 40 minutes less sleep on the Monday after DST begins compared with other nights of the year. ""Disrupted sleep can cause people to feel fatigued, groggy, and less focused,"" says Dr. Czeisler. This may explain, in part, the 6% rise in car accidents following the spring time change, according to a 2020 study in the journal Current Biology. Poor sleep caused by DST also can exacerbate existing problems like depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder. Is the end of daylight saving near? Present-day daylight saving time (DST) was officially adopted in 1966. Proponents believe the semiannual time change means people can enjoy outdoor activities longer, save energy by using less electricity for lighting, and perhaps have a positive economic impact. But DST has its critics. A 2022 poll found that 61% of Americans favored ending DST. Also, many sleep experts say evidence strongly suggests that staying on standard time all year is healthier. A bill to eliminate the time change has been introduced in the past three Congressional sessions but has not yet made it into law. It remains to be seen whether legislators will reintroduce it. Prepare for the switch People can take steps to make the hour change less daunting to their bodies and mind. Dr. Czeisler offers several different approaches: Alter your bedtime. About three days before the time change, go to bed and wake up 10 to 15 minutes earlier than usual. The next night, aim for 20 to 30 minutes, and then 30 to 45 minutes on the third night. ""By the end of this period, your body would have adjusted to that lost hour, and you won't have the stress of trying to quickly catch up on sleep,"" says Dr. Czeisler. Take afternoon naps. If you feel tired in the afternoons after DST starts, take scheduled midday naps for 20 to 30 minutes (napping longer than that can make you feel even more groggy). Get more light. During the first week after the time change, try to get about 15 minutes of exposure to morning light, which can help maintain your circadian rhythms. Another option is to use a light box that produces a bright white light. Choose a light box with 10,000 lux exposure (lux is a measure of light intensity). Sit about 12 inches away for up to 30 minutes. Keep your eyes open, but don't look directly at the light. Spend the time reading, writing, or just being present. Delay your day. For several days after the time change, postpone beginning your daily routine for an hour. For example, if you go for your morning walk at 8 a.m., wait until 9 a.m. ""Your internal clock is still running an hour behind, so you give it a chance to adjust,"" says Dr. Czeisler. Gradually shorten your start time by 10 or 15 minutes; within a week, your body's clock should be reset to the new time. Curb the alcohol and caffeine. Cut back on drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages several days before and after the time change, as they can disrupt your sleep. Image: © ljubaphoto/Getty Images",5,0.16151854,-0.1261189,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-04-25-water-suppliers-iowa-drinking-water-forever-chemicals.html,At least a dozen water suppliers in Iowa are still providing residents with drinking water contaminated with “forever chemicals”,0,"At least 12 community drinking water supplies in Iowa are unacceptably contaminated with ""forever chemicals"" linked to various health ailments. This warning comes as the Environmental Protection Agency implements new drinking water standards that limit certain per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as PFAS or forever chemicals, to almost none. Officials say this will reduce exposure for 100 million people and help prevent thousands of illnesses, including cancers. ""It's the first time in more than a decade that the EPA has issued a new regulation that will require Iowa water suppliers to reduce or eliminate a contaminant for public safety,"" said Corey McCoid, an Iowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR) supervisor who oversees water supply compliance. ""It's a big deal."" (Related: Biden admin approves more stringent rules covering “forever chemicals” in drinking water ). ""Everyone can agree we need to get these things out of our water,"" said David Cwiertny, a University of Iowa engineering professor and director of the university's Center for Health Effects of Environmental Contamination. ""We're still understanding health effects, but what we know is not good."" PFAS have been used for decades in products including non-stick pans, firefighting foam and waterproof clothing. Although some of the most common types are phased out in the United States, others remain. Water providers will now be forced to remove contamination put in the environment by other industries. The new rules limit the amount of two common types of PFAS – PFOA and PFOS – that can be detected in drinking water to four parts per trillion. Three other types of PFAS including GenEx chemicals are limited to 10 parts per trillion. Human knowledge is under attack!

Within five years, water providers will have to test for these PFAS chemicals and tell the public when levels are too high. Combinations of some PFAS types will be limited, too. ""We've got a lot of communities that are going to need to figure out how to address this,"" Cwiertny said. Thousands of Iowans possibly exposed to unsafe levels of PFAS in their water The Iowa DNR started testing community water supplies for PFAS in 2021. Results available online show 14 water systems, including cities and mobile home parks, whose water tested over four parts per trillion. In other places, PFAS were detected, but below the threshold. In many other places, including Iowa City and Cedar Rapids, PFAS were not found in the public water supply. PFAS persists in the environment indefinitely and can accumulate in people’s bodies, potentially causing a variety of illnesses and cancers. They are used in numerous products for their ability to repel oil and water, and the vast majority of Americans are believed to have detectable amounts of them in their blood. Common sources of significant contamination include manufacturers such as 3M Company, landfills and airports and other sites where firefighting foam has been used. The new federal regulation will generally require water supplies that regularly serve at least 25 people to test for PFAS within the next three years and to mitigate its contamination within five years. That can be accomplished by finding alternate water sources or installing equipment to remove the chemicals. DNR testing in recent years of water supplies that are most likely to be contaminated has revealed 12 that will be affected by the new rules, McCoid said. They include utilities that provide drinking water for residents of Buffalo, Burlington, Camanche, Davenport, Dubuque, Muscatine, Osage, Sioux City and Tama. Also affected are the Kammerer Mobile Home Park and Bayer Crop Science near Muscatine, and a seasonal campground near Bellevue called Peteschs that has some year-round residents. Several cities with contaminated water have already worked toward fixing the problem, even if their PFAS concentrations are below the new federal threshold, McCoid said. They include Ames, Burlington, Central City, Rock Valley and Tama. Burlington, which draws water from the Mississippi River, might spend about $20 million on a well field and water treatment improvements, McCoid said. It’s possible that further testing will reveal PFAS contamination in other water supplies , McCoid added. There are about 1,100 community supplies in Iowa that are subject to the new federal regulation, and the DNR has yet to test about 800 of them. McCoid expects that a handful more might be contaminated.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-new-diabetes-drugs-your-best-shot-for-weight-loss,The new diabetes drugs: Your best shot for weight loss?,1,"A weekly injection that leads to dramatic weight loss without serious side effects almost sounds too good to be true. But several drugs originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes can help people shed as much as 20% of their body weight — far more than other anti-obesity drugs. Known as incretin mimetics, they also improve blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Not surprisingly, these medications are in high demand, especially semaglutide (for a list of these drugs and their brand names, see ""Diabetes and anti-obesity drugs""). This has led to shortages of certain formulations. That's just one of the issues faced by people hoping to take these drugs, which are costly — around $1,000 to $1,500 per month — and not covered by Medicare for obesity (although some private insurers cover them). Who's a good candidate for these medications, and what else should people know about them? Diabetes and anti-obesity drugs Poisonous lizards known as Gila monsters have a unique ability to maintain steady blood sugar levels even after long stretches of not eating. Venom from this colorful creature inspired the development of exenatide (Byetta), the first in a class of drugs known as incretin mimetics. Today, there are more effective drugs that mimic an incretin called GLP-1. These injectable drugs include dulaglutide (Trulicity), liraglutide (Victoza), and semaglutide (Ozempic); the latter is also available as a pill called Rybelsus. Liraglutide and semaglutide are also approved for weight loss, in formulations marketed respectively as Saxenda and Wegovy. The newest addition to this drug family combines GLP-1 and another incretin mimic, GIP. Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) was approved for treating type 2 diabetes in May 2022 and tagged for accelerated review for approval to treat obesity, which is anticipated sometime in 2023. Overlapping risks Up to half of all new-onset diabetes cases in this country are linked to obesity, a disease that now affects more than 40% of Americans. Both conditions are closely linked to cardiovascular disease. ""Many cardiologists now recognize that treating obesity is the best way to treat heart disease,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, who co-directs the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Other anti-obesity drugs help people lose only about 5% to 8% of their body weight. But the incretin mimics, which are similar to hormones made naturally by the gut and brain, have multiple effects. They prod the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar rises too high, slow down the emptying of the stomach, and target brain receptors involved in reducing appetite. The newest ones, tirzepatide and semaglutide, can lead to remarkable weight loss and also lower HbA1c levels (a three-month average measure of blood sugar) by as much as two percentage points. ""Studies also show that semaglutide and liraglutide, an older drug, can lower the risk of serious cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack and stroke, in people with obesity and diabetes,"" says Dr. Apovian. A large trial to see whether semaglutide lowers heart-related risks in people without diabetes who are overweight or obese is currently under way, she adds. Who might consider these drugs? People with diabetes who are carrying excess weight are good candidates for semaglutide or tirzepatide, especially those at high risk for heart disease, Dr. Apovian says. For people without diabetes, the official criteria for prescribing the drugs are the same as for all other anti-obesity drugs: a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, or a BMI of 27 or higher and at least one weight-related health problem, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. (See the calculator at /bmi-calculator to estimate your BMI.) Taking these drugs involves injecting yourself in the abdomen or thigh using a penlike device with a tiny needle the size of a human hair. Side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, and constipation are common. But they rarely last longer than a week or so, especially if you start low and increase the dosage slowly while guided by an experienced physician, says Dr. Apovian. If you stop taking the drug, you'll likely regain weight. But that's similar to what would happen if you were taking blood pressure medication and stopped — your blood pressure would rise. ""Obesity is a disease, and we need to treat it like one,"" says Dr. Apovian. Image: © Ariel Skelley/Getty Images",8,0.17642362,0.19777153,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/exercising-when-you-have-a-heart-condition,Exercising when you have a heart condition,1,"You just discovered you need surgery to replace a faulty heart valve. Or maybe you've had a heart attack, or were recently diagnosed with mild heart failure. Learning that you have heart disease is understandably upsetting. But don't let fear or worry keep you from taking steps to heal and strengthen your heart. ""For a lot of people, a heart attack is a wake-up call. But for others, it's more like a red light,"" says Dr. Hicham Skali, associate director of the cardiac rehabilitation program at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Instead of starting or renewing efforts to exercise, they stop or avoid physical activity. ""Some people believe that a heart condition means they should be careful and rest, but that's a major misconception,"" says Dr. Skali. Exercise is one of the most important things you can do to prevent all types of heart disease from getting worse — not to mention avoiding heart problems in the first place. ""As long as you're exercising safely, there's far more benefit than risk,"" says Dr. Skali. Your age, current fitness level, and diagnosis will influence what makes the most sense for you. But everyone can exercise, and even small amounts can make a difference, he adds. Cardiac rehab Many people with heart disease qualify for cardiac rehabilitation. The initial evaluation includes an exercise stress test, a closely monitored workout done on a treadmill or stationary bike that shows how your heart and body respond to exertion. The results can help your rehab team offer safe, effective suggestions for physical activity. Unfortunately, not everyone who qualifies for cardiac rehab has easy access to such a program, which typically requires you to attend a few times a week for several months. However, a hybrid program that includes some online sessions may be available (see ""A virtual approach to healing the heart"" in the October 2022 Heart Letter). Another option is to ask your cardiac surgeon, cardiologist, or primary care doctor to prescribe an exercise stress test, which can be reassuring for people who are worried about exercising, says Dr. Skali. If you're generally healthy, your doctor might decide that you don't need a stress test and can go ahead and start exercising on your own. After a procedure After any procedure, wait until your doctor gives you the green light to start exercising. After an angioplasty (a minimally invasive procedure to widen a narrowed or blocked heart artery), you can usually resume your normal activities after two days. If you had the procedure to treat a heart attack, you might need to take it easy for a bit longer. People often need a month or more to fully recover from open heart surgery, which requires sawing through the breastbone. But that doesn't mean avoiding exercise as you heal. In fact, a small study found that starting cardiac rehab just two weeks after surgery was just as effective and likely as safe as waiting for six weeks, says Dr. Skali. The good news is that people often have more energy and endurance after their heart is repaired. Take it easy at first, starting ""low and slow,"" especially if exercise hasn't been part of your regular routine, says Dr. Skali. Walking outside or on a treadmill for just five minutes at a time several times a day is a good way to start. Keep adding a few minutes to your walks every week or so, until you're up to at least 20 minutes a day. Pay attention to how you're feeling, and add intensity by walking briskly (or even jogging) for short bouts if that feels okay. Rest as needed Even people who've never exercised and have several serious health problems can still exercise. ""I have patients with heart failure and obesity who tell me they can't walk for more than one minute,"" Dr. Skali says. His advice: Put a chair at each end of your driveway or whatever short distance you can manage. Walk back and forth between the chairs, sitting down to rest when needed to catch your breath. Try to do four laps in the morning, and then another four laps in the afternoon. ""Even just 30 seconds at a time is enough to make progress,"" he says. And no matter what your fitness level, always stop or slow down if you feel dizzy, weak, or breathless. Image: © luciano/Getty Images",5,0.31259406,0.046613812,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/shift-work-can-harm-sleep-and-health-what-helps-202302282896,Shift work can harm sleep and health: What helps?,1,"We can feel groggy when our sleep schedule is thrown off even just a little. So what happens when shift work requires people to regularly stay awake through the night and sleep during the day — and how can they protect their health and well-being? What is shift work disorder? Mounting evidence, including several new studies, paints a worrisome picture of the potential health fallout of nontraditional shift work schedules that affect 15% to 30% of workers in the US and Europe, including factory and warehouse workers, police officers, nurses, and other first responders. So-called shift work disorder mainly strikes people who work the overnight or early morning shift, or who rotate their shifts, says Eric Zhou, an assistant professor in the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. It is characterized by significant problems falling and staying asleep, or sleeping when desired. That's because shift work disrupts the body's normal alignment with the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle called the circadian rhythm. ""People who work 9-to-5 shifts are typically awake when the sun is up, which is aligned with their body's internal circadian clock. But for shift workers, their work hours and sleep hours are misaligned with the natural cues to be awake or asleep,"" Zhou says. ""They're working against the universe's natural inclinations — not just their body's."" What's the connection between shift work and health? A 2022 research review in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine links shift work to higher risks for serious health problems, such as heart attack and diabetes. This research suggests adverse effects can include metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that raises the risks for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke), accidents, and certain types of cancer. ""The research is consistent and powerful,"" Zhou says. ""Working and sleeping during hours misaligned with natural light for extended periods of time is not likely to be healthy for you."" How do new studies on shift work boost our understanding? New research continues to add to and strengthen earlier findings, teasing out specific health effects that could stem from shift work. Shift workers on rotating schedules eat more erratically and frequently than day workers, snack more at night, and consume fewer healthier foods with potentially more calories, a study published online in Advances in Nutrition suggests. This analysis reviewed 31 prior studies involving more than 18,000 participants, comparing workers' average food intake over 24 hours. Disrupting the circadian rhythm through shift work appears to increase the odds of colorectal cancer, a malignancy with strong ties to lifestyle factors, according to a 2023 review of multiple studies published online in the Journal of Investigative Medicine. Contributors to this higher risk may include exposure to artificial light at night, along with complex genetic and hormonal interactions, study authors said. ""Cancer understandably scares people, and the World Health Organization recognizes that shift work is a probable carcinogen,"" Zhou says. ""The combination of chronically insufficient and poor-quality sleep is likely to get under the skin. That said, we don't fully understand how this happens."" How can you protect your sleep — and your health? If you work overnight or early morning shifts, how can you ensure you sleep more soundly and restfully? Zhou offers these evidence-based tips. Time your exposure to bright and dim light. Graveyard shift workers whose work schedule runs from midnight through 8 a.m., for example, should reduce their light exposure as much as possible after leaving work if they intend to go right to sleep once they return home. ""These measures could take the form of wearing blue light–blocking glasses or using blackout shades in your bedroom,"" he says. Make enough time for sleep on days off. ""This is often harder than it sounds, because you'll want to see your family and friends during nonwork hours,"" Zhou says. ""You need to truly protect your opportunity for sleep."" Maintain a consistent shift work schedule. ""Also, try to minimize the consecutive number of days you spend working challenging shifts,"" he says. Talk to your employer. Perhaps your boss can schedule you for fewer overnight shifts. ""You can also ask your doctor to make a case for you to be moved off these shifts or have more flexibility,"" Zhou says. Look for practical solutions that allow you to get more restful sleep. ""People engaged in shift work usually have responsibilities to their job as well as their family members, who often operate under a more typical 9-to-5 schedule,"" he notes. ""The goal is to preserve as strong a circadian rhythm as possible under the abnormal schedule shift work requires.""",5,0.23226498,-0.14754958,True
https://naturalnews.com/2024-04-25-who-msm-bird-flu-warnings-fear-campaign.html,WHO and mainstream media’s bird flu warnings are part of a psyop fear campaign to gain control and push vaccines,0,"Last week, the World Health Organization issued a warning that bird flu has an “extremely high” mortality rate in humans and has the potential to mutate in the latest attempt to scare the masses into giving up their freedoms. However, the virus, which is formally known as H5N1 avian influenza virus, has never actually passed from one human being to another, and although it can pass among certain animals, reports of it being passed from animals to humans are extremely rare. Although these types of warnings can make people understandably jittery with the COVID-19 pandemic fresh in our memories, it is important to keep in mind that bird flu outbreaks have been reported since at least as far back as the 1880s and have not wiped humans off the planet yet. Recent reports indicate that bird flu has been detected in poultry, wild birds and some mammals. It didn't take long for WHO Chief Scientist Jeremy Farrar to start sounding the alarm bells and saying that there is “great concern” that the virus could evolve and gain the capability to be transmitted among humans. His warnings were quickly picked up by the mainstream media, with the Daily Mail warning that the virus could be “100 times worse than COVID” and the New York Times echoing Farrar’s concerns that it could mutate and be passed between humans. However, all of this may prove to be little more than an effort to drum up support for a new vaccine now that interest in COVID-19 jabs and boosters has been dwindling as the world finally starts to see how risky and ineffective they are.

Every purchase at HealthRangerStore.com helps fund our efforts to build and share more tools for empowering humanity with knowledge and abundance. This isn’t conjecture; Farrar even said as much himself, noting: “It’s a tragic thing to say, but if I get infected with H5N1 and I die, that’s the end of it. If I go around the community and I spread it to somebody else then you start the cycle.” “We have to watch, more than watch, we have to make sure that if H5N1 did come across to humans with human-to-human transmission that we were in a position to immediately respond with access equitably to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.” Pursuing power and vaccine profits His comments have spurred headlines like Barron’s “U.S. Could Vaccinate a Fifth of Americans in a Bird Flu Emergency” and the CNN opinion piece “The next pandemic threat demands action now.” The former indicated that the government would be able to distribute enough of its current stockpile of FDA-approved H5N1 vaccines to vaccinate roughly 20 percent of Americans within four months should the virus spread on a wide scale. These vaccines, which are manufactured by GSK, Sanofi, and CSL Sequrius, have questionable efficacy, with some of them being developed back in 2007. Predictably, Farrar cautioned that development of H5N1 vaccines is “not where we need it to be.” It’s also quite convenient that these warnings are coming just weeks ahead of the WHO Pandemic Agreement meetings, in which member countries are expected to vote on a controversial new Pandemic Agreement and a series of International Health Regulations amendments that will give the body broad authority when it comes to managing pandemics . The agreement will give the WHO executive powers to declare international health emergencies and override the responses of individual countries with their own mandates.",4,-0.41966972,0.19720621,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/parents-dont-always-realize-that-their-teen-is-suicidal-201902132897,Parents don't always realize that their teen is suicidal,1,"Parents like to think that they know what is going on with their children — and that they would know if their teen was suicidal. However, research shows that this is not always the case. Teens may consider suicide more often than parents realize In a study published a few years ago in the journal Pediatrics, researchers interviewed more than 5,000 adolescents ages 11 to 17. In those interviews, they asked them if they had ever thought about killing themselves — or if they had ever thought a lot about death or dying. The teens' parents were asked if they believed that their teens had ever thought about killing themselves, or had thought a lot about death or dying. There wasn't a whole lot of match-up. Half of the parents of the adolescents who thought of killing themselves were unaware — as were three-quarters of the parents of adolescents who thought often about death. This disconnect looms larger as research shows mental health problems are on the rise in youth. According to the 2021 Youth Risk Behavioral Survey, 42% of high school students reported persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness; 22% seriously considered suicide, and 10% attempted it. The numbers were higher for girls and youth who identify as LGBTQ+: Almost 60% of girls experienced persistent sadness and hopelessness; 30% seriously considered attempting suicide, and 13% attempted it. Among LGBTQ+ youth, 70% experienced persistent sadness and hopelessness; 45% seriously considered attempting suicide, and 22% attempted it. Many factors contribute to this. Stress and isolation caused by the pandemic clearly played a role. While teens are back in school, re-entry has been difficult for many. Social media clearly plays a role, inviting unrealistic comparisons, reinforcing negative thoughts and ideas, and encouraging doomscrolling. It is also a source of bullying: in the report, 16% of high school students reported being bullied electronically, including 20% of girls and 27% of those who identify as LGBTQ+. Why the disconnect between teens and parents? It's not that surprising that parents don't always know that their teens are considering suicide. Teens may not always realize how bad they are feeling, and may not want to tell their parents when they do — both for fear of worrying them, and also because of uncertainty about how their parents might react. Parents may miss signs of depression in their teens, or quite genuinely misinterpret them or attribute them to something innocent; after all, it's natural to want to believe that your child is fine, rather than thinking that they might be suicidal. And given how much drama can be intrinsic to the life of a teen, it's understandable that parents could misinterpret statements about death or dying as, well, just teen drama. What can parents do? Be aware of signs of depression in teens, and never ignore them. Acting sad is one of them, but there are many others: dropping gradesbeing irritable or angry oftenacting bored all the time, and/or dropping out of activitiesdifficulty with relationships, including changing peer groups or becoming more isolateddangerous or risky behaviorpersistent physical complaints such as headaches or stomachachesfatigue. Listen to your teen, and never assume that statements like ""nobody cares if I live or die"" are just drama. Instead of saying, ""You don't mean that,"" ask them if they do mean it. Often parents worry that asking about suicide might ""give them ideas,"" but asking may be the only way to know — and the best way to show your teen that you are taking them seriously. Learn how to have tough conversations about mental health and suicide. The American Academy of Pediatrics has many tips and resources for parents. Get help. Call your doctor, call a mental health professional, call the new nationwide number 988 that can link you to local help like a suicide hotline, or take your child to a local emergency room. This is crucial. If counseling is recommended, do your best to schedule it, letting your doctor know if you are having trouble finding a provider. Make sure your teen sticks with it. If you suspect your teen may be depressed or suicidal, take precautions. If you have a gun in your house, make sure it is locked up with the ammunition locked separately. Take stock of prescription medications and alcohol in your house that could be used for self-harm, and either get rid of them or be sure they are stored safely. Sometimes it is just drama — or short-term blues after a breakup or another one of life's inevitable disappointments. And in the study, half of the teens whose parents thought they were suicidal, and two-thirds of those whose parents believed their teens thought about death, said they were fine. But when it comes to suicide, it's always better to be safe than sorry. So ask the questions — and ask for help.",7,-0.012461808,-0.07596939,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/a-pain-in-the-rear,A pain in the rear,1,"We're all born with eyes, ears, arms, legs… and the makings of hemorrhoids. While they're not what we think of as a body part, the blood vessels that pad the anus and rectum are nonetheless part of all of us — and one that few mention in polite company. These blood vessels only become problematic when they enlarge. Before that, they ""actually contribute to some of our continence — they hold things in place,"" says Dr. Anne Fabrizio, a proctologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. But when symptoms emerge — ranging from barely noticeable to excruciating — they can disrupt our days. About half of adults have experienced some degree of hemorrhoidal symptoms by age 50. Pain, itching, swelling, and bleeding can progress to a point where hemorrhoids bulge dramatically and develop blood clots that prove agonizing, Dr. Fabrizio says. ""It's an incredibly common problem that can have a huge impact on quality of life,"" she says. ""But a lot of people try to ignore it for a long time, partly because it can be embarrassing, so they hesitate to bring it up."" Serious complications Hemorrhoids are classified into two types depending on where they're found. External hemorrhoids are visible at the anus, while internal ones are inside the rectum. The latter tend to produce painless, bright red bleeding with bowel movements, but not much pain, Dr. Fabrizio says. Because any rectal bleeding is concerning — possibly signaling colorectal cancer — you should see a doctor, even if you're unbothered and convinced internal hemorrhoids are the cause. Pregnancy is one of the top risk factors for hemorrhoids because it intensifies pressure in the rectum. Others include aging, chronic constipation or diarrhea, and obesity. But women are likely to delay hemorrhoid treatment in the years after childbirth — when the problem can flare — as they juggle family with other priorities. This is a mistake, Dr. Fabrizio says. Putting off care can lead to potentially serious complications as well as needless suffering for anyone with hemorrhoids. ""They may be uncomfortable all the time, in pain, and thinking of their hemorrhoids when they're supposed to be focused on other things,"" she says. When hemorrhoids get extremely large, mucus can seep out. So can blood. ""A worst-case scenario is that people can get really anemic,"" Dr. Fabrizio adds. ""They can have significant blood loss that harms their overall health."" Treatment strategies Drugstore hemorrhoid remedies are often the first thing people try when symptoms are mild. These include pain relievers, along with witch hazel pads and topical creams and ointments to reduce itching and discomfort. Shallow sitz baths and cold compresses can also bring relief. But while these tactics are ""great for symptom management,"" Dr. Fabrizio says, ""they don't tackle the underlying problem. They don't really make a hemorrhoid go away. That's why you should see a doctor."" Seeking care early also widens your treatment choices before the problem worsens to a point of needing more extreme — and potentially painful — options. One tool is prescription hydrocortisone suppositories, which can be used for short-term hemorrhoid inflammation. Most patients who see a doctor early and take steps toward having easy, regular bowel movements can often sidestep the worst symptoms of hemorrhoids — or even prevent symptoms from arising at all, she says. For internal hemorrhoids, the doctor may recommend a procedure to eliminate the hemorrhoid by cutting off its blood flow. One option is sclerotherapy, which involves a chemical injection into the hemorrhoid. Another is banding, in which the doctor places a small rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid. In both cases, the bulging vessel eventually withers away. For large, bulging external hemorrhoids, surgery called hemorrhoidectomy is the only permanent removal option. Dr. Fabrizio acknowledges the procedure is painful, but often worth it. ""I tell patients that hemorrhoidectomy brings short-term, guaranteed pain, but offers long-term symptom improvement."" Preventing hemorrhoids from enlarging in the first place is the ideal, of course. Dr. Fabrizio recommends preventing constipation by eating fiber-rich foods and drinking plenty of water. Also, avoid straining for long periods on the toilet and aggressive wiping, which can lead to more irritation. ""Hemorrhoids are something we've been dealing with for centuries,"" she says. ""Talking about them more would make people more comfortable seeing a doctor earlier, which would be a win-win."" Image: © Lars Neumann/Getty Images",0,0.15103628,-0.025264502,True

John Campbell, PhD, recently analyzed the peer-reviewed study on his podcast – watch below . He discussed what it reveals with Angus Dalgleish, a professor of oncology at St. George's, University of London . Campbell noticed from the study's findings that increases in mortality from all causes increased in Japan from 2021 through the present. The study was conducted in Japan, which is why it focused just on that country, but the findings can almost certainly be extrapolated to the United States and other ""fully vaccinated"" countries as well. All in all, the study identified a 2.1 percent mortality increase in 2021, followed by a much more substantial 9.6 percent mortality increase in 2022, the year of the ""booster"" shots.

Researchers examined 190 adults ages 40 to 75 who did not have cardiovascular disease. Participants had LDL levels that ranged from optimal to high and a 5% to 20% risk of developing cardiovascular disease within 10 years. Everyone was randomly put into one of eight groups.

After 28 days, people in the statin group lowered their LDL by an average of almost 38%, while changes in most of the supplement groups were comparable to those who took a placebo. (The garlic supplement group actually saw their LDL levels increase.) The statin group also had an average 24% decrease in total cholesterol. The researchers noted that more than 28 days may be needed for these dietary supplements to affect cholesterol levels.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-gut-healthy-heart,"Healthy gut, healthy heart",1,"The gut is known as the ""second brain,"" as it produces many of the same neurotransmitters, chemicals released by nerves needed for communication with other nerves and tissues. The gut and brain are also connected through a joint partnership called the gut-brain axis that links biochemical signals both to and from the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. But what about the gut and the heart? Do they have a similar connection? Research suggests there might be a link, but that it travels in one direction — from the gut to the heart — and that keeping your gut healthy can be another means to protect against heart disease. The gut-heart connection The gut is the primary home to trillions of microbes, collectively known as the human microbiota. These microbes help with digestion, manufacture certain nutrients, and release substances that have wide-ranging health effects. ""There's a complex interplay between the microbes in our intestines and most of the systems in our bodies, including the vascular, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, all of which are linked with cardiovascular health,"" says Dr. Stanley Shaw, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Since diet plays a significant role in the composition of gut microbiota, what you feed your gut can therefore affect heart health — for better and for worse. One way the gut does this is with metabolites, substances the gut microbiota creates when breaking down food. One particular gut metabolite, trimethylamine (TMA), forms when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a substance strongly connected with forming artery-clogging plaque. Research has shown that people with high TMAO levels in their blood are more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those with lower levels. Since red meat is a main source of TMA, cutting back can stop the gut from making too much TMAO. In fact, a study in the September 2022 issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found that among nearly 4,000 people ages 65 and older, those who ate an average of 1.1 servings of red meat per day had a 22% higher risk of heart disease compared with those who ate less. The researchers pointed out that about 10% of this added risk could be attributed to increased levels of TMAO as well as two other metabolites — gamma-butyrobetaine and crotonobetaine — which also are made by gut bacteria from components in red meat. Fiber at work Fiber also helps support the gut and thus the heart. According to some estimates, fiber-rich diets can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as 30%. Fiber in the small intestine binds fat and cholesterol, decreasing absorption and lowering blood cholesterol levels. But the gut's microbiota also helps out. Fiber gets broken down by bacteria in the colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds interact with specific receptors on cells that regulate blood pressure, better control blood sugar and body weight in people with diabetes, and dampen inflammation — all of which can improve heart health. Other supporting foods It's unclear whether eating other foods that improve gut microbiota — for example, probiotics (beneficial bacteria) found in yogurt and fermented foods (sauerkraut, miso, tempeh) — can also support heart health. The best advice for helping your gut help your heart is to follow a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean diet or similar eating patterns. These involve limiting red meat and eating plenty of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, all of which can have favorable effects on the gut,"" says Dr. Shaw.

https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/news/20240705/weight-loss-drugs-lower-cancer-risk-in-type-2-diabetes-patients,Weight Loss Drugs Lower Cancer Risk in Type 2 Diabetes Patients,1,"July 5, 2024 – Recent research on popular weight loss drugs has uncovered surprising benefits beyond their intended use, like lowering the risk of fatal heart attacks. And now there may be another unforeseen advantage: People with type 2 diabetes who took these drugs had a lower risk of having 10 out of 13 obesity-related cancers, compared to those who used insulin therapy. That’s according to a study published Friday in JAMA Network Openwhere researchers studied glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (known as GLP-1RAs), a class of drugs used to treat diabetes and obesity. Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound, which have become well-known recently because they are linked to rapid weight loss, contain GLP-1RAs. For the study, they looked at electronic health records of 1.7 million patients who had type 2 diabetes, no prior diagnosis of obesity-related cancers, and had been prescribed GLP-1RAs, insulins, or metformin from March 2005 to November 2018. The scientists found that compared to patients who took insulin, people who took GLP-1RAs had a “significant risk reduction” in 10 of 13 obesity-related cancers. Those 10 cancers were esophageal, colorectal, endometrial, gallbladder, kidney, liver, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, as well as meningioma and multiple myeloma. Compared to patients taking insulin, patients taking GLP-1RAs showed no statistically significant reduction in stomach cancer and no reduced risk of breast and thyroid cancers, the study said. But the study found no decrease in cancer risk with GLP-1RAs compared to the drug metformin. (Metformin is used to lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.) While the study results suggest that these drugs may reduce the risk of certain obesity-related cancers better than insulins, more research is needed, they said.",8,0.13588443,0.26943445,False
https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20240703/key-indicator-of-covid-just-spiked-western-us,A Key Indicator of COVID Just Spiked in the Western U.S.,1,"July 3, 2024 – COVID-19 cases have been on the rise nationwide this summer, and now wastewater monitoring data suggests a further increase may be underway in the Western part of the U.S. The CDC has updated its wastewater monitoring website to report that the virus that causes COVID, called SARS-CoV-2, is being detected at high levels in some Western states. The Western reporting region includes 13 states and one territory: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. The new report of increased COVID activity comes as the busy Fourth of July holiday travel period gets underway. Wearing a well-fitting mask in crowded indoor places remains on the CDC’s COVID prevention tip sheet, in addition to staying up to date on vaccinations and practicing good hygiene. Wastewater virus detection is considered a bellwether for some infectious diseases because it can indicate person-to-person viral spread before testing trends, since people who are sick tend to wait to go to the doctor or hospital. Also, wastewater monitoring can show trends when people are infected with a virus and do not have symptoms. COVID symptoms typically appear between 2 and 14 days after exposure. In its latest wastewater monitoring report, the CDC urged people to put the upward trend into the context that COVID activity remains historically low. “During April and May 2024, COVID-19 activity was lower than at any time since the start of the pandemic. Recent increases need to be considered from that baseline. This includes increases in COVID-19 test positivity and emergency department visits, suggesting growth in COVID-19 activity across several states, and increases in rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among adults 65+ at some Western sites,” the agency explained its latest update. “While there are indications for the potential start of a summer surge, nationally COVID-19 activity remains low. CDC will continue to monitor to see if these recent increases persist.” The CDC wastewater monitoring program includes data from 1,214 sites and is estimated to cover about 126 million people, or 37% of the U.S. population. The latest numbers indicate a concerning departure from the SARS-CoV-2 activity level that has been trending upward steadily since May. The new data from Western states jumped more steeply than the rest of the nation during the week spanning June 15 to June 22. Monitoring by Stanford and Emory University scientists posted on the website WastewaterSCAN.org also shows higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the country. The donation-funded program reports on municipal wastewater from nearly 200 sites nationwide, and it said virus activity was “high” during the past 3 weeks for the entire country, except the Northeast, where activity was labeled “medium.”",4,-0.3749469,0.1712927,False

Researchers (including Harvard experts) randomly assigned 190 people (ages 40 to 75) with high levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol to take either 5 milligrams of the cholesterol-lowering statin drug rosuvastatin; a supplement containing fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast rice; or a placebo (inactive pill). After four weeks, people in the statin group showed a 37% drop in LDL cholesterol, a 24% drop in total cholesterol, and a 19% drop in blood triglycerides. Meanwhile, people in the supplement and placebo groups didn't have any significant decreases in these measures. In fact, there were some adverse effects: LDL cholesterol went up for people taking the garlic supplement, and ""good"" HDL cholesterol dropped for people taking the plant sterols, compared with people taking a placebo. The study was brief, and researchers say it's possible it wasn't long enough to give some supplements a chance to work. But they also point out that the contents of dietary supplements vary and don't produce consistent results. They warn that supplements that are marketed for cholesterol or heart health are unlikely to be effective. Image: © Grace Cary/Getty Images",3,0.27911574,0.2374608,True

Rand Paul (R-KY) has highlighted newly discovered emails where Peter Daszak of the EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) admits to his company having 15,000 coronavirus samples in the freezers of a laboratory in Wuhan, China. The lawmaker for the Bluegrass State obtained the emails as part of his ongoing probe into the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), Modernity News reported. In one of the emails, Daszak told Dr. David Morens of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that EHA had 15,000 coronavirus samples in the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China's central Hubei province. These samples, Daszak added, could help scientists ""do the full genomes"" of more than 700 coronaviruses. Daszak, a British zoologist and infectious disease expert, is the president of the New York-based EHA. Morens, meanwhile, was the top aide of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) under the NIH. Fauci stepped down from the NIAID's leadership in 2022. Morens considers the EHA president his self-proclaimed ""best friend."" Incidentally, Daszak is at the center of controversy related to his use of U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund dangerous gain-of-function research at the WIV . According to Paul, the emails were revealed by the whistleblower he earlier referred to. This whistleblower, the senator continued, provided evidence directly tying Fauci and multiple government agencies to the funding of research that led to the creation of SARS-CoV-2. During hours of testimony, briefings and interviews, Fauci never mentioned that he was aware of hundreds of unknown variants of coronaviruses that existed in the Wuhan lab. Thus, the emails between Daszak and Morens revealed by the senator prove that Fauci deliberately concealed this during his congressional appearances.

The senator also mentioned another email showing Morens referencing Fauci's attempts to provide ""damage control"" for EHA. The correspondences date from April 2020, when COVID-19 was in full effect worldwide. (Related: Congress seeks emails suggesting Fauci worked behind the scene to discredit COVID lab leak stories .) Congress subpoenas Morens over emails ""We'll communicate with you via Gmail from now on,"" Daszak said in the first email, casually dropping that ""we have 15,000 samples in freezers in Wuhan."" In a later email, Morens told the EHA president: ""Tony [Fauci] is now fully aware, I think. [And he] is, I am told, involved in some sort of damage control."" But according to Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), chairman of the House COVID-19 Select Subcommittee, Morens' use of Gmail to ""intentionally [subvert] federal transparency laws to shield discussions related to the origins of COVID-19 … raise serious concerns about federal health officials potentially covering up the pandemic's origin."" The NIH official himself previously admitted to the subcommittee in a closed interview that he would ""delete anything I don't want to see in the New York Times ."" He added: ""I always try to communicate over Gmail because my NIH email is FOIA'd constantly,"" referencing transparency requests as part of the Freedom of Information Act. Because of this, Wenstrup issued a subpoena to Morens demanding that the latter turn over all documents from his email account concerning COVID-19 and grant funding. He also ordered the NIH official to turn over all his communications with Fauci, former NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins and other top health officials.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/poor-sleep-linked-to-a-common-cause-of-blindness,Poor sleep linked to a common cause of blindness,1,"Poor sleep is tied to many health problems, such as weight gain, mood disorders, and even dementia. Now, a large study published online Nov. 1, 2022, by BMJ Open suggests that poor sleep is also linked to higher risk for developing glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The study involved more than 400,000 people without glaucoma (ages 40 to 69) who were followed for 10 years. Researchers evaluated participants' medical records and self-reported sleep habits. People who had unhealthy sleep patterns (those who snored, experienced daytime sleepiness, had insomnia, slept less than seven hours per night, or slept more than nine hours per night) were more likely to develop glaucoma than people who had healthy sleep patterns. People who had insomnia or slept too much or too little had the highest risks for glaucoma — 13% higher than people without these problems. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that unhealthy sleep behaviors caused glaucoma. So what's the possible link? Study authors say eye pressure increases when you lie down and when your sleep hormones are out of kilter (which occurs in insomnia). That might be a plausible explanation for glaucoma risks, since the condition is caused by increased pressure on the optic nerves, which connect the eyes to the brain.

Researchers focused on the participants' intake of regular sodas, lemonade, fruit drinks, and other sugar-sweetened beverages. Higher intakes (more than one 12-ounce serving per day) were linked to increased levels of unhealthy blood fats (lipids), including LDL (bad) cholesterol, triglycerides, and other lipids associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Although the results don't prove that sugary drinks cause blood lipids to rise, they are consistent with earlier research on this topic.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-latest-on-lipoprotein-a-an-inherited-cause-of-early-heart-disease,"The latest on lipoprotein(a), an inherited cause of early heart disease",1,"About one in five people has high blood levels of fatty particles called lipoprotein(a), which doctors refer to as ""L-P-little a"" or Lp(a). Think of it as the evil twin of the familiar low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as ""bad"" cholesterol. ""Lp(a) particles are similar to LDL particles but with an apolipoprotein(a) molecule wrapped around each one,"" says cardiologist Dr. Christopher Cannon, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Lp(a) accelerates the buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries and inflammation even more than LDL does. A high Lp(a) level may double or even triple a person's risk of a heart attack. It also raises the risk of stroke and is linked to a narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis). So why have most people never even heard of Lp(a)? For starters, Lp(a) isn't picked up by a standard cholesterol test. You can get a separate Lp(a) blood test, but doctors haven't routinely recommended it because currently there aren't any FDA-approved drugs to lower elevated Lp(a). And because Lp(a) levels are largely genetically determined, eating and exercise habits are believed to have virtually no effect on the level in your bloodstream. Novel RNA-based drugs lower Lp(a) The burgeoning field of RNA therapeutics uses a small piece of genetic material to interfere with and silence unwanted genes. Currently, three RNA-based drugs that shut off the gene that makes Lp(a) in liver cells are in clinical trials. The drugs, called pelacarsen, olpasiran, and SLN30, are given by injection just once every one to six months. So far, studies suggest they can lower Lp(a) levels dramatically — between 70% and 100%. The side effects appear to be limited to mild, short-lived pain at the injection site. For now, it's too soon to know whether lowering Lp(a) will prevent heart attacks and related problems, but that evidence should be available within several years. Testing and treatment trends But recent clinical trials of several investigational drugs have shown promising results (see ""Novel RNA-based drugs lower Lp(a)""), which have raised awareness of Lp(a). In Europe and Canada, guidelines already recommend that everyone get tested for Lp(a) at least once in their lives. In the United States, the recommendations are more conservative, with testing suggested for the following groups: people with premature cardiovascular disease, defined as people who've had a heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or aortic stenosis before age 55 (for men) or 65 (for women) people who have a father, mother, sister, or brother with premature cardiovascular disease people with very high LDL cholesterol (190 mg/dL or higher) close relatives (siblings, children, and parents) of anyone with an elevated Lp(a) level. However, growing numbers of cardiologists support more widespread Lp(a) testing. ""I'm now measuring it in most of my patients who have or are at high risk for cardiovascular disease,"" says Dr. Cannon. People with high Lp(a) levels often have close family members who suffered a heart attack or stroke in their 50s or even earlier. Some of these people appear to be unlikely candidates for developing heart disease because they don't have any traditional risk factors, such as high LDL cholesterol, diabetes, or high blood pressure. A risk enhancer But many others have one or more of those risk factors, and the high Lp(a) adds to their overall vulnerability to heart problems, says Dr. Cannon. ""We think of high Lp(a) as a risk-enhancing factor that may warrant more intensive LDL lowering, in addition to paying close attention to a healthy lifestyle,"" he says. That means eating a mostly plant-based diet, getting regular exercise and sufficient sleep, and managing stress. Some people might benefit from aspirin and LDL-reducing drugs to lower their risk (see ""The changing landscape of LDL-lowering drugs"" in the April 2022 Heart Letter). People with high Lp(a) should consult a cardiologist for specific advice, says Dr. Cannon. They should also suggest Lp(a) testing for their close family members. ""I have patients who are in their 30s and 40s who find out they have high Lp(a) and are worried,"" says Dr. Cannon. He reassures them that he's optimistic there will be an effective therapy soon.

Emergency rooms are seeing a 15% increase in treating people who have COVID, and hospitalizations for severe cases are up 25%. Signs of the virus that causes COVID found in the nation’s wastewater are also trending upward, mirroring a curve seen last summer as well. The highest reported rates of positive COVID tests are in the region that includes California, Nevada, Arizona, and Hawaii, where 10% or more of tests are showing positive. The positive rate remains below 10% throughout the rest of the U.S., and less than 5% of tests are positive throughout most of the Southeastern U.S. and up the coast to Pennsylvania. The counts are modest compared to previous summer COVID waves, but the rise is still large enough to translate into a meaningful increased risk. Most U.S. states are having weekly COVID deaths, but numbers are dramatically down from the height of thousands per week earlier in the pandemic. For the week ending June 15, each U.S. state reported fewer than 10 deaths due to COVID. But the illness still poses serious health threats, and research continues to show that it is more dangerous than the flu. In addition to staying up to date on vaccination, the CDC recommends practicing good hygiene, such as thorough hand-washing, and staying home and away from others if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness. Wearing a mask is still a good prevention strategy, the CDC says. Certain groups of people, such as those who are older or who have weakened immune systems, are particularly at risk for severe and potentially life-threatening cases of COVID. That’s why knowing if you have COVID and staying home is important because you can help prevent illness in people most at risk, according to COVID expert Andy Pekosz, PhD, of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. At-home tests may have extended expiration dates that are different from the ones printed on the package. Check this FDA database to see if a test is still OK to use.",4,-0.32336754,0.25771892,False

Cass Review is the world's largest review into transgender interventions for minors . Hilary Cass, a pediatrician commissioned by the U.K.'s NHS to review available transgender services for dysphoric minors, found that ""gender medicine"" is ""built on shaky foundations"" and that while these drastic interventions should be done with extreme vigilance, ""quite the reverse happened in the field of gender care for children."" (Related: Top North Carolina health systems push transgender mutilation of children: report .) ""While a considerable amount of research has been published in this field, systematic evidence reviews demonstrated the poor quality of the published studies, meaning there is not a reliable evidence base upon which to make clinical decisions or for children and their families to make informed choices,"" Cass wrote in the report. The report also includes key findings, such as: The rationale for early puberty suppression remains unclear, with weak evidence regarding the impact on gender dysphoria, mental or psychosocial health. The effect on cognitive and psychosexual development remains unknown. The use of masculinizing/feminizing hormones in those under the age of 18 also presents many unknowns, despite their longstanding use in the adult transgender population.

Clinicians are unable to determine with any certainty which children and young people will go on to have an enduring trans identity. Moreover, Cass commissioned the University of York in northern England to conduct several analyses as part of the review. As it turned out, the researchers found that 23 reviewed clinical guidelines ""were not independent or ""evidence-based"" because those studies were written by activists driven by ideology , not medicine. But the CBC has tried to downplay the revelations in its article. It argued that the findings contradict the recommended standard of care endorsed by various international medical organizations. The CBC even interviewed Canadian doctors who dispute the findings that there is a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of puberty blockers. ""There actually is a lot of evidence, just not in the form of randomized clinical trials,"" said Dr. Jake Donaldson, a family physician in Calgary specializing in transgender care. ""That would be kind of like saying for a pregnant woman since we lacked randomized clinical trials for the care of people in pregnancy, we’re not going to provide care for you… It’s completely unethical."" Van Maren: CBC fails to acknowledge extremely relevant facts against transgender care Jonathon Van Maren, a public speaker, writer and pro-life activist, argued in his article written for the Life Site News that the CBC did not explain why many European countries are turning away from these treatments. For instance, Belgium and the Netherlands have joined the growing list of European countries reconsidering the use of puberty blockers, particularly in children after the publication of the Cass Review. In Belgium, medical professionals are advocating for reforms in gender care for children and adolescents, urging a shift akin to the practices observed in Sweden and Finland. These countries view hormonal treatments as a last resort, rather than relying on puberty blockers as a primary intervention. Similar pressure is mounting in the Netherlands, where parliament has initiated research into the physical and mental health impacts of puberty blockers on adolescents. Even institutions like the Amsterdam Center of Expertise on Gender Dysphoria, which previously supported the Dutch protocol, are now reconsidering their stance. Britain, which has recently restricted the use of puberty blockers to individuals under 18, followed suit. Originally integrated into gender treatments , these blockers were widely adopted based on the ""Dutch protocol,"" pioneered in the Netherlands in 1998. However, recent scrutiny has led to a reassessment of their efficacy and safety. This shift is reflected in the recent actions of countries like Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark, which have implemented tighter restrictions on hormone treatments for adolescents.

https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20240621/essential-nutritional-counseling-after-heart-attack-misses-many,Essential Nutritional Counseling After Heart Attacks Misses Many,1,"June 21, 2024 -- Heart disease reigns as the leading cause of death in the U.S., a stark reality fueled largely by our daily choices. Among these, diet stands out as the foremost contributor to premature deaths from cardiovascular conditions. But many people aren’t getting important nutritional counseling after surviving a heart attack that could prolong their lives. In a study published last week in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, researchers found that fewer than 1 in 4 patients received any nutritional counseling within 90 days of being hospitalized for a heart attack, cardiac bypass, congestive heart failure, or a stent. “Nutritional counseling is key to the prevention of future events, but not enough patients are getting it,” said lead study author Eric Brandt, MD, an assistant professor in the division of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, MI. We know that diet is critical to future heart health and that dietary counseling is an important tool for changing habits, yet several barriers hinder most patients from getting any nutritional guidance at all. Why Nutritional Counseling Works After a cardiac event, patients are presented with an urgent opportunity to make changes in their lives that can have a significant impact on their future heart health, said Barbara Olendzki, director of the Center for Applied Nutrition and an associate professor of medicine at the UMass Chan Medical School in Worcester, MA. In effect, this is the “sweet spot” when it comes to changing poor habits -- a time to adjust diet in ways that lower cholesterol and blood pressure to reduce the future risk arterial blockages. “After a heart attack, you’re frightened for your life, which gives patients around 6 months of motivation to make the kinds of changes necessary to prevent future events, but not enough patients take advantage of that time,” said Olendzki. Research has shown that medium-to high-intensity dietary counseling for patients with elevated cardiovascular risk factors can help them make significant changes toward a healthy diet that reduces cardiovascular events, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity-related outcomes, according to an article published in the November 2020 edition of JAMA Network. Patients are taught the importance of eating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, and healthy sources of monounsaturated fats like olive oil. They’re also taught to choose low-fat dairy and lean or plant-based sources of protein while avoiding saturated fats, sweets, and red meat, as well as moderating alcohol consumption. The type of counseling matters. Its effectiveness is dependent on format and frequency, according to a study published in the September 2019 issue of theJournal of Clinical Medicine. Just one meeting isn’t going to change habits. Rather, it takes time to establish trust with a clinician as well as identifying the changes that will have the most impact on heart health. It isn’t just about preaching a healthy diet, “it’s about identifying barriers that are keeping a patient from making positive dietary changes so that they can find ways around them,” said Geeta Sikand, a registered dietitian and associate professor of medicine in cardiology at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine in Irvine, CA. For example, if you make poor dietary decisions when you get busy or anxious, consider having healthier foods prepared rather than reaching for unhealthy grab n’ go foods. If you tend to eat the least healthy when you drink alcohol, consider controlling consumption. And if you choose unhealthy foods at the grocery store, opt for grocery delivery services instead. “It’s about going on the journey with patients rather than them feeling like they’re being judged by their clinician,” said Sikand. Why Patients Aren’t Getting Nutritional Counseling Still, the largest barrier to nutritional counseling isn’t the quality of it but the complete lack of any sort of guidance. Cost, time, and motivation keep most patients from getting the care they need, said Brandt. And after the initial 6 months after a cardiac event, many people settle back into their bad habits if they haven’t already attempted to alter them. Counseling with a registered dietitian is the gold standard because dietitians are trained not just in nutrition but in the behavioral components of healthy eating. For example, why people eat the way they do. Unfortunately, one of the biggest hurdles for patients is cost since this type of counseling isn’t covered by insurance unless a patient has kidney failure or diabetes. “Many patients don’t receive dietary counseling either because their provider doesn’t have enough time to cover it during an office visit or dietitian services aren’t covered by insurance,” Brandt said. Heart attack patients can get limited nutritional counseling as part of their cardiac rehabilitation plan, which also involves exercise training, emotional support, and education around better heart health. But it tends to be more limited in scope and frequency. Still, this is the most counseling that many patients will get. Only about 5% of patients in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics study got counseling outside of cardiac rehab. Expanding Nutritional Services to Cardiac Patients The hope is that better access will increase patient participation. A new bill currently in Congress could improve access to nutritional counseling by expanding coverage to patients with Medicare. HR: 6407: The Expanded Medical Nutrition Therapy Act will expand the availability of medical nutrition therapy services under the Medicare program to include cardiovascular disease and a range of other chronic diseases. Once that happens, private insurers will follow the government’s lead when deciding what to cover, said Sikand. “But as of now, despite its benefits, many people are left without care.” Still, it’s also true that some choose not to go to counseling. They may wrongly conclude that genetics is the leading driver of cardiovascular health— and that there isn’t much they can do if their family history dooms them to die of a heart attack. Or they might not have time because they need to get back to work, said Jean Copeland, a clinical dietitian nutritionist with Dartmouth Health’s Heart and Vascular Center. “As a result, many patients fall prey to fad diets, resulting in them developing more and worsening health conditions in future years,” Copeland said. For patients who don’t have the time or transportation to do cardiac rehab, there’s also remote rehabilitation that may work for some, said David Jeremy Davidson, MD, director of medical weight loss and lipid clinics at NorthShore University Health System in Highland Park, IL. “This can help bridge the gap for patients who can’t do the therapy in person,” he said. Counseling apps that are nutrition focused like Noom, for example, provide nutritional counseling but also cognitive behavioral therapy, although these are also not covered by insurance. While they might not be as good as in person medical diet therapy, they do add a level of accountability and help patients recognize what they’re really eating, Davidson said. We now know that lifestyle changes can prevent cardiac events, and in fact those born into families with poorer cardiovascular outcomes are not destined to that same fate. But the next step for both patients and insurance providers are to recognize the important, cost-effective role of nutritional counseling in saving the lives of those with heart disease.",3,0.25983354,0.22657545,True

It is still negatively impacting humans in the form of mass bird slaughter, which is damaging the supply chain for eggs and chicken meat, but as of yet there is not a human bird flu ""pandemic"" – though that could soon change . At first it looked like maybe they would try to usher in the next COVID-like scamdemic with monkeypox. When that failed, they tried other ""variants"" and ""subvariants"" of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which also failed. Now, they appear poised to give bird flu, also known as H5N1, another try. Over the past several years, at least 86 million birds have been killed in the United States for supposedly being infected with bird flu. Whether or not this is actually true, it has created a convenient cover for destroying a large segment of the American meat and egg supply at a time when inflation is through the roof. It would seem as though the goal is to make bird flu transmissible to humans as well, which would turn it into another COVID whereby the powers that be will once again lock everything down, usher in new ""vaccines"" at warp speed , force everyone back into masks, and all the rest. ""From an animal welfare perspective, it's viciously cruel. From a sustainable agriculture perspective, it's senseless,"" writes Alexis Baden-Mayer on her The Scamerican Century Substack page.

https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/news/20240611/independent-fda-panel-endorses-new-alzheimers-disease-treatment,Independent FDA Panel Endorses New Alzheimer’s Disease Treatment,1,"June 11, 2024 – An FDA advisory panel unanimously gave a green light on Monday to the Alzheimer’s disease treatment donanemab for use during early stages of the disease. The move makes it likely that the FDA will fully approve this monoclonal antibody drug. Donanemab targets the buildup of plaques in the brain that are an indicator of the severe form of dementia. The FDA had been expected to consider approving donanemab earlier this year as part of its fast track program. However, it delayed the decision and instead sought input during a meeting of independent experts. Clinical trial results published last year suggested that the treatment could slow progression of the disease by a matter of months. This was based on people’s performance on tests that measure abilities related to cognition and to daily living skills, such as driving and managing finances. Some experts have characterized the treatment’s effects as modest. Committee members on Monday discussed how the complex determination of effectiveness was made. In the trial, participants received monthly infusions for about a year and a half. Three people in the clinical trial died. The treatment can cause brain swelling or brain bleeding. Ultimately, advisors agreed that donanemab is safe and that the treatment’s benefits outweigh the risks. One estimate suggests the out-of-pocket annual cost of regularly getting donanemab infusions would be about $6,600 for people on Medicare. If fully approved, donanemab would join another recently approved monoclonal antibody treatment for Alzheimer’s disease called lecanemab. This drug also targets plaques and was approved by the FDA in July 2023. Leaders from the Alzheimer’s Association applauded the panel’s decision. “A future with more approved Alzheimer’s treatments is a tremendous advancement for people eligible for these drugs. Progress with treatment is happening,” said Joanne Pike, DrPH, Alzheimer’s Association president and CEO, in a statement. An estimated 6 million people have Alzheimer’s disease, and there currently is no known way to fully prevent the disease or cure it.",7,0.03471097,0.2013643,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/muscle-pain-in-statin-users-is-probably-not-caused-by-the-drug,Muscle pain in statin users is probably not caused by the drug,1,"While muscle pain is a possible side effect of taking a statin medication, an analysis published Sept. 10, 2022, in The Lancet found that it's uncommon, and most pain stems from something other than the cholesterol-lowering drug. Researchers reviewed 19 trials with more than 120,000 people who took either a daily statin or a placebo for an average of four years. (Most dosages were moderate-intensity regimens that typically reduced LDL cholesterol levels by approximately one-third.) About 25% of people reported muscle pain whether they took statins or not. Among statin users, the drug was found to have a marginal impact on pain risk. In general, symptoms were rated as mild and gone within a year despite continuing the drug. A separate analysis of four trials, comparing high statin doses with moderate or low doses, showed a greater likelihood of muscle pain symptoms from higher doses. But almost always, the benefits of high-intensity doses outweigh any muscle aches the user may experience, the researchers noted. They also suggested that many people who develop muscle pain after beginning a statin experience a ""nocebo effect,"" where negative expectations can lead to perceived side effects. In other words, some people think a statin will cause discomfort, so they blame the drug even though muscle aches and pain generally are more common with age.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/3-miracle-herbs-to-instantly-lower-blood-pressure/,3 Miracle Herbs to Instantly Lower Blood Pressure & Clear Arteries Naturally,0,"Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, yet many people overlook the powerful natural remedies available in their own kitchens. Imagine being able to support your cardiovascular health, improve circulation, and reduce your risk of heart disease—all without expensive medications or invasive procedures. Nature has provided us with three extraordinary herbs that can do just that: cayenne pepper, garlic, and ginger. These humble ingredients pack a serious punch when it comes to heart health, offering benefits that have been recognized for centuries. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore how each of these herbs works to protect your heart and improve your overall well-being. We’ll break down the science into simple terms, provide practical ways to incorporate them into your daily routine, and explain why they’re often more effective—and safer—than many pharmaceutical options. Whether you’re looking to prevent heart problems or support existing cardiovascular health, these three herbs could be the natural solution you’ve been searching for. Cayenne Pepper: The Fiery Heart Protector Cayenne pepper does much more than add heat to your food—it’s a cardiovascular powerhouse. The secret lies in its active component called capsaicin, which gives cayenne its characteristic spiciness and its remarkable health benefits. This vibrant red pepper works in three key ways to support heart health: thinning the blood, dilating blood vessels, and strengthening arterial walls. When we say cayenne thins the blood, we mean it helps prevent dangerous clotting that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Unlike pharmaceutical blood thinners that often come with risky side effects like excessive bleeding, cayenne provides this benefit naturally and safely. As a vasodilator, cayenne helps relax and widen blood vessels, improving circulation and reducing blood pressure. This is particularly important for people with hypertension or poor circulation. Perhaps most impressively, cayenne actually strengthens the walls of your arteries. Over time, arteries can become damaged and clogged with plaque—a condition called atherosclerosis. Cayenne helps reinforce these vital passageways, making them more resilient. The herb is so effective that some natural health practitioners suggest it could be an alternative to bypass surgery in certain cases of clogged arteries. Beyond its cardiovascular benefits, cayenne offers several other health advantages. It stimulates digestion by increasing gastric juices, which can improve nutrient absorption and relieve bloating. Many people find it helps with weight management by boosting metabolism and promoting fat burning. Topically, cayenne can relieve muscle and joint pain when used in creams or ointments because it increases blood flow to affected areas. Incorporating cayenne into your routine is surprisingly easy. If you’re sensitive to spice, capsules are an excellent option—many practitioners recommend taking two capsules three times daily for cardiovascular support. For those who enjoy some heat, cayenne tea (just ¼ teaspoon in hot water with honey or lemon) makes a warming, circulation-boosting drink. You can also sprinkle it on foods like eggs, soups, or roasted vegetables, or add a pinch to smoothies for an extra metabolic kick. The key is to start with small amounts and gradually increase as your tolerance builds. Garlic: The Ancient Heart Medicine Garlic has been valued as both food and medicine for thousands of years, and modern research continues to uncover its impressive cardiovascular benefits. This pungent bulb contains powerful sulfur compounds, particularly allicin, which are responsible for both its distinctive aroma and its health-promoting properties. Garlic works on multiple fronts to protect your heart and improve circulation. One of garlic’s most significant benefits is its ability to lower blood pressure naturally. The sulfur compounds in garlic help relax blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more freely and reducing strain on the cardiovascular system. Studies have shown that regular garlic consumption can be as effective as some prescription blood pressure medications, but without the side effects. For people with hypertension, adding garlic to their diet could make a meaningful difference in their health. Garlic also helps manage cholesterol levels, specifically by reducing small dense LDL (the “bad” cholesterol) while supporting HDL (the “good” cholesterol). This balancing act is crucial for preventing plaque buildup in arteries, which can lead to atherosclerosis and increased risk of heart attack or stroke. Additionally, garlic acts as a natural blood thinner, helping to prevent dangerous clots that can block blood flow to the heart or brain. The benefits of garlic extend far beyond heart health. It’s a potent immune booster, with antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties that can help ward off infections. During cold and flu season, garlic can be particularly valuable for both prevention and treatment. It also supports the body’s natural detoxification processes, helping to eliminate heavy metals and other toxins that can contribute to chronic disease. To get the most from garlic, it’s best to consume it raw and crushed or chopped, then allowed to sit for about 10 minutes before eating or cooking. This waiting period allows the allicin to fully develop. While cooked garlic still offers benefits, some of its potency is reduced by heat. For those who dislike the taste or are concerned about garlic breath, odorless supplements are available. Whether added to salad dressings, blended into hummus, or taken in capsule form, making garlic a regular part of your diet could be one of the simplest and most effective steps you take for your heart health. Ginger: The Warming Circulatory Tonic Ginger, with its distinctive spicy-sweet flavor, has been used in traditional medicine systems for thousands of years to treat everything from digestive upset to inflammatory conditions. When it comes to heart health, ginger offers several important benefits that make it worthy of inclusion in your daily routine. Like cayenne and garlic, ginger acts as both a blood thinner and vasodilator, but it brings its own unique set of advantages to the table. One of ginger’s standout features is its powerful anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic inflammation is now recognized as a root cause of many diseases, including heart disease. The compounds in ginger, particularly gingerols, help reduce this damaging inflammation throughout the body. For people with arthritis or other inflammatory conditions, ginger can provide relief comparable to some over-the-counter pain medications, but without the potential side effects. Ginger’s ability to improve circulation makes it particularly valuable for cardiovascular health. By helping blood vessels relax and widen, ginger promotes better blood flow, which can lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the heart. Improved circulation also means more oxygen and nutrients reach your tissues and organs, enhancing overall vitality. Many people who regularly consume ginger report feeling warmer and having better circulation to their extremities—a boon for those who often suffer from cold hands and feet. The herb is perhaps best known for its digestive benefits, which indirectly support heart health. Ginger stimulates digestive enzymes, helps food move smoothly through the digestive tract, and can relieve nausea, bloating, and indigestion. A healthy digestive system contributes to better nutrient absorption and reduced inflammation—both important factors in maintaining cardiovascular wellness. Additionally, ginger has been shown to help regulate blood sugar levels, which is crucial for preventing diabetes and its associated cardiovascular risks. Incorporating ginger into your daily life is both simple and enjoyable. Fresh ginger makes a wonderful tea when steeped in hot water—add lemon and honey for extra flavor and health benefits. Grated ginger adds zing to stir-fries, soups, and salad dressings, while a small piece blended into smoothies provides a metabolic boost. For convenience, ginger supplements are widely available, though they may not offer the full spectrum of benefits found in the fresh root. Whether you choose to enjoy it in food, as tea, or in supplement form, making ginger a regular part of your routine could pay significant dividends for your heart health and overall well-being. Final Thoughts: A Natural Approach to Heart Health The combination of cayenne pepper, garlic, and ginger offers a comprehensive, natural approach to cardiovascular wellness. Together, these herbs provide blood-thinning properties, improved circulation, reduced inflammation, and stronger arteries—all crucial factors in preventing and managing heart disease. What makes them particularly appealing is their safety profile; unlike many pharmaceutical options, these herbs can be used long-term with minimal risk of side effects when consumed in reasonable amounts. Implementing these herbs into your daily life doesn’t require drastic changes. Start by adding one to your diet—perhaps garlic in your evening meal or ginger tea in the morning. As you become comfortable, gradually incorporate the others. Pay attention to how your body responds; many people report increased energy, better digestion, and improved circulation within weeks of regular use. While these herbs are powerful, they work best as part of a holistic approach to heart health that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management, and adequate sleep. For those on blood-thinning medications, it’s wise to consult with a healthcare provider before making significant changes to your herb consumption.",3,0.28826493,0.15583579,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-taking-enzyme-supplements-help-soothe-my-bloating,Can taking enzyme supplements help soothe my bloating?,1,"Q. I often feel uncomfortable and bloated after eating. I have not been able to identify any particular foods that cause it. Would digestive enzyme supplements be helpful? A. Digestive enzyme supplements purportedly fix all sorts of abdominal symptoms, including bloating, gas, and bowel irregularity, as well as overall gut health. However, for most people, there's little evidence that they do any good. Naturally occurring digestive enzymes help break down food so the body can soak up nutrients. Your mouth, stomach, and small intestine make some digestive enzymes. Still, most come from your pancreas, which floods the small intestine with enzymes when the food arrives there. The main pancreatic enzymes are lipase, which breaks down fats; amylase, which breaks down carbohydrates; and proteases and peptidases, which break down proteins. Once nutrients are broken into small molecules, they are absorbed through the wall of the small intestine into the blood and then delivered throughout the body. Sometimes the body doesn't make enough digestive enzymes, which can slow digestion and lead to uncomfortable symptoms. For example, if your small intestine doesn't make enough of the enzyme lactase, you can have difficulty digesting lactose, the sugar in milk and milk-based products. This can lead to bloating, flatulence, and loose stools. Doctors prescribe special enzyme pills to substitute for the lack of natural enzyme production for people who can't make enough digestive enzymes because of a health condition, like chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis. People with known deficiencies get benefit from these drugs. On the other hand, over-the-counter digestive enzyme supplements — available in health food stores and drugstores or through the Internet — are not medications. The FDA does not regulate them. Therefore, you can't be sure how the pills are made or the amount of enzymes they may contain. A lactase supplement (such as Lactaid or Lactrase) can help people manage lactose intolerance. An alpha-galactosidase supplement (like Beano or Bean Relief) may reduce gas and bloating if you have difficulty digesting the sugars in beans. Even though you have not identified specific foods as problematic, it's still likely that dietary changes will help reduce your discomfort. Consider a consultation with a registered dietitian.

https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/news/20240529/breast-cancer-in-young-women-rates-rise-guidelines-shift,"Breast Cancer in Young Women: Rates Rise, Guidelines Shift",1,"May 29, 2024 -- Breast cancer does not discriminate based on age. Women across the world are increasingly becoming diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 40. Researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found a 20% increase in breast cancer diagnoses among women born in 1990 compared to those born in 1955. Moreover, the types of breast cancer found in women under 40 “tend to have later-stage tumors, when the disease is more advanced and more difficult to treat,” according to Adetunji T. Toriola, MD, PhD, MPH, co-leader of the Cancer Prevention and Control Program at Siteman Cancer Center in St. Louis, MO. Making matters worse, most women don’t begin regular breast cancer screening until at least age 40. In fact, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released new guidelines this month to begin mammograms every other year at age 40, rather than the previous annual exam at 50. Such a large shift in the recommended screening age raises the question: What is causing breast cancer in younger women? There are many factors at play. Some of these include: Toxin Exposure There are over 2,400 chemicals banned within European cosmetic companies; there are 11 banned in the United States. Because the FDA does not have the authority to require cosmetic companies to submit their safety data, tracking the ingredients list and safety risks is difficult. More than 80,000 chemicals have been introduced into the marketplace in the past 50 years, many of which are known carcinogens. Many of these chemicals are found in items targeted for women. Repeat exposure to these known toxins can increase the risk of breast cancer. Screening Exams The lack of screening exams for women under 40 are one of the biggest risk factors for the advancement of breast cancer to a later stage. Insurance policies have made it difficult to access ultrasounds and mammograms for screening purposes for younger women. While these imaging tools should not be the first choice for screening, it should not be difficult to access when a woman suspects a problem or is considered “high risk.” Joshua Jarman, MD, a breast radiologist with Saint Alphonsus Health System in Boise, ID, believes that “some of the uptick is actually because of increased screening.” In a lot of cases, he said, an early-stage cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ “would have smoldered in the breast for a long time without women even knowing.” While the increased screening may explain the increase in diagnoses among women, it does not shed a light on what’s causing a higher incidence of aggressive breast cancers. Lack of Education The absence of curriculum in health classes that teach students how to perform a breast self-exam is a major component in the lack of detection. Health education classes in many Middle Eastern and African countries have created curriculum that supports breast health education. They instruct the students, both male and female students, how to perform a breast exam and when. In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended ending the practice of teaching teen girls in high school how to perform self-exams. The group, whose recommendations health care insurance companies typically follow, found the exams could cause mental health problems and lead to unnecessary biopsies and treatments. “For the teaching of [self-exams], there is moderate certainty that the harms outweigh the benefits,” the task force said at the time. Genetics Genetics play a major role in the development of breast cancer in young women, which is why it is important to ask questions within your family. Younger women diagnosed with breast cancer are typically associated with a genetic link. There are genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2 that can be hereditary among men and women. Johns Hopkins found that BRCA genes may account for a “45-85% chance of developing breast cancer in your lifetime, along with a 10-46% chance of developing ovarian cancer.” Certain cancers within the family can also be related to breast or ovarian cancer, such as: The closer the relation to a family member – such as your mother or sister -- with these types of cancer, the higher the risk of developing breast cancer. Genetic counseling and testing can be performed with a simple questionnaire and a blood test to determine whether there are genetic mutations. Race Race, unfortunately, also places women at higher risk for breast cancer at younger ages. Research from a 2024 study has found that Black women, especially among those ages 20 to 29, have a 53% increased risk compared with white women of the same age group. A study from 2020 found that Black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than any other ethnic group as well. Increased risks for the development of breast cancer are hereditary among eastern European Jews. The CDC has found about 1 in 40 Ashkenazi women carry the BRCA gene, making them more susceptible to developing breast cancer under the age of 50. Increased Cases of Hormone-Positive Breast Cancers There has been an increase in hormone-positive and HER2-positive cancers in the United States. On cancer cells, there may or may not be the presence of hormone receptors. The hormone receptors are referred to as ER (estrogen receptor) and PR (progesterone receptor) and will either be negative or positive when tested. These hormone receptors feed off estrogen and progesterone, resulting in cancer cell growth. The hormones do not cause cancer, but they provide nourishment to cancer cells and support growth. Younger women have higher levels of these hormones to aid in fertility. When there is an increase in hormone-positive cancers, these hormones fuel the cancer that is going undetected. “We also hope to learn from the decrease in estrogen-receptor-negative tumors,” Toriola said. “If we understand what is driving that rate down, perhaps we can apply it in efforts to reduce or prevent other breast tumor types.” On a cancer cell, there may or may not be a protein called HER2. There has been an increase in HER2-positive breast cancer cases, which is associated with a more aggressive form of breast cancer. Risk factors for HER2-positive breast cancers include first child born after age 30, having prior radiation to the chest, being less than 30 years old, and having a family history of breast cancer. A potential contributor to the rising numbers of hormone-positive breast cancers is the use of oral birth control. The CDC found that roughly 14% of U.S. women between the ages of 15 and 49 take oral birth control. Oral birth control artificially raises the levels of estrogen and progesterone circulating within the body, which could contribute to a growth of hormone-positive cancer. Conclusion Breast cancer is an extremely treatable form of cancer. When detected early, the chances of remission increase and complications from the cancer decrease. With the rise in younger women developing breast cancers, it is more important than ever to educate women on the risk factors and the tools they can utilize to decrease their overall risk. Beginning mammograms as soon as possible, advocating for their care, and routine monitoring is essential for every female to ensure early detection.",7,-0.08684428,0.16990878,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-is-non-hdl-cholesterol,What is non-HDL cholesterol?,1,"Q. My recent cholesterol test results included a value I haven't seen before: non-HDL cholesterol. What's the relevance of that number, and what's a healthy value? A. A standard cholesterol test (also called a lipid profile) typically features four numbers: total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. Recently, non-HDL cholesterol (your total cholesterol minus your HDL cholesterol) has started appearing on some of these reports. In coming years, its relevance may rise for two reasons: (1) you don't need to fast to check your non-HDL cholesterol, and (2) for many people, it may be as good as (or even more reliable than) LDL for assessing heart disease risk. Traditionally, doctors have focused mainly on LDL cholesterol, mostly because large studies have revealed that statins and other drugs that lower LDL cholesterol levels also decrease the risk of heart attacks and related problems. Also, a number of guidelines have instituted target LDL levels for various levels of risk. However, most labs don't directly measure LDL in your blood sample. Instead they use a formula to calculate your LDL based on your triglycerides and other lipid values. When and what you eat affects your triglyceride levels, so you ideally should fast before the blood test, which helps standardize the results. But many doctors no longer tell patients to fast, as it may be difficult depending on when they get their blood drawn. Because the non-HDL cholesterol calculation is not based on a triglyceride value, you aren't required to fast before the test; the results are similar whether you fast or not. A non-HDL cholesterol value includes all the atherogenic (artery-clogging) lipoprotein particles — not just LDL, but also very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL). These particles, which transport triglycerides to tissues, are eventually transformed into LDL. Increasingly, lipid experts acknowledge that the non-HDL cholesterol value may be superior to the LDL cholesterol value for predicting heart disease. Most people eat every few hours during the day, which means we spend the better part of our waking hours in a ""fed"" rather than fasting state. So results from non-fasting blood tests better reflect our typical physiology. Also, the widely used online Heart Risk Calculator (www.cvriskcalculator.com) uses the non-HDL cholesterol number. The target for non-HDL cholesterol is no greater than 30 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) above your recommended LDL level. For example, if your LDL target is under 100 mg/dL, you should strive for a non-HDL cholesterol level of 130 mg/dL or less. If your non-HDL cholesterol is elevated, your doctor might further intensify your LDL-lowering therapy or focus on lowering elevated triglycerides.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/trying-to-lower-stubbornly-high-ldl-cholesterol-202211012842,Trying to lower stubbornly high LDL cholesterol?,1,"Recently I met with Nancy, a 72-year-old woman with coronary artery disease, to review her latest cholesterol results. Despite taking a statin, following a healthy diet, and exercising regularly, her low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remained above our target. ""What else can I do?"" she asked. ""When I increase my statin dose I get terrible leg pains. But I don't want to have another heart attack!"" When elevated, LDL contributes to cardiovascular disease, which can cause a heart attack or stroke. Taking statin drugs can drop LDL levels in most people by about 30%, substantially lowering this risk. Usually, these commonly prescribed drugs work effectively with tolerable side effects. But what if a person's LDL level remains too high on their maximally tolerated dose? An expert consensus report issued by the American College of Cardiology lays out a clear path for next steps. What is a healthy target for LDL cholesterol? Target LDL depends on many factors, including your age, family history, and personal history of cardiovascular disease. For people at intermediate risk, LDL should be lowered by 30% to 50%. For those who have already had a heart attack, target LDL is no more than 70 mg/dl (note: automatic download). Which non-statin therapies are recommended first? Five non-statin therapies described in this post aim to help people achieve target LDL goals while minimizing side effects. They may be combined with a statin or given instead of statins. Each helps lower LDL cholesterol when diet and statins are not sufficient, such as when there is a family history of high cholesterol (familial hypercholesterolemia). But so far, only two options are proven to reduce cardiovascular risk — the risk for heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and other issues affecting the heart and blood vessels. Ezetimibe (Zetia) What it does: Lowers LDL and cardiovascular risk by reducing cholesterol absorption. How it's given: A daily pill Relatively inexpensive and often given with statins. PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) What it does: A protein called PCSK9 controls the number of LDL receptors on cells. These medicines are monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 that increase LDL receptors on the liver, helping to clear circulating LDL from the bloodstream. How it's given: A shot every two to four weeks Highly effective for lowering LDL, but expensive and may not be covered by insurance. Three newer non-statin therapies Three newer, FDA-approved non-statin therapies are highly effective for lowering LDL cholesterol. Whether these lessen cardiovascular risk is not yet known. Bempedoic acid (Nexletol) What it does: Like statins, bempedoic acid tells the liver to make less cholesterol. How it's given: A daily pill Bempedoic acid is activated only in the liver, whereas statins are activated in liver and muscle tissue. Experts hope that this difference will translate to a similar LDL lowering effect, but without the muscle aches that some people who take statins report. Indeed, early trials show this medication lowers LDL cholesterol by about 20% to 25% compared to placebo. Potential downsides include high cost and a possible increase in the risk of tendon rupture, gout, and a heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. Results of larger trials are expected in late 2022. Evinacumab (Evkeeza) What it does: Rare individuals born without a cholesterol-processing protein called ANGPTL3 have extremely low LDL and triglyceride levels, which lowers their risk for coronary heart disease by about 40%. Taking a cue from nature, scientists developed evinacumab, a monoclonal antibody that turns off ANGPTL3, mimicking this rare condition and resulting in dramatic LDL lowering of almost 50% in one trial. How it's given: Monthly intravenous infusion Currently, the FDA has only approved evinacumab for people with familial hypercholesterolemia. Evinacumab appears safe in early trials, but is very expensive and can only be given in a doctor's office. Inclirisan (Leqvio) What it does: Inclirisan blocks PCSK9. However, unlike alirocumab and evolocumab, which inactivate PCSK9 after it is produced, inclirisan inhibits production of PCSK9 in the liver. Inhibition of PCSK9 leads to an increase in the number of LDL receptors on the surface of the liver, speeding clearance of LDL from the bloodstream and dropping LDL by about 50% (see here and here). How it's given: A shot every six months Potential downsides include increased rate of urinary tract infection, joint and muscle pain, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. This medicine is expensive and insurance may not cover it. What does the report recommend? It reinforces the importance of personalizing a plan to lower LDL by accounting for individual risk, cost of medication, and genetic factors. A combination of lifestyle changes and medicine can help people achieve better control of LDL. So, if you have elevated LDL cholesterol, try to follow healthy eating patterns, exercise regularly, avoid smoking and vaping, and maintain a healthy weight. Statin drugs are the first choice to treat anyone who has elevated cholesterol and cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. If statins aren't sufficient to help you reach your LDL target, or if side effects aren't tolerable, ezetimibe should be added next. PSCK9 inhibitors are then considered for those who remain at increased risk after adding ezetimibe. If LDL targets still cannot be achieved in people with cardiovascular disease, bempedoic acid and inclirisan are considered. For those with familial hypercholesterolemia, evinacumab may be appropriate. Cardiologists eagerly await the results of studies looking at whether the three new LDL-lowering medications also lower risk for heart attack, stroke, and other poor cardiovascular outcomes. Until then, their use is likely to be limited to people at high risk for whom proven, less costly drugs cannot achieve LDL goals.",7,0.2449633,0.21102078,False

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that the farmworker had regular exposure to livestock infected with the H5N1 virus. The Michigan farmworker has mild symptoms and has recovered. The department did not release the worker’s name or employer. The CDC says the risk to the general public is low and that testing of milk and ground beef has not detected evidence of live virus. A Texas dairy farmer was confirmed in April to be the first in the U.S. to contract the virus from sick cattle. That worker also had mild symptoms, reportedly conjunctivitis, or pink eye. A third case occurred in Colorado in 2022, but that was from poultry and was not considered part of the current outbreak. To date, the virus has been confirmed in wild animals including foxes, bears, seals, and sea lions, as well as in domesticated animals, including pets such as cats and dogs, farmed mink and foxes, and livestock such as goats and cows. In Michigan, the state “has led a swift public health response, and we have been tracking this situation closely since influenza A (H5N1) was detected in poultry and dairy herds in Michigan,” said Natasha Bagdasarian, MD, chief medical executive for the state of Michigan. “Farmworkers who have been exposed to impacted animals have been asked to report even mild symptoms, and testing for the virus has been made available.” The CDC reports nine states have seen outbreaks in cattle, affecting 51 herds.",4,-0.3511711,0.09572731,False
https://www.webmd.com/obesity/news/20240521/wegovy-ozempic-aid-weight-loss-with-or-without-surgery,"Wegovy, Ozempic Aid Weight Loss With or Without Surgery",1,"May 21, 2024 – Meaningful weight loss was seen with the weight loss drugs Wegovy or Ozempic regardless of whether people had previous weight loss surgery, a first-of-its-kind study reveals. In addition, insurance coverage/expense was the most common issue for people wishing to start the popular medications, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Side effects and drug shortages were among the reasons people stopped taking the medication. Overall, people lost an average of 6% of their total body weight in almost 1 year of taking semaglutide, the class of drugs that includes Wegovy and Ozempic. When researchers compared people who had weight loss surgery with those who had not, total weight loss was almost identical: 5.8% in those who had surgery, vs. 6.0% who had not. People in this study lost a lower percentage of their total body weight, compared to people in clinical trials for the drugs, who tended to lose up to 15%, said lead investigator Pourya Medhati, MD, a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. These results suggest real-world weight loss results may be different than those in carefully controlled research studies. Medhati presented the findings at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2024 in Washington, DC. Total weight loss was not significantly different between men and women in the surgery group. But in the non-surgery group, women lost 6.4%, compared to 4.8% among men, a significant difference. Medhati and Ali Tavakkoli, MD, chief of the Division of General and GI Surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, used electronic health records to study 2,491 adults prescribed semaglutide between 2018 and 2023 at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Average age was 51, 74% were White, and 78% were women. A total 13% had a history of weight loss surgery. Costs, Side Effects, and Other Concerns The investigators looked at issues around starting and staying on semaglutide in a subgroup of 500 patients. A total of 75 people never started the drug, for example. The majority, 72%, of this group said it was because of insurance coverage or the cost of the medication. Another 19% did not give a reason, and 9% said it was because of side effects. People with higher BMIs and diabetes were less likely start taking semaglutide, Medhati said. Another 100 of the 500 patients started and then stopped semaglutide. Again, insurance coverage and cost were reasons, this time cited by 13%. About 36% stopped because of side effects; 21% pointed to a shortage of semaglutide; and 30% stopped for an unspecified reason. “Our study highlights the importance of addressing insurance to ensure broader access,” Medhati said. The 325 people who stayed on semaglutide lost an average of 8.5% of their total body weight at 50 weeks. Access Remains Unequal “These medications are incredibly powerful to treat obesity and weight-related disease both for people with a history of bariatric surgery and those without,” said session co-moderator Matthew Kroh, MD, vice chair of innovation and technology in the Department of General Surgery at Cleveland Clinic. More equitable access to semaglutide and other GLP-1s is needed, he said. “Because the cost is so high and they’re not covered by most insurance plans at this point, people with better financial means have access to these medications,” while others may not. Kroh said the findings may only apply to the patients, most of whom were female, White, and middle-aged. But he applauded the researchers for doing the study outside of a clinical trial. “Real-world data will help guide these decisions in the future,” he said.",8,0.13545576,0.2019137,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/scientists-discover-hidden-brain-changes-in-regular-cannabis-users/,Scientists Discover Hidden Brain Changes in Regular Cannabis Users,0,"The largest study ever conducted on cannabis and brain function has unveiled concerning findings about how heavy marijuana use affects our cognitive abilities. In a groundbreaking investigation of over 1,000 young adults, researchers discovered that nearly two-thirds of heavy cannabis users showed reduced brain activity during critical memory tasks[1][2]. The Surprising Numbers Heavy cannabis users, defined as those who have used marijuana more than 1,000 times in their lifetime, demonstrated a significant decline in brain activity. Specifically, 63% of lifetime heavy users exhibited reduced brain activity during working memory tasks, while an even higher percentage (68%) of recent users showed similar impairments[4]. What is Working Memory? Working memory is crucial for everyday tasks that we often take for granted. It’s what allows you to remember driving instructions, follow a conversation, or solve a math problem in your head. Think of it as your brain’s temporary sticky note – holding onto information just long enough to use it[2]. The Science Behind the Impact The research revealed decreased activity in several critical brain regions: Key Affected Areas: Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex Anterior insula These regions are vital for decision-making, memory, attention, and emotional processing[1]. The impact was substantial enough to show a measurable difference from non-users, with a Cohen d value of -0.28[10]. Long-Term vs. Recent Use Perhaps most concerning is that the effects appear to persist even after stopping cannabis use. The study found that chronic use had a more significant impact than recent use on working memory difficulties[7]. This suggests that heavy lifetime use might lead to lasting changes in brain function, regardless of current usage patterns. Who’s Most at Risk? The study focused on adults aged 22 to 36, with participants classified into three categories: Heavy users (>1,000 times): 8.8% Moderate users (10-999 times): 17.8% Non-users (<10 times): 73.4%[1] What This Means for You If you’re a cannabis user, these findings suggest that taking breaks before engaging in cognitively demanding tasks could help improve performance[4]. The research indicates that residual cognitive effects might persist for up to four weeks after stopping use[4]. Related: Regular cannabis use linked to negative life outcomes by age 35 Looking Forward As cannabis legalization continues to spread globally, understanding its impact on brain function becomes increasingly crucial. While this research provides valuable insights, it also raises important questions about long-term cognitive health and the need for informed decision-making regarding cannabis use[1][2]. Remember, this study doesn’t suggest that everyone who uses cannabis will experience these effects, but it does highlight the importance of being aware of potential risks, especially for heavy users. As we continue to learn more about how cannabis affects our brains, this research serves as a crucial piece of the puzzle in understanding the long-term implications of heavy use.

https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/news/20240516/drug-overdose-deaths-declined-2023-cdc,Drug Overdose Deaths Declined in 2023: CDC,1,"May 16, 2024 – Annual U.S. drug overdose deaths declined last year. The good news was double-edged, indicating that opioid deaths declined the most, but opioids remained the top killer. The CDC report puts a cap on a steep rise in overdose deaths that spanned the past 5 years and took the annual death toll above 100,000.The decline between 2022 and 2023 was modest and is estimated to be 3%, which is a difference of about 3,500 deaths. The encouraging decline was largely driven by fewer overdose deaths due to opioids. But deaths due to other drugs, like the stimulants cocaine and methamphetamine, rose. Overall, more than 80,000 deaths in 2023 were linked to opioids (mainly synthetic opioids like fentanyl and tramadol). Opioid deaths declined 3.7% from 2022. But overdose deaths involving cocaine climbed 5%, and deaths involving other psychostimulants like methamphetamine rose by 2% in 2023, compared to the prior year. The new total estimate attributes 107,543 deaths to drug overdoses in 2023, down from 111,029 in 2022. The data is considered preliminary because sometimes, drug overdose deaths are first reported as ""no cause of death"" due to lengthy investigations that may include toxicology testing that can take months to confirm. A top CDC official called the numbers “heartening news” and said the progress should reinvigorate further efforts. “Our thoughts remain with those who have lost loved ones and those who are struggling with addiction or know someone who is,” CDC Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry, MD, MPH, said in a statement. “Our country is committed to ending this epidemic and preventing unnecessary death and suffering.” Individuals and families affected by substance use can call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s National Helpline at 800-662-4357.

https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20240516/federal-experts-talk-bird-flu-what-ifs,Federal Experts Talk Bird Flu ‘What Ifs’ in WebMD Live Event,1,"May 16, 2024 – Multiple U.S. agencies are working to contain the recent bird flu outbreak among cattle to prevent further spread to humans (beyond one case reported in early April) and use what we learned before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic to keep farm workers and the general public safe. Fingers crossed, the bird flu will be contained and peter out. Or the outbreak could continue to spread among dairy cattle and other animals, threatening the health and livelihoods of farmers and others who work with livestock. Or the virus could change in a way that makes it easier to infect and spread among people. If this happens, the worst-case scenario could be a new influenza pandemic. With so many unknowns, WebMD brought together experts from four federal agencies to talk prevention, monitoring, and what the “what ifs” of bird flu might look like. Communication with the public “about what we know, what we don’t know, and ways you and your family can stay safe is a priority for us at CDC,” said Nirav D. Shah, MD, JD, the CDC’s principal deputy director. “We at the federal level are responding, and we want the public to be following along.” People should consult the websites for the CDC, FDA, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) for updates. It is essential to not only stay informed, but to seek trusted sources of information, Shah said during “Bird Flu 2024 – What You Need to Know,” an online briefing jointly sponsored by the CDC and WebMD. An 'Experimental Hamburger' If one take-home message emerged from the event, it was that the threat to the general public remains low. The retail milk supply is safe, although consuming raw or unpasteurized milk is not recommended. “While commercial milk supply is safe, we strongly advise against drinking raw milk,” said Donald A. Prater, DVM, acting director for the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. As for other foods, thoroughly cooked eggs are less risky than raw eggs, and the nation’s beef supply remains free of the virus as well. For years, federal inspectors have purchased and tested meat at retail stores, said Eric Deeble, DVM, USDA deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Congressional Relations. So far, H5N1, the virus behind bird flu, has not been detected in beef. The USDA took testing a step further and recently cooked ground beef from dairy cows in their lab. Using what Deeble described as an “experimental hamburger,” the agency showed cooking beef to 165 F or higher kills the virus if it ever becomes necessary. The federal government now requires all cattle be tested and be free of bird flu virus before crossing any state lines. The government is also reimbursing farmers for veterinary care and loss of business related to the outbreak, and supply personal protective equipment (PPE) like gloves, masks, and face shields to workers. Vaccination Not Recommended Now Federal scientists know enough about H5N1 virus to create vaccines against it quickly if the need arises. It’s more about planning ahead at this point. “Vaccines are not part of our response right now,” said David Boucher, PhD, director of infectious diseases preparedness and response at the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. If the virus changes and becomes a bigger threat to people, “we have the building blocks to produce a vaccine,” Boucher added. An event attendee asked if the seasonal flu shot offers any protection. “Unfortunately, the flu shot you got last year does not provide great protection from the avian flu,” Shah responded. “It might do a little bit … but that is the vaccine for seasonal flu. This is something more novel.” Treatments Stockpiled and Ready Antiviral medications, which if given early in the course of bird flu infection could shorten the severity or duration of illness, are available now, Shah said. The dairy farmer who was infected with bird flu earlier this year responded to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) treatment, for example. When it comes to bird flu symptoms, the fact that the only infected person reported so far this year developed pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, is interesting, Shah said. Officials would have expected to see more typical seasonal flu symptoms, he added. “Influenza is not a new virus,” Boucher said. “With this strain of influenza, we are not seeing any genetic markers associated with resistance to antivirals. That means the antivirals we take for seasonal influenza would also be available if needed to treat H5N1.” ASPR has stockpiled Tamiflu and three other antivirals. “We do have tens of millions of courses that can be distributed around the country if we need them,” he added. “Influenza is an enemy we know well,” Boucher said. That is why “we have antivirals ready to go now and many types of PPE.” Science in Action The feds intend to stay on the case. They will continue to monitor emergency department visits, lab test orders, and wastewater samples for any changes suggesting a human pandemic risk is growing. “While we’ve learned a great deal, there are still many things we do not know,” Deeble said. Shah added, “As in any outbreak, this is an evolving situation and things can change. What you are seeing now is science in action.” For the latest updates on bird flu in the United States, visit the CDC’s H5N1 Bird Flu: Current Situation Summary website.",4,-0.43448555,0.14761569,False

Addressing each of those factors can reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and help ward off a heart attack or stroke. Why did the AHA add sleep to the list? Because sleep affects overall health, and getting enough sleep helps keep the other risk factors in check. Plus, wearable trackers make it easier than ever to measure your sleep.

https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20240513/dairy-farmers-will-be-paid-for-bird-flu-testing-safety-efforts,Dairy Farmers Will Be Paid for Bird Flu Testing and Safety Efforts,1,"May 13, 2024 – The federal government will pay dairy producers millions of dollars to participate in biosecurity efforts as health and agriculture officials attempt to better understand and safeguard humans and animals from bird flu. An initial allocation of $98 million was announced Friday and may be spent in just 4 months. The move comes after a Texas dairy farm worker tested positive earlier this year for the virus, which is officially called avian influenza A (H5N1). Since then, inactive virus fragments have been detected in pasteurized milk, and 42 herds of cattle across nine states have tested positive for bird flu. Officials maintain that the commercial milk supply is safe, but admit there is much more they want to learn about how the virus may be affecting animals, humans, and the food supply. Dairy farmers have reportedly been reluctant to voluntarily participate in government efforts to monitor cows and workers. The new plan includes compensation of up to $28,000 per location for farmers and those in dairy industry support roles for a long list of different biosecurity and testing actions, including: The new measures are in addition to earlier testing requirements that apply to some situations in which cows are transported. Federal officials said they would also compensate farmers for loss of milk production related to outbreaks and testing under an existing initiative called the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-raised Fish Program. “While dairy cows that have been infected with H5N1 generally recover well, and there is little mortality associated with the disease, it does dramatically limit milk production, causing economic losses for producers with affected premises,” according to a joint news release issued Friday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Additional new actions by the CDC and FDA will “increase testing and laboratory screening and testing capacity, genomic sequencing, and other interventions to protect the health and safety of dairy and other potentially impacted food items,” the news release stated. The CDC is expected to launch a bird flu wastewater tracking dashboard this week, multiple news outlets reported. Some scientists have criticized the CDC for not implementing a tracking program sooner, the Los Angeles Times reported. “CDC is monitoring wastewater data for any evidence of unusual levels of influenza and is working to develop and validate an influenza wastewater metric that will be publicly shared soon on CDC’s website,” the CDC’s avian flu information webpage stated as of its Friday update. The FDA and CDC advise people not to consume raw milk. Also on Friday, the FDA announced it had completed testing of 297 retail dairy product samples and confirmed preliminary results that no viable form of the virus was detected. The agency said it is conducting further tests on raw milk samples intended for commercial processing to further assess the effectiveness of pasteurization at inactivating the virus in cow milk and other dairy products. “The results from this study will help further the FDA’s understanding of pasteurization efficacy against anticipated concentrations of virus under real-world processing conditions,” the latest FDA update explained.",4,-0.3444784,0.14860694,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/taking-up-adaptive-sports-202209122813,Taking up adaptive sports,1,"Health guidelines recommend adults get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous exercise. Which activities you choose don't matter as long as they get you moving. But what if an injury, illness, health condition, disability, or even normal aging makes being active hard for you? In those cases, adaptive sports could lend a much-needed hand. What are adaptive sports? Adaptive sports are competitive or recreational sports or activities for people with disabilities or physical limitations. They often run parallel to traditional endeavors, but are modified to support people's specific physical abilities. ""Eventually, almost everyone will experience some kind of disability that impedes regular exercise, whether it's mild arthritis, requiring a knee or hip replacement, limited vision, or a more significant physical disability,"" says Dr. Cheri Blauwet, an associate professor in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School, and a former wheelchair racer who is a seven-time Paralympic medalist and two-time winner of both the Boston and New York City Marathons. ""But today, because of advanced technology and supportive infrastructure, people can find almost any kind of sport or activity that takes into account their abilities and helps them stay active."" Why is it important to stay active? Not getting sufficient regular exercise increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. It also affects mood. And people with disabilities are especially vulnerable because of the challenges of staying active, says Dr. Blauwet. ""Adaptive sports are a way for us to continue to exercise regularly and support our health and well-being going forward."" Research backs this up. According to one study, people participating in adaptive sports and activities report better overall health, quality of life, and social life. How can you learn about options for adaptive activities near you? You can find state and local adaptive sports programs and accessible activities through the websites of the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability and the Challenged Athletes Foundation. ""These programs also can help you find mentors, coaches, and the support system that you need to be successful,"" says Dr. Blauwet. What kind of sport or activity you choose ultimately depends on your interests and level of function, but many options are available. Build on strengths and consider new activities Dr. Blauwet shares other strategies that can help you transition to adaptive activities. Look at your current form of exercise. ""Almost any kind of sport or activity can be adjusted to accommodate people with disabilities, so there is a good chance you can continue with a favorite endeavor,"" says Dr. Blauwet. For instance, as part of her ongoing therapy, former Arizona representative Gabby Giffords, an avid cyclist who lives with a brain injury after an assassination attempt, now rides a recumbent bike because of paralysis on her right side and balance issues. (A recumbent bike is a three-wheel bicycle that places the rider in a seated or laid-back reclining position.) Other sports and activities can be altered similarly. For example, specialized golf carts can help you stand and stabilize your body while swinging the club. Sledge hockey uses sleds to skate across the ice. Focus on your strengths. Don't dwell on what you can't do, but focus on what you can. Running no longer an option? How about power walking using walking poles for support? Can't use your legs? Focus on upper body activities like swimming or kayaking. Low vision? Guides are available to help you walk, run, and cycle. Join a team. Many adaptive sports have organized team leagues with adjusted rules and formats, like wheelchair basketball and tennis, and ""beep"" baseball and kickball for individuals with low vision. ""These are a great way to build more awareness about your new endeavor and build a community with other peers with similar disabilities,"" says Dr. Blauwet. ""Plus, a little competition provides extra motivation."" Try something new. Use your new functional status as an opportunity to attempt a different sport or activity. ""Test the waters and try something that has always interested you,"" says Dr. Blauwet. ""Now might be the ideal time to explore waterskiing, windsurfing, horseback riding, or rock wall climbing."" It may be mentally and emotionally tough to embrace adaptive sports and activities, as it can feel like your disability has become magnified. But don't let that dissuade you, adds Dr. Blauwet. ""Staying committed to being active and investing in your health can help reduce and eliminate any negative stigma you feel. Participation in adaptive sports is not a lesser way of living, but a way to live better.""",5,0.24697185,-0.05755777,True

The study, published April 28, 2022, in the journal eClinicalMedicine, analyzed data from 46 adults who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom from March to July 2020, including 16 who needed ventilators. All underwent comprehensive, computerized testing of memory, attention, and reasoning abilities an average of six months after their illness. The researchers compared the test results to data from more than 66,000 people who weren't infected with the virus. The COVID survivors, especially those who'd needed ventilators, logged far slower mental processing speeds and showed less-accurate verbal reasoning than the uninfected group. The researchers estimated their magnitude of cognitive loss to be about 10 IQ points. The results suggest that the cognitive effects of severe COVID infection are still noticeable more than six months afterward and that recovery can be gradual, the investigators said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/the-mental-powers-of-super-agers,The mental powers of super-agers,1,"The general thinking is that memory and other brain functions automatically slow with age. But older adults known as ""super-agers"" have changed that perception. ""This group of individuals can maintain optimal brain power much longer in life,"" says Yuta Katsumi, an instructor in neurology with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""They suggest that age-related brain changes are not always inevitable."" Old brain, young brain Memory decline is often linked to brain shrinkage. But how much brain size changes with age is highly variable. On average, a person's brain declines in volume and weight by about 5% per decade, beginning after age 40. Age-related brain shrinkage tends to affect the brain regions involved with learning and memory, like the frontal lobe and hippocampus. A reduced brain size is also less likely to maintain robust communication among its different parts. ""These brain changes can make it more difficult to learn and process new information, recall names and words, and focus on completing tasks,"" says Katsumi. But super-agers' brains shrink slower — almost half as fast, according to some research. Why this occurs is not fully understood. ""There could be a genetic component that makes these people's brains be more resilient to natural shrinkage or shrink at a slower rate, but the difference also may be associated with lifestyle habits,"" says Katsumi. ""It's also possible some people are born with exceptional memory, so they can still maintain higher-than-normal brain function even when exposed to natural decline."" Living the life So the question becomes, can you make yourself a super-ager? While you can't do anything about your genes, it may be possible to slow cognitive decline — or maybe even improve cognitive function — by following the lifestyle of super-agers. Many super-agers embrace habits that research has linked with healthier brains, including better memory and a lower risk for dementia. For example: Be more social. Super-agers tend to have large social groups. Studies have shown that regular social engagement is a great brain booster. The opposite is also true. Social isolation is linked to lower volumes of gray matter in brain regions related to cognition, according to research published online June 8, 2022, by Neurology. One way to increase social activity is to join a group. Men often find it most natural to bond with others over a shared activity or interest, so consider a walking group, golf or bowling league, card or chess club, or men's club at a senior community center. If you already have a small circle of friends but have trouble getting together regularly, take the initiative and schedule a meeting time. Men respond well to routine, so try setting up a regular gathering for coffee or lunch at the same place, ideally a setting designed for conversation and discussion. Challenge yourself. Studies have linked learning with better memory. ""Anything that can stimulate the mind and engage you to learn new information helps,"" says Katsumi. Focus on topics that interest you. For instance, study a language for an upcoming overseas trip. A study published May 15, 2019, in Frontiers in Neuroscience found that adults ages 59 to 79 who studied a second language for just four months (16 two-hour sessions) improved the neural connectivity in the brain regions responsible for attention, working memory, and language processing. Other examples include signing up for an online class, learning to play an instrument, volunteering for a favorite cause, or mentoring a youth. Even playing video games may improve memory in older adults, according to a 2020 study in Behavioural Brain Research. Eat more ""superfoods."" So-called superfoods are high in antioxidants, which a growing body of research has shown help reduce inflammation and protect cells from disease-causing damage. But scientists also have suggested that other nutrients or compounds — like polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, and specific vitamins and minerals — also play a role. It's no coincidence that many superfoods are staples in confirmed brain-healthy diets like the MIND, DASH, and Mediterranean diets. It's not certain which of these foods or what amounts are ideal, so the consensus is to focus on eating ""superplates"" — meals containing a variety of superfoods. Common choices include the following: berries whole grains (oatmeal, quinoa, barley) fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, trout) nuts (walnuts, almonds, pecans) olive oil cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower) avocados green tea. Be more active. Super-agers are quite active. Research has suggested that exercise can help maintain and possibly improve cognitive function, even if you begin later in life.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/the-hidden-truth-why-colon-cancer-is-rising-among-20-30-year-olds/,The Hidden Truth: Why Colon Cancer Is Rising Among 20-30 Year Olds,0,"At 25, Sarah thought her persistent stomach pain was just stress from her new job. At 28, she was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer. Her story isn’t an anomaly – it’s part of a frightening new trend. Someone born in the 1990s is twice as likely to develop colorectal cancer compared to those born in the 1950s[2]. Even more alarming is the staggering 333% surge in cases among young adults in just two decades[1]. This isn’t just another health statistic – it’s a wake-up call for an entire generation that thought they were too young to worry about colon cancer. Why This Generation Faces Higher Risks Our modern lifestyle has created a perfect storm of risk factors. The combination of ultra-processed foods, extended screen time, and sedentary habits has dramatically increased our vulnerability[4]. Rising obesity rates among young adults, coupled with significant changes in gut microbiome due to modern diets, create an environment where colon cancer can thrive[4]. Environmental pollutants further compound these risks, making our generation particularly susceptible[4]. The Changing Landscape of Colon Cancer What was once considered an “older person’s disease” has evolved into a serious threat for younger adults. Colon cancer now ranks as the leading cause of cancer deaths in men under 50 and stands second only to breast cancer in women of the same age group[5][6]. This dramatic shift demands a complete reimagining of how we approach cancer prevention and awareness. Critical Warning Signs for Young Adults Commonly Overlooked Symptoms Young people often mistake serious warning signs for minor health issues. Persistent belly cramps might be dismissed as stress, and chronic fatigue attributed to a busy lifestyle[7]. Unexplained weight changes, rectal bleeding (often misidentified as hemorrhoids), and changes in bowel habits deserve immediate attention, not rationalization[7]. Signs Requiring Immediate Medical Attention Certain symptoms should trigger immediate medical consultation: Blood in stool persisting beyond 48 hours[7] Unrelenting abdominal pain[7] Unexplained weight loss[7] Chronic changes in bowel movements[7] Consistently narrow, pencil-thin stools[7] Proactive Prevention for Young Adults Traditional screening guidelines are evolving, but don’t wait for symptoms to act. Consider early screening if you have family history[8]. Focus on preventive measures: embrace a fiber-rich diet, minimize processed foods, maintain regular exercise, and limit alcohol consumption[3]. Most importantly, take digestive issues seriously and seek prompt medical attention when concerns arise. Your Age Is Not Your Shield The myth that youth provides protection against colon cancer must be dispelled. This disease is becoming more aggressive and striking earlier than ever before[9]. Understanding and acting on warning signs could mean the difference between early detection and late-stage diagnosis[10]. Remember: in today’s world, age offers no immunity against colon cancer, making vigilance and early detection crucial for survival. CITATIONS",1,0.15673006,0.15259354,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/vegetable-oil-may-increase-cancer-spread/,"This Vegetable Oil May Increase Cancer Spread, Study Finds",0,"In a groundbreaking scientific discovery, researchers have uncovered a concerning link between a common cooking oil and cancer progression. Let’s get into what you need to know. The Discovery Scientists at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Barcelona have made a startling finding – palmitic acid, a fatty acid commonly found in palm oil, may increase the likelihood of cancer spreading throughout the body[1]. This discovery is particularly significant since palm oil is an ingredient found in numerous everyday products, from chocolate to toothpaste and shampoo[1]. The Science Explained When cancer spreads through the body – a process called metastasis – it becomes much more dangerous. In fact, metastasis is responsible for approximately 90% of cancer-related deaths worldwide, claiming around nine million lives annually[1]. The research, published in Nature[3], revealed that palmitic acid can actually alter the cancer genome[1]. Even more concerning, these effects persist long after exposure to the fatty acid has ended[1]. The study showed that cancer cells exposed to palmitic acid developed the ability to form neural networks around tumors, making it easier for cancer to spread[1]. Important Distinctions Not all fatty acids show this effect. The researchers found that other common fatty acids, such as: Oleic acid (found in olive oil) Linoleic acid (found in flaxseeds) Did not promote cancer spread[1]. Future Hope Scientists are already working on developing new therapies to interrupt this process, with clinical trials potentially beginning within the next few years[1]. However, researchers caution against making immediate dietary changes without proper medical guidance[2]. CITATIONS",3,0.16809313,0.03843534,False

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-lowdown-on-good-cholesterol,"The lowdown on ""good"" cholesterol",1,"Our bodies rely on cholesterol to create cell membranes, make hormones, and synthetize vitamin D, among other things. This waxy fat travels through the blood in tiny particles called lipoproteins, which come in a range of shapes and sizes. But too much of the wrong type in the wrong place can create problems. The tale of ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is pretty straightforward. Excess LDL ends up in artery walls, triggering plaque buildup and inflammation, and raising heart attack risk. Lowering LDL reduces that risk. But the story of ""good"" high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is a bit more complex. ""We used think of HDL as protective because it grabs cholesterol from the bloodstream and other tissues and transports it to the liver, where it's recycled or disposed,"" says Dr. Jorge Plutzky, director of preventive cardiology at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. But it turns out that not all HDL particles perform this function, which is known as reverse cholesterol transport. Some types of HDL are indifferent to cholesterol, and others actually block the process of reverse cholesterol transport. Failed promises Over the past decade, five different experimental drugs known as CETP inhibitors have been tested in large clinical trials in people with low HDL. All the drugs raise HDL levels dramatically — sometimes by as much as 60%. But most haven't clearly achieved their real goal: preventing heart attacks, stroke, and other complications from clogged arteries. Maybe that's because they increased the wrong type of HDL, according to researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who scrutinized 16 of the 200-plus different subtypes of HDL. In a study published in 2021 in Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology, they found that two of the experimental drugs, evacetrapib and torcetrapib, tended to raise the subtypes of HDL that are not associated with cardiovascular benefit. Still, another new CETP inhibitor called obicetrapib looks promising. When taken with a high-intensity statin, the drug raises HDL but also — perhaps more importantly — lowers LDL by about 50%. Larger studies of this experimental drug are currently under way. Danger from very high HDL? Past observational studies in large groups of people have suggested that those with higher HDL levels (above 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/dL for women) tend to have fewer heart attacks. However, a recent analysis found that people with very high HDL levels (80 mg/dL or higher) were about as likely to die from heart disease as people with low HDL (30 mg/dL or lower). The findings, gleaned from nearly 20,000 people with heart disease, were published May 18, 2022, in JAMA Cardiology. Rare genetic variations known to cause high HDL but also increase heart disease risk didn't explain these paradoxical findings. Other health habits could be at play, such as frequent alcohol intake, which is known to raise HDL and may increase heart attack risk (see ""A daily drink: Not as harmless as you think"" in the July 2022 Heart Letter). In addition, a national large health survey found that people who consumed at least 10% of total calories from added sugar were up to three times more likely to have low HDL as those who took in half that much sugar. People who consumed the most sugar had HDL levels that were, on average, about 11 points lower than the low-sugar-intake group. Other research has linked high-sugar diets with an increased risk of death from heart disease. Take-home message What should you make of these new results? A very low or very high HDL value should be a red flag warning to double down on your efforts to dodge heart disease, an editorial accompanying the JAMA Cardiology study suggests. Traditionally, the things that doctors recommend to keep your heart healthy, such as exercising and eating a mostly plant-based diet, are also thought to boost HDL. ""That's especially true for people who have high triglycerides, which tend to go hand-in-hand with low HDL levels,"" says Dr. Plutzky. Also, lifestyle changes have clear benefits even if they don't change your HDL levels. For example, among people who smoke, quitting can raise HDL levels and is also known to markedly reduce cardiovascular risk. ""For lowering your risk of heart attack and stroke, reducing elevated LDL cholesterol is still the main priority,"" says Dr. Plutzky. If you've already had a heart attack or been diagnosed with heart disease, aim for an LDL of at least 70 mg/dL, if not lower. For everyone else, an LDL of 100 mg/dL or lower is a good goal.

https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/news/20240501/reclassification-of-marijuana-doesnt-mean-its-safer,Easing Marijuana Laws Doesn’t Mean the Drug Is Safer,1,"May 1, 2024 – You shouldn’t draw major conclusions about the safety of marijuana amid the recent announcement that federal regulators may reclassify the drug, experts are cautioning But the move is expected to make it easier for scientists to study questions about safety and how well marijuana works as a medical treatment. One legal expert said it could change how the federal government views using medical marijuana by prescription in a state where medical usage is legal under state law. Right now, that is still considered illegal under federal law. “If you're a patient in a state with a medical marijuana law and your physician gives you a prescription for medical marijuana and you possess it, you will no longer be guilty of a federal crime,” said Robert Mikos, JD, LaRoche family chair in law at Vanderbilt University Law School in Nashville. The Drug Enforcement Administration is proposing to change how marijuana is classified, from a Schedule I to Schedule III drug. Schedule I also includes drugs like heroin, and the proposed change would drop marijuana to a lower-risk group that includes drugs like Suboxone, which is used to treat heroin addiction. “I don’t think the intention in moving it from Schedule I to III was to send a message to the public that it’s safe to use. I hope people are not misinterpreting or over-interpreting what the change in schedule implies,” said psychiatrist Deepak Cyril D’Souza, MD, director of the Yale Center for the Science of Cannabis and Cannabinoids in New Haven, CT. The Justice Department confirmed the proposed change Wednesday. “Today, the Attorney General circulated a proposal to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III,” Xochitl Hinojosa, the department's director of public affairs, said in a statement. “Once published by the Federal Register, it will initiate a formal rulemaking process as prescribed by Congress in the Controlled Substances Act.” The federal government defines Schedule I drugs as having a strong potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use, while Schedule III carries a “a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.” Some other Schedule III drugs are steroids, testosterone, and certain combinations of limited codeine with Tylenol. There are two more levels – Schedules IV and V – with even lower risks of abuse or dependence. “There is some data suggesting that there may be therapeutic applications to cannabis,” said D’Souza, using the scientific term for marijuana. “So to that extent, I think the reclassification does make sense.” Andrew Esch, MD, a palliative care specialist in Tampa, FL, has already received some calls from patients asking what the proposed change may mean for them. Esch, who specializes in treating patients with serious illnesses, meets the state of Florida’s requirements to certify patients to buy medical marijuana from a dispensary. He praised the reclassification announcement. “I think it matters a lot, and I think it’s a great step in the right direction in getting us information that will help our patients,” said Esch, who also serves as a senior education adviser to the Center to Advance Palliative Care at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Although he never uses marijuana as a first-line treatment, Esch said it’s an important option because of its potential to treat problems with nausea, appetite, and sleep, as well as pain and anxiety, all of which are common among people with serious illnesses. But sometimes, his patients aren’t willing to consider using marijuana. “Patients are savvy and they know how to work the internet. If I suggest medical marijuana, they look it up and see that it’s classified the same as heroin, and they get very, very scared,” he said. “This reclassification, when they see it listed with things like Tylenol with codeine, it becomes a lot less scary to them.” When prescribing marijuana, Esch manages it the same way that he manages an opioid prescription. “I think marijuana can be safe if it’s used in the right patients and monitored closely,” he said. “There’s just a lot more data with opioids than there is with marijuana, and I think both have their dangers and both have their benefits.” In states where marijuana is still illegal under state law, not much will change. ""You still wouldn't be committing a federal crime, but you could be violating state law,” Mikos said. “That's a much more salient consideration because if you look at who goes after individuals who possess small amounts of drugs, the state handles 99% of those cases. The Known Risks of Marijuana Currently, 38 states and Washington, DC, allow the use of medical marijuana, and 24 states allow recreational use. Nearly 1 in 5 people use marijuana in the U.S. in a complex legal landscape where it remains illegal at the federal level. “There’s very little science to support what’s happening in reality,” D’Souza said. “The argument that has been posed is that there is no good science because of the draconian regulations. So, if these regulations are relaxed and marijuana is rescheduled from Schedule I to III, that might allow researchers to answer some of these fundamental questions.” Doing research studies involving a Schedule I drug carries high levels of risks, liabilities, and detailed inspections with the DEA. D’Souza has studied marijuana for 3 decades and says the regulatory complexities deter many researchers. His latest project will examine marijuana as a treatment for nerve pain. The lack of research, coupled with increasing access to the drug as states legalize it for recreational or medical use, means people are often turning outside the scientific community for information. “People are interested in what Snoop Dogg and Willie Nelson have to say about cannabis,” D’Souza said. “It’s hard for us in the scientific community to compete against it. I think we’ve done a very bad job of educating people.” He noted that marijuana today is up to 20 times more potent than marijuana that was commonly used in the 1960s through the 1980s, and marijuana addiction rates have risen from around 10% of users to up to 30%. Known risks of marijuana use include: “As a physician, as a psychiatrist, and as someone who has studied cannabis for 30 years, I would say I continue to have concerns about the impact of cannabis on human health, similar to my concerns about the impact of alcohol and tobacco on human health. And as you know, those are in the top 10 causes for global disease burden,” D’Souza said. “The game changer was the commercialization of those products.” Staff writer Kelli Whitlock Burton contributed to this report.",8,-0.11154103,-0.020933136,False

https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamin-d-supplements-fail-to-lower-heart-disease-risk/,"Vitamin D Supplements Fail to Lower Heart Disease Risk, Study Shows",0,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in adults over 65 years old, a demographic that often struggles with low Vitamin D levels. This has raised questions about whether Vitamin D supplements could be a potential safeguard against heart issues. However, despite numerous observational studies suggesting a link between low Vitamin D levels and increased cardiovascular risk, randomized trials have produced different results. Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center set out to clarify this issue through a rigorous study. They focused on whether high doses of Vitamin D could lower the presence of two proteins in the blood that indicate cardiac injury and strain. By utilizing a double-blind, randomized trial—considered the gold standard in clinical testing—the team aimed to provide clearer insights into the relationship between Vitamin D supplementation and heart health. The study, published in the American Journal of Preventative Cardiology, revealed some striking findings. Lead author Dr. Katharine W. Rainer emphasized that their analysis disproved the hypothesis that higher doses of Vitamin D could reduce cardiovascular risk in adults with low blood levels of the vitamin. Over a two-year follow-up period, Vitamin D supplementation showed no effect on the markers of cardiovascular disease, regardless of the dose administered. Related: The Shocking Truth About Vitamin D You Absolutely Must Know Conducting this study required participants aged 70 and older with low Vitamin D levels. They were divided into four groups, receiving daily doses of 200, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 International Units of Vitamin D3. Researchers measured blood levels of cardiovascular markers both at the beginning and during the follow-up visits at three, 12, and 24 months. The findings revealed that while there was an initial association between lower Vitamin D levels and one marker of cardiovascular disease, supplementation itself did not lead to any reductions in these markers over time. This conclusion remained consistent across factors such as age, sex, race, and existing health conditions, including high blood pressure and diabetes. Senior author Dr. Stephen P. Juraschek added that although more research is needed to understand the link between Vitamin D deficiency and cardiovascular disease, the results from their study clearly suggest that Vitamin D supplementation alone is not an effective prevention strategy for heart-related events. Interestingly, Dr. Juraschek hinted that other elements, perhaps linked to lifestyle choices like outdoor physical activity, may offer better avenues for preventing cardiovascular diseases, rather than relying solely on Vitamin D supplementation. Related: 12 Bizarre Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency You Need to Know In summary, while Vitamin D has long been associated with various health benefits, including heart health, this latest trial provides compelling evidence that simply increasing Vitamin D levels through supplementation does not significantly lower cardiac risk. As researchers continue to explore the complexities surrounding Vitamin D and cardiovascular health, the focus may shift to broader preventive strategies that encompass various lifestyle factors.

https://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/news/20240419/cm/how-long-should-active-surveillance-of-prostate-cancer-last,How Long Should Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer Last?,1,"April 19, 2024 -- Men with low-risk prostate cancer who go on active surveillance rather than treatment are best followed- for more than 15 years — and perhaps indefinitely — according one of the longest studies to date to look at the issue. Previous studies have shown that active surveillance continued for 15 years is appropriate to identify men who progress and need treatment, but now data out to 25 years ""suggest that meticulous follow-up is needed over a longer time if the chance for cure is not to be missed,"" said Emmeli Palmstedt, PhD, a research student in the Department of Urology at the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. ""These data are crucial, given the long current life expectancy"" of men in otherwise good health. Palmstedt presented the findings at the 2024 annual meeting of the European Association of Urology. At many cancer clinics, active surveillance is a standard of care for men with low-risk prostate cancer based on a benefit-to-risk ratio that favors delayed intervention, according to Palmstedt. Several studies have supported follow-up for 15 years. But new data now extends that suggestion Treatment-Free Survival Falls to 31% The rate of patients who survive without treatment, which was estimated to be 65% in a 15-year analysis published in 2016, had declined to 31%. The rate of failure-free survival – meaning that during and after treatment a patient lives with the disease but does not get worse -- was 59%, and prostate cancer-specific survival was 92%, according to the researchers. Palmstedt noted that deaths from prostate cancer among all low-risk patients climbed fourfold (8% vs 2%) since the 2016 figures were published. The proportion of men no longer failure-free climbed from 10% to more than 40%. ""These are non-negligible numbers,"" said Palmstedt, who added that overall survival fell from 69% at 15 years to 37% at 25 years. Although some men between the 15-year and 25-year timepoints were switched to watchful waiting – meaning doctors watch the prostate cancer until it has metastasized or started to cause symptoms -- these data have not yet been analyzed. The low rate of deaths from prostate cancer over the extended period is reassuring, Palmstedt said, but the main message from the new study is that active surveillance permits treatment toward a cure to be offered even after late follow-up. She emphasized that patients without progression by 15 years cannot be considered ""safe."" Based on these data, ""men with a long remaining life expectancy should be informed that active surveillance is still viable after 15 years,"" Palmstedt said. Active Surveillance Now More Common Over the past decade, the proportion of men with prostate cancer managed with active surveillance has been rising steadily, according to Matthew R. Cooperberg, MD, MPH, a professor of urology at the University of California, San Francisco. In a study published last year in JAMA Network Open, Cooperberg and his colleagues reported that rates of active surveillance rose from 26.5% in 2014 to 59.6% in 2021. However, given the value of the approach for avoiding overtreatment of men with low-risk prostate cancers, even that increase is not enough, he said. ""The window of opportunity for cure is typically very wide,"" Cooperberg said. Although many men ""will never need treatment…long-term surveillance is definitely important"" for those that do, he said. The data from trials supports the principle that this strategy still preserves the option of treatment when it is needed. ""Treatment for cure at age 70 is generally far preferable to treatment at 55, and surveillance should absolutely be preferred treatment for the vast majority of men with low-grade disease at diagnosis,"" he explained.",8,-0.11698438,0.109009966,False

Indiana-based Eli Lilly sells tirzepatide under the brand name Zepbound, which was approved by the FDA in November to treat overweight and obesity. Tirzepatide is also marketed under the name Mounjaro to treat diabetes, and it's among the same class of drugs as other well-known weight loss and diabetes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. Sleep apnea is a disorder where regular breathing is interrupted or obstructed during sleep, and it's linked to serious health problems affecting the heart, kidneys, and metabolic system. Many people with sleep apnea use a device called a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine while they sleep to treat the condition. The newly announced results came from a pair of studies that followed people with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who also had obesity. People in the study took tirzepatide, which is given by injection, for one year. One study evaluated people who were using a sleep apnea device called positive airway pressure during sleep, and another study included people who didn’t use the device. People in both studies taking tirzepatide had significant reductions in sleep events and also lost about 20% of body weight. About 70% of people in the studies were men. The findings have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, and the preliminary results were announced by Eli Lilly because of reporting requirements related to information that could affect stock prices. The company indicated that detailed results will be presented at a conference of the American Diabetes Association in June and will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for consideration of publication. The company also plans to submit the information to the FDA for approval consideration mid-year, the investor news release stated. People in the study taking tirzepatide on average experienced 63% fewer instances of reduced oxygen due to breathing changes, or events when breathing entirely stopped, Eli Lilly reported. The reduction was the equivalent of 30 fewer events per hour. The severity of sleep apnea is measured by the number of events per hour, often referred to as the Apnea Hypopnea Index: A sleep expert from Washington University in St. Louis told The New York Times that the initial findings were extremely positive and noted that tirzepatide works to treat the underlying cause of sleep apnea, rather than current treatments that just address symptoms. Tirzepatide “is a great alternative for people who are obese and can’t use CPAP or are on CPAP and want to improve the effect,” Eric Landsness, MD, PhD, told the Times. Eli Lilly indicated that the most commonly reported adverse events in the studies were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. An estimated 39 million people have obstructive sleep apnea and about 33 million people use CPAP machines, according to The National Council on Aging. The condition has been increasingly diagnosed in recent years and becomes more likely to affect people as they get older.",8,0.09790633,0.096646264,False

Yesterday, tens of thousands of Jews hit the streets to protest in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, New York, and London against Benjamin Netanyahu. I have created a video report that is less than 7 minutes long. Most of the protesters you will see in these videos are Jews who do not support Netanyahu. Netanyahu’s government has issued their final warning to the Palestinians, telling them to leave or face the consequences, as they will soon start evacuating the Palestinians from Gaza. Defense Minister Israel Katz warns Gazans that Israel will soon issue evacuation orders for combat zones in the Strip, as the military returns to fighting against Hamas. “Gaza residents, this is a final warning.” “The Air Force strikes against Hamas terrorists were just the first step. It will become much more difficult and you will pay the full price,” he says. Katz says that if the hostages are not released and Hamas is not removed from Gaza, “Israel will operate with strength you have not yet seen.” “Take the US president’s advice. Return the hostages and remove Hamas, and other options will open for you, including leaving for other places in the world for those who want to,” he says. “The alternative is absolute destruction,” Katz adds. Source. As I wrote in yesterday’s article, the current conflict in the Middle East was reportedly discussed in Trump’s phone call with Putin yesterday. I wrote that Iran was a member of BRICs and probably had the backing of China and Russia, and that perhaps this is the main reason why Israel has not attacked Iran yet. Trump and Russian President Putin allegedly had a phone call today, and as was expected, nothing of significance has been published about this call. However, we do know that they discussed Israel and the Middle East, according to reports. Let’s remember that Russia has the upper hand here with their new Oreshnik missile that was unleashed late last year, and which no defense system can defend against. But the fact that Israel and the Middle East were addressed in the call is significant. Russia has used Iranian-made drones during the Ukraine conflict, and they have trade relationships with each other as members of BRICS. This is probably the one main reason the U.S. and Israel have hesitated on direct attacks against Iran. (Full article.) I researched this further today, and learned that Iran, Russia, and China just completed joint naval exercises off the coast of Iran a few days ago, as part of the “Maritime Security Belt-2025”. This did not appear anywhere in my news feeds last week, and I had to search for it. TEHRAN – Iran has reaffirmed its pivotal role in regional security by leading the seventh iteration of the Maritime Security Belt-2025 joint naval exercises alongside China and Russia, held March 10–13 near the strategic port of Chabahar. The drills, marked by advanced tactical operations and aerial maneuvers, underscored Tehran’s commitment to safeguarding vital maritime routes while strengthening alliances with global powers in the face of shifting geopolitical dynamics. The exercises featured synchronized day and night aerial target shooting, tactical formations, mock rescue missions, and a grand naval parade, demonstrating heightened interoperability among the three nations. Rear Admiral Mostafa Tajeddini, deputy operations commander of Iran’s Navy, hailed the drills as a testament to Iran’s technical sophistication and leadership. “The execution of these operations demands precise coordination and step-by-step orders,” he stated, emphasizing the seamless integration of the Iranian Navy (part of Artesh) and Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Navy with Chinese and Russian fleets. Notably, this year’s drills expanded operational scope, deploying helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft in deeper waters—a strategic leap from prior iterations. Tajeddini underscored the significance of such advancements, describing them as critical to countering “external threats” and ensuring regional stability. Rear Admiral Tajeddini also reiterated Iran’s uncompromising stance: “We will not tolerate any threats or incursions into the nation’s maritime borders.” “Unity at sea today ensures stability onshore tomorrow,” he added. The choice of Chabahar as the drills’ focal point highlights its unparalleled strategic value. Situated on the Gulf of Oman, Iran’s sole oceanic port bypasses the congested Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil transits. Chabahar’s direct access to the Indian Ocean positions it as a gateway for the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200-km trade artery linking India to Central Asia and Europe via Iran. The 2025 drills signal a deepening alignment among Iran, China, and Russia, reflecting shared opposition to unilateralism. Analysts note that the exercises, occurring near the Strait of Hormuz and Chabahar, symbolize a collective resolve to secure energy corridors and trade lanes critical to the Global South. Some experts view these exercises as more than just defensive actions; they are seen as opportunities to create a unified vision for maritime security. This partnership also counters Western isolation efforts. Furthermore, the inclusion of aerial units and night operations—a first in the tripartite drills—signals Iran’s growing confidence in asymmetric warfare capabilities, crucial in deterring adversarial naval presence. (Source.) Image Source. Immediately after this naval exercise, on March 14, 2025, Foreign Ministers from Iran and Russia met with Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing, China, to discuss the “Iranian Nuclear Issue.” On March 14, 2025, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met in Beijing with Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov Sergey Alexeevich of the Russian Federation and Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi of the Islamic Republic of Iran who attended the Beijing meeting between China, Russia and Iran on the Iranian nuclear issue. Wang Yi said that over the past year or so, tensions in the Middle East have continued to escalate, with the regional security situation deteriorating significantly and hotspot issues emerging one after another. As a responsible major country, China remains committed to the political settlement of regional hotspots, the maintenance of peace and stability in the Middle East, and the support of unity and self-reliance among regional countries. There are enough issues in the Middle East, and all parties should focus on addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an unresolved historical injustice lingering since World War II, rather than creating new tensions or even crises. (Full Article.) Things are escalating very quickly now, and to get a true feel for what is happening outside the U.S., it is very important to read how the rest of the world is reacting to events unfolding in what is now a “hot war” in the Middle East, and not rely solely on the U.S. Press, whether the corporate legacy media, or just the American alternative media. And above all, cure yourself from looking at the news through political lenses, and pursue the Truth, no matter where it leads. Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.(Philippians 4:8)",2,-0.26285887,-0.3020444,False
https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20240408/cdc-issues-broad-warning-amid-latest-human-bird-flu-case,CDC Issues Broad Warning After Latest Human Bird Flu Case,1,"April 8, 2024 – Following the confirmed case of avian influenza in a Texas dairy farmer last week, the CDC has issued a broad alert for people to take precautions when working around birds or other animals that could be infected with the potentially dangerous virus. The CDC recommended the use of personal protective equipment like masks and eye protection by anyone who may be exposed to sick or dead animals with suspected or confirmed infection with the virus known as A(H5N1). To date, the virus has been confirmed in wild animals including foxes, bears, seals, and sea lions, as well as in domesticated animals, including pets such as cats and dogs, farmed mink and foxes, and livestock such as goats and cows. In its new advisory to medical and public health professionals, the CDC explained that the risk of a human contracting bird flu is rare, but “having unprotected exposure to any infected animal or to an environment in which infected birds or other animals are or have been present can pose a risk of infection.” Since 1997, there have been cases of bird flu confirmed in humans in 23 countries, and those cases result in death more than half the time, the CDC alert stated. The virus has been confirmed in wild birds in all 50 states since 2022, and 48 states have had confirmed outbreaks in commercial or backyard poultry flocks in the past 2 years. The dairy farmer in Texas is the second human case in the U.S. In 2022, a human case occurred in Colorado and was linked to contact with poultry. “Human infections with avian influenza A viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth or is inhaled,” the CDC alert explained. The dairy farmer was not hospitalized, reported eye symptoms known as conjunctivitis, and was treated with antiviral medication, according to a CDC news release. Genetic testing among cows and the farmer linked the infection. The person in Colorado confirmed to have bird flu reported mild fatigue for a few days and recovered. In addition to being cautious around dead or potentially sick birds or animals, the CDC urged people not to eat “uncooked or undercooked food or related uncooked food products, such as unpasteurized (raw) milk, or raw cheeses, from animals with suspected or confirmed” bird flu. It is safe to consume commercially produced milk products, the CDC said, because the milk is pasteurized before entering the market and that process kills bacteria and viruses. Poultry products that have been properly handled and cooked (to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit) are also safe because that temperature ensures bacteria and viruses have been killed, the CDC also advised. The CDC continues to classify the overall risk to humans of contracting bird flu as low.",4,-0.36369893,0.16436522,False
https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20240405/us-bird-flu-outbreak-what-to-know,U.S. Bird Flu Outbreak: What You Need to Know,1,"April 5, 2024 – What’s the buzz about the bird flu? By now, you’ve likely heard that the bird flu has been detected in some herds of dairy cows across six states – the first time the virus has infected cattle. And with Texas health officials confirming this week that a farm worker contracted the virus – only the second known case of the H5N1 virus infecting a person in the U.S. – you may be wondering: Should I be worried? While the outbreak has raised concerns about possible risks to humans – one food expert cautioned against eating runny eggs for the time being – the current risk to the public is low, said William Schaffner, MD, an Infectious Diseases Society of America expert and professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. Human-to-human bird flu transmission is extremely rare, he said. “This virus still does not have the genetic capacity to spread readily from person to person,” Schaffner said. “There's no evidence of person-to-person spread here. This individual's [Texas dairy farmer's] contacts have all been tested and found to be negative.” And if you’re not near sick livestock or poultry, you shouldn’t be quick to link an illness to bird flu, said Louise Ivers, MD, a doctor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital. “It's a very specific group of people who have been working closely with animals, and certainly people should not work unprotected with sick animals or be in contact with them, if at all possible,” she said. If a person contracts bird flu, it can start with standard flu symptoms, such as a cough or fever. For some, the illness could get worse, causing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, respiratory failure, and nervous system changes. But bird flu symptoms can vary greatly. For example, the Texas dairy farmer who recently caught the virus only had conjunctivitis (pink eye) and is now insolating and being treated with antiviral medication, according to the CDC. Human cases of bird flu have been rare, but it does happen sometimes and is more common in certain areas of the world like Southeast Asia, Schaffner said. Human cases largely happen where people live near infected chickens, among other animals. “People have such close contact with those animals, they get a big dose of virus that goes down deep into their chest, and those are the rare people who get infected,” he said. Public health officials are keeping a watchful eye out for any new bird flu developments. This includes monitoring any changes to the virus that could affect poultry globally, which is a “very important source of protein for both underdeveloped and developed countries,” noted Schaffner. But the fact that bird flu is circulating globally among wild birds, domestic poultry, and now U.S. cattle is one cause of concern, especially coming off the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Ivers. “Every time we have a large amount of virus spreading, it has a chance to have errors in its replication, and errors in its replication means that it's shifting and changing,” she said. As for dairy milk, Schaffner suggested making sure your milk is pasteurized – like all milk sold in grocery stores – and not raw. pasteurization kills any germs found in milk. Going dairy-free is another option. You can read more about bird flu here.",4,-0.30355808,0.12896232,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/improve-leg-circulation-and-blood-flow/,Top 5 drinks to INSTANTLY improve leg circulation and blood flow,0,"Today, we will discuss five drinks that can help improve poor circulation, varicose veins, and leg pain. If you have heart issues, have ever had blood clots in your veins or arteries, deal with high blood pressure, or any other condition affecting your blood vessels or heart, this video will be very helpful for you. It is especially beneficial if you experience leg pain or feel that your legs are heavy after walking a short distance. I will show you some easy, inexpensive, and effective ways to boost your circulation with these five drinks that are readily available. Let’s begin with our first drink. Number 5 is “Beet Juice”. Beet juice is a powerful ally in the fight against poor circulation, varicose veins, and leg pain. This vibrant red drink is loaded with nitrates, which your body converts into nitric oxide, a key vasodilator. When you drink beet juice, the nitrates are first converted into nitrites by bacteria in the mouth. These nitrites are then further converted into nitric oxide in the stomach and bloodstream, helping to widen your blood vessels, giving blood more room to flow, and boosting overall circulation. The recommended daily intake of beet juice is between 8 and 16 ounces (240 to 470 ml). Making it at home is super easy—just blend raw beets with a little water, and you’re all set. This simple drink can do wonders for your vascular health because of its high nitrate content. However, it’s important to be aware of some precautions. As a natural vasodilator, beet juice can lower your blood pressure, which is great for those with high blood pressure but could be an issue for people with low blood pressure. If you’re on blood pressure medication, you might need to adjust your dosage under medical supervision when adding beet juice to your diet. Side effects are usually mild, with some people experiencing slight discomfort or gas, especially if they drink a lot of it. For diabetics, the effects can vary. While many diabetics can drink beet juice without significant changes in blood sugar levels, others might see spikes. It’s crucial to monitor your own response and talk to a healthcare provider if you have any concerns. The next drink is Number 4. “Hibiscus Tea”. Hibiscus tea, known for its vibrant red color and tart flavor, is a powerful drink that can greatly benefit your circulation. Packed with flavonoids like quercetin, hibiscus tea acts as an antioxidant, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation—both of which are harmful to circulation. Furthermore, quercetin acts as a vasodilator, meaning it helps widen blood vessels. This property allows hibiscus tea to effectively lower blood pressure and improve circulation. Studies have shown that quercetin can reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive individuals, making hibiscus tea a beneficial choice for those looking to manage their blood pressure naturally. The ideal dose of hibiscus tea is about one to two cups per day. Preparing it is simple: boil 8 to 10 ounces (240 to 300 mil) of water, add a handful of hibiscus flower petals, and let it steep for 5 to 10 minutes until the water takes on a rich color. This process ensures that the tea extracts all the beneficial properties of the hibiscus. However, hibiscus tea does come with some precautions. It can interact with blood pressure and diabetes medications. Additionally, due to its diuretic effect, it should be consumed in moderation if you are taking diuretic medications to avoid excessive fluid loss. Some people might also experience mild gastrointestinal discomfort. It’s best to enjoy hibiscus tea earlier in the day as its diuretic properties mean it might disrupt your sleep. Moving on, the next drink is Number 3. “Lemon Balm Tea”. Lemon balm tea is a calming drink that can boost circulation and fight off harmful substances in your body. The beneficial compounds in this sweet-smelling tea, such as flavonoids and rosmarinic acid, work synergistically to improve blood circulation. They achieve this by widening blood vessels, decreasing inflammation, and shielding the circulatory system from damage caused by free radicals. To make lemon balm tea, use 1 teaspoon of dried leaves or 2 tablespoons of fresh leaves per cup. Pour boiling water over the leaves and let it steep for 5-10 minutes. Then strain and enjoy. You can have 1-3 cups a day for optimal results. Adding honey or lemon can enhance the flavor. While lemon balm tea is generally safe, exercise caution if you are taking medications that cause drowsiness, as the tea may increase this effect. Pregnant women should also consume it in moderation. In rare cases, some individuals might experience a mild rash. As with any herbal remedy, consult your doctor before making it a regular part of your routine, especially if you have health issues or are on medication. Next, at Number 2 we have, “Garlic Tea” Our next drink is another tea—garlic tea. This powerful brew boosts circulation and heart health by preventing blood clots and lowering high blood pressure, leading to better overall blood flow. Garlic’s health benefits stem from compounds like allicin, which work in multiple ways to improve cardiovascular health. These compounds help prevent blood clots by reducing platelet clumping, effectively thinning the blood naturally. For those with high blood pressure, garlic can significantly lower both systolic (top number) and diastolic (bottom number) readings by several points. Moreover, garlic can slow the hardening of arteries by reducing plaque buildup and improving the flexibility of blood vessels, slowing the progression of atherosclerosis. You’ll want to aim for 2 grams of garlic a day, whether that’s in tea, capsules, or just eating it. Making garlic tea is a breeze—just boil some water, toss in some garlic, and let it sit for a bit before drinking. However, there are a few things to watch out for with garlic tea. It can interfere with some blood-thinning medications, especially those like warfarin. If you’re on these medications, check with your doctor before incorporating garlic tea into your routine. As for side effects, it might upset your stomach if you drink too much. And fair warning—it could make you smell like garlic. Some folks enjoy that garlic aroma, but it might not be the best personal fragrance for many others. Before we reveal our Number One, if you’re interested in a convenient way to boost blood flow for better circulation, eliminate excess plaque for clearer arteries, and balance cholesterol and blood pressure levels, consider drinking a cup of our innovative blend containing 10 of nature’s mightiest nutrients. To learn more, and get a special discount, click the link below at the end of this video. And at Number 1, we have, “Horsetail tea” Our last drink, which is also a tea, is horsetail tea. This popular herbal tea is rich in flavonoids, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory properties. It also contains silica, which can contribute to strengthening veins and improving circulation by boosting collagen production and making blood vessels more flexible. The ideal amount of horsetail tea to consume is 1 to 4 grams per day. To prepare it, simply boil water, add the horsetail, and let it steep. However, there are some important precautions to consider. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid horsetail tea due to its silica content. Additionally, horsetail tea has diuretic properties, which means it can interact with medications that have similar effects. Side effects may include allergic reactions or gastrointestinal irritation. There you have it! The five drinks that can improve leg circulation and blood flow. It’s important to understand that treating circulation problems requires more than just drinking a cup of garlic tea or horsetail tea daily. While these teas can support circulation, they are not standalone solutions. Poor circulation typically develops over many years as a result of unhealthy lifestyle habits, including a poor diet, lack of regular exercise, and excess weight or obesity. To truly improve your circulation, you need to adopt a healthier lifestyle. This means eating a balanced diet, staying physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Managing stress and anxiety, as well as ensuring adequate sleep, are also vital. By controlling risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, you can significantly enhance your circulation. For instance, managing diabetes can prevent blood vessel damage caused by high blood sugar levels, thereby improving overall blood flow. So while beetroot juice and teas are beneficial, they should be part of a broader strategy that includes lifestyle changes to effectively address and improve poor circulation.",3,0.29439506,0.054156497,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/nutrients-to-reduce-knee-osteoarthritis-pain/,Top 6 Nutrients To Reduce Knee Osteoarthritis Pain,0,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease affecting millions of adults worldwide. It is marked by the breakdown of cartilage in the knee joint due to aging, overuse, or injury. As the cartilage starts to wear out, crack, or become damaged, the bones in the knee joint rub against each other, causing inflammation. This leads to pain, swelling, and stiffness in the knee. So, what is cartilage? Cartilage is a flexible yet strong connective tissue found in various parts of the body, including the bone ends in joints (articular cartilage). It acts as a protective cushion, allowing bones to glide smoothly over each other without friction. However, cartilage isn’t as hard as bone, and this makes it more prone to damage over time. Now, it’s important to understand that when cartilage is damaged, the chances of natural repair are practically zero. Cartilage is a tissue that essentially cannot regenerate on its own, due to its lack of blood supply and low cell turnover rate. However, certain key nutrients can improve cartilage health and reduce the pain, swelling, and stiffness associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). In today’s video, we look at six nutrients that support cartilage health and reduce joint discomfort. To reduce joint discomfort and OA symptoms, joint nutrients have to address three factors: The first factor is “Decline in Collagen”. Collagen is a major part of the extracellular matrix in cartilage, which acts like scaffolding to give your joints strength and structure. Type II collagen, which makes up approximately 90-95% of the collagen in articular cartilage, forms a network within the matrix, helping cartilage trap other important molecules and stay strong. However, modern lifestyle factors such as poor diet, being overweight, hormonal changes with age, and overuse and misuse of joints can cause collagen levels to drop over time. By age 40, our bodies often produce less than half the collagen they did when we were younger. This decline leads to weaker cartilage and changes in the matrix, resulting in less cushioning for our joints. These changes can cause joint pain, stiffness, and worsen symptoms of OA. The second factor is “Attacking Enzymes”. When enzymes known as MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) are too active—often due to the modern lifestyle factors mentioned earlier—they destroy cartilage faster than the body can rebuild it. This is like having more demolition workers than builders. This leads to further collagen and cartilage reduction, causing more joint damage and inflammation. Overactive MMPs can make OA worsen quickly. The third factor is “Drying Out of Synovial Fluid”. Hyaluronic acid is the key component of synovial fluid, acting as a lubricant and shock absorber in joints. As cartilage decreases in conditions like OA, both the quantity and quality of this fluid diminish. This leads to increased friction between joint surfaces, causing more wear and tear, pain, and stiffness. If left unchecked, this process can cause serious joint damage and accelerate OA progression. These three factors are interconnected and can create a vicious cycle in OA progression: The decline in collagen weakens the cartilage structure, making it more vulnerable to damage. Overactive MMPs break down the already weakened cartilage more rapidly. The drying out of synovial fluid increases friction and wear on the cartilage, further accelerating its breakdown. Now that we’ve covered the three factors that lead to joint discomfort and OA, let’s look at the nutrients that can address them. First, we have to mention glucosamine and chondroitin, the two most common nutrients used in joint supplements. They are naturally present in human cartilage. However, research has shown mixed results for their effectiveness in treating OA. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that six months of supplementation with these compounds was no better than a placebo for reducing joint discomfort. Having said that, if you have gotten good results using glucosamine and chondroitin, do share in the comments below. Now, let’s look at the 6 nutrients that target cartilage health and joint discomfort. The first nutrient is Number 6. Undenatured Type II Collagen (UC-II). Collagen is the structural protein found in skin, tendons, and bones, with type II collagen specifically present in the cartilage lining the joints. A special patented form of type II collagen, known as UC-II, is derived from the breastbone of chickens. UC-II works very differently from popular collagen supplements, as it engages the immune system in the repair of joint cartilage. Among the published studies on UC-II, one in the International Journal of Medical Sciences demonstrated that a daily dose of 40 mg of UC-II was significantly more effective at reducing joint discomfort and improving overall joint function compared to glucosamine and chondroitin. Next, at Number 5, we have “Boswellia Serrata”. Boswellia serrata is a plant extract that has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries to treat inflammatory diseases. It targets and inhibits MMP enzymes, helping maintain collagen levels and reduce joint discomfort. A 2020 review of seven trials with 545 patients, found that Boswellia serrata extract significantly relieved pain and stiffness and improved joint function in OA patients. To treat OA specifically, take 100-500 mg of a standardized extract 2-3 times daily. Moving on, the Number 4 nutrient is “Hyaluronic acid”. With both aging and osteoarthritis, your joints’ ability to produce hyaluronic acid deteriorates, affecting not only synovial fluid but also other tissues like skin, contributing to joint discomfort, dehydrated skin, and wrinkles. To get hyaluronic acid from food, bone broth is the best direct source. It’s made by simmering animal bones and connective tissues for an extended period, which releases nutrients including hyaluronic acid, collagen, glucosamine, and chondroitin into the broth. Organ meats, especially liver, kidney, and tongue, are another good direct food source of hyaluronic acid. You’ll also want to eat magnesium-rich foods like leafy green vegetables (kale, spinach) and nuts and seeds (almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds) as magnesium aids in hyaluronic acid production. For supplementation, a patented form of hyaluronic acid called Mobilee® has been shown to be 5 times more powerful and effective than other forms of hyaluronic acid, significantly reducing activity-related joint flare-ups in OA. Instead of taking these 3 nutrients separately, choose a supplement which contains all three, like the one we recommended. Click the link below to learn more. In addition to these 3 nutrients, ensure you get enough of these 3 vitamins that support bone and cartilage health. At Number 3, we have “Vitamin C”. Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is essential for collagen production, which helps maintain bones, teeth, and cartilage. It acts as a powerful antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals and reducing the risk of inflammation and disease. Adequate vitamin C intake is particularly important for those with knee cartilage issues, as a deficiency could contribute to cartilage problems. A daily intake of at least 500 mg is recommended. This can be easily achieved through a diet rich in fruits and vegetables such as red bell peppers, kiwifruit, papaya, strawberries, oranges, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, pineapple, grapefruit, and tomatoes. Moving on, we have Number 2. “Vitamin D3”. Vitamin D is essential for bone and tooth health, as it facilitates calcium absorption in the body. While some studies suggest that higher vitamin D levels may slow cartilage loss in knee OA patients, and vitamin D deficiency is linked to increased OA risk, it doesn’t seem to provide significant relief for OA pain. Sunlight exposure (10-30 minutes at midday) is the most effective way for your body to produce vitamin D3. Excellent food sources of vitamin D3 include salmon, cod liver oil, and mackerel. For supplementation, take 1,000 to 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day, depending on the severity of your deficiency. And at Number 1, we have “Vitamin K2”. Your body needs calcium to build and maintain bones. When calcium is broken down in your body, vitamin K2 activates a protein (osteocalcin) that helps the mineral bind to your bones to do its job. Studies have shown that increasing vitamin K2 intake can improve bone density and lower the risk of bone fractures, though research is still ongoing. For optimal absorption, consume vitamin K2 with healthy fats like olive or coconut oil. Vitamin K2 is essential for activating matrix Gla protein, which helps prevent calcium from accumulating in the arteries. This protein depends on vitamin K to function properly. The richest food source of vitamin K2 MK-7 is natto (fermented soybeans), followed by sauerkraut and hard cheeses. For supplementation, take 150-180 mcg of vitamin K2 MK-7 per day along with vitamin D3 to help your body use calcium effectively, promoting bone health and preventing arterial calcification. There you have it! The top 6 nutrients that help improve joint cartilage health and reduce pain and inflammation.",0,0.29952472,-0.14749995,False
https://healthimpactnews.com/2025/donald-trump-continues-to-lie-about-fentanyl-as-he-envisions-himself-as-king-of-israel-ruling-from-gaza/,Donald Trump Continues to Lie About Fentanyl as he Envisions Himself as King of Israel Ruling from Gaza,0,"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News President Donald Trump renewed his threats to impose a 25% tariff against imports from Canada and Mexico starting next week on March 4, while lying in public about what he is claiming is the reason for these tariffs, which he claims is that they are still allowing too much fentanyl to come across the border. As I have previously published, there were only 50 lbs. of fentanyl seized coming across the very long border from Canada for ALL of 2024. See: Have seizures of illegal fentanyl somehow increased here in 2025 coming into the U.S. from Canada to warrant these crippling tariffs? Here is what is being reported about fentanyl seizures from Canada in 2025 according to the Canada Border Services Agency: Ahead of the looming March 4 deadline, Canada announced it was launching an effort, dubbed “Operation Blizzard.” The effort is “aimed at intercepting illegal contraband arriving and leaving Canada, with a focus on fentanyl and other synthetic narcotics,” according to a statement published by the Canada Border Services Agency Thursday morning. CBSA also shared that it seized 56.1 grams of fentanyl this month, including 20 fentanyl pills and 23 grams “of a substance suspected to be fentanyl from two US citizens crossing at the Windsor-Detroit Tunnel port of entry.” (Source.) For those Americans who are math-challenged to understand metric weights, 28 grams is equal to about 1 ounce. So two ounces of fentanyl and 20 fentanyl pills here in 2025 are behind the “fentanyl crisis” coming out of Canada. Fortunately, we can learn what Trump’s true reasons are for threatening Canada with tariffs, directly from Trump himself, in what appeared to be unscripted remarks he made after his staff meeting yesterday. He starts out with lies about fentanyl, and then basically admits he is lying as he gives the real reason he is imposing tariffs on Canada. So here you go, directly from the horse’s mouth as to what the real reason is for beating Canada into submission with tariffs: Please note that I am not debating whether or not the U.S. should keep supporting Canada, or whether or not they should become the 51st state. That is a different question. But when Trump uses the fentanyl excuse to beat them into submission, he is clearly lying. When did you ever read in the media, either corporate media or alternative media, that we had a fentanyl crisis on our border with Canada? Never, until a few weeks ago, because it is a LIE. When a person habitually lies, how can you ever believe what they say, and how can you trust them? And while the corporate “liberal” media pretends to hate Trump and spends so much time criticizing him, I have yet to see any of them point out that Trump is lying about the fentanyl issue coming out of Canada. Why? Because the corporate media are funded and supported by Big Pharma, and the truth is that the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. is from U.S. produced fentanyl from U.S. pharmaceutical companies which are distributed through U.S. pharmacies. This has all been proven in a court of law over the past several years with mega lawsuits against Big Pharma for fentanyl and other opioids. As far as Mexico is concerned, one has to go to the Mexican media to read their side of the story. Here are two recent articles. A few weeks ago, a well-read friend of mine gave me a book with no commentary other than “You must read this.” The book, titled “One Hundred Years of Spies and Drugs: The Story of United States Counternarcotics Agents in Mexico” by Carlos Pérez Ricart, didn’t exactly fit into my standard reading interests, which are more focused on business, the economy and politics. But given my friend’s insistence, I decided to give the book a try. I remember thinking similarly when pressed by friends to watch the Netflix series “Narcos.” My wife and I do not like consuming dramatic or violent content and try to avoid it as much as possible, as we feel like it is the equivalent of junk food for our brains. But once I began watching the “Narcos” series, I must admit that I found it fascinating. The insight it provided into the inner works of the DEA, the CIA, the U.S. government, the Mexican government and of course the cartels, was informative, enlightening and disturbing. This book had a similar effect on me and within just the first few pages, I became completely engrossed in the details. So much so that I reached out to the author, Carlos Pérez Ricart, and sat down with him to discuss his book and his thoughts on the current state of U.S./Mexican affairs. What follows are the highlights of our conversation. Pérez Ricart: The reality is that the United States has in fact been involved quite actively in the drug industry in Mexico for nearly 100 years already, so in many ways it would be nothing new. Help me understand why and how the U.S. has been involved for so long. How did it begin so long ago? During the Second World War, the U.S. military became increasingly concerned about the reliability of the supply of Asian (and Turkish) opium needed to produce morphine for wounded soldiers. As a result, U.S. agents went looking for an alternative supply in Mexico. They wanted to have a supply chain closer to home that was not actually in the United States, given the delicate nature of the product. The result was essentially the development of an opium supply base in the Mexican states of Sonora and Guerrero. The second well-documented case of the U.S. military encouraging the production of opium in Mexico was during the Vietnam War for the same purpose of local morphine supply when Asian supplies were disrupted. I will note that there is no formal agreement of the U.S. buying opium from Mexico, but rather vast amounts of documentation making clear the encouragement of the development of a supply base of the product. Wow. You are saying that the U.S. military actually had an important role in developing the opium drug industry in Mexico? That seems like a pretty staggering claim. How confident are you in your research and sources of information? Most of my sources are actually public information from the National Archives in Washington, D.C. As do all government agencies, the DEA, after a certain period of time, makes many previously classified documents public. I dedicated my Ph.D. and several years of my life reviewing the DEA archives on Mexico in the National Archives in D.C., as well as additional archives in California and Texas archive offices. I was subsequently able to fill in gaps of information though many requests I made to the U.S. government through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). I was told by the National Archives staff that I was only the second person to review these documents since they were first released. (Full Article.) I was recently asked by two large companies with manufacturing operations in Mexico whether I thought that Mexico would be the victim of the United States’ “beggar thy neighbor” protectionism. Everyone seems to be playing a game of “will he, or won’t he,” which plays perfectly into a strategy that seeks to inject uncertainty into the trade relationship. Keeping everyone guessing increases the cost of doing business with Mexico (and Canada and China, etc.), which is what the current U.S. president wants. According to the Wall Street Journal, “some companies, including networking-equipment company Cisco Systems, fashion company Tapestry and clog and sandal company Crocs, have included the impact of tariffs in their latest guidance. Others, including Mexican-inspired restaurant company Chipotle Mexican Grill, consumer-products maker Clorox and cereal maker WK Kellogg have excluded it.” My advice is to ignore the tariffs. If they do come to pass, the market will be shocked out of its complacency and will correct on three fronts…. (Full Article.) At the time of this writing, the MAGA faithful are still strong in their adoration and love for Trump, especially the Zionist Evangelical Christians. So I dedicate this AI video which was released by President Donald Trump himself, on his Truth Social platform, about his future plans to purchase Gaza. This is a video that needs no commentary, and shows the moral degradation that has now become the American Evangelical Christian Church, along with the rest of the MAGA cult followers. (Note: it moves fast. Slow down the speed or pause frequently to see all the scenes here.) Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people. Therefore come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you. I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.” (2 Corinthians 6:14-18)",8,-0.2150113,-0.06464927,False
https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20240321/us-life-expectancy-increasing-but-so-is-child-death-rate,"U.S. Life Expectancy Increasing, but So Is Child Death Rate",1,"March 21, 2024 -- The risk of death due to COVID-19 has declined so much that life expectancy in the U.S. is once again on the rise. The predicted lifespan rose to 77.5 years in 2022, adding just over an entire year to the life expectancy for babies born in 2022 compared to 2021. The improvement corresponds to a 9% decrease in the nation’s death rate and was primarily driven by a 55% decrease in year-over-year deaths attributed to COVID, according to final data published this week. The rebound in life expectancy still has not caught up to prepandemic highs. The 2022 life expectancy of 77.5 years is equivalent to life expectancy in the year 2004. While heart disease and cancer remained the top two causes of death in the nation in 2022, COVID dropped to fourth place. COVID was an underlying cause in the death of 186,552 people in 2022, down from 416,893 in 2021. Unintentional injuries moved into the third place position for leading causes of death. Women are still expected to live about 5 years longer than men, but the gender gap narrowed slightly in the new estimates. Girls born in 2022 are expected to live to 80.2 years old, while boys are expected to live to age 74.8. Women are now expected to live 5.4 more years than men, down from 5.8 years based on 2021 figures. The CDC report also estimated the remaining lifespan for people who were age 65 in 2022: Men were expected to live about 18 more years, to age 83, and women were expected to live nearly 19 more years, to age 84. The new data also showed a concerning trend of increasing death rates among children, including those ages 1 to 4 years old and those ages 5 to 14. The infant mortality rate rose as well. Maternal complications and bacterial infections in newborns increased substantially in reported causes of infant deaths, according to the CDC. An editorial published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association said the nation should be alarmed by the increasing death rate among its youngest residents, warning that “this increase in all-cause pediatric mortality has ominous implications. A nation that begins losing its most cherished population—its children—faces a crisis like no other.”",4,-0.18033549,0.33148515,True
https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20240319/covid-levels-decline-but-other-viruses-remain-high,"COVID Levels Decline, but Other Viruses Remain High",1,"March 19, 2024 -- COVID-19 may be headed toward a springtime retreat. The indication comes from declining levels of SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus that causes COVID -- being detected in wastewater over the past 3 weeks. Virus levels are already considered “low” throughout western U.S. states. Detections are at medium levels in the Midwest and South, while high levels persist in the Northeast, according to WastewaterSCAN. But it’s not time to let your guard down because high levels of other viruses that cause stomach and respiratory illnesses continue to circulate widely nationwide. Wastewater data currently shows threats from flu, RSV, norovirus, and rotavirus. The rate of positive flu tests reported to the CDC had been a downward trend since peaking around a rate of 16% in mid-January, but positive test rates are now climbing again, with the most recent weekly rate back around 15%. So far this flu season, 116 children and an estimated 20,000 adults have died from the flu, according to the CDC’s weekly flu publication, FluView. RSV wastewater detection remains high, especially in the Midwest and Northeast, WastewaterSCAN data shows. But positive RSV test results reported to the CDC are at the lowest point of the 2023 to 2024 season, with less than 2,000 positive results listed for the week of March 9, down from a peak of more than 14,000 cases around Christmas. Wastewater data tends to offer a real-time (and sometimes predictive) view of pathogen behavior in the general population, since sick people usually wait until symptoms worsen to seek medical care. About 12% of norovirus tests reported to the CDC in the last 3 weeks of February were positive, mirroring an upward trend observed during the same time period last year. In 2023, norovirus peaked in the U.S. in March with a positive test rate around 16%, CDC data show. Last year, COVID also followed a downward springtime trend. Around this time last year, there were about 20,000 weekly hospital admissions due to COVID-19, compared to just over 13,000 in early March this year. All COVID metrics, including the positive test rate, hospitalizations, and ER visits, are currently trending downward, the CDC’s COVID Data Tracker indicates. The positive COVID test rate is 5%, and just 1% of ER visits in the U.S. involve a COVID-19 diagnosis. “We’re seeing a downward trend, which is fantastic,” Marlene Wolfe, PhD, WastewaterSCAN’s program director, told USA Today. “Hopefully, that pattern continues as we enjoy some warmer weather and longer daylight.”",4,-0.28887665,0.2024288,False
https://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/news/20240314/new-blood-test-colon-cancer-highly-accurate-trial,New Blood Test for Colon Cancer Highly Accurate in Trial,1,"March 14, 2024 – Detecting colorectal cancer may be as easy as a simple blood test one day. Promising results of this new option -- the results of the study were published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine -- could help convert the estimated 1 in 3 people who don’t stay up-to-date on screenings that should begin at age 45. If everyone in the U.S. got screened regularly, as many as 90% of deaths linked to colorectal cancer may be avoided, the researchers wrote. Current screening options are often considered unpleasant experiences -- collecting a fecal sample at home and mailing it, or taking laxatives and going under sedation for a colonoscopy procedure. The blood test can detect DNA shed into the bloodstream from tumors, and in a trial of more than 7,800 people, the new test accurately detected colon cancer at early, treatable stages 87% of the time. The false-positive rate was 10%. The test was less successful at detecting advanced precancerous lesions, with just 13% being detected. In comparison, fecal tests are about 42% successful at early detection, and colonoscopies are up to 93% accurate, according to a summary from the American College of Surgeons. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. and one of the most common types of cancer overall. More than 150,000 people nationwide are diagnosed annually, and more than 50,000 people die each year from cancers of the colon or rectum. Early detection at the precancerous stage is an important consideration, according to a group of medical professionals who specialize in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. “While a blood test can be an additional tool, it shouldn't be used in place of a colonoscopy,” a statement from the American Gastroenterological Association advised. “Colonoscopies allow detection and removal of precancerous polyps as well as identifying cancer early when it is in the most treatable stages. The blood test reported in the New England Journal of Medicine study is only designed to pick up cancers and not precancerous polyps.” Current screening guidelines suggest a colonoscopy every 10 years for people at average risk, or annual fecal testing. The new blood test would be given every 3 years, and, according to maker Guardant Health, may be considered for approval by the FDA sometime this year, NBC News reported.",8,-0.075444296,0.09748788,False
https://www.webmd.com/children/news/20240314/measles-control-2024-what-to-know,Measles Control So Far in 2024: ‘Not Off to a Great Start’,1,"March 14, 2024 – Just over 2 months into 2024, measles cases in the United States aren't looking great. The recent rise in cases across the U.S. is linked to unvaccinated travelers, lower than ideal vaccination rates, and misinformation, experts said. The CDC has identified 45 cases of measles in 17 jurisdictions across the U.S. As of March 7, the federal health agency reported measles cases in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York City, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington. As for the 45 cases, “that's almost as many as we had for the entire calendar year of 2023,” said Sarah Lim, MD, a medical specialist at the Minnesota Department of Health. “So we're really not off to a great start.” (For context, there were 58 officially reported measles cases last year.) Chicago is having a measles outbreak this week – with eight cases reported so far. All but one case has been linked to a migrant child at a city shelter. Given the potential for rapid spread – measles is relatively rare here but potentially very serious – the CDC sent a team of experts to investigate and to help keep this outbreak from growing further. Sometimes Deadly About 30% of children have measles symptoms and about 25% end up hospitalized. Complications include diarrhea, a whole-body rash, ear infections that can lead to permanent deafness, and pneumonia. Pneumonia with measles can be so serious that 1 in 20 affected children die. Measles can also cause inflammation of the brain called encephalitis in about 1 in 1,000 children, sometimes causing epilepsy or permanent brain damage. Similar to long COVID, some effects can last beyond the early infection. For example, measles “can wipe out immune memory that protects you against other bacterial and viral pathogens,” Lim said at a media briefing sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. This vulnerability to other infections can last up to 3 years after the early infection, she noted. Overall, measles kills between 1 and 3 people infected per thousand, mostly children. Vaccine Misinformation Playing a Role Vaccine misinformation is partly behind the uptick, and while many cases are mild, ""this can be a devastating disease,” said Joshua Barocas, MD, an associate professor of medicine in the divisions of General Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “I'm a parent myself. Parents are flooded with tons of information, some of that time being misinformation,” he said at the media briefing. “If you are a parent who's been on the fence [about vaccination], now is the time, given the outbreak potential and the outbreaks that we’re seeing.” Vaccine misinformation “is about as old as vaccines themselves,” Lim said. Concerns about the MMR vaccine, which includes measles protection, are not new. “It does seem to change periodically – new things bubble up, new ideas bubble up, and the problem is that it is like the old saying that ‘a lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on.’” Social media helps to amplify vaccine misinformation, she said. “You don't want to scare people unnecessarily – but reminding people what these childhood diseases really look like and what they do is incredibly important,” Lim said. “It's so much easier to see stories about potential side effects of vaccines than it is to see stories about parents whose children were in intensive care for 2 weeks with pneumonia because of a severe case of measles.” Barocas said misinformation is sometimes deliberate, sometimes not. Regardless, “our job as infectious disease physicians and public health professionals is not necessarily to put the counternarrative out there, but to continue to advocate for what we know works based on the best science and the best evidence.” “And there is no reason to believe that vaccines are anything but helpful when it comes to preventing measles,” he noted. Lifelong Protection in Most Cases The MMR vaccine, typically given as two doses in childhood, offers 93% and then 97% protection against the highly contagious virus. During the 2022-to-2023 school year, the measles vaccination rate among kindergarten children nationwide was 92%. That sounds like a high rate, Lim said, “but because measles is so contagious, vaccination rates need to be 95% or higher to contain transmission.” One person with measles can infect anywhere from 12 to 18 other people, she said. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets spread through the air. “And if someone is unvaccinated and exposed, nine times out of 10, that person will go on to develop the disease.” She said given the high transmission rate, measles often spreads within families to infect multiple children. If you know you’re not vaccinated but exposed, the advice is to get the measles shot as quickly as possible. “There is a recommendation to receive the MMR vaccine within 72 hours as post-exposure prophylaxis,” Lim said. “That's a tight time window, but if you can do that, it reduces the risk of developing measles significantly.” If you’re unsure or do not remember getting vaccinated against measles as a young child, your health care provider may be able to search state registries for an answer. If that doesn't work, getting revaccinated with the MMR vaccine as an adult is an option. “There is no shame in getting caught up now,” Barocas said. Lim agreed. “There is really no downside to getting additional doses.”",4,-0.3931192,0.12401272,True
https://dailyhealthpost.com/scientists-find-microplastics-lodged-in-more-than-50-of-plaques-from-clogged-arteries/,Scientists find microplastics lodged in more than 50% of plaques from clogged arteries,0,"Imagine for a moment your body as a complex network of rivers and streams. These rivers – your arteries and veins – are essential for transporting life-sustaining blood to every corner of your body. Now, imagine finding out that these vital waterways are polluted, not with chemicals or waste, but with something as mundane as plastics. That’s exactly what recent studies are suggesting – our arteries may be clogged with the same materials used to make our water bottles and grocery bags. It’s a revelation that’s as concerning as it is surprising. Over 50% of arterial plaques, the blockages that can lead to heart attacks and strokes, are now found to contain plastic particles. These aren’t large pieces, but microplastics, so tiny they can travel through our bloodstream and embed themselves deep within our bodily tissues. Recent Study Reveals Startling Data A landmark study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has catapulted the issue of microplastics into the limelight of public health concerns. The study, which followed hundreds of patients, found that a staggering 60 percent had microplastics lurking within the plaques of their arteries. The Ubiquity of Plastics and Human Health We live in an age where plastics are virtually inescapable. They are in our homes, our workplaces, and even in the food we eat and the air we breathe. It’s no wonder then that these materials are making their way into our internal systems. But what does this mean for our health? Understanding the Health Impact Before we dive into the gritty details, let’s get one thing clear: the plastics we’re talking about are not the kind you can see. Microplastics are microscopic particles that, once they enter the body, can cause a cascade of health issues. They can trigger inflammation, which is a known precursor to a multitude of diseases, including atherosclerosis – the hardening and narrowing of the arteries. When our arteries are compromised, blood flow is restricted, and the risk of heart attacks and strokes skyrockets. The connection between microplastics and cardiovascular disease is still being explored, but the evidence is mounting, and it’s pointing towards a relationship we cannot afford to overlook. How Microplastics Enter the Body Let’s break down how these microplastics are getting into our systems. It’s a multifaceted problem, with numerous sources contributing to our daily intake of these tiny particles. They can come from a variety of everyday activities that may impact our blood circulation and overall health. The breakdown of larger plastic items in the environment. Microbeads found in personal care products like exfoliants and toothpaste. Synthetic fibers released when washing clothes made from materials like polyester and nylon. Plastic packaging that can shed particles into the food it contains. Airborne dust from the degradation of plastic items in our surroundings. Because these particles are so small, they can penetrate the body’s natural defenses and find their way into our bloodstream. From there, it’s a short journey to the heart and the arterial walls, where they can become part of the plaques that spell trouble for cardiovascular health. Therefore, understanding the various pathways through which microplastics enter our bodies is essential. It’s the first step in taking control of our exposure and, in turn, our health. Associations with Cardiovascular Illness When we talk about cardiovascular illness, we’re referring to a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. Microplastics are now suspected to be a silent contributor to these diseases. They can set off inflammation, which is known to damage the delicate inner lining of blood vessels, leading to the buildup of plaques. These plaques can narrow arteries and, if they rupture, can cause clots that may lead to heart attacks or strokes. It’s not just about the physical presence of plastics in the arteries, but also about the chemicals they leach. These substances can disrupt the body’s hormonal balance and have been linked to obesity, diabetes, and hypertension – all risk factors for heart disease. This makes the conversation about microplastics not just an environmental concern, but a pressing health issue. Unveiling the Study’s Findings Over 50% of arterial plaques in patients studied contained microplastics. The most common plastics found were polyethylene (used in packaging) and PVC (used in pipes and building materials). Patients with microplastics in their plaques had a higher incidence of heart attacks and strokes. The study in question followed patients over a period of 34 months, revealing a correlation between the presence of microplastics in arterial plaques and the occurrence of serious cardiovascular events. While correlation does not imply causation, this association is a red flag that signals the need for further research and immediate public health action. The findings are a wake-up call, urging us to re-evaluate our relationship with plastic materials and their pervasive role in our daily lives. We now know that our exposure to these materials can have direct implications for our heart health. Analysing the Italian Research Results The Italian research that brought these findings to light was a comprehensive analysis that meticulously tracked the presence of microplastics in patients with clogged arteries. The study’s methodology was robust, involving prospective, multicenter research to ensure the findings were not isolated to a specific region or group of people. Relation Between Microplastics and Artery Plaques The relation between microplastics and artery plaques is not merely incidental. Plaques are made up of fats, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. When microplastics enter the bloodstream, they become part of this mix, contributing to the size and potentially the stability of the plaques. Unstable plaques are more likely to break apart and cause blockages, leading to heart attacks or strokes. This discovery is particularly troubling because it suggests that our exposure to plastics could be directly influencing the progression of arterial diseases. It also raises questions about the long-term effects of microplastics on our vascular health and the potential for these particles to contribute to other diseases. Examining the Culprits It’s important to identify the types of plastics that are most commonly found in these arterial plaques. This knowledge can help us target the biggest offenders and reduce our exposure to them. Common Sources of Microplastics Everyday items are the main culprits when it comes to microplastic pollution. Here are some of the most common sources: Single-use plastics, like water bottles and shopping bags, which break down into smaller pieces. Clothing made from synthetic fibers that shed microplastics with each wash. Beauty products with microbeads, although many countries are now banning these. Food packaging, which can shed microplastics that contaminate our food. Industrial processes that release plastic dust into the air. These sources are so ingrained in our daily routines that avoiding them entirely can be challenging. However, by being aware of them, we can start to make more conscious choices that can help reduce our overall exposure. The Role of Polyethylene and PVC in Plaques Specifically, polyethylene and PVC have been highlighted as the most prevalent plastics found in arterial plaques. Polyethylene is the most commonly produced plastic and is used in a wide array of packaging materials. PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, is used in everything from pipes to building materials and can release harmful phthalates – chemicals that have been linked to a range of health issues. The Path to Better Health While it’s nearly impossible to eliminate all exposure to plastics, there are effective strategies we can adopt to minimize our risk. Preventative Measures to Minimize Plastic Exposure To start reducing our plastic footprint and its potential health risks, consider the following: Choose glass or stainless steel containers over plastic ones, especially for food and drink storage. Opt for clothing made from natural fibers rather than synthetic ones to reduce the release of microfibers during laundry. Support and advocate for environmental policies that aim to reduce plastic waste and improve recycling programs. Be mindful of plastic use in your daily life and seek out alternatives whenever possible. Participate in community clean-up efforts to help reduce the amount of plastic that can break down into microplastics. Implementing Healthier Lifestyle Choices Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, getting regular physical activity, and finding ways to manage stress can all help keep your arteries clear and your heart strong. A heart-healthy lifestyle is your best defense against the myriad of threats facing our cardiovascular system today. FAQ It’s natural to have questions about microplastics and their impact on our health. Here are some answers to the most commonly asked questions: What Are Microplastics and How Do They Affect Health? Microplastics are tiny plastic particles, usually smaller than 5 millimeters, that can come from a variety of sources, including larger plastic debris that breaks down, microbeads in personal care products, and synthetic fibers from clothing. They can enter the human body through ingestion or inhalation and have been found in various organs, including the heart and brain. In the body, they may cause inflammation and contribute to the development of diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. How Can I Reduce My Exposure to Microplastics? To reduce exposure to microplastics: Avoid single-use plastics and opt for reusable alternatives. Choose products with natural ingredients and without microbeads. Wash synthetic clothes less frequently and use filters to capture fibers. Filter tap water, especially if you live in an area with high plastic pollution. Support and participate in environmental conservation efforts. These steps can help you limit the amount of microplastics you come into contact with and potentially ingest. What Foods or Products Are Known to Contain Microplastics? Microplastics have been found in a variety of foods and products, including: Seafood, especially shellfish, as they can ingest microplastics from the ocean. Bottled water, which can contain microplastics shed from the packaging. Table salts, particularly sea salts that may be contaminated with microplastics. Beer and other beverages that may be contaminated during the production process. Personal care products like facial scrubs and toothpaste that contain microbeads (though many countries have banned these). Being aware of these sources can help you make more informed choices about the products you consume and use daily.",7,0.011992354,0.041184813,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/the-first-sign-of-a-magnesium-deficiency/,The First Sign Of A Magnesium Deficiency Is…,0,"When it comes to maintaining a healthy balance in your body, magnesium is a bit of a superhero. It’s involved in over 300 biochemical reactions, from keeping your heart rhythm steady to supporting your immune system. But, like any silent guardian, its absence is felt more profoundly than its presence. That’s why it’s crucial to recognize the first sign of a magnesium deficiency – it’s often a whisper before it becomes a shout. The Telling Tale: First Indicators of Low Magnesium The first sign of a magnesium deficiency can often be fatigue. You may just feel a bit more tired than usual, a little less sparky. It’s easy to brush off, but it’s your body’s way of waving a red flag. Magnesium is crucial for energy production, and without enough of it, you simply won’t have the same get-up-and-go. So, what does this fatigue feel like? It’s not just feeling sleepy after a poor night’s rest. It’s a pervasive sense of exhaustion that doesn’t improve with sleep. If you’re finding that your energy levels are consistently low, it could be time to take a closer look at your magnesium intake. Besides fatigue, your body might send other subtle SOS signals. You might experience muscle weakness, those unexplained twitches in your eyelid, or even spasms known as charley horses. Numbness or tingling in your extremities, loss of appetite, or a sudden wave of nausea can also be your body’s way of hinting at a magnesium deficit. And while these symptoms might seem minor, they’re the early whispers of your body telling you it needs more of this essential mineral. Ignoring these signs can lead to more pronounced symptoms over time, which is why catching them early is so important. Magnesium Regulates Muscle and Nerve Functions Magnesium plays a pivotal role in regulating nerve impulses and muscle contractions. When levels drop, you may notice a tremor in your hands or a sense of restlessness in your legs. These are more than just annoying symptoms; they’re indications that your body’s electrical system is crying out for balance. Magnesium works as a natural calcium blocker to help muscles relax. Without it, muscles may contract too much and lead to discomfort or even cramps. Common Culprits: What Leads to Magnesium Deficiency? Understanding what depletes your body’s magnesium is just as important as recognizing the deficiency signs. Common dietary culprits include excessive intake of soda, salt, and caffeine. But it’s not just about what you consume; it’s also about what you may not be getting enough of. A diet lacking in leafy greens, nuts, and whole grains can leave you deficient in this essential nutrient. Everyday Habits That Drain Magnesium Most importantly, certain lifestyle choices can accelerate the loss of magnesium. High levels of stress, for instance, can increase magnesium excretion. Alcohol consumption is another factor; it can inhibit magnesium absorption and increase its excretion through the kidneys. Even heavy sweating from intense exercise can deplete your body’s magnesium stores, so athletes, listen up! Medical Conditions Impacting Magnesium Levels Some medical conditions can also interfere with magnesium absorption. Gastrointestinal disorders like Crohn’s disease or celiac disease can limit the body’s ability to absorb magnesium from food. Kidney diseases can lead to an increased loss of magnesium in urine. Therefore, if you have a chronic health condition, it’s especially crucial to monitor your magnesium levels. Preventive Measures: How to Maintain Healthy Magnesium Levels So, how do you keep your magnesium levels in check? The answer lies in a combination of diet, lifestyle adjustments, and, when necessary, supplements. Let’s delve into the specifics of each to ensure you’re giving your body what it needs to thrive. Integrating Magnesium into Your Daily Diet Eating a variety of magnesium-rich foods is the most natural way to maintain healthy levels. Here’s a simple list to get you started: Spinach and other leafy greens Seeds and nuts, especially pumpkin seeds and almonds Whole grains like brown rice and quinoa Legumes such as black beans and chickpeas Avocados, bananas, and dark chocolate (in moderation!) By incorporating these foods into your meals, you’re not just getting magnesium; you’re also taking in a wealth of other nutrients that work synergistically to bolster your health. When to Consider Supplements While diet should always be your first line of defense, there are times when supplements may be necessary. If you’re dealing with chronic stress, have a medical condition that affects absorption, or you’re an athlete who loses a lot of magnesium through sweat, a supplement may be a good idea. But remember, more isn’t always better. It’s crucial to stick to the recommended daily allowance, as too much magnesium can lead to adverse effects. Click here to see our recommended magnesium supplement with the best absorption. Course of Action: Addressing Magnesium Deficiency If you suspect a magnesium deficiency, it’s essential to take a methodical approach. Start by evaluating your diet and lifestyle choices. Are you consuming magnesium-rich foods regularly? Are you engaging in habits that might deplete magnesium levels? Once you’ve made necessary adjustments, observe if your symptoms improve. Review your diet and lifestyle for potential magnesium drains. Consider incorporating more magnesium-rich foods into your meals. Evaluate the need for a magnesium supplement, especially if you’re at risk for deficiency. If you’ve made these changes and still experience symptoms, it’s time to consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis. Getting Proper Diagnosis Getting a proper diagnosis for magnesium deficiency can be tricky since most magnesium is stored in bones and soft tissues. A blood test can measure serum magnesium levels, but it may not reflect total body magnesium accurately. That’s why it’s crucial to discuss your symptoms with a healthcare professional who can guide you through the best diagnostic approach and treatment plan. Natural Sources vs. Supplements: Making an Informed Decision When faced with a magnesium deficiency, the decision between natural sources and supplements is critical. If you’re generally healthy and looking to prevent deficiency, focus on dietary sources of magnesium. They come with additional nutrients and benefits that supplements can’t match. However, if you’re at risk of deficiency due to a health condition or other factors, supplements can be a practical solution to restore your levels quickly and effectively. Remember, always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen. Frequently Asked Questions How much magnesium do I need each day? Can taking too much magnesium be harmful? Which foods are high in magnesium? Can I test for magnesium deficiency at home? What are the long-term effects of untreated magnesium deficiency? How much magnesium do I need each day? The daily recommended intake of magnesium varies by age, gender, and life stage. For adults, men require about 400-420 mg per day, while women need 310-320 mg. Children and teens have lower needs, depending on their age. It’s worth noting that pregnant and breastfeeding women may need more magnesium. Always aim to meet these requirements through a balanced diet and consider supplements only if necessary. For more information on maintaining a healthy diet, check out these foods to detox your kidneys, which are also rich in magnesium. A simple way to remember magnesium-rich foods is to think “greens, beans, nuts, and seeds.” These are your go-to options for a magnesium boost. Also, don’t forget about whole grains and certain fruits like avocados and bananas. These foods not only provide magnesium but also a host of other nutrients that contribute to overall health. Keep in mind that your body can only absorb so much magnesium at once, so it’s better to spread out your intake throughout the day. This can be as easy as adding a handful of almonds to your morning snack and tossing some spinach into your lunchtime salad. Can taking too much magnesium be harmful? While magnesium is essential, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Excessive magnesium intake, particularly from supplements, can lead to diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramping. In severe cases, it can cause an irregular heartbeat and cardiac arrest. The upper limit for supplemental magnesium is 350 mg per day for adults. Stick to this limit unless advised otherwise by a healthcare professional. Which foods are high in magnesium? Foods rich in magnesium are readily available and can be easily integrated into your diet. Here are some top choices: Leafy greens like spinach and Swiss chard Nuts, especially almonds and cashews Seeds, with pumpkin seeds being a standout Whole grains such as brown rice, oats, and quinoa Legumes, including black beans and lentils Avocado, banana, and dark chocolate for a treat Can I test for magnesium deficiency at home? While home testing kits are available, they may not provide an accurate measure of your body’s magnesium status since most magnesium is stored inside cells and bones, not in the blood. These tests typically measure serum magnesium, which can be normal even when a deficiency exists. If you suspect a deficiency, it’s best to consult with a healthcare provider who can offer more reliable testing methods and interpret the results correctly. What are the long-term effects of untreated magnesium deficiency? Ignoring early signs of magnesium deficiency can lead to more serious health issues down the line. Chronic magnesium deficiency is linked to hypertension, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and migraines. In the long term, it can also contribute to mental health issues like depression and anxiety. Therefore, addressing a deficiency promptly is not just about feeling better now; it’s about protecting your future health.",5,0.3183175,-0.13599166,False

https://healthimpactnews.com/2024/beat-the-flu-without-vaccines-and-drugs/,Beat the Flu Without Vaccines and Drugs!,0,"Commentary by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News It’s that time of year again in North America that is called “the flu season”, and where Big Pharma likes to make a ton of money on their products to “fight the flu.” Big Pharma’s flu products are highly toxic, however, and their number 1 product is the flu shot, which can injure, cripple, or kill you. In just this year alone, 2024, over 6,000 cases of adverse effects from the flu shots have been filed with VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System), including 52 deaths, 70 life threatening adverse reactions, 80 permanent disabilities, 285 hospitalizations, and 666 ER visits. (Source – From the 11/29/2024 release of VAERS data.) Human beings have been fighting flu-like illnesses for thousands of years before modern-day western medicine started producing vaccines and pharmaceutical products, and the body of research showing how much more effective natural, non-patentable remedies are for fighting the flu is very large. This is a topic I have covered for almost two decades now, so I am going to list here the top remedies for fighting the flu that people have found much more effective than vaccines and pharmaceutical products.

And please don’t email me either asking for personal advice, because I do not give out advice to people over the Internet. Vitamin D is one of the most potent supplements to stop flu symptoms in their track. It is well researched, which makes it a constant target by Big Pharma to try and suppress this research, as it would seriously put a dent into the sale and distribution of flu shots, as Vitamin D supplements can be purchased almost anywhere and does not need a doctor’s prescription. William B. Grant, Ph.D. of Orthomolecular Medicine News Service is someone we have featured many times on Health Impact News regarding the benefits of Vitamin D. See: One of the most popular articles we have published on Vitamin D for beating the flu, is a 2017 article published by Dr. Joseph Mercola: When we reposted this article on Facebook in 2019, it went viral, reaching a high of 15,000 views per hour, until Facebook added a “Fact Checker” warning as “fake news”. See: The best source of Vitamin D is direct sunlight, which is why Vitamin D supplementation can have dramatic effects during the short winter days where sunlight exposure is the most limited. When I feel flu-like symptoms coming on during the winter months, I take 20,000 to 30,000 IU (500 mg to 750 mg) a day until symptoms subside. Vitamin C is the other “Super Vitamin” that has a long history of research showing just how effective Vitamin C supplementation is for a variety of illnesses, including respiratory illnesses such as the flu. Another natural product that cannot be patented and that is widely available without a doctor’s prescription, it too presents a threat to Big Pharma’s expensive and highly toxic drugs. Because it has such a long history of success in fighting “influenza”, it proved successful against the “cornavirus” as well, since COVID-19 was just simply a rebranding of a set of symptoms that is usually called “the flu.” See: Doctors who started treating COVID patients with Vitamin C and seeing a 100% success rate that they made public, were attacked, censored, and even arrested during the COVID Scam. See: The best presentation about all the wonderful benefits of Vitamin C supplementation is a 2014 presentation by Dr. Suzanne Humphries. See: Virgin Coconut Oil also has a long history of stopping the flu and other illnesses attributed to “viruses” in their tracks. See: Virgin Coconut Oil works best when you replace the toxic oils in your house and diets with Virgin Coconut Oil. Toxic oils that contribute to illnesses are: Canola Oil, Soybean Oil, Corn Oil, and most any other cooking oil that has only entered the human food chain after WW II when industrialization began, and we developed the technology (seed expeller technology) to make liquid oils from seeds we never did before. I have written an entire book on Virgin Coconut Oil, and at the time of this writing it is currently being offered for free (soft cover version – 242 pages with recipes), with a minimum purchase of $20. Order here. Bone broths and soups are another effective way to fight the flu, as family stories about “grandma’s homemade chicken soup” being a cure for colds and flus is not just simply an “old wives’ tale”, but the evidence is overwhelming that it is actually true! You can easily make your own bone broths, especially if you are roasting turkeys or chickens over the holidays. (Don’t throw away the bones!!) Here are some good articles to read to learn more, including how to make your own bone broths: Photo by Shannon Stonger.",6,-0.32147044,0.33830684,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/vitamin-d-danger/,#1 Vitamin D Danger You Absolutely Must Be Aware Of,0,"Today, we’ll talk about the number one vitamin D danger, and two big mistakes you could be making when taking vitamin D supplements. You could be taking vitamin D wrong in a way that not only makes it ineffective, so you can’t actually absorb, or use it, but could actually be dangerous. This video will show you an easy way to make sure the vitamin D you’re taking is effective, and also prevent it from being dangerous, so let’s get into it. First, let’s look at why vitamin D supplementation is necessary for many people. Vitamin D deficiency is a common global issue, with approximately 42% of adults in the US being deficient. This is largely attributable to our modern lifestyle. We spend a lot of time indoors, so we don’t get enough sunlight to produce vitamin D in our skin. Using a lot of sunscreen can also limit vitamin D production. This is especially true for those with darker skin, as they need more sunlight to make an adequate amount of vitamin D. Plus, there are few foods that are rich in vitamin D, such as cod liver oil, certain mushrooms exposed to ultraviolet light, and foods fortified with vitamin D. If you have a condition that makes it difficult for your body to absorb vitamin D, like inflammatory bowel disease, liver disease, or cystic fibrosis, or if you take certain medications, such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, you may also have a deficiency in vitamin D. Also, some studies suggest that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found in polluted air, water bottles, cosmetics, pesticides, and heavy metals can lower vitamin D levels. As you can see, there are many factors that can increase your risk of vitamin D deficiency. Your body absolutely needs vitamin D to ensure it functions optimally. Vitamin D plays a critical role in strengthening the immune system, aiding in calcium absorption, and supporting heart and brain health. It also activates and deactivates genes that can cause diseases. Studies have shown that vitamin D can turn off genes that cause cancer, and turn on genes that are essential for the immune system to function properly. So, it’s hardly surprising a deficiency of vitamin D can be dangerous. When vitamin D levels drop below the threshold level of 30 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL), it puts you at risk of serious chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, and disorders that attack your immune system. Signs of vitamin D deficiency, include weakened immunity, feeling tired, fragile bones, feeling sad and low, hair loss, and muscle or joint pain. Many people take vitamin D3 supplements to ensure they’re not deficient, but at least 50% of the time, they’re doing it wrong. That’s because they’re missing two other nutrients that help your body use vitamin D effectively. This is important, because supplementing with vitamin D “without” these two other key nutrients, can weaken your bones and contribute to plaque buildup in your arteries. Now, let’s talk about the first important nutrient: Magnesium. Before you take vitamin D supplements, it’s important to consider if you are getting sufficient magnesium in your diet. Magnesium is a cofactor or “helper” in hundreds of enzymes that are essential for various biological reactions. This includes the enzymes responsible for the activation and metabolism of vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D, in either the D2 or D3 form, is biologically inactive, until it is converted into its active form, calcitriol. For this conversion to happen, the enzymes present in your liver and kidneys need to use sufficient amounts of magnesium. Now, the more vitamin D you take, the more your body uses magnesium. If you have low levels of magnesium, your body won’t be able to use vitamin D properly. In other words, the vitamin D you’re taking won’t be effective. This can definitely impact your bone health, immune function, and overall well-being. It’s estimated that about half of the population have low magnesium levels because of factors like soil depletion, chronic stress, not eating enough magnesium-rich foods, certain medications, digestive problems, and alcohol consumption. Studies have shown that low magnesium levels can reduce vitamin D levels and taking magnesium supplements has been found to help reverse vitamin D deficiency. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the recommended amount of magnesium is 400 to 420 milligrams per day for men, and 310 to 320 milligrams a day for women. If you experience muscle twitches, tremors and cramps, poor sleep, lethargy and heart palpitations, this could be because you aren’t getting enough magnesium. One way to replenish your body’s supply of magnesium is by eating foods such as almonds, pumpkin seeds, mushrooms, cashew nuts, and spinach. If you’re thinking about taking a magnesium supplement, consider magnesium bisglycinate. For a lot of people, this is the best form of magnesium to take, because it’s absorbed well by the body and is unlikely to cause digestive issues. Getting enough magnesium benefits you in a variety of ways, such as relieving muscle tension, reducing stress, helping with your nervous system and your body’s synthesis of proteins, and of course, utilizing vitamin D. If you suspect your magnesium levels are low, you may just want to supplement without taking a blood test. This is because a blood test is not a good indicator of magnesium levels, as only about 1% of your body’s magnesium is found in the blood. Now, let’s talk about the second nutrient you absolutely cannot ignore when taking vitamin D. A JAMA study published in 2010 found that women aged 70 years or older, who received very high doses (500,000 IU) of vitamin D3 every winter for 3-5 years, were more likely to experience falls and fractures. You may find these results surprising, since one of vitamin D’s primary functions is to absorb calcium in the intestines into the bloodstream. And it’s widely believed that more calcium equals stronger bones. As it turns out, calcium absorption is only one part of the picture. An excessive intake of vitamin D can actually have the opposite effect. In another 2019 study, people who took either 400 IU, 4,000 IU, or 10,000 IU of vitamin D over three years didn’t see any improvement in bone density. In fact, those who took the highest dose had a decrease in bone density. To understand why more vitamin D does not lead to stronger bones, you need to know that vitamin D stimulates the formation and activation of osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are specialized cells that continuously break down old or damaged bone tissue, so that new bone can be rebuilt to maintain bone strength. During this process, calcium is released from the bone for use throughout your body. This blood calcium is vital for nerve transmission, blood clotting, and muscle contraction. This means that now your body needs to deliver more calcium to the bones. The problem is that vitamin D cannot tell calcium to go to the right places like your bones and teeth. In order for this to happen, your body needs vitamin K2 in the form of MK-7. So, vitamin K2 is the second missing piece of the puzzle. Here’s what should happen: The active form of vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium into the bloodstream. Then, vitamin K2 activates the protein, osteocalcin, which instructs your cells to transport the calcium into your bones and teeth. And vitamin K2 switches on another protein, MGP, which prevents calcium from accumulating in the soft tissues of the body. If you take too much vitamin D without an adequate intake of vitamin K2, there will be excessive calcium in the blood. This can lead to calcium being deposited in the kidneys, arteries, and other soft tissues. In other words, taking vitamin D on its own can lead to calcified arteries, and put you at risk of heart problems. Studies have shown that people deficient in vitamin K2 are more likely to develop calcified arteries. They also show that supplementing with vitamin K2 prevented blood vessel calcification in animals and reduced the risk of calcification in humans. Make sure you’re getting between 100 and 300 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin K2 per day. You’ll find vitamin K2 in grass-fed butter, cheese, and meat, pastured-raised eggs, beef and goose liver, natto, sauerkraut, and eel. So, now you understand the importance of getting sufficient magnesium and vitamin K2 along with vitamin D3. Most people are lacking in one or both of these nutrients, and this can significantly impact their overall health. So, how much vitamin D should you get daily? The generally recommended safe upper limit is 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day. However, individuals who are deficient in vitamin D may need to take a higher dosage, and it’s important to consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate amount for you.

Grown-ups need them to protect against diseases that become more common in adulthood. They can also protect you if you missed a dose as a child. Most adults need some or all of the following 11 vaccines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist what you need. Let them know if you'll be traveling internationally, if you have allergies, or if you’re pregnant. All of those things can affect which vaccines you need and which you should skip for now. How you get it: As a shot, or sometimes a nasal spray is recommended How often and when: Once a year, usually starting in September through the end of the flu season, which can last as late as May. The earlier you get it, the better your protection. Who should get it: All adults should get the vaccine in some form, unless they have a medical reason not to. The shot is the most common type. The nasal spray version has often been available for healthy adults up to age 49 who aren’t pregnant. There is an egg-free vaccine in case you have severe egg allergies. And if injections make you nervous, you can also get a shot that uses a smaller needle and doesn't pierce as deeply. Also, people who have a greater chance of getting the flu, like those over 65, can get high-dose injections that give them better protection. How you get it: As a shot How often and when: There are two types of these vaccines. If you’re a healthy adult over 65, you’ll need one or both. The timing and sequence of them depend on what vaccine you may have had before. Doctors may recommend more doses of the vaccine depending on which vaccine they received first for people with long-lasting kidney failure or other conditions that weaken the immune system. People who get their first pneumococcal shot before age 65 get a second dose after 65. Who should get it: All adults 65 and older. If you’re younger than 64, you need it if you: How you get it: A single shot of Tdap protects against all three diseases. One shot of Td guards against tetanus and diphtheria.

If you start before you are 15, then you get the second shot 1 to 2 months after the first. Who should get it? Young women and some men up to age 26 who didn't get it as preteens or teenagers. It’s best to get it before you start having sex. How you get it: In a single shot that protects against the three viruses How often and when: One shot, in some cases followed by a booster at least 4 weeks later Who should get it? Adults who were born after 1957, haven’t had measles, mumps, or rubella, and don’t have any immunity to them. Because this vaccine is made with live viruses, pregnant women shouldn’t get it, though women should get it at least 4 weeks before they get pregnant. How you get it: As a shot How often and when: Any time, in two doses 4-8 weeks apart Who should get it? Healthy adults who aren’t pregnant, haven't had chickenpox before, and aren’t immune to the virus. This vaccine is made with live viruses, so you shouldn’t get it if you have a weak immune system because of a disease (like cancer or HIV) or medical treatments (like steroids or chemotherapy). How you get it: As a shot How often and when: The first shot at age 11 or 12, with a booster at 16 and when a doctor recommends one. Who should get it?

https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-to-heal-your-heart/,Eat These 10 Foods that Will Help Your Heart Heal,0,"Imagine if your doctor prescribed you a “miracle drug” that could lower your blood pressure, reduce your triglycerides, protect you from heart disease, and had no side effects, all while tasting delicious. Would you take it? I’m pretty sure you would take it in a heartbeat. The good news is that this prescription already exists. In today’s video, we highlight 10 foods that have the power to heal your heart, prevent cardiovascular disease, and improve your quality of life if you already have a heart condition. Continue watching till Number 1, as this is the one food most people ignore. Let’s begin with Number 10: “Fatty Fish”. Fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, and anchovies, are at the forefront of the most heart-healthy foods you can consume. These fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which play a pivotal role in supporting heart health by reducing inflammation, lowering triglycerides, preventing blood clots, and maintaining healthy blood pressure. A groundbreaking 2021 study revealed that individuals with heart disease who consumed at least two servings of fatty fish per week experienced a remarkable 20% reduction in their risk of heart attacks, strokes, and even death. Furthermore, fish consumption has been linked to a lower risk of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AFib). Additionally, omega-3 fatty acids from seafood have been shown to help prevent coronary calcification and plaque progression, with a high omega-3 index predicting a low heart attack risk in individuals with coronary calcification. When purchasing fish, it’s advisable to stay away from farm-raised fish, which can be contaminated with heavy metals and chemicals. Instead, opt for wild-caught fish from a sustainable source. Coming up next, is Number 9: “Nitrate-rich Vegetables”. Leafy green vegetables are a vital component of a heart-healthy diet. Recent research from Edith Cowan University in Australia has unveiled the remarkable benefits of daily consumption of a cup of nitrate-rich vegetables, which is associated with a 15 to 26% reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. This includes lower blood pressure and a decreased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure. Nitrate-rich vegetables encompass a variety of leafy and non-leafy options, including spinach, arugula, lettuce, kale, cabbage, beets, and fennel. These greens are abundant in nitrates, which elevate nitric oxide levels in the body. Nitric oxide is crucial for heart health, as it relaxes blood vessels, enhances blood flow, restores endothelial functioning, and lowers blood pressure. Furthermore, leafy green vegetables are also rich in vitamin K, chlorophyll, calcium, magnesium, and potassium, making them some of the best foods to heal your heart and reverse heart disease. When purchasing vegetables, always try to go organic. Moving on, we have Number 8: “Organ Meats”. Organ meat, such as beef heart and liver, is often referred to as a “carnivore superfood” due to its exceptional nutritional value, particularly for heart health. Beef liver, is a rich source of vital minerals, L-carnitine, and B vitamins, including B1, B2, B6, folate, and B12, all of which play a crucial role in protecting, strengthening, and stabilizing heart muscle cells. These B vitamins also aid in lowering homocysteine levels in the blood. High homocysteine is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis, blood clots, and blood vessel blockages. Additionally, heart and liver are one of the best sources of CoQ10, an antioxidant that increases energy uptake in heart cells, lowers blood pressure and inflammation, and improves vascular function. When purchasing organ meat, go for high-quality grass-finished or pasture-raised organ meat. Coming into our Number 7, we have: “Nuts and Seeds”. Packed with healthy omega-3 fatty acids, plant sterols, and fiber, nuts and seeds are formidable allies in your quest for a healthy heart. These nutritional powerhouses not only lower inflammation and harmful cholesterol but could also reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by as much as 23%. Each type of nut and seed possesses different kinds of vitamins, amino acids, and minerals, including vitamin E, L-arginine, and magnesium. Studies have shown that vitamin E has the potential to halt plaque development in the arteries and reduce the risk of stroke. Additionally, L-arginine, an amino acid that converts to nitric oxide in the body, has been associated with lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. And magnesium helps maintain a steady heart rhythm and normal blood pressure. Nuts and seeds high in magnesium include brazil nuts, chia seeds, cashews, almonds, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, hazelnuts, sunflower seeds, and pistachios. When buying nuts and seeds, always opt for fresh, organic varieties without added ingredients. Next, at Number 6, we have: “Grass-finished Beef”. The conventional advice to limit red meat consumption as a means to prevent or reduce heart disease has been a long-standing recommendation. However, this guidance has been influenced by the low-fat movement, leading to a common misconception. In reality, grass-finished beef, with its impressive nutrient profile, can be a valuable addition to a heart-healthy diet. It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), both of which are essential for cardiovascular health. Additionally, grass-finished beef contains L-carnitine, which has been found to be critical in heart health. A review study analyzing the benefits of L-carnitine on the heart revealed significant reductions in all-cause mortality, angina symptoms, and ventricular arrhythmias. When considering beef, it is advisable to prioritize grass-finished beef and to avoid beef that is not organic and comes from grain-fed animals. This is due to the potential presence of growth hormones, antibiotics, GMOs, and toxic pesticides in non-organic, grain-fed beef. Moving on, at Number 5, we have: “Citrus Fruits”. Citrus fruits, including oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruits, offer a vibrant array of health benefits. Packed with vitamin C, these fruits act as powerful antioxidants, safeguarding your arteries from free radical damage and supporting the production of collagen, a vital component for artery repair and maintenance. Moreover, citrus fruits are abundant in hesperidin, a flavonoid that stimulates the production of nitric oxide, thus promoting blood vessel function and reducing inflammation. This natural compound, combined with the fruits’ potassium and pectin fiber content, can help stabilize cholesterol levels and reduce blood pressure, further enhancing their cardiovascular benefits. When selecting citrus fruits, opt for organic varieties and limit citrus juice consumption to homemade options in moderation. Next up, is our Number 4: “Olive Oil”. A comprehensive study, spanning over two decades, revealed that adding more than half a tablespoon of olive oil into your daily diet could potentially lower your risk of cardiovascular disease by 15% and coronary artery disease by 21%. These remarkable benefits are attributed to the high levels of antioxidants and monounsaturated fats, particularly oleic acid, found in this heart-protective oil. To fully embrace the benefits of olive oil, it is recommended to opt for extra-virgin, first, cold-pressed olive oil in a dark bottle, as this represents the highest-quality option. Coming into the top 3, we have: “Garlic”. Garlic consumption has been linked to improved circulation, increased blood flow, and a reduction in inflammation. Notably, a 2017 study published in the Journal of Hypertension revealed that a higher habitual intake of allium vegetables, including garlic, was associated with a substantial 64% reduced risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes. Furthermore, another study demonstrated that taking garlic extract for 24 weeks was as effective as atenolol, a common prescription beta blocker, at reducing blood pressure. To maximize the benefits of garlic, always crush, chop, smash, or press it before use. Doing this starts the chemical reaction that makes allicin, the biologically active compound found in garlic. Coming into Number 2, we have: “Berries”. Blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries are rich in potent antioxidants such as anthocyanins, which combat free radicals in your body and reduce chronic inflammation. Research suggests that incorporating berries into your diet could lead to lower blood pressure, improved cholesterol levels, and reduced insulin resistance, thus making them top contenders in the fight against heart disease. It’s worth noting that avocados and pomegranates, which are also technically classified as berries, offer proven heart-healthy benefits. Avocados have been shown to lower the most dangerous type of cholesterol, small, dense LDL, and are abundant in potassium, which can decrease blood pressure and reduce the risk of stroke. Furthermore, a study revealed that drinking one ounce of pomegranate juice daily for one year led to a remarkable 30% reduction in atherosclerotic plaque in patients with severe carotid artery blockages. This underscores the potential of these fruits to significantly benefit your cardiovascular health. And at Number 1, is one food that most people ignore: “Fermented Foods”. Emerging research suggests that a balanced and thriving gut microbiome can play a pivotal role in preventing the development of cardiovascular issues and maintaining robust heart health. To nurture a healthy gut, it’s essential to embrace a diverse organic diet, replete with prebiotics and probiotic-rich foods. Prebiotics are found in an array of foods such as bananas, kiwifruit, legumes, garlic, oats, and artichokes, while fermented delights like natto, kimchi, sauerkraut, and coconut kefir, serve as fantastic sources of probiotics, fostering your gut’s health and harmony. These fermented foods are also rich in vitamin K2, a nutrient that not only prevents calcium from depositing in the arteries but also promotes the removal of calcium from existing plaques. By activating the protein, MGP, vitamin K2 moves calcium away from the blood vessels and kidneys to the bones and teeth where it is needed. To get enough vitamin K2 daily, as well as all the other nutrients mentioned in this video, you’ll have to consume multiple varieties of whole foods and many bowls a day. To see an easy solution to get all the nutrients you need every day, to naturally banish plaque from your circulatory system, enjoy a surge of natural energy that lasts, and keep your ticker in tip-top shape, check out our recommended product below. It’s important to remember that while adding these foods to your diet can keep your ticker healthy, it’s equally essential to eliminate or minimize the consumption of foods that can harm your cardiovascular system.

https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20240229/ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-health-problems-and-early-death,Ultra-processed Foods Linked to Health Problems and Early Death,1,"Most health experts recommend that you eat a balanced, healthy diet to maintain or to lose weight. But exactly what is a healthy diet? It should include: Dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of those nutrients, ideally from foods. A good general rule is to use MyPlate, which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal. Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein. Stick to your calorie “budget,” because when you're working on losing weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal, your age, your sex, and how active you are. A dietitian can help you figure that out. Don't cut your calories too much, or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs. More tips: That's just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss. Keep learning as much as you can, including the following terms. Calories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat. Proteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes. Your body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely. There are several types of fats: Carbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Adults should get about 35% to 55% of their calories from carbohydrates. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, leading to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients. You should limit those, which include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesn't make them. There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins don't build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet. Minerals, like vitamins, must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it can't make them. You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper. Water has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up 55%-65% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.",3,0.396813,-0.03855194,True

It's a number of conditions that can affect how your heart works. Heart disease can also be called cardiovascular disease, though that term covers blood vessels problems as well. Heart disease is a major killer in the U.S., causing about 1 in 5 deaths, or about 700,000 a year. Each type of heart disease has its own symptoms and treatment. If you have some kinds, lifestyle changes and medicine can make a huge difference in your health. For others, you may need surgery to make your ticker work well again. Here are some of the common types of heart disease and how to prevent, recognize, and treat them. CAD is the most common heart problem and the biggest killer. With CAD, you get blockages in your coronary arteries — the vessels that supply blood to your heart. That can reduce the flow of blood to your heart muscle, keeping it from getting the oxygen it needs. The disease usually starts as a result of atherosclerosis, sometimes called hardening of the arteries. When you have that condition, deposits called plaque build up in your arteries, often over many years. Coronary heart disease can give you pain in your chest, called angina, or lead to a heart attack. It can also contribute to other heart problems, such as abnormal heart rhythms or heart failure. Some things that may put you at a higher risk of CAD are: When you have an arrhythmia, your heart beats too fast, too slow, or in an irregular, uneven pattern. Some arrhythmias are harmless. But others can put you at a serious risk of problems such as cardiac arrest and stroke. They may also cause symptoms like dizziness and fainting. Serious arrhythmias often develop from other heart problems but may also happen on their own. You're at higher risk if you smoke, drink alcohol, or have health problems such as obesity, high blood sugar, or sleep apnea. With heart failure, your heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should to meet your body's needs. It is usually caused by CAD, but it can also happen because you have thyroid disease, high blood pressure, heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy), or certain other conditions. Your heart has four valves that open and close to direct blood flow between your heart's four chambers, the lungs, and blood vessels. An abnormality could make it hard for a valve to open and close the right way. When that happens, your blood flow could be blocked or blood can leak. The causes of heart valve problems include infections such as rheumatic fever, congenital heart disease, high blood pressure, CAD, and damage from a heart attack. Diseases of the heart valves include: Endocarditis. This is an infection that's usually caused by bacteria, which may enter the blood and take root in your heart during illness, after surgery, or after using IV drugs. It often happens if you already have valve problems. Antibiotics can usually cure it, but the disease is life threatening without treatment. If your heart valves are seriously damaged as a result of endocarditis, you may need valve replacement surgery. Rheumatic heart disease. This condition develops when your heart muscle and valves are damaged by rheumatic fever, which is linked to strep throat and scarlet fever. Rheumatic heart disease was more common in the past. But doctors are now able to prevent it by using antibiotics to treat the diseases that lead to it. If you do get it, the symptoms usually show up many years after the infection. Any disease of the pericardium, the sac that surrounds your heart, is called a pericardial disease. One of the more common diseases is pericarditis or inflammation of the pericardium. It's usually caused by an infection with a virus, inflammatory diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, or injury to your pericardium. Pericarditis often follows open heart surgery. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of your heart muscle, or myocardium. It gets stretched, thickened, or stiff. Your heart may get too weak to pump well. There are many possible causes of the disease, including genetic heart conditions, reactions to certain drugs or toxins (such as alcohol), and viral infections. Sometimes, chemotherapy for cancer causes cardiomyopathy. Many times, doctors can't find the exact cause. Congenital heart disease happens when something goes wrong while the heart is forming before birth. The heart abnormality sometimes leads to problems right after birth, but other times, there aren't any symptoms until adulthood. Septal abnormalities are among the most common congenital heart problems. These are holes in the wall that separates the left and right sides of your heart. You can get a procedure to patch the hole. Another type of abnormality is called pulmonary stenosis. A narrow valve reduces the flow of blood to your lungs. A procedure or surgery can open or replace the valve. In some babies, a small blood vessel known as the ductus arteriosus doesn't close up at birth as it should. When this happens, some blood leaks back into the pulmonary artery, which puts strain on the heart. Doctors can treat this with surgery or a procedure or sometimes with medication. Heart disease symptoms vary, depending on the kind of heart disease you have. In some cases, symptoms of different conditions overlap; in others, they don't. Here are some symptoms you might see with common types. CAD Arrythmias Heart failure Heart valve disease Cardiomyopathy Congenital heart disease If you have symptoms of heart disease, your doctor will start with the basics: examining you and listening to your heart with a stethoscope. They'll also want to know about your family and medical history. From there, you might get some tests, depending on your symptoms and history. They might include: Blood tests. These include the routine tests you get for cholesterol and blood sugar levels. In some cases, you might get tests for proteins linked to inflamed arteries and heart attacks. Chest X-ray. This can show if your heart is enlarged. EKG. This test records the electrical signals in your heart and shows the rate and rhythm of your heartbeats. Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to make detailed images of your heart in motion. It can show how blood moves through the heart and heart valves. Exercise tests or stress tests. You might use a treadmill or stationary bike while your heart is checked. Cardiac catheterization. If you might have blockages in your heart arteries, you can get this test, in which a long, thin flexible tube called a catheter is inserted in a blood vessel and guided to your heart. Dye can then be injected to help the arteries show up on X-rays. Depending on your type of heart disease, your treatment might start with lifestyle changes and include medications, procedures, and rehabilitation. Medications for heart disease These include medications to: Procedures for heart disease These include: Cardiac rehabilitation If you've had a heart attack, angioplasty, or heart surgery or if you have heart failure, you can benefit from this kind of program. Cardiac rehab includes: Because heart disease is the leading cause of death, taking steps to protect your heart is important, whether you've been diagnosed with heart disease or not. Here are some ways to keep your heart in the best shape possible: Don't smoke. Smoking isn't just bad for your lungs. It harms your heart and blood vessels, too. Quitting can quickly improve your heart health. Get or stay active. Try to get your heart pumping with 150 minutes a week of moderate activity, like brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity, like running. Eat heart-healthy foods. That means lots of fruits and veggies, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats like those found in olive oil and avocados. Limit salt, sugar, alcohol, and highly processed foods. Get enough sleep. Most adults need at least seven hours a night. Reduce stress. If you're constantly on edge, try relaxation exercises or meditation. Getting more physical activity can help, too. Get regular checkups. Make sure you know your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar levels and take steps to improve them if needed. Having heart disease can have a big impact on your life and keep you from doing the things you'd like to do. The most common form of heart disease, CAD, is a major killer. But you can prevent or limit the damage from most forms of heart diseases. Living a heart-healthy lifestyle and working with your doctor to recognize and treat heart problems can make a big difference. Can you live a long life with heart disease? In many cases, the answer is yes. Of course, it depends on the type of heart disease you have and how effectively it's treated, as well as your health habits. For example, people who get treated for CAD can stop artery buildup from getting worse and prevent heart attacks, potentially adding years to their lives. And people with some conditions, including heart failure, are living longer than they did in the past, thanks to advances in medicine. What are the two warning signs of heart disease? Heart disease can have many warning signs. For the most common type, CAD, the two most common symptoms are chest pain and shortness of breath. What happens after you get diagnosed with heart disease? After the diagnosis, it's important to work with your doctor to get the best care and understand what's going on with your heart. So ask lots of questions — like whether you'll need more tests and treatments and what you should do if you have new symptoms. You may need to have regular visits with a heart doctor and make changes to your diet or other habits. In many cases, you'll need to take medicine for the rest of your life.",7,0.22709514,0.3007443,True

Lots of items can be recalled. Some products that are commonly recalled include: If an item is recalled, you may have to throw it away, return it, or exchange it for a similar or newer product. Although most companies create specific quality control procedures to either prevent or lessen the chance of a recall, they can happen. Product safety recalls are mainly used to protect people. Usually, a recall happens because someone finds out that the item could hurt someone or make them sick, or has already has. It could also be an issue that affects how the item is supposed to work or it might be one that creates legal problems for the makers. If an item you have is recalled, your next move depends on the type of product and the instructions put out by the government agency or manufacturer. Usually the company that makes the product or a government agency will announce the product recall and encourage people who have that item to take action. For example, some recalls will let you know that you need to throw the item out. Others prevent the company from selling any more of that product. Or, you might have to send the product back to the manufacturer so they can either repair or replace it. Recall notices will include useful information like: A food recall can happen if the food is mislabeled or if it might be contaminated. Food recalls are often announced on local or national news outlets. If you have a food product that’s been recalled: Medication product recalls happen for different reasons. Some drugs are recalled because doctors discovered a dangerous side effect. Other times, the way the medication was made isn’t up to par. Lots of drug recalls happen because of minor issues, such as changing the wording on a patient information pamphlet or medication label. If you have a medication that has been recalled: Before you buy an item, especially if it’s for a child, make sure the company that created it hasn’t recalled it.

But exactly what is a healthy diet? It should include: Dieting or not, everyone needs a mix of those nutrients, ideally from foods. A good general rule is to use MyPlate, which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal. Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein. Stick to your calorie “budget,” because when you're working on losing weight, you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink. Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal, your age, your sex, and how active you are. A dietitian can help you figure that out. Don't cut your calories too much, or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs. More tips: That's just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss. Keep learning as much as you can, including the following terms. Calories are a measurement, like an inch or a tablespoon. They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to the body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. Even low-carb and fat-free foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat. Proteins help repair and maintain your body, including muscle. You can get protein in all types of food. Good sources include fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, beans, and other legumes. Your body needs some fat. But most Americans get too much of it, which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely. There are several types of fats: Carbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose, which is a type of sugar. Adults should get about 35% to 55% of their calories from carbohydrates. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbs, leading to obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Some carbs are rich in nutrients. Those include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Other carbs are sugary and starchy, and not high in nutrients. You should limit those, which include candy, pastries, cookies, chips, soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body. In general, vitamins must come from the diet; the body doesn't make them. There are 13 essential vitamins. Your body can store vitamins A, D, E, and K, and it can be a problem if you get too much of them. Vitamin C and the B vitamins don't build up in your body, so you need to keep getting them regularly in your diet. Minerals, like vitamins, must come from the diet. Your body needs them, but it can't make them. You need more of some minerals (such as calcium, potassium, and iron) than others. For instance, you need only small amounts of the minerals zinc, selenium, and copper. Water has no calories or nutrients, but it keeps you hydrated. It also makes up 55%-65% of body weight. You can drink water or get it from foods that naturally have water in them, like fruits and vegetables.",3,0.396813,-0.03855194,True
https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/news/20240223/cm/increase-in-measles-cases-tied-to-drop-vaccination-rates,Increase in Measles Cases Tied to Drop in Vaccination Rates,1,"Feb. 23, 2024 – The recent growth in measles cases in the United States and the world is linked to declining vaccination rates for children, medical experts say. The CDC issued an alert last month saying 23 confirmed cases of measles had been detected in the United States between Dec. 1, 2023, and Jan. 23. That included seven cases imported by international travelers and two outbreaks with more than five cases each. “Most of these cases were among children and adolescents who had not received a measles-containing vaccine (MMR or MMRV), even if age eligible,” the CDC said. Vaccination rates have been declining for several years. National coverage for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) was 93.1% for the 2022-2023 school year, a 2% drop from the 95% rate in the 2019-2020 school year, the CDC reported. That was the third straight year the rate fell below 95%, which is the level needed for herd immunity. “We’re not just seeing cases, we’re seeing transmission, which means vaccine levels aren’t what we’d like them to be,” Saskia Popescu, PhD, an assistant professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, told PBS. Another expert said that vaccine hesitancy fueled during the pandemic has also affected measles vaccination rates. ""In addition, because children were quarantined during the pandemic, many missed out on well-child visits and didn’t catch up on their vaccines. That has meant 61 million fewer doses distributed nationwide between 2020 and 2022,"" said Priya Soni, MD, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Cedars-Sinai Guerin Children’s. The same trends are occurring globally. From 2021 to 2022, worldwide measles cases increased by 18%, and deaths have increased by 43%, the CDC and the World Health Organization reported. “The increase in measles outbreaks and deaths is staggering, but unfortunately, not unexpected given the declining vaccination rates we’ve seen in the past few years,” said John Vertefeuille, PhD, director of the CDC’s Global Immunization Division. “Measles cases anywhere pose a risk to all countries and communities where people are under-vaccinated. Urgent, targeted efforts are critical to prevent measles disease and deaths.”",4,-0.3965331,0.21301155,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/6-ways-to-boost-magnesium-levels/,6 Powerful Ways to Boost Your Magnesium Levels,0,"To keep your body strong and healthy, make sure to pay attention to your intake of all essential nutrients. A magnesium deficiency can lead to a plethora of health problems, including diabetes, heart attacks and anxiety. (Updated Nov 10, 2023) Many people are magnesium deficient without even realizing it, and it’s better to be safe than sorry! Here are six proven ways to boost magnesium levels. 1. Blend Magnesium-Rich Foods If it’s a rich dark green and it has leaves, chances are it’s excellent for your health. Foods like kale and spinach have been popularized as foods rich in iron and antioxidants, but what not everyone knows is that they also do wonders for your magnesium levels. Go ahead and make the verdant salad of your dreams, and toss in some nuts along the way for even more of the mineral. A few handfuls of almonds, cashews, pine nuts, brazil nuts, pecans and most of all pumpkin seeds are a great natural magnesium supplement. If you’re in the mood for something sweeter, try this magnesium-rich smoothie: 5 bananas (fresh or frozen) 1/2 bunch of fresh kale 1/2 bunch of fresh spinach 1 Tablespoon of chia seeds 4 dates 1.5 – 2 cups of purified water or fresh coconut water 2. Make Your Own Magnesium Lotions Magnesium butter smells fresh and feels divine when rubbed onto your skin. You can easily make it from scratch yourself from only three ingredients. It’s the perfect addition to your pre-bedtime routine—or your own domestic spa day. Blend together just a half cup of coconut oil, another half cup of coconut butter and a quarter cup magnesium oil and you’ll have a soft, fragrant lotion to massage onto your skin. Here are some additional recipes you can try making at home from TheModestMomBlog and RadiantLifeCatalog. It takes about 20-30 minutes for any lotion to completely absorb into your skin, so if after that time you’d like to rub the lotion off with a wet cloth, feel free to. If you’re brave, you can also choose to use pure magnesium oil as a body lotion. But be warned, many people find it a mildly irritating, while very few find it super soothing. 3. Go For a Swim…In The Sea! All major oceans are a natural source of magnesium. In fact, sixty-five percent of the magnesium in the world is contained in sea water. If you live close to one, luxuriate in the water as long as you want and feel the mineral seep through your skin to revitalize your cells. 4. Improve Absorption With Key Nutrients Your magnesium levels aren’t just dependent on how much of the mineral you take in. Other materials in the body are required to properly process it. To help boost your levels, ensure that you’re getting enough of these nutrients: Vitamin D3 Vitamin B1 (thiamine) Selenium (can be found in brazil nuts) Vitamin E (can be found in avocado) Vitamin B6 That’s only one side of the story, though: like it or not, there’s a host of products you’ll want to avoid if you’re serious about maintaining healthy magnesium levels. The list includes foods high in sugar, gluten, and alcohol. The bottom line: avoid anything that is overly refined, processed or sweetened and stick with real food. 5. Epsom Salt Baths Basking in nutrient-infused water is both physically soothing and chemically strengthening. Add a dash of magnesium flakes to your next hot bath and relax. Epsom salt baths are a sweet alternative to magnesium flakes, and they’re fun to float in. 6. Don’t Let Stress Take Over Magnesium is the 4th most abundant mineral in your body and is the most critical mineral of all for coping with stress. That’s why, when you’re constantly stressed, you can become magnesium deficient even if you eat the right foods regularly. To prevent this from happening try meditating or coloring books. Bottom Line An often overlooked bodily necessity, magnesium is essential to all facets of your health. Promote the health of your mind, heart and body by consuming enough of it every day. You may feel a sudden surge in your energy levels, or the feeling of being cleansed from within. Activities that promote healthy magnesium levels also promote overall health—so you have every reason to go home and test out what you’ve learned.",3,0.39853686,-0.046440914,False

https://dailyhealthpost.com/magnesium-for-your-heart/,7 Unique Benefits of Magnesium for Your Heart,0,"You’ve probably heard of people taking magnesium for sleep, anxiety, and constipation. But did you know it’s one of the most essential minerals for your heart? Magnesium is so important that many cardiologists recommend this vital mineral as part of a holistic approach to cardiovascular wellness. Today, we’ll explore seven unique benefits of magnesium for your heart – from regulating heartbeat to reducing inflammation and boosting energy production. We’ll also reveal the best magnesium supplement you can take to maximize health benefits. So, make sure to watch till the end. As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare provider about any changes to your health regimen. First, it’s important to understand what happens to your body when you have a magnesium deficiency. Magnesium is an often overlooked mineral that quietly performs hundreds of vital jobs to keep your body running smoothly. Every organ in your body needs magnesium. It contributes to muscle and nerve function, regulates blood sugar, and supports bone health, among many other functions. One study published in the journal Atherosclerosis found that people with low magnesium levels were more than twice as likely to die of heart disease. They were also more than seven times as likely to die from all causes. Despite its importance, it has been estimated that 50-80% of the population is deficient in magnesium without knowing it. This deficiency could be caused by gastrointestinal disorders, kidney disease, medications, and poor diet. However, a major contributing factor is the depletion of minerals in the soil due to modern farming practices So, how do you know if your body is low in magnesium? The first symptoms of magnesium deficiency can be subtle and may include leg cramps, foot pain, or muscle twitches. Other early signs are loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. As magnesium deficiency worsens, numbness, tingling, seizures, personality changes, abnormal heart rhythms, and coronary spasms can occur. If you do a blood test for magnesium levels, be aware that it may not accurately reflect the total body store of this mineral. This is because only 1% of magnesium circulates in the blood, while the rest is stored in the bones and muscles. Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video. Now, let’s look at magnesium’s multifaceted benefits for your heart: Number 7. Maintain a Normal Heart Rhythm. Your heart is like a drum – constantly beating out a steady rhythm. But what keeps it on tempo? Magnesium plays a key role. Magnesium is like a conductor, making sure the electrical signals move smoothly through the heart’s muscle cells. It ensures each beat happens on cue. Without enough magnesium, the heart’s rhythm can go haywire. Irregular heartbeats like atrial fibrillation can occur. The heart may start racing out of control in a condition called tachycardia, when the heart rate is dangerously fast at more than 100 beats per minute. Magnesium regulates levels of calcium, sodium and potassium. All these electrolytes must be balanced for the heart’s electrical system to function properly. Simply put, getting enough magnesium helps maintain a healthy heart rhythm and prevent issues. Number 6. Support Healthy Blood Pressure. Magnesium plays a vital role in maintaining healthy blood pressure. This essential mineral helps your blood vessels relax, allowing them to widen and support proper blood flow. One study found that consuming 500-1000 mg of magnesium per day could lower systolic pressure by up to 5.6 points and diastolic pressure by up to 2.8 points. On the flip side, a magnesium deficiency can lead to vasoconstriction, where blood vessels tighten, making it harder for blood to flow freely and potentially elevating blood pressure. Magnesium works in several ways to lower blood pressure: Boosting Endothelial Health: Magnesium improves the health of your endothelium, the thin inner lining of your heart and arteries. This helps increase the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that supports vasodilation, the relaxation of blood vessels, and ultimately lowers blood pressure. Acting as a Natural Calcium Channel Blocker: Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker, relaxing the heart and blood vessels, thereby lowering blood pressure. Relieving Depression and Anxiety: Magnesium can alleviate depression and anxiety which can throw the nervous system out of balance, increase sympathetic activation, and drive up blood pressure. Reducing Inflammation and Oxidative Stress: This will be discussed next. Number 5. Reduce Inflammation. Magnesium plays a crucial role in supporting your immune system and maintaining low levels of inflammation. Inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), have been linked to high blood pressure. Chronic inflammation is closely tied to heart disease. A multitude of studies have highlighted the effectiveness of magnesium in reducing CRP levels. Think of magnesium as your body’s peacekeeper, quelling internal flare-ups and protecting your cardiovascular system. Magnesium also reduces inflammation by helping with insomnia. Low magnesium levels may be the culprit behind sleep difficulties, and getting enough magnesium can relax the nervous system and support restful sleep. Better sleep leads to less inflammation, a well-regulated nervous system, and lower blood pressure. Number 4. Decrease Oxidative Stress. Magnesium has powerful antioxidant properties that helps battle oxidative stress in your body. This stress is like rust, targeting your heart and the intricate network of vessels that nourish it. If left unchecked, it can pave the way for many cardiovascular complications, including plaque buildup in the arteries and constriction of the blood vessels. Acting as a protective shield, magnesium neutralizes harmful free radicals that drive oxidative stress. This process can be likened to giving your heart a suit of armor, safeguarding it from potential threats, and ensuring it beats strong and healthy. Number 3. Reduces Risk of Clogged Arteries. Atherosclerosis, also known as clogged arteries, is a silent and sinister threat to your cardiovascular health. It can lead to heart attack or stroke. Magnesium helps maintain the smooth flow of your circulatory system and protects against the buildup of arterial blockages. Number 2. Supports Heart Muscle Function. Your heart is the most critical muscle in your body. It requires magnesium to relax and contract properly. This mineral aids in transmitting muscle impulses so your heart can pump blood more efficiently throughout your body. Number 1. Increases Energy Production. Your heart is working nonstop, and it requires a continuous energy source in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to function optimally. Magnesium plays a crucial role in the production of ATP, ensuring that your heart has the energy it needs. Now that we’ve covered the benefits of magnesium for your heart, let’s look at how you can get magnesium from foods and supplements. First, here’s a list of top foods chock-full of this vital mineral: Spinach, Pumpkin Seeds, Almonds, Artichokes, Avocado, Tuna, Salmon, Zucchini, Sweet Potatoes, and Dark Chocolate. However, in reality, it’s difficult for an adult to get 400 mg of magnesium daily from food alone, for all the reasons we mentioned earlier. So, it’s important to supplement. Next, let’s look at the 5 best magnesium supplements for your heart and overall health. Magnesium Citrate: This is an easily absorbed form that is commonly used to treat constipation, heartburn and indigestion. One study found that magnesium citrate can help improve arterial stiffness in healthy overweight individuals. Magnesium Malate: Some people believe this is the most bioavailable form of magnesium. It helps with energy production at the cellular level, so is often preferred by individuals experiencing fatigue or muscle pain. Magnesium malate is naturally found in fruits, which is why it often has a “tart taste”. It also helps alleviate migraines, chronic pain, and depression. Magnesium Taurate: A combination of magnesium and the amino acid taurine, this form is particularly recommended for heart health. Taurine offers cardiovascular benefits of its own, and when combined with magnesium, the duo can be particularly effective for supporting healthy muscle function, improving circulation, and helping to maintain a regular heart rhythm. Magnesium Bisglycinate: Also known as Magnesium Bisglycinate Chelate, this is a form of magnesium where the mineral is chelated, or bound, to two molecules of the amino acid glycine. This chelation process enhances magnesium absorption in your body, making it one of the most bioavailable forms. Magnesium Orotate: This highly bioavailable form is derived from orotic acid and is known for its ability to support heart tissue health and improve overall heart performance. This makes it a popular choice for individuals with heart disease, those who have had a heart attack or heart surgery, and athletes seeking enhanced recovery, energy, and performance. Magnesium orotate is believed to be the best form for improving metabolism. Now, instead of wondering which type of magnesium will best suit your needs, wouldn’t it be great if you could get all five types in one supplement? This way you can maximize the health benefits for your heart, brain, digestion, bones and muscles. After doing a lot of research online, we finally found one supplement that offers all five forms of magnesium scientifically formulated in the right ratios. Click the link below to learn more.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/stop-calcium-plaque-in-your-heart-arteries/,8 Ways To Stop Calcium Plaque In Your Heart Arteries,0,"Welcome to our video on the 8 Ways To Stop Calcium Plaque In Your Heart Arteries. The blood vessels that wrap around the outside of your heart, covering it like a crown, are called coronary arteries. They deliver a continuous supply of oxygen and nutrients to your heart muscle so it can pump blood effectively to the rest of your body. Excess calcium commonly builds up in the coronary arteries as you age. Coronary calcification is widespread; calcium deposits are found in 67% of women and 90% of men over 70. Contrary to popular belief, coronary artery disease (CAD) is not a result of consuming saturated animal fats or dietary cholesterol. Instead, coronary calcification, the root of CAD, is a symptom of inflammation and repair in your arteries. Calcium, the most abundant mineral in your body, usually resides within your teeth and bones. However, calcium can start depositing elsewhere as you age, including in your arteries. Calcification starts early in the development of atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease that causes your arteries to harden and narrow. Over time, as calcium accumulates in the fatty deposits called plaque, reduced blood flow may cause chest pain or tightness (angina), shortness of breath, and extreme fatigue. However, more often than not, calcification goes undetected and has no symptoms until a blood clot cuts off the blood flow entirely and causes a heart attack or stroke. Now, calcification is not random; it is found in all patients with documented CAD. The good news is you can rewrite your heart’s story by addressing the inflammation in your body. Here are eight ways to reverse coronary calcification, backed by the synergy of modern science and timeless wisdom. As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare provider about any changes to your health regimen. So, we start with Number 8. “Avoid Inflammatory Foods.” Say goodbye to inflammation-inducing foods in your diet. These offenders, including vegetable oils, trans fats, refined sugars, GMOs, and gluten, can cause a low-grade inflammatory response in your body, contributing to coronary calcification. Instead, focus on anti-inflammatory, heart-healthy foods that can help combat inflammation. Consume whole foods rich in vitamin K2, magnesium, and vitamin D. This powerful trio can help counteract nutritional deficiencies linked to coronary calcification. Picture a plate filled with vibrant, organic leafy greens, nutritious nuts from nature, and wild-caught fish from the ocean’s depths. Remember to include grass-fed and pasture-raised meats; they are nutrient-dense sources of these vitamins. Click the link below to get your FREE anti-inflammatory diet plan. Next, we have Number 7. “Practise Fasting.” When you eat food, your body breaks it down into fuel that provides energy for essential organs like your brain, heart, lungs, and liver. During fasting, your body looks for alternative energy sources, leading to ketosis. In ketosis, your body uses ketones from fat as its primary fuel source instead of glucose from carbohydrates. Fasting and ketogenic diets help reduce oxidation, inflammation, and insulin resistance, three factors that contribute to artery calcification. As you fast, your fat stores decrease, and your body may slowly and naturally break down coronary plaque for fuel. Fasting can also increase apoptosis and autophagy, which help clear damaged cells and plaques in arteries. Some fasting protocols that may help prevent coronary calcification include intermittent fasting, alternate-day fasting, 24-hour fasting, and 72-hour fasting periods. Consider consulting a healthcare professional before starting any extended fasting regimen. Moving on, we have Number 6. “Get Regular Exercise.” Staying active is essential for a healthy heart, but it’s all about finding the right balance. Moderate exercise can help slow down the hardening of heart arteries, but very high-intensity workouts may speed it up. Don’t let this discourage you from being active, though. Studies reveal a sedentary lifestyle promotes heart artery hardening by lowering body metabolism and increasing inflammation. For most individuals, the cardiovascular benefits of exercise far outweigh any potential risks. Whether you take a leisurely walk in the park or a lively dance class, every move you make is a step towards a healthier heart. Next, at Number 5, we have “Get Enough Sunlight.” Did you know that soaking up the sun’s rays could benefit your heart? Turns out, sunlight does way more than feel nice your skin. It helps your body make optimal vitamin D crucial for preventing coronary calcification. Vitamin D keeps inflammation in check. Not getting enough can cause inflammation to spiral out of control and speed up calcification. Despite its importance, an estimated 42% of people in the US struggle with vitamin D deficiency, mainly due to spending too much time cooped up indoors and slathering on sunscreen when outside. Besides helping with vitamin D production, sunlight also stimulates the creation of nitric oxide, a compound that widens blood vessels. When the body has enough nitric oxide, blood flows freely and quickly, thus preventing calcification. Diabetes and insulin resistance can cause clogged arteries by blocking nitric oxide production. You can increase nitric oxide by spending more time in the sun. Coming up next is Number 4. “Reduce Toxins.” We are constantly exposed to harmful substances such as air pollution, pesticides, mold, heavy metals, and chemicals in everyday products. These toxins can disrupt your body’s balance and contribute to coronary calcification. Choose organic food and avoid items susceptible to mold mycotoxins. Replace chemical-heavy cleaners and beauty products with natural alternatives. By making these changes, you can reduce exposure to harmful substances and support your body’s natural detoxification processes, ultimately promoting better heart health. In the top 3, we have Number 3. “Reduce Stress.” When stress invades your life, it triggers a series of biological changes, such as increased blood pressure and a fight-or-flight response, which leads to a surge in hormones like cortisol. Chronic stress leads to inflammation, a significant contributor to calcification. Studies show that reducing stress can help stop or slow the progression of coronary artery calcification by lowering cortisol levels and blood pressure. Moving on next, Number 2 is “Sleep More.” Getting enough quality sleep is critical for heart health. Multiple studies have found strong links between insufficient sleep and increased risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, and other cardiovascular problems. A 2008 study from the University of Chicago found that people who slept less than 5 hours per night were over twice as likely to develop coronary artery calcification over five years compared to those sleeping 7 to 8 hours per night. The researchers concluded that getting just one extra hour of sleep per night could significantly reduce heart disease risk, with benefits comparable to a significant drop in blood pressure. And at Number 1, we have “Supplement As Needed.” Due to depleted soils and chemical agriculture, it’s increasingly more difficult to obtain all the essential nutrients your body needs from food alone. Here are six essential nutrients that combat calcification and CAD, along with their food options. Omega-3 Fatty Acids. Statins do not prevent coronary calcification, but eating seafood does. A recent study showed that omega-3 fatty acids from seafood help to prevent coronary calcification and plaque progression. According to this study, a high omega-3 index predicts a low heart attack risk in people with coronary calcification. Wild-caught fatty fish top the list of omega-3 foods you can eat. They are loaded with omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) that support the heart by decreasing inflammation, lowering triglycerides, preventing blood clots, and maintaining healthy blood pressure. The best seafood choices for Omega-3s are salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, anchovies, oysters, and mussels. If you plan to supplement, take a look at the high-quality fish oil below. Vitamin K2. Clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that vitamin K2, especially in the form of MK-7, can help slow down the development and progression of coronary artery calcification. Vitamin K2 activates a protein called MGP, which prevents calcium buildup in blood vessel walls and pushes the calcium to your bones where needed! Fermented foods reign supreme when it comes to vitamin K2. Bacteria produce it during fermentation, so foods like natto (fermented soybeans), sauerkraut, kefir, and cheeses like gouda, brie, and cheddar pack a punch when it comes to K2. Two other excellent choices are grass-fed butter and pastured egg yolks. When choosing a supplement, opt for the MK-7 form of K2, as it stays in your bloodstream longer, providing more benefits to your heart health. CoQ10 CoQ10 does two critical things. It sparks energy production in your body’s cells, including your heart. Plus, it scavenges and destroys free radicals that cause cardiovascular problems and heart disease. Fueling your body with CoQ10 is one of the most important things you can do for your heart. CoQ10 is an antioxidant. It helps prevent artery calcification by reducing the oxidation of LDL cholesterol. It also regenerates nitric oxide to improve blood flow. The bioavailable form of CoQ10 is Ubiquinol, which provides eight times more absorption and works better for people over 45. For a supplement that combines ubiquinol with vitamin K2, see the link below. Vitamin D. Vitamin D helps increase the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the intestines. There are a few decent food sources of vitamin D: fatty fish, cod liver oil, pastured egg yolks, mushrooms exposed to UV light, beef liver, and fortified foods. When supplementing, take vitamin D3 with vitamin K2. Multiple studies have shown that taking MK-7 plus vitamin D over six months to 2 years slows artery calcification more than vitamin D alone. B Vitamins. Homocysteine is a double-edged amino acid that plays a crucial role in building proteins but can be harmful when levels become too high. Eating protein-rich foods like meats, seafood, dairy, eggs, sesame seeds, and Brazil nuts converts the amino acid methionine to homocysteine. B vitamins, specifically B12, B6, and B9 or folate, help regulate homocysteine levels by breaking it down into other beneficial substances, leaving only a trace in the bloodstream. High homocysteine levels can cause significant damage to arterial walls. It can also trigger excessive clotting, obstructing blood flow to critical body areas and potentially leading to heart attacks, accelerated dementia, and strokes. To consume all three, B12, B6, and folate, in foods, choose beef liver, salmon, pastured eggs, grass-fed milk and yogurt, fortified cereals, lentils, spinach, asparagus, and avocado. When supplementing, choose a liposomal B complex for better absorption. Magnesium. Magnesium is vital in various bodily functions, including muscle and nerve function, blood pressure regulation, and bone health. Up to 80% of adults are not getting enough magnesium because it’s depleted in the soil. This can be serious, because your heart cannot function properly without adequate magnesium. Magnesium prevents muscle spasms of the heart arteries, which increases the risk of high blood pressure and heart attack. Together with vitamins K2 and D3, magnesium stops calcium from forming inside the plaque. Higher magnesium intake has been associated with reduced markers of calcium plaque in the arteries. There are many forms of magnesium. Get 7 types of magnesium in one supplement at the link below. There you have it! Eight ways to stop calcium plaque in your heart and arteries.

https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20240220/cm/respiratory-virus-levels-remain-high-cdc-says,"Respiratory Virus Levels Remain High, CDC Says",1,"Feb. 20, 2024 -- Respiratory virus levels remain high, although the worst of this winter seems to have passed, the CDC says. Numbers have been declining in recent weeks, with flu hospitalization rates falling to about half of what they were in December, according to data from the CDC. Hospitalization rates for COVID-19 were about a third lower. “While the respiratory virus season is likely past its peak, it is definitely not over,” the agency wrote Friday. “There is still a lot of respiratory virus activity, so it’s not time to let our guard down.” The CDC said this season’s peak in “combined COVID-19, flu, and RSV hospitalizations” was not as high as last year’s. The healthcare system wasn’t burdened as much, and cumulative hospitalizations from COVID-19 and flu are lower. About half of Americans have received a flu shot this season, the CDC says. About 22% of adults and 12% of children have had the latest Covid-19 shot. “COVID-19 activity remains high, and getting vaccinated can protect you from severe illness, hospitalization, and death,” the CDC said. “Significant” flu activity can last through May. In addition to vaccinations, the CDC recommends masking, physical distancing, handwashing, and improving airflow to help slow the spread of respiratory viruses. Early testing can help bring needed treatment. CNN noted, “Covid-19 viral levels in wastewater remain high in the US – especially in the South, where levels are twice as high as the rest of the country. Despite the improvements, thousands of people are still being hospitalized with Covid-19: more than 21,000 people during the week ending on February 10, according to the CDC. The latest data from the CDC on Covid-19 deaths is incomplete, but it estimates that there were at least 650 deaths during the week ending February 10.”",4,-0.35896286,0.36427164,False

https://dailyhealthpost.com/different-types-of-magnesium-supplement/,You’ve Been Taking The Wrong Type of Magnesium All This Time,0,"Magnesium is a mineral essential for human health yet it doesn’t get the press it should. For example, magnesium is more important for bone health than calcium, for without it, calcium isn’t absorbed by bone cells. The fourth most plentiful mineral on the planet, magnesium is necessary for virtually every process in the human body, including creating DNA and proteins; regulating blood pressure and sugar levels; muscle, nerve, and brain function; and maintaining an active immune system. (Updated Sep 6, 2023) Without enough magnesium, your body can’t produce the energy to do all the things you want and need it to do. Chronic magnesium deficiency can manifest in any health malady, including: fibromyalgia, restless leg syndrome, high blood pressure, memory loss, asthma, tremors, insomnia, depression, chronic fatigue, osteoporosis, heart arrhythmia, and kidney stones. The World Health Organization has estimated that seventy-five percent of Americans don’t get enough magnesium in their diets. (1) The reasons why we may not be getting enough magnesium in our diets are many: Immunological conditions like Chron’s disease and irritable bowel syndrome place a huge burden on the body as every cell is fighting or its life—literally. Proton pump inhibitors are a type of drug used to treat gastrointestinal issues like ulcers, acid reflux, and heartburn—many are over-the-counter and are greatly over-used. These work by blocking normal cell activity, thereby keeping magnesium from penetrating cells. (2) Chronic stress Use of diuretics Medications: corticosteroids, insulin, antibiotics Too much salt Too much coffee, soda, or alcohol Not enough magnesium-rich foods C. Norman Sheal, MD, PhD is a neurosurgeon and pain management expert. He has this to say about magnesium deficiency: “Every known illness is associated with a magnesium deficiency…magnesium is the most critical mineral required for electrical stability of every cell in the body. A magnesium deficiency may be responsible for more diseases than any other nutrient .“ (3) Magnesium’s importance, therefore, can’t be over-emphasized but very few people recognize it. Seven Different Types of Magnesium There are seven different types of magnesium, in the sense that when combined with other compounds, the magnesium behaves differently to fulfill its different roles in the body. The bioavailability of magnesium is rather low; it’s meant to work together with other substances. Below are magnesium compounds to consider for supplementing to optimize cell health and activity. Please be advised that most supplements are synthetic and not exactly like the minerals found naturally in the body. Deriving added magnesium from a swim in the ocean, an Epsom salt bath, and food sources are always preferable. Magnesium Aspartate – (not to be confused with “aspartame”!) one of the most bioavailable forms of magnesium, it is bound to asparitic acid (an amino acid) and stays in the blood—unlike some other forms of magnesium that are readily eliminated through waste. This compound can help boost general energy level, brain and muscle performance, and prevent muscle cramps and fatigue. Magnesium Citrate – used for stool softening and to prevent kidney stones, this form is derived from citric acid and is highly bioavailable. Magnesium Glycinate – glycinate is another amino acid chelated (bonded) with magnesium; it easily passes through intestinal barriers and is therefore highly absorbable and well tolerated. Taking with a meal will help avoid any potential side effects like upset stomach or diarrhea. May help alleviate insomnia. Magnesium Malate – when bound to malic acid (a fruit acid), magnesium improves energy metabolism, easing muscle pain such as experienced with fibromyalgia. (4) Magnesium Orotate – orotic acid is an enzyme that may foster heart health, however, as a magnesium supplement it may not be optimal. (5) Consumer Lab, an independent laboratory for health and nutrition products, warns: “Magnesium orotate is not the best choice as a magnesium supplement and despite preliminary evidence of a benefit for people with heart disease, there is also evidence suggesting a potential safety concern at around the high dosage used for that purpose. Until more is known about the potential benefits and risks, it may be best not to use magnesium orotate.” (6) The European Food Safety Authority had similar concerns: “The Panel concludes that in the light of the tumour-promoting effect of orotic acid in animal experimentation, the small margin of safety to this effect from foreseeable exposure, and the absence of any relevant studies on genotoxicity and of any developmental studies, the use of orotate as a source of the eight other minerals [including magnesium] and choline at the proposed levels of use is of safety concern.” (7) Magnesium Taurate – good for brain and nervous system support, heart and mental health, easily absorbed and tolerated by the digestive system, taurine is a beta amino acid that, when paired with magnesium, enables easy movement through cell walls. (8) A beta amino acid is one that doesn’t create proteins and is highly adaptive as a nutrient carrier. Taurine delivers magnesium to a cell, which penetrates and stays inside while calcium stays outside the cell. The magnesium is therefore where it needs to be. Taurine itself has antioxidant properties and like magnesium, adapts to different roles in different types of cells (e.g., liver, pancreas, heart). Magnesium taurate causes diarrhea for some, so begin with a small dose and take with food. (9) Magnesium-L Threonate – improves memory and brain function and eases anxiety, with implications for treating neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s. (10)",3,0.36520436,0.012833104,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/neuropathy-remedies/,Top 6 Neuropathy Remedies (Peripheral Neuropathy Home Remedies),0,"Let’s talk about the best natural remedies to treat neuropathic pain, including peripheral neuropathy. Once you have experienced the torment of neuropathy, you’ll never forget it. The weakness, pain, and numbness caused by this condition are truly like no other. So, what exactly is neuropathy? It occurs when one or more of your nerves are diseased or malfunctioning. The most prevalent type, peripheral neuropathy, affects your hands, feet, arms, and legs. Normally, your peripheral nerves transmit messages from your brain and spinal cord to different parts of your body. However, when neuropathy damages these nerves, the messages get intercepted. This alters the way your body responds to pain, temperature changes, and various other factors. If you suffer from chronic neuropathic pain, these symptoms can flare up unexpectedly, without any clear cause. One of the leading causes of neuropathy is disease, particularly diabetes, which accounts for 30% of cases. Other causes include cancer treatment, infections, amputations, injuries, and long-term, excessive alcohol consumption. Surprisingly, neuropathy is more common than you think. Approximately one in three people in the United States deal with chronic pain, with 20% of them experiencing neuropathic pain. A 2014 study estimated that up to 10% of all Americans have some form of neuropathic pain. It’s certainly a challenging condition to live with, but thankfully, there are natural ways to treat and reverse it… Before we dive into natural treatment options, let’s explore the symptoms of neuropathy. While each person’s experience may vary, some common symptoms include: Tingling, numbness, and “pins and needles”. Burning, stabbing, or shooting pain. Sudden pain without an obvious trigger. Sensitivity to typically non-painful situations (such as cold weather or brushing hair). Difficult-to-describe and unpleasant sensations. Sleep disturbances. And emotional toll from living with chronic pain, sleep deprivation, and difficulty articulating symptoms. Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video. Now, there are different types of neuropathy, depending on which nerves are damaged. Here are seven of the most common ones… Peripheral Neuropathy This is the most prevalent form of neuropathy and results from damage to the peripheral nervous system. This condition predominantly affects the nerves in your hands, feet, arms, and legs. If you have peripheral neuropathy, you may also notice a gradual onset of numbness starting in your hands and spreading to your arms and legs. Charcot’s Joint This is also referred to as neuropathic arthropathy, a condition where a joint deteriorates as a result of nerve-related issues. Typically affecting the foot, individuals with Charcot’s Joint often experience a significant loss of sensation in their feet. On top of that, the muscles are unable to adequately support the joint, leading to difficulties in walking. Individuals with pre-existing neuropathy are particularly susceptible to this condition. Compression Mononeuropathy This is a relatively common type of neuropathy. It occurs when a single nerve is damaged, resulting in numbness and swelling. One example that most people are familiar with is carpal tunnel syndrome. Femoral Neuropathy Most cases of femoral neuropathy, or femoral nerve dysfunction, occur in people who have type 2 diabetes. It affects the legs, causing pain and muscle weakness in the thighs, and potentially down to the feet. Unilateral Foot Drop This is a condition that occurs as a result of damage to the peroneal nerve in the leg. This nerve controls the muscles responsible for lifting the foot; so people with this condition are unable to raise the affected foot. Focal Neuropathy This condition is characterized by sudden weakness or pain that can impact a single nerve or a cluster of nerves. It may lead to double vision, pain in specific body parts like the thigh, or even result in Bell’s palsy—a form of partial facial paralysis. Cranial Neuropathy This affects the 12 sets of nerves that connect to the brain and play a crucial role in sight, hearing, eye movement, and taste. It can lead to the paralysis of eye muscles, resulting in double vision. There are various types of cranial neuropathies, including Bell’s palsy, microvascular cranial nerve palsy, third nerve palsy, fourth nerve palsy, sixth nerve palsy, and multiple cranial neuropathies (MCN). Next, if you’re looking to reverse neuropathy, here are 6 home remedies to try… At Number 6, we have, “Socks for Neuropathy”. Peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes can leave your feet vulnerable to unexpected everyday damage. Due to reduced sensation, you might not even feel the pain if a small object gets stuck in your shoe or if you step on something sharp. This puts you at risk of foot injuries and developing ulcers without realizing it. Fortunately, diabetic socks offer a solution. These specially designed socks not only help mitigate the risks but also ensure your feet stay dry, comfortable, and well-ventilated. With seamless construction, they minimize friction and prevent potential damage. Plus, the breathable moisture-wicking fabric helps ward off infections, while the added padding provides extra protection. Wearing diabetic socks can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with neuropathy. However, if you also have poor circulation in your feet, it’s crucial to select socks that fit snugly without rubbing against your skin while still allowing proper airflow. Pair your diabetic socks with comfortable shoes that are not too tight. Next up, we have Number 5. “Supplements for Neuropathy”. When it comes to managing neuropathy and its symptoms, anti-inflammatory supplements like krill oil can be incredibly beneficial. Packed with omega-3 fatty acids, krill oil not only helps alleviate neuropathic pain but also promotes neuron growth. But that’s not all – krill oil offers a wide range of benefits; it protects your brain, balances blood sugar and improves blood lipids. Moreover, for those suffering from neuropathy caused by autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, krill oil’s anti-inflammatory effects can provide relief for the root symptoms of the disease itself. You can reap the amazing benefits of krill oil and its powerful omega-3s, by making this supplement a part of your daily routine. If you are taking fish oil, you may be wondering why we recommend krill oil; there are two main reasons. One, the Omega-3 fatty acids in krill oil are in the form of phospholipids, which are better absorbed by your body’s cells than the triglycerides in fish oil. Two, krill oil contains a powerful antioxidant called astaxanthin which helps protect your body against oxidative damage and enhances the absorption of anti-inflammatory Omega-3s. To see our recommended wild-caught Antarctic krill oil supplement, click the link below. To learn about other nutrients for neuropathy, see our video, “The Best Vitamins for Your Nerves“. Moving on, we have Number 4. “Herbs for Neuropathy”. Curcumin, the powerful compound found in turmeric, holds great promise in providing relief for neuropathy. It exhibits remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, making it an ideal herb for soothing numbness and tingling in your feet or hands. Interestingly, a groundbreaking 2013 study discovered that consumption of curcumin in the early stages of neuropathy may prevent chronic neuropathic pain. Moreover, a 2014 animal study showcased the potential of curcumin in alleviating symptoms of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. If you choose to take curcumin as a supplement, find one with enhanced bioavailability, such as the one we recommend. This means your body can absorb curcumin more effectively and reap its maximum benefits; click the link below to learn more. In the top 3, we have Number 3. “Acupuncture for Neuropathy”. Acupuncture, a key treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), involves the gentle insertion of thin needles at precise points on the body’s surface, to activate the body’s innate healing response. This technique offers a multitude of benefits, including the management of neuropathic pain. By stimulating the release of endorphins, acupuncture induces a positive, pain-relieving feeling throughout the body. Scientific research has consistently shown that acupuncture is highly effective in alleviating neuropathic pain. It provides a gentle and holistic alternative to medication, without any side effects. Moreover, this treatment can also safeguard your nerves from potential future damage. Moving to Number 2, we have, “Essential Oils for Neuropathy”. Research has suggested that certain essential oils can be beneficial in managing nerve pain. Let’s explore a few options: Peppermint oil: Known for its soothing properties, peppermint oil can help alleviate muscle discomfort and relieve pain. In a study, patients reported immediate pain relief when applying this oil topically. Roman chamomile: This essential oil is believed to have muscle-calming effects, potentially offering relief for inflammatory disorders. Lavender: Not only does lavender oil possess muscle-relaxing properties, but it may also aid in reducing stress and promoting relaxation. Moreover, blending multiple essential oils can provide additional relief for neuropathy. A 2010 study found that a combination of geranium, bergamot, lavender, eucalyptus, and tea tree oils provided pain relief for some participants. If you plan to try essential oils at home, remember to dilute them with a carrier oil like coconut or olive oil before applying them to your skin. This will ensure safety and effectiveness. In addition to topical applications, diffusing relaxing oils in the air can also help alleviate the anxiety and fatigue associated with chronic pain. But do note that some essential oils may not be safe to diffuse around pets. And at Number 1, we have, “Exercise for Neuropathy”. Regular physical activity, particularly aerobics and stretching exercises, has been shown to effectively reduce the intensity of neuropathic pain. In addition to slowing nerve damage and improving circulation, exercise can serve as a valuable outlet for managing the stress associated with chronic conditions.

https://www.webmd.com/women/news/20240201/cm/researchers-find-link-pcos-midlife-cognitive-decline,Researchers Find Link Between PCOS and Midlife Cognitive Decline,1,"Feb. 1, 2024 – A common condition called polycystic ovary syndrome that causes irregular menstrual cycles has been linked to signs of early cognitive decline. Known as PCOS, the condition may affect more than 1 in 10 women, and is among the most common causes of infertility. In addition to ovulation problems, PCOS can cause excess hair growth on the face and the other parts of the body, as well as abnormal growths on the ovaries. Women with PCOS are at a particularly heightened risk of getting type 2 diabetes, as well as other serious health conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, cholesterol problems, and sleep apnea, particularly if the women are overweight. This latest study looked for possible links between PCOS and brain health in women once they were in their late 40s or older. “Our results suggest that people with this condition have lower memory and thinking skills and subtle brain changes at midlife,” lead author Heather G. Huddleston, MD, of the University of California, San Francisco, and director of the PCOS clinic at UCSF Health, said in a statement. “This could impact a person on many levels, including quality of life, career success and financial security.” Specifically, women with a median age of 55 years old who also reported PCOS symptoms scored lower on cognitive tests commonly used to gauge brain health, like the ability to recall 15 unrelated words. The researchers also found that women with PCOS symptoms had changes in white matter of their brains based on magnetic resonance imaging, and the changes could be a sign of early brain aging. The findings were published in this month’s edition of the journal Neurology. The research study did not show that PCOS causes cognitive decline, but instead found consistent links between the two conditions. The 907 women in the study ranged from 18 to 30 years old at the start of the study and were followed for 3 decades. At the end of the 30-year study period, the women took tests evaluating memory, verbal abilities, attention, and processing speed, which is the time it takes to do a mental task. The researchers compared the results among women without PCOS to the 66 women in the study who likely had PCOS based on their reported symptoms or because they had a common PCOS condition of high levels of androgens, which are a type of hormone. Women with PCOS symptoms scored about 11% lower on the attention test, which required them to look at a list of words in different colors and then say the color of the ink, rather than read the actual word. The women with PCOS symptoms also scored lower on memory and verbal ability tests. The researchers cautioned that a limitation of the study was that the women in the PCOS group didn’t necessarily have a medical diagnosis of PCOS. “Additional research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine how this change occurs, including looking at changes that people can make to reduce their chances of thinking and memory problems,” Huddleston said. “Making changes like incorporating more cardiovascular exercise and improving mental health may serve to also improve brain aging for this population.”",7,0.18971014,0.022879481,False
https://www.webmd.com/children/news/20240130/cm/measles-warning-signs-growing,Measles Warning Signs Growing: How Concerned Should We Be?,1,"Jan. 30, 2024 – It may be reassuring to think that serious measles outbreaks are a problem we conquered in the past or something that only affects people over there – like in Europe, which last year reported 42,200 cases. But complacency here in the United States could come at a price, experts said. While measles was considered officially wiped out here in 2000, sporadic, clustered outbreaks continue to pop up. Most notably, measles hit New York City in 2019, central Ohio just 2 years ago, and Philadelphia starting this past December. In early January, public health experts warned travelers who passed through two Washington, DC-area airports that they may have been exposed. That highlights just how easy it is for an infected person to pass measles along to other, unvaccinated people. The recent number of cases in the U.S. prompted the CDC to issue a nationwide measles alert last week. COVID Lowered Measles Vaccinations Measles is an “immense concern,” said Gregory A. Poland, MD, founder and director of the Mayo Clinic Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, MN, and editor-in-chief of the journal Vaccine. He described measles as the “canary in the coal mine” for vaccine-preventable disease. Measles is so contagious, he added, that a person coming to an emergency room 12 hours after someone else was there with measles could contract the infection (if not immunized). “If SARS-CoV-2 were that transmissible, we’d have millions of more deaths in the U.S. by now,” Poland said. And speaking of COVID-19, the pandemic led to considerable delays in measles vaccinations. “WHO [World Health Organization] data showed that in the year up to November 2022, almost 40 million children worldwide had missed a measles vaccine dose. A historical high of 25 million children skipped their first dosage, and another 14.7 million missed their second,” according to a March 2023 report in the Annals of Medicine and Surgery (London). COVID delayed vaccinations in the United States, too. CDC data updated Jan. 12 shows that more than 61 million doses of the MMR vaccine, which contains the measles vaccine, were delayed or missed entirely from 2020 to 2022 due to COVID. “This increases the risk of bigger outbreaks around the world, including the United States,” the agency noted. At least 8,500 schools nationwide are at risk of a measles outbreak, according to a CBS News investigation that looked at vaccination rates at public and private schools in 19 states. In these instances, the vaccination rate for kindergartners falls below the 95% the CDC says is necessary to achieve herd immunity and protect entire communities. “Even though we give infants two doses, which can be up to 97% effective, there are still people who remain vulnerable,” said Adam Ratner, MD, director of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone in New York City, and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases. “The measles vaccine is amazing.” Two doses in childhood generally last a lifetime, it doesn’t need updating, and it’s been pretty much the same formula since the 1960s. Ways to get more people to take the measles and other vaccines is “really about understanding and trying to engage with different communities about what their concerns are, making vaccination easy, and educating the public,” said Krutika Kuppalli, MD, vice chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Global Health Committee. “Measles is called the inequity virus for good reason. It is the disease that will find and attack those who aren’t protected,” Kate O’Brien, director of the World Health Organization's Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, said in a November 2023 WHO news release. “Children everywhere have the right to be protected by the lifesaving measles vaccine, no matter where they live.” “The increase in measles outbreaks and deaths is staggering, but unfortunately, not unexpected given the declining vaccination rates we’ve seen in the past few years,” John Vertefeuille, director of CDC’s Global Immunization Division, said in the same release. “Measles cases anywhere pose a risk to all countries and communities where people are under-vaccinated. “Urgent, targeted efforts are critical to prevent measles disease and deaths,” Vertefeuille added. According to a joint CDC-WHO report, there were more than 136,200 global measles deaths in 2022. You have to go back to 2015 to find a measles-related death in the United States. Another challenge with controlling measles outbreaks is the incubation period. Typically, people can have measles for 10 to 14 days before they realize it. Expert Perspective Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, what happened in Europe foretold what we could expect here stateside. Is the same true for measles? We asked experts just how concerned we should be, and what, if anything, about measles keeps them awake at night. “I’m concerned. It is the most contagious virus we know of,” said William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. “It is the number one, Olympic gold virus in terms of transmission.” After eliminating measles from the Western Hemisphere, “we got lax,” said Schaffner, who is also a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “We are now two to three generations from when measles was common in the U.S. A lot of people know the name,” he said, but have never seen measles in their lifetime, including younger doctors. Back in the 1950s and early 1960s, so many children got measles that “it was familiar to parents, pediatricians, and everyone else,” Ratner said. “It’s a different story now. “We had a big outbreak in New York right before the pandemic, and for a lot of people I work with, it was their first clinical exposure to measles.” Measles, polio, and diphtheria “are things we don’t see as much. It’s really important to remind people how serious they can be,” said Kuppalli. “We should inform people, not in a fearmongering way but in an educational way.” “People do not have to panic, but every time there is a [measles] case in the U.S. or elsewhere, it is a warning sign,” Ratner added. “People should vaccinate their kids.” It’s not just measles either. Globally, there is a resurgence in other vaccine-preventable diseases, like diphtheria and pertussis. “This is not just a problem in the U.S. It’s a problem around the world,” added Kuppalli, who is also a medical officer for COVID-19 health operations in the Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention in the Health Emergencies Program at the World Health Organization. Two other things are adding to the resurgence in these diseases along with the COVID-related vaccination delays. “There has also been a rise in vaccine hesitancy because of misinformation and disinformation related to COVID vaccines – and that affects the uptake of other vaccines,” Kuppalli said. “During COVID, people were socially distant. Now, people are traveling more than ever and mixing again. A Growing Global Threat Measles cases are not just happening around the world, they are happening more often. The virus is a growing threat, especially to young children, in 37 countries around the world, according to 2022 numbers from the World Health Organization and the CDC. Those case numbers are up 18%, compared to 2021. Deaths from measles were also up 43% globally from 2021 to 2022, the same report notes. The 136,000 deaths reported in 2022 were mostly among children. In the United States, we’ve been more fortunate in terms of deaths from measles lately. For example, measles infected 649 people in New York City in a 2018-2019 outbreak and caused serious illness, but no deaths were reported. Public health officials traced the New York City cases to an unvaccinated child returning home from Israel, which was having an outbreak of its own at the time. And no deaths have been reported from measles in recent months. That means the 85 people infected in the U.S. since late 2023 survived, although 36 of them had to be hospitalized. Even though our luck has held regarding deaths, “There are only so many times we can roll the dice,” Ratner said. “There is a big outbreak in the U.K. now. It’s heartbreaking because there are so many things we cannot prevent, but this is something we can.” Globally, measles kills mostly children in one of two ways: they get measles pneumonia, “which is very difficult to treat,” Schaffner said. “We don’t have anti-measles, antiviral medications for this.” The second cause of death is rarer: measles encephalitis. Complacency Not the Only Cause Negative attitudes about vaccination overall could also add to lower immunization rates for measles. Although cases are imported and spread among the unvaccinated, Schaffner said, “What is happening more, however, is children from whom the vaccine is being withheld by their parents go abroad and bring it back home, exposing other unvaccinated children.” There are political and cultural factors involved in vaccine hesitancy, said Poland, who said he and a lot of his friends had measles as children. He has received funding over the past 30 years to study measles. About one to two people die for every 1,000 cases of measles. “This is not something that most parents think about,” Poland said. “Do they want to take that risk or get their child vaccinated?” The occasional outbreaks in communities across the U.S. remind “us once again that this pathogen is still very much alive and well,” said Jon Woltmann, MD, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at Dayton Children’s Hospital in Ohio. People planning international travel might want to discuss the best course of action with their doctor as well, he said. Asked what keeps him up at night, Ratner said, “I do worry. We are as a society complacent about measles.” The overall vaccination rates in the U.S. are pretty high and help with herd immunity. For example, among school-age kids In New York at the time of the 2019 outbreak, the vaccination rate was 95% to 96%, “which should be good enough to control an outbreak,” he added. “But what matters is not the overall rate, but the little pockets where the vaccination rate is 60% to 70%,” Ratner said. “Measles spreads incredibly well, especially within cloistered neighborhoods, which can then endanger larger communities.”",4,-0.40676636,0.19279124,False
https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20240126/cm/with-case-count-rising-cdc-issues-nationwide-measles-alert,"With Case Count Rising, CDC Issues Nationwide Measles Alert",1,"Jan. 26, 2024 – Nearly two dozen cases of measles have occurred in the U.S. in the past two months. The count has reached a tipping point and prompted the CDC to issue an alert to health care providers to be on the lookout for people with symptoms such as a rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. There have been 23 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. since Dec. 1, according to the alert, which was published in an email newsletter from the agency. Among the 23 cases, there were at least two concentrated clusters of five cases or more. Seven cases were linked to international travel. The CDC said that measles should particularly be suspected in symptomatic people who have traveled internationally recently. “Measles cases often originate from unvaccinated or undervaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally and then transmit the disease to people who are not vaccinated against measles,” the CDC alert stated. “The increased number of measles importations seen in recent weeks is reflective of a rise in global measles cases and a growing global threat from the disease.” Most of the 23 people in this latest count of infections in the U.S. were children who had not been vaccinated against measles, the CDC said. One of the outbreaks occurred in Philadelphia, where people were infected at a hospital and at a daycare, according to a summary of the U.S. cases from the Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota. The other large outbreak occurred among family members in Washington state, according to a local television news station. Cases have also been reported this month in Georgia, Missouri, and Pennsylvania. One case in New Jersey involved someone who attended a daycare. Health authorities were publicizing the possibility that people may have been exposed when the patient visited a pediatric clinic and an emergency room. In its advisory, the CDC urged health care providers to isolate people suspected of having measles, “ideally in a single-patient airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) if available, or in a private room with a closed door until an AIIR is available.” Measles is highly contagious, and the fever with it can reach as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Babies and young children are particularly at risk for severe complications. About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles is hospitalized, the CDC says, adding that pneumonia and swelling of the brain that can lead to deafness or intellectual disability are among potential severe complications. Public health officials have warned of an increasing risk of measles outbreaks recently because of the declining rate of children receiving routine vaccinations, such as the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) series of shots. The first of these is typically given around 1 year old, and the second shot is given between age 4 and 6 years old. The two-dose series is 97% effective at preventing measles, and a single dose is 93% effective, the CDC says. “We're going to start seeing more and more of these outbreaks,” CIDRAP Director Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, told USA Today. “We're going to see more kids seriously ill, hospitalized and even die. And what's so tragic about this, these are all preventable.”",4,-0.27942038,0.17072149,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/lemon-and-baking-soda-a-miraculous-cancer-fighting-combination/,Lemon and Baking Soda: A Miraculous Cancer-Fighting Combination,0,"Drinking lemon water is great, but there is a way to take it to a whole other level by adding one household ingredient. By adding a spoonful of baking soda into the mix, you can actually protect yourself against chronic inflammation and cancer. (Updated June 6, 2023) How it Works Lemons contain compounds called limonoids, which have the ability to fight breast cancer cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis (1). These compounds also work against other hormone-sensitive cancers, like cervical or ovarian cancer (2). Roughly 11 different limonoids contribute to fighting the disease, killing cells in as little as 12 hours (3). Studies have shown that consuming four or more 150-gram portions per week of citrus fruit decreased the risks of throat cancer by 58%, oral/pharyngeal cancer by 53%, stomach cancer by 31 percent, and colorectal cancer by 18%. Another study found that women who had never experienced hormone replacement therapy and consumed roughly 75 grams daily of citrus fruits experienced a 22% reduction in breast cancer risk (4). The high vitamin C content of these fruits also improves cancer survivability, fights aggressive colorectal cancers, and suppresses tumor growth. Lemon seeds, pulp, and skin contain even more antioxidants than the juice alone. Its aglycones and glucosides have chemopreventive and cytotoxic effects, but that’s not all (5). The fruit also has the ability to: Lower cholesterol Fight inflammation Kill harmful bacteria Regulate high blood pressure Combat depression and stress Detox your kidneys and liver Baking Soda, on the other hand, fights cancer by fighting inflammation and pro-cancer acidity (6,7). It serves as a buffer to alkalize the extracellular fluid in your body without harming your healthy cells. This also prevents tumors from metastasizing and protects your lymph nodes (8,9). Case studies have found that baking soda can effectively reverse late-stage prostate cancer and prevent cancer recurrence. To help prevent cancer, combine 2 teaspoons of freshly squeezed organic lemon juice and half a teaspoon of baking soda in a tall glass of water and drink it on an empty stomach before breakfast.",3,0.19883527,0.09220375,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-trigger-acid-reflux/,Here Are 8 Foods That Trigger Acid Reflux – AVOID,0,"Today, we look at the worst foods that trigger acid reflux and should be avoided. We also look at the best foods that reduce heartburn and GERD. Acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux occurs when the sphincter muscle at the lower end of your esophagus relaxes when it should not. This allows stomach acid to back up into the esophagus, resulting in heartburn and related symptoms like pain in the chest, difficulty swallowing, and regurgitation of bitter-tasting food. When the foods you eat trigger or worsen acid reflux, it is due to increased pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which causes it to malfunction and become leaky. There are two ways in which this happens: One. Bacterial overgrowth causes bloating and puts pressure on the LES. This starts with low stomach acid – usually measured in people with heartburn and GERD – creating the perfect conditions for bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and small intestine. These bacteria feed on undigested carbohydrates and produce gas that increases pressure in the stomach, causing the LES to malfunction and allow acid to enter the esophagus. Two. Other factors cause bloating and result in LES malfunction and GERD. These factors include overeating, obesity, hiatal hernia, pregnancy, reclining after eating, and eating certain trigger foods. Now that we understand what causes the LES to malfunction, let us look at the foods and drinks that trigger and worsen acid reflux and GERD in people with existing conditions. Removing these foods usually makes heartburn and other symptoms go away. It is important to note that these trigger foods do not cause reflux in those who do not suffer from it. However, the wrong combination of food and other factors can cause reflux in anyone. For example, overeating too late and consuming too much alcohol, or having a fatty meal followed by mint chocolate chip ice cream, can all trigger reflux. Let’s begin with Number 8. “Fried, Fatty & Processed Foods”. High-fat foods can contribute to acid reflux. These foods include: deep-fried food (French fries, onion rings), full-fat dairy (cheese, cow’s milk), fatty meats (fatty cuts of beef, lamb, hamburgers, bacon, hotdogs, sausages), processed snacks (beef jerky, potato chips), and other fast food (pizza, chicken nuggets), Fried and fatty foods usually contain high amounts of harmful vegetable oils, artificial trans fats, fructose, and artificial sweeteners, as well as other chemicals. These processed ingredients increase bacterial overgrowth, delay stomach emptying, and worsen reflux symptoms. Also, fatty foods stimulate the release of a hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK), which causes the LES to relax. Moreover, processed foods, such as white bread and cookies, are high in refined or simple carbs, which contribute to bacterial overgrowth and increased gas output. A study in 2022 by researchers at Vanderbilt University showed that reducing the consumption of simple carbs can reduce the frequency and severity of heartburn and other GERD symptoms. Next up, we have Number 7. “Gluten-containing Grains”. Studies show that consuming gluten-containing grains (wheat, barley, and rye) in starchy foods such as bread and pasta, as well as cereals, can lead to symptoms associated with acid reflux and GERD, especially in people with undiagnosed celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Some acid reflux sufferers find that once they remove gluten from their diets, their heartburn fades away. Moving on, we have Number 6. “Mint”. Avoid spearmint and peppermint, as both are LES-relaxing reflux triggers. This includes anything mint-flavored, such as tea, alcohol, candy, and desserts. Coming up next, we have Number 5. “Nuts”. When it comes to nuts, the recommendation for those with reflux is to choose nuts that are lower in fat and not to eat too many. According to one doctor, pistachios and walnuts are far less likely to cause reflux than peanuts, macadamia nuts, or cashew nuts. And as for almonds, they possess a property that can help reduce reflux symptoms; they are alkaline, not acidic. This may explain why some people report that eating a few raw almonds before or after a meal helps their acid reflux go away. Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video. And at Number 4, we have “Acidic Foods and Drinks”. Reports from heartburn patients show that certain acidic foods and drinks irritate the stomach lining and trigger or exacerbate acid reflux symptoms. One. Avoid soft drinks or sodas, as they are more acidic than anything found in nature. This acid damages the LES. Furthermore, they are carbonated, thus increasing stomach pressure and causing the valves to open. Two. Avoid or reduce citrus fruits and juices, such as oranges, limes, and lemons, which are high in citric acid, as they can trigger heartburn symptoms. Instead, go for low-acid, non-citrus fruits such as apples, melons, and pears. Three. Tomatoes have a lot of citric and malic acid, which can cause heartburn. Fresh tomatoes are less likely to trigger reflux compared to prepared, canned, or bottled tomato products such as ketchup, marinara sauce, and pizza. Four. Onion and garlic, especially in their raw forms, are common triggers for heartburn. These two vegetables are hard to digest because they contain fructans. So they stay in your stomach longer and make your heartburn and burping worse. You can use parsley, dill, or basil instead to give your food flavor. Five. Also, avoid vinegar such as apple cider vinegar, as these contain acetic acid and are likely to cause heartburn. Coming into our top 3, Number 3 is “Spicy Foods”. People with acid reflux, esophageal issues, and ulcers often experience heartburn more quickly and intensely when they eat spicy foods. That’s because spices like chili powder, curry, and hot peppers contain capsaicin, which slows digestion and delays stomach emptying through adverse effects on vagal nerve function, which controls the gastrointestinal tract. At the same time, these spices are often combined with other reflux-triggering foods like onions, garlic, and fatty meats. To cook with herbs that do not trigger reflux, use rosemary, basil, parsley, oregano, cumin, and turmeric. Moving on, we have Number 2. “Caffeine and Chocolate”. Chocolate is probably the single most common trigger for people with acid reflux (GERD and LPR). That’s because it contains theobromine, caffeine, and fat – three ingredients that relax the LES. Also, eating milk and dark chocolate can cause a surge of serotonin, which makes your LES relax and gastric contents rise. Next, we have coffee. For some people with reflux, drinking coffee can trigger heartburn, but this is not because of its acidity. Soda, orange juice, and wine are more acidic than coffee. Coffee triggers reflux in 2 ways: One. Some people are sensitive to coffee beans; for these people, both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee are equally bad. Two. For anyone else, drinking a high volume of caffeinated coffee, such as a pot of coffee before lunch, is going to open up any LES. For most people with reflux, drinking one or two cups of caffeinated coffee per day will not cause any symptoms. If you want a strong kick in the morning, black tea is better than coffee if you have acid reflux. However, you should limit yourself to one or two cups. Finally, soft drinks and energy drinks have levels of caffeine and acid high enough to increase the risk of reflux. And at Number 1, we have “Alcohol”. This may be the number one reflux trigger, and it is dose-related. Alcohol or ethanol is a powerful trigger for all types of acid reflux: GERD, LPR, Respiratory Reflux, and Silent Reflux. The mechanism is that alcohol directly relaxes the LES, and the more you drink, the more likely you are to have acid reflux. If you must drink, just have one. In general, wine is better than beer because there is no carbonation. Red wine is also better than whites such as Chardonnay and Champagne, as they are more acidic and carbonated. Additionally, avoid any mixed drinks or cocktails with citrus juice, seltzer, and soda, as this can cause a severe reaction. And if you must drink liquor, gin, tequila, and non-grain vodkas have the least amount of acid. Lastly, stay away from any alcoholic drink made with peppermint (peppermint white Russian), chocolate (mudslide), or coffee (Irish coffee). To recap, the reflux-trigger foods that affect a lot of people are fatty meats, fried food, fast food, high-fat cheese, processed snacks, chili powder and hot peppers, chocolate, mint, some nuts, onions, tomatoes, garlic, coffee, citrus fruits (including juice), apple cider vinegar, energy drinks, soda, and alcohol. To this list, add any other trigger foods that are unique to you; pay close attention to what you eat! Now, let’s look at the foods that are “reflux-friendly”. These foods help reduce heartburn and GERD and promote healing in the lining of the stomach and esophagus. A low-carb diet can work wonders for people with GERD or other digestive disorders. In one study of 144 obese women with GERD, a low-carb diet helped all patients completely resolve their GERD symptoms within weeks, and they discontinued their medications. In a low-carb diet, the focus is on protein-rich whole foods and vegetables. This includes foods such as: Fatty fish such as trout and salmon (preferably wild-caught). Animal protein such as lean chicken, beef, and pork (preferably grass-fed and grass-finished). Pasture-raised eggs. Fruits, such as bananas, berries, apples, pears, melons, and peaches, in moderation. Non-starchy vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus; and starchy vegetables, such as beans, peas, butternut squash, and sweet potatoes. These are usually cooked for easier digestion. For snacking, these choices are reflux-friendly: raw almonds, melons such as cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, banana, apple, carrots, plain popcorn, avocado toast, and baked potatoes. For people with reflux, the best beverage choices are water, tea (no mint), and low-fat milk such as almond, rice, and soy milk. To improve your gut microbiome, add sauerkraut, or fermented pickles. These fermented foods have probiotic effects and help reduce acid reflux. Also consider bone broth, as it is rich in collagen, gelatin, glutamine, and proline–all of which help to heal the gut. In addition, herbal teas can soothe the lining of the stomach and esophagus and promote better digestion. Herbal teas that provide acid reflux relief include camomile, slippery elm, marshmallow root, licorice, and ginger tea. Also, you can eat bitter foods to improve digestion and stomach acid. Some reflux-friendly bitter foods are arugula, dill, dandelion greens, Brussels sprouts, Jerusalem artichokes, kale, turmeric, and ginger.

https://healthimpactnews.com/2024/massive-protests-in-israel-against-netanyahu-after-6-hostages-found-dead/,Massive Protests in Israel Against Netanyahu After 6 Hostages Found Dead,0,"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News The war in the Middle East continues to escalate, as Israelis took to the streets Sunday (September 1, 2024) after the bodies of six hostages who were being detained by Hamas were found dead. Netanyahu claims they were “brutally murdered” while Hamas released a statement claiming Israeli airstrikes killed them. Families of the Israeli captives have called on the government to sign a deal with Hamas to free about 100 people still in Gaza. Israel’s military has announced that its troops have recovered the bodies of six captives, including a dual US national, from a tunnel in southern Gaza, as it continued its 11-month long, deadly assault on the Palestinian enclave. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched war on Gaza on October 7 following an attack led by Palestinian group Hamas that left more than 1,100 people dead. The Palestinian fighters took about 250 captives in the wake of the attack. The coastal enclave has since been turned into rubble amid non-stop bombardment as Israel has been accused of stalling a ceasefire deal to free the captives. The military said on Sunday that their remains were recovered “from an underground tunnel in the Rafah area” and returned to Israel where they were formally identified. It claimed that the captives were killed not long before their bodies were recovered. The captives were identified as Almog Sarusi, Alex Lobanov, Carmel Gat, Ori Danino, Eden Yerushalmi and Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Senior Hamas official Izzat al-Risheq said the six captives were killed in Israeli air strikes. Al-Risheq also blamed the United States for its “bias, support and partnership” in the 11-month war on the besieged territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to “settle the score” with Hamas, saying “we will hunt you down.” “Those who kill hostages do not want an agreement” for a Gaza truce, Netanyahu said. But a forum of captives’ families, who have been critical of Netanyahu’s handling of the issue, called for a massive protest later on Sunday, demanding a “complete halt of the country” to push for the implementation of a ceasefire and release of the remaining captives. (Full article.) There were calls for a general strike on Monday (September 2, 2024) from Israel’s labor groups. September 2, 2024 is, ironically, “Labor Day” in the United States. JERUSALEM, Sept 1 (Reuters) – The head of Israel’s biggest labour union called for a general strike on Monday to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to bring back Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, as thousands of protesters took to the streets. The call for a one-day general strike by Arnon Bar-David, whose Histadrut union represents hundreds of thousands of workers, was backed by Israel’s main manufacturers and entrepreneurs in the high-tech sector. Israel said earlier it had recovered the six bodies from a tunnel in southern Gaza where they were killed not long before Israeli troops reached them. Ben Gurion Airport, Israel’s main air transport hub, will be closed from 8 a.m. (0500 GMT) on Monday, he said. Municipal services in Israel’s economic hub Tel-Aviv will also be shut for part of Monday. Israel’s Manufacturers’ Association said it backed the strike and accused the government of failing in its “moral duty” to bring the hostages back alive. (Full article.) Image source. Meanwhile, the war in the West Bank entered its 5th day Sunday, with many Palestinian “resistance forces” called the “Axis of Resistance” now participating, including the Pakistani Al-Mujahideen Resistance movement, now engaging the Israeli military forces. Palestinian Resistance factions praise the dual operation that took place at dawn Saturday, calling for escalation against the Israeli occupation and its forces. The Al-Mujahideen Resistance movement hailed the significant and heroic operations carried out in the Gush Etzion and Karmei Tzur settlements in northern al-Khalil, in the occupied West Bank, which resulted in confirmed casualties among Israeli ranks, including the commander of the Etzion Regional Brigade. The Resistance movement, in a statement, affirmed that the operations were “a firey message from the free Palestinian people to the enemy’s fascist government,” and a natural response to the violent Israeli crimes in the West Bank, the ongoing genocide in Gaza, and the continued attempts at Judaization and aggression against Al-Aqsa Mosque and occupied al-Quds. The operations also reflect the growing revolutionary sentiment and increasing confrontations in Palestine against the Israeli enemy forces, which further reaffirm that the people of Palestine continue fighting on the path of Resistance, the statement said. “The enemy’s attempts and plots to break their [Palestinian people’s] will and determination to resist and achieve liberation will fail.” The Al-Mujahideen movement further considered that the operations were “another blow to the arrogant enemy’s security and intelligence apparatuses.” It warned the Israeli occupation to prepare for floods of strikes and confrontation axes “from the unknown” and to expect escalations in operations and blows carried out by the people and the Resistance everywhere. “As the enemy attacks in the North, the response will come from the South.” (Full article.) Three Israeli police officers were reportedly killed in the West Bank on Sunday. Reports indicate that the Palestinians who carried out the operation safely withdrew from the shooting scene near the Tarqumiyah military checkpoint. Three Israeli police officers were killed in a shooting operation in the southern West Bank governorate of al-Khalil on Sunday morning, Al Mayadeen’s correspondent reported. According to the Israeli newspaper Maariv, two Israeli police officers were critically injured and one was seriously wounded in a drive-by shooting on Route 35 east of the Tarqumiyah military checkpoint. Israeli emergency services rushed to the scene in an area to the northwest of the city of al-Khalil. Israeli emergency services later announced the death of the three injured soldiers. (Full article.) We are most definitely in the beginning stages of World War III now, as the Middle East is not the only region where tensions are escalating. The war between Russia and Ukraine is also escalating, as Russia has reported this weekend that they shot down over 150 Ukrainian drones inside Russia today, and the Chinese Navy is actively patrolling disputed islands near the Philippines in the South China Sea where clashes happened last week. Meanwhile, it was also reported this past week that the U.S. Navy does not have any aircraft carriers in the Indo-Pacific for the first time in “decades” due to deployments to the Middle East. Carrier ‘gap’ comes as tensions mount with China over regional disputes The U.S. military for the first time in decades has no aircraft carrier strike groups in the Indo-Pacific region, despite mounting tensions with China over disputed South China Sea islands, the Taiwan Strait, and a recent Chinese air incursion near Japan. The Pentagon recently ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln to speed up its deployment from the Pacific to the Middle East to be ready for a potential conflict with Iran. Earlier the USS Theodore Roosevelt, like the Lincoln based in San Diego, was sent to the Middle East. Both warships are currently in the Gulf of Oman, USNI reported Monday. (Full article.) Cmdr.

There is still only 1 report of an actual case of someone having polio based on a laboratory PCR test, and no one has died. Deaths due to the new oral polio vaccine, however, which was given “emergency use authorization” (EUA), are currently about 25% of all vaccine injuries caused by the new oral polio vaccine, according to the U.S. government database of Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). (Source.) JERUSALEM (AP) — The U.N. health agency and partners are launching a campaign starting Sunday to vaccinate 640,000 Palestinian children in Gaza against polio, an ambitious effort amid a devastating war that has destroyed the territory’s healthcare system. The campaign comes after the first polio case was reported in Gaza in 25 years — a 10-month-old boy, now paralyzed in the leg. The World Health Organization says the presence of a paralysis case indicates there could be hundreds more who have been infected but aren’t showing symptoms. Most people who have polio do not experience symptoms, and those who do usually recover in a week or so. (Source – emphasis mine.) This is clearly a population reduction campaign, as most childhood vaccines are, and I have yet to see any English news sites covering this story, and exposing that this is a fake polio outbreak that NOBODY is dying from, with an experimental and dangerous polio vaccine. Apparently some Israeli scientists have sounded the alarm, but I have not located who these scientists are, perhaps because their voices have only been reported in Hebrew. The United Nations has upheld the safety of the polio vaccine that will be administered to more than half a million Palestinian children during an inoculation campaign in Gaza. Dire conditions brought on by the war have caused the disease to resurface after more than two decades. Last week, a case was confirmed in a 10-month-old. Countering vaccine misinformation During his daily media briefing from New York on Tuesday, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric noted that there had been misinformation surrounding the vaccine. “I want to make the following clear: the safest and most effective way to protect children against the polio virus, regardless of the variant, is to vaccinate them,” he said. Several news stories have appeared online in Israel and the United States, quoting two Israeli scientists falsely asserting that the polio vaccine due to be used in Gaza is “experimental” and a danger to citizens in both Palestine and Israel. The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN agency that assists Palestine refugees, UNRWA, are preparing to launch the campaign, which will be conducted in two rounds. More than 640,000 children under the age of 10 will receive two drops of oral polio vaccine type 2. “This vaccine is safe, it is effective, and it offers top quality protection,” said Mr. Dujarric. “It is a vaccine globally recommended for variant type two polio virus outbreaks by the World Health Organization.” (Source.) As is common when discussing vaccines, those who are pro-vaccine injectors offer no evidence, no scientific studies, and no facts about vaccine side effects when making these pronouncements, just appeals to authority. (Trust us, because we are the experts, and don’t listen to those crazy anti-vaccine people.) I have already published one article on this issue, so let’s review the facts that are currently available publicly to anyone who takes the time to research this issue. Practicing medicine without a license, Bill Gates administers an oral polio vaccine into a child in India. When you read articles about calls for mass-vaccination campaigns against children, the first thing to do is examine the actual facts that are being reported over any so-called “outbreak.” I went to the sources of the reporting over this “polio outbreak”, which is the UN, and specifically UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund), the largest purchaser and distributor of vaccines for children worldwide. Here is what they reported in their August 16th publication that everyone is now using as their source to write these articles about the Gaza “polio outbreak”: JERUSALEM/CAIRO/AMMAN, 16 August 2024 – Two rounds of a polio vaccination campaign are expected to be launched at the end of August and September 2024 across the Gaza Strip to prevent the spread of circulating variant type 2 poliovirus (cVDPV2). WHO and UNICEF request all parties to the conflict to implement humanitarian pauses in the Gaza Strip for seven days to allow for two rounds of vaccination campaigns to take place. These pauses in fighting would allow children and families to safely reach health facilities and community outreach workers to get to children who cannot access health facilities for polio vaccination. Without the humanitarian pauses, the delivery of the campaign will not be possible. During each round of the campaign, the Palestinian Ministry of Health (MoH), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and partners, will provide two drops of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) to more than 640 000 children under ten years of age. The poliovirus was detected in July 2024 in environmental samples from Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. Worryingly, three children presenting with suspected acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), a common symptom of polio, have since been reported in the Gaza Strip. Their stool samples have been sent for testing to the Jordan National Polio Laboratory. Over 1.6 million doses of nOPV2, which is used to stop cVDPV2 transmission, will be delivered to the Gaza Strip. This followed a report published by the UN last month (July, 2024), which stated that the “virus” had been identified (using the infamous PCR test protocol) in 6 locations, NOT people, by testing sewage samples. To add to the devastation of war and the complete breakdown of law and order, Gazans now have to contend with the threat of highly infectious polio disease linked to the disastrous sanitation situation created by the conflict, the UN health agency said on Friday. In a statement, Christian Lindmeier, spokesperson for the World Health Organization (WHO), said that vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) had been identified at six locations in sewage samples collected on 23 June from Khan Younis and Deir al Balah. To date, no one has been treated in Gaza for paralysis or other symptoms caused by polio virus infection. “It is important to note the virus has been isolated from the environment only at this time; no associated paralytic cases have been detected,” he told journalists in Geneva. As part of the response efforts, WHO in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is already working with the local health authority, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) and partners to assess how far poliovirus has spread. This work will determine the measures needed to stop any further spread, “including prompt vaccination campaigns”, the WHO spokesperson explained. (Source.) We can now summarize the facts from these two official news reports from the UN. In July, a total of 6 cases of a positive polio PCR test result were found in sewage samples (fecal matter) at 6 locations. It was admitted that these cases were “vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2″. This was the beginning of the “polio outbreak” that is now being reported, even though at the time these tests were conducted, there was not a single person being treated for polio, nor anyone showing any symptoms of polio. Nevertheless, it was declared an “outbreak” and plans were immediately put into effect to produce hundreds of thousands of doses of the oral polio vaccines. One month later, in August, “three children presenting with suspected acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), a common symptom of polio” was reported. That’s it, 3 children, who did not even have a positive polio PCR test diagnosis, but only “symptoms” of polio, was all that was needed to determine that this was a deadly “outbreak” of polio and kick into gear the production of 1.6 million doses of the oral polio vaccine to give to children in Gaza, along with now a single “confirmed case” of a 10-month-old child. Original image source. Sadly, I have seen this story before, many times, wherever disaster strikes and it is announced that “polio is back” after many years of having no “cases” of polio. What the media fails to report, however, is that these “cases” of polio came from the oral polio vaccines themselves! The last time I reported on this UN method of mass polio vaccination of children during times of crisis, was at the beginning of last year (2023), just after the massive earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria. See: Even 10 years before that, back in 2013, I exposed the UN polio vaccine campaign agenda when polio allegedly broke out in the Syrian refugee camps due to the war in Syria. See: As I reported then, as well as multiple other times, in ALL of these cases the new “outbreak” of polio is caused by the oral polio vaccine itself. Here are some more articles I have published about this vaccine scam over the years: The oral polio vaccine is notorious for “shedding” the so-called “live virus”, and its use has been banned in wealthier countries, such as the U.S. and Israel, because it was widely known that this oral polio vaccine actually causes polio. Even the corporate media has admitted this, since 2019. In the recent press release by UNICEF about this “outbreak” of polio in Gaza, they stated that prior to 2022 Palestinians were receiving the “inactivated polio vaccine”, the same polio vaccines used in the U.S. and Israel. The Gaza Strip had a high level of vaccination coverage across the population before the escalation of hostilities in October 2023. However, due to the impact of the conflict, routine immunization coverage (for the second dose of inactivated polio vaccine) dropped from 99 per cent in 2022 to less than 90 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, increasing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases to children, including polio. (Source.) Since the current war in Gaza started in October of 2023, I suspected that UNICEF had already distributed some of the oral polio vaccines, which cause polio. So I did some searching, and it did not take long to find out my suspicions were true, because as I wrote above, I have seen this script performed many times over the past decade. In a June 13, 2024 UNICEF report that covered a reporting period between May 16th through May 29th this year (2024), 10,000 doses of the oral polio vaccine were administered in Gaza. During the reporting period, UNICEF also managed to conduct a mission to the North Gaza governorate in order to deliver vaccines including 10,000 oral Polio vaccines, 5,000 Rotavirus vaccine drops, 6,000 Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccines, as well as Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis vaccines. (Source.) Bingo! Now we know the source of the current “outbreak” of polio in Gaza, which so far has only officially been found in a single child, but nonetheless is being used as an excuse to vaccinate every single child still living in Gaza, 630,000, with the deadly oral polio vaccine. Shame on those of you in the Alternative Media for not reporting all the facts on this “outbreak” of polio! It is time for people to wake up and realize that ALL vaccines are a scam, and not just the COVID-19 ones. Please do your research and learn how the polio vaccines have ALL been scams to scare the public into mass vaccination campaigns, starting in the 1960s. I’ll give you some help by pointing to a summary article on this issue that I published back in 2022: And in case you are wondering how serious polio is worldwide, here are the official stats from WHO in this graph: Source: WHO Police will only release parents once they have sworn that they will vaccinate their children. Image source. Because it was widely known that the oral polio vaccine was dangerous, and the cause of almost all “polio outbreaks” around the world, a new oral polio vaccine was developed, called the “novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2)”, which is the “updated” OPV being ordered to distribute in Gaza now. The first thing that one needs to know about this “novel” new oral polio vaccine, is that it was given “Emergency Use” authorization in November of 2020, during the height of the COVID Scam. On 13 November 2020, type 2 novel oral polio vaccine (nOPV2) became the first vaccine to be authorized for use under the WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) mechanism. The use of nOPV2 is restricted to outbreak response for type 2 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV2). SAGE recommended that an independent nOPV2 safety monitoring group be established (the GACVS subcommittee on nOPV2) and that the GACVS should advise on nOPV2 safety monitoring during the entire period of the EUL. (Source: WHO) A study published in 2022 that was conducted in Panama, showed that this “new” oral polio vaccine also sheds, just like the older one did. Since this “new” oral polio vaccine is NOT used in the U.S., there is not much recorded on it in the U.S. CDC and FDA database of vaccine adverse events (VAERS). So I did a search for “oral polio vaccine” in VAERS after January 1, 2021, as almost all of those cases should be the new OPV vaccine. As is to be expected, since the vaccine is not distributed in the U.S., there are only 40 cases from the beginning of 2021 through today, all foreign cases reported. However, of those 40 cases recorded in VAERS, 10 of those cases of oral polio vaccine side effects resulted in DEATH (25%), with 30 hospitalizations. (Source.) And 65% of those cases were infants below the age of 6 months. (Source.) The deaths of these babies are recorded as “sudden infant death syndrome” (SIDS), because according to the CDC all vaccines are safe and effective, and never cause any deaths. Sadly, in the weeks and months ahead we will see babies and children die and become crippled in Gaza, not only due to the war, but also because of this mass vaccination campaign with the new Oral Polio Vaccine. In addition, vaccine-induced polio will spread, including throughout Israel where the OPV has been banned for years, and this will result in even MORE vaccines being distributed as they will claim that there is now a full-blown “Polio epidemic”, that possibly they will claim is spreading worldwide. Where have we seen this script play out before?? NOTE: I am using DeepL to translate this article into Arabic, in the hopes that many Arabs will read this information and share it in places where Arabic-speaking people living in Palestine will see it and read it. I apologize in advance for any mistakes in the translation, but I, for one, am an American who cares about the murder of ALL babies and children around the world, irrespective to nationality, ethnic group, or religious group. وجدت حماس والقوات الإسرائيلية أخيرًا أرضية مشتركة لإصدار أمر بوقف إطلاق النار في قطاع غزة: حملة تطعيم جماعية ضد الأطفال لإجبارهم على تلقي لقاح شلل الأطفال الفموي القاتل المحظور في معظم الدول الغربية، وذلك بسبب تفشي مرض شلل الأطفال المزيف الذي يستند باعترافهم إلى أدلة على وجود شلل أطفال ناجم عن اللقاح في عينات من مياه الصرف الصحي. لا يوجد حتى الآن تقرير واحد فقط عن حالة فعلية لشخص مصاب بشلل الأطفال استنادًا إلى اختبار تفاعل البوليميراز المتسلسل في المختبر، ولم يتوفى أحد. ومع ذلك، تبلغ نسبة الوفيات الناجمة عن لقاح شلل الأطفال الفموي الجديد، الذي حصل على ”تصريح استخدام طارئ“ (EUA)، حاليًا حوالي 25% من جميع إصابات اللقاح الناجمة عن لقاح شلل الأطفال الفموي الجديد، وفقًا لقاعدة بيانات الحكومة الأمريكية لنظام الإبلاغ عن الأحداث الضارة للقاحات (VAERS). (المصدر) 3 أيام، 640,000 طفل، 1.3 مليون جرعة خطة لتطعيم صغار غزة ضد شلل الأطفال القدس (أسوشيتد برس) – تطلق وكالة الصحة التابعة للأمم المتحدة وشركاؤها حملة تبدأ يوم الأحد لتطعيم 640 ألف طفل فلسطيني في غزة ضد شلل الأطفال، في جهد طموح وسط حرب مدمرة دمرت نظام الرعاية الصحية في القطاع. وتأتي هذه الحملة بعد الإبلاغ عن أول حالة شلل أطفال في غزة منذ 25 عامًا – طفل يبلغ من العمر 10 أشهر، وهو الآن مشلول الساق. وتقول منظمة الصحة العالمية إن وجود حالة شلل تشير إلى احتمال وجود مئات آخرين أصيبوا بالعدوى ولكن لا تظهر عليهم الأعراض. لا يعاني معظم الأشخاص المصابين بشلل الأطفال من أعراض المرض، وعادةً ما يتعافى المصابون به في غضون أسبوع أو نحو ذلك. (المصدر) من الواضح أن هذه حملة لتخفيض عدد السكان، كما هو الحال في معظم لقاحات الأطفال، ولم أر حتى الآن أي موقع إخباري باللغة الإنجليزية يغطي هذه القصة، ويكشف أن هذا تفشي مزيف لشلل الأطفال الذي لا يموت منه أحد، بلقاح تجريبي وخطير لشلل الأطفال. من الواضح أن بعض العلماء الإسرائيليين الذين دقوا ناقوس الخطر، ولكنني لم أحدد من هم هؤلاء العلماء، ربما لأن أصواتهم لم تُنقل إلا باللغة العبرية. الأمم المتحدة تؤيد سلامة وفعالية لقاح شلل الأطفال في غزة أيدت الأمم المتحدة سلامة لقاح شلل الأطفال الذي سيتم إعطاؤه لأكثر من نصف مليون طفل فلسطيني خلال حملة تلقيح في غزة. وقد تسببت الظروف القاسية الناجمة عن الحرب في عودة المرض إلى الظهور من جديد بعد أكثر من عقدين من الزمن. في الأسبوع الماضي، تم تأكيد حالة إصابة طفل يبلغ من العمر 10 أشهر. مواجهة المعلومات المضللة حول اللقاح خلال إحاطته الإعلامية اليومية من نيويورك يوم الثلاثاء، أشار المتحدث باسم الأمم المتحدة ستيفان دوجاريك إلى وجود معلومات خاطئة حول اللقاح. وقال: ”أريد أن أوضح ما يلي: الطريقة الأكثر أمانًا وفعالية لحماية الأطفال من فيروس شلل الأطفال، بغض النظر عن نوعه، هي تطعيمهم“. ظهرت العديد من القصص الإخبارية على الإنترنت في إسرائيل والولايات المتحدة الأمريكية نقلاً عن عالمين إسرائيليين يؤكدان كذباً أن لقاح شلل الأطفال المقرر استخدامه في غزة ”تجريبي“ ويشكل خطراً على المواطنين في كل من فلسطين وإسرائيل. وتستعد منظمة الأمم المتحدة للطفولة (اليونيسف) ومنظمة الصحة العالمية ووكالة الأمم المتحدة التي تساعد اللاجئين الفلسطينيين ”الأونروا“ لإطلاق الحملة التي ستتم على جولتين. وسيتلقى أكثر من 640,000 طفل دون سن العاشرة قطرتين من لقاح شلل الأطفال الفموي من النوع الثاني. ”وقال السيد دوجاريك: ”إن هذا اللقاح آمن وفعال ويوفر حماية عالية الجودة. ”إنه لقاح موصى به عالميًا لتفشي فيروس شلل الأطفال من النوع الثاني من قبل منظمة الصحة العالمية.“ (المصدر) كما هو شائع عند مناقشة اللقاحات، لا يقدم المؤيدون للقاحات أي دليل أو دراسات علمية أو حقائق حول الآثار الجانبية للقاحات عند الإدلاء بهذه التصريحات، بل مجرد مناشدات للسلطة. (ثقوا بنا، لأننا نحن الخبراء، ولا تستمعوا إلى هؤلاء المجانين المناهضين للقاحات). لقد سبق لي أن نشرت مقالاً واحداً حول هذه المسألة، لذا دعونا نستعرض الحقائق المتاحة حالياً للجمهور لأي شخص يخصص وقتاً للبحث في هذه المسألة. عندما تقرأ مقالات حول الدعوات لحملات التطعيم الجماعية ضد الأطفال، فإن أول ما يجب فعله هو فحص الحقائق الفعلية التي يتم الإبلاغ عنها بشأن أي ”تفشٍ“ مزعوم. لقد ذهبت إلى مصدر التقارير حول ”تفشي شلل الأطفال“، وهو الأمم المتحدة، وتحديداً منظمة الأمم المتحدة للطفولة (اليونيسف)، أكبر مشترٍ وموزع للقاحات الأطفال في جميع أنحاء العالم. إليكم ما ذكروه في منشورهم الصادر في 16 أغسطس/آب والذي يستخدمه الجميع الآن كمصدر لكتابة هذه المقالات حول ”تفشي شلل الأطفال“ في غزة: وقفات إنسانية ضرورية لحملة التطعيم ضد شلل الأطفال الحرجة في قطاع غزة القدس/القاهرة/عمان، 16 آب/أغسطس 2024 – من المتوقع إطلاق جولتين من حملة التطعيم ضد شلل الأطفال في نهاية آب/أغسطس وأيلول/سبتمبر 2024 في جميع أنحاء قطاع غزة لمنع انتشار فيروس شلل الأطفال من النوع الثاني الساري (cVDPV2). وتطلب منظمة الصحة العالمية واليونيسف من جميع أطراف النزاع تنفيذ هدنات إنسانية في قطاع غزة لمدة سبعة أيام للسماح بإجراء جولتين من حملات التطعيم. ومن شأن هذه التوقفات في القتال أن تسمح للأطفال والعائلات بالوصول بأمان إلى المرافق الصحية وللعاملين في مجال التوعية المجتمعية بالوصول إلى الأطفال الذين لا يستطيعون الوصول إلى المرافق الصحية للتطعيم ضد شلل الأطفال. وبدون هذه التوقفات الإنسانية، لن يكون تنفيذ الحملة ممكناً. وخلال كل جولة من الحملة، ستقدم وزارة الصحة الفلسطينية، بالتعاون مع منظمة الصحة العالمية ومنظمة الأمم المتحدة للطفولة (اليونيسف) ووكالة الأمم المتحدة لإغاثة وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الأونروا) والشركاء، قطرتين من لقاح شلل الأطفال الفموي الجديد من النوع الثاني (nOPV2) لأكثر من 640,000 طفل دون سن العاشرة. تم اكتشاف فيروس شلل الأطفال في تموز/يوليو 2024 في عينات بيئية من خان يونس ودير البلح. ومما يثير القلق أنه تم الإبلاغ منذ ذلك الحين عن ثلاثة أطفال في قطاع غزة يشتبه في إصابتهم بالشلل الرخو الحاد، وهو أحد الأعراض الشائعة لشلل الأطفال. وقد تم إرسال عينات البراز الخاصة بهم لفحصها في المختبر الوطني الأردني لشلل الأطفال. وسيتم إيصال أكثر من 1.6 مليون جرعة من لقاح شلل الأطفال غير اللقاحي (nOPV2)، الذي يُستخدم لوقف انتقال فيروس شلل الأطفال الحاد الرخو الحاد (cVDP2) إلى قطاع غزة. جاء ذلك في أعقاب التقرير الذي نشرته الأمم المتحدة الشهر الماضي (يوليو 2024)، والذي ذكر أنه تم تحديد ”الفيروس“ (باستخدام بروتوكول اختبار تفاعل البوليميراز المتسلسل سيئ السمعة) في 6 مواقع، وليس في أشخاص، عن طريق فحص عينات من مياه الصرف الصحي. عاملون في المجال الإنساني يحذرون من أن شلل الأطفال يطارد سكان غزة مع انتشار ”الفوضى بالإضافة إلى الدمار الذي خلفته الحرب والانهيار الكامل للقانون والنظام، يتعين على سكان غزة الآن مواجهة خطر الإصابة بمرض شلل الأطفال شديد العدوى المرتبط بالوضع الصحي الكارثي الذي تسبب به الصراع، حسبما قالت منظمة الصحة العالمية التابعة للأمم المتحدة يوم الجمعة. وقال كريستيان ليندماير، المتحدث باسم منظمة الصحة العالمية، في بيان له، إنه تم تحديد فيروس شلل الأطفال من النوع الثاني المشتق من اللقاح في ستة مواقع في عينات من مياه الصرف الصحي التي تم جمعها في 23 حزيران/يونيو من خان يونس ودير البلح. وحتى الآن، لم يتم علاج أي شخص في غزة من الشلل أو الأعراض الأخرى الناجمة عن الإصابة بفيروس شلل الأطفال. وقال للصحفيين في جنيف: ”من المهم ملاحظة أن الفيروس قد تم عزله من البيئة فقط في هذا الوقت؛ ولم يتم اكتشاف أي حالات شلل مصاحبة له“. وكجزء من جهود الاستجابة، تعمل منظمة الصحة العالمية في الأرض الفلسطينية المحتلة بالفعل مع السلطة الصحية المحلية ومنظمة الأمم المتحدة للطفولة (اليونيسف) ووكالة الأمم المتحدة لإغاثة وتشغيل اللاجئين الفلسطينيين (الأونروا) والشركاء لتقييم مدى انتشار فيروس شلل الأطفال. وأوضح المتحدث باسم منظمة الصحة العالمية أن هذا العمل سيحدد التدابير اللازمة لوقف أي انتشار إضافي، ”بما في ذلك حملات التطعيم الفورية“. (المصدر) يمكننا الآن تلخيص الحقائق من هذين التقريرين الإخباريين الرسميين الصادرين عن الأمم المتحدة. في شهر تموز/يوليو، تم العثور على ما مجموعه 6 حالات إيجابية نتيجة اختبار PCR لشلل الأطفال في عينات من مياه الصرف الصحي (البراز) في 6 مواقع. وتم الاعتراف بأن هذه الحالات كانت ”فيروس شلل الأطفال من النوع 2“ المشتق من اللقاح. كانت هذه هي بداية ”تفشي شلل الأطفال“ الذي يتم الإبلاغ عنه الآن، على الرغم من أنه في الوقت الذي أجريت فيه هذه الاختبارات، لم يكن هناك شخص واحد يعالج من شلل الأطفال، ولم تظهر على أي شخص أي أعراض لشلل الأطفال. ومع ذلك، أُعلن عن ”تفشي المرض“ ووُضعت الخطط على الفور لإنتاج مئات الآلاف من جرعات لقاحات شلل الأطفال الفموية. بعد شهر واحد، في شهر أغسطس/آب، تم الإبلاغ عن ”ثلاثة أطفال مصابين بشلل رخو حاد مشتبه به، وهو أحد الأعراض الشائعة لشلل الأطفال“. هذا كل ما في الأمر، 3 أطفال، لم يكن لديهم حتى تشخيص إيجابي لاختبار PCR لشلل الأطفال، بل فقط ”أعراض“ شلل الأطفال، كان كل ما كان مطلوبًا لتحديد أن هذا ”تفشٍ“ مميت لشلل الأطفال والبدء في إنتاج 1.6 مليون جرعة من لقاح شلل الأطفال الفموي لإعطائها للأطفال في غزة، إلى جانب ”حالة مؤكدة“ واحدة لطفل عمره 10 أشهر. للأسف، لقد شاهدت هذه القصة من قبل، عدة مرات، حيثما تقع الكارثة ويُعلن عن ”عودة شلل الأطفال“ بعد سنوات عديدة من عدم وجود ”حالات“ لشلل الأطفال. لكن ما لا تنقله وسائل الإعلام هو أن ”حالات“ شلل الأطفال هذه جاءت من لقاحات شلل الأطفال الفموية نفسها! كانت المرة الأخيرة التي تحدثت فيها عن هذه الطريقة التي تتبعها الأمم المتحدة في التطعيم الجماعي للأطفال ضد شلل الأطفال في أوقات الأزمات، في بداية العام الماضي (2023)، بعد الزلزال الهائل الذي ضرب تركيا وسوريا مباشرة. انظر: حتى قبل 10 سنوات من ذلك، في عام 2013، كشفتُ عن أجندة حملة الأمم المتحدة للقاح شلل الأطفال عندما زُعم أن شلل الأطفال انتشر في مخيمات اللاجئين السوريين بسبب الحرب في سوريا. انظر: وكما ذكرت في ذلك الحين، وكذلك عدة مرات أخرى، في جميع هذه الحالات، فإن ”تفشي“ شلل الأطفال الجديد في جميع هذه الحالات سببه لقاح شلل الأطفال الفموي نفسه. فيما يلي بعض المقالات الأخرى التي نشرتها حول عملية الاحتيال باللقاح هذه على مر السنين: لقاح شلل الأطفال الفموي سيء السمعة لأنه ”يفرز“ ما يسمى بـ ”الفيروس الحي“، وقد تم حظر استخدامه في البلدان الأكثر ثراءً، مثل الولايات المتحدة وإسرائيل، لأنه كان من المعروف على نطاق واسع أن لقاح شلل الأطفال الفموي يسبب بالفعل شلل الأطفال. حتى وسائل إعلام الشركات اعترفت بذلك، منذ عام 2019. في البيان الصحفي الأخير الذي أصدرته اليونيسف حول ”تفشي“ شلل الأطفال في غزة، ذكروا أنه قبل عام 2022 كان الفلسطينيون يتلقون ”لقاح شلل الأطفال المعطل“، وهو نفس لقاحات شلل الأطفال المستخدمة في الولايات المتحدة وإسرائيل. كان قطاع غزة يتمتع بمستوى عالٍ من التغطية بالتطعيم بين السكان قبل تصاعد الأعمال القتالية في تشرين الأول/أكتوبر 2023. ومع ذلك، وبسبب تأثير الصراع، انخفضت التغطية بالتحصين الروتيني (للجرعة الثانية من لقاح شلل الأطفال المعطل) من 99 بالمائة في عام 2022 إلى أقل من 90 بالمائة في الربع الأول من عام 2024، مما زاد من خطر إصابة الأطفال بالأمراض التي يمكن الوقاية منها باللقاحات، بما فيها شلل الأطفال. (المصدر) منذ أن بدأت الحرب الحالية في غزة في أكتوبر من عام 2023، اشتبهت في أن اليونيسف قد وزعت بالفعل بعض لقاحات شلل الأطفال الفموية التي تسبب شلل الأطفال. لذا قمتُ ببعض البحث، ولم يستغرق الأمر وقتاً طويلاً لأكتشف أن شكوكي كانت صحيحة، لأنني كما كتبتُ أعلاه، فقد رأيت هذا السيناريو يُنفذ عدة مرات على مدار العقد الماضي. في تقرير اليونيسف الصادر في 13 حزيران/يونيو 2024، والذي غطى الفترة المشمولة بالتقرير بين 16 أيار/مايو حتى 29 أيار/مايو من هذا العام (2024)، تم إعطاء 10,000 جرعة من لقاح شلل الأطفال الفموي في غزة. وخلال الفترة التي يشملها التقرير، تمكنت اليونيسف أيضًا من إيفاد بعثة إلى محافظة شمال غزة من أجل تقديم اللقاحات، بما في ذلك 10,000 لقاح فموي ضد شلل الأطفال، و5,000 قطرة لقاح ضد فيروس الروتافيروس، و6,000 لقاح ضد الحصبة والنكاف والحصبة الألمانية، بالإضافة إلى لقاح الدفتيريا والكزاز والسعال الديكي. (المصدر) وجدتها! لقد عرفنا الآن مصدر ”تفشي“ شلل الأطفال الحالي في غزة، والذي لم يتم حتى الآن اكتشافه رسميًا لدى طفل واحد حتى الآن، ولكن مع ذلك يتم استخدامه كذريعة لتطعيم كل طفل لا يزال يعيش في غزة، 630,000 طفل، بلقاح شلل الأطفال الفموي القاتل. عار على أولئك الذين يعملون في وسائل الإعلام البديلة لعدم نقلهم جميع الحقائق حول ”تفشي“ شلل الأطفال هذا! لقد حان الوقت لكي يستيقظ الناس ويدركوا أن جميع اللقاحات هي خدعة، وليس فقط لقاح كوفيد-19. من فضلك قم ببحثك وتعلم كيف أن جميع لقاحات شلل الأطفال كانت خدعة لتخويف الجمهور من أجل حملات التطعيم الجماعية، بدءًا من ستينيات القرن الماضي. سأقدم لك بعض المساعدة من خلال الإشارة إلى مقال موجز حول هذه المسألة نشرته في عام 2022: وفي حال كنت تتساءل عن مدى خطورة مرض شلل الأطفال في جميع أنحاء العالم، إليك الإحصائيات الرسمية من منظمة الصحة العالمية في هذا الرسم البياني:",6,-0.4294328,0.08904879,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/control-blood-pressure-naturally/,7 Key Nutrients to Control Blood Pressure Naturally,0,"High blood pressure, also referred to as hypertension, is often called a “silent killer”. This is because, most people with high blood pressure, won’t have any symptoms, and feel perfectly fine. And one in three of them are not even aware that they have it. However, blood pressure that is consistently high damages the arteries. This causes your heart and blood vessels to work harder, yet more inefficiently, in circulating oxygen-rich blood to all parts of your body. If left untreated, this dramatically increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and vision loss. Now, about 90-95% of cases of hypertension are not caused by a medical condition, but rather the result of genetics and lifestyle factors such as obesity, stress, insulin resistance, consuming excessive sugar and salt, and leading a sedentary lifestyle. This is called essential hypertension. One important factor that contributes to hypertension is nutrient deficiencies that make it difficult to manage your blood pressure. Often, these nutrient deficiencies can be overlooked by your doctor. Today, we look at 7 key nutrients that control blood pressure. Luckily, getting enough of these nutrients often helps to reverse high blood pressure. Watch this important video until the end, then click the link below to learn about our recommended solution for removing high blood pressure permanently. Let’s begin with Number 7. “Potassium”. Studies consistently show that a potassium deficiency can raise blood pressure, and correcting low potassium levels can markedly lower blood pressure in those with existing hypertension. One of the ways potassium helps to keep your blood pressure normal is by balancing out the effects of sodium. The more potassium foods you eat, the more sodium is excreted through urine. When extra fluid leaves the body, blood pressure goes down. Also, potassium is important for muscle function. This includes the relaxation of the walls of the blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure and prevents muscle cramping. And potassium is needed to keep electrical signals moving through the nervous system and the heart. This protects against an irregular heartbeat. To fight hypertension, you should aim to get at least 4,700 mg of potassium per day. Fruits and vegetables are the best sources of potassium. Some excellent choices to include in your diet are potatoes, bananas, legumes, mushrooms, and spinach. One strategy to significantly increase your potassium levels is to replace grains with root vegetables like potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, turnips, and pumpkin throughout the week. However, if you take a diuretic for high blood pressure, heart failure, or edema, food alone may not be sufficient to keep your potassium levels normal. This is because these medications cause potassium to be excreted in the urine. In such cases, your doctor may prescribe potassium supplements. Coming up next, Number 6 is “Magnesium”. Research has shown that a magnesium deficiency is strongly linked to elevated blood pressure, regardless of whether you are overweight or not. Other studies have shown that correcting low magnesium by taking 365-450 mg of magnesium per day for three months can significantly reduce high blood pressure. So, how does magnesium help lower blood pressure? First, magnesium blocks calcium from entering the smooth muscle cells of the heart and arteries, thus resulting in blood vessel dilation. Because of this, magnesium is sometimes called “nature’s calcium channel blocker”. Second, magnesium lowers blood pressure by increasing nitric oxide, a compound that dilates and relaxes blood vessels, thus improving blood flow. For a list of nutrients that increase nitric oxide, see our video “7 vitamins to increase blood flow and circulation”. It has been estimated that 50-75% of U.S. adults are not getting enough magnesium. So, it is easy to see how increasing magnesium-rich foods, such as pumpkin seeds, almonds, cashews, and spinach, can make it easier to manage blood pressure. To fight hypertension, you should aim to get at least 310 to 420 mg of magnesium per day. Since magnesium is involved in over 300 bodily processes, such as energy production and bone development, it is super important to get enough of this mineral. And, just like with potassium, the use of diuretics can cause an excessive loss of magnesium through urine. So supplementing may be required. Consider magnesium glycinate or magnesium malate, as they are easier on the digestive system and are easily assimilated into the body. Now, here’s something important to know: Because magnesium helps transport calcium and potassium ions in and out of cells, a lack of magnesium can lead to low levels of calcium and potassium. Next up is Number 5, “Calcium”. Calcium influences blood pressure by regulating the proper narrowing and widening of blood vessels. A review of 23 studies found that increasing calcium intake decreases both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by a small amount in people with normal blood pressure. These studies are mostly based on supplement intake of 1,000-1,500 mg per day. Now, most people are not getting enough calcium from their diet. So, it is recommended to increase your intake of calcium from food sources, including dairy (such as yogurt, milk, cheese), fish (such as salmon, canned sardines), and dark leafy greens (such as kale, bok choy, collard greens). Other than its role in regulating blood pressure, calcium is needed to build bones and teeth and is required for proper nerve transmission and muscle contraction. To effectively absorb calcium, your body needs Vitamin D. Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video. This leads us to Number 4. “Vitamin D”. Vitamin D is both a nutrient that we eat and a hormone that our bodies make. For your body to absorb calcium from food, optimal levels of vitamin D are needed. Without enough vitamin D, only 10-15% of calcium can be absorbed by the intestines. In a review of 35 studies published in 2014, researchers found that not getting enough Vitamin D can lead to high blood pressure later in life. The same review also showed that people with higher levels of Vitamin D had lower diastolic and systolic blood pressures, and were 8% less likely to develop hypertension. The best way to get enough Vitamin D is to spend 10-30 minutes in midday sunlight several times a week. The best food sources of vitamin D are fatty fish such as salmon and sardines, cod liver oil, egg yolks, mushrooms, and fortified foods such as milk and cereals. If you are supplementing, taking 2000 I.U of vitamin D3 per day, should be enough in most cases. Now, vitamins D2 and D3 are considered biologically inactive until they are converted into their active form, calcitriol. For this conversion to happen, the enzymes present in your liver and kidneys require sufficient amounts of magnesium to draw upon. This means that if you have low levels of magnesium, your body will not be able to make full use of the vitamin D you are receiving. This is yet another reason to ensure that you have optimal levels of magnesium. Coming into the top 3, Number 3 is “Vitamin K2”. A 2017 study published in Hypertension found that the combination of low vitamin D and low vitamin K was associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Your body needs vitamin K2, or menaquinone, to activate the proteins that keep calcium in the bones and out of the arteries. Therefore, vitamin K2 prevents calcium from sticking to the walls of the arteries, where it would otherwise form calcified plaques, thus limiting blood supply and increasing blood pressure. Essentially, vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, while vitamin K2 routes the calcium away from your heart, kidneys, and arteries and sends it to the bones and teeth. For this reason, it is important to take vitamin K2 MK7 and vitamin D3 together when supplementing. There aren’t many foods that are high in vitamin K2. These include sauerkraut, natto, miso, eel, beef liver, egg yolks, grass-fed butter and cheese, and pastured eggs. If you don’t eat a lot of these foods, you may want to supplement with 100-300 mcg of vitamin K2 MK7 per day. Next up, we have Number 2, “CoQ10”. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is an antioxidant produced by your body. Studies have shown that CoQ10 can lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension. One study in China found that supplementing with CoQ10 countered the effects of a high-salt diet and kept blood pressure healthy. CoQ10 affects blood pressure through a mechanism related to nitric oxide, protecting the blood vessels and enhancing blood flow, much in the same way as beetroot juice does. Several factors can deplete CoQ10 levels over time. Long-term use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs is the main culprit. Aging and some disease states, such as after a heart attack, fibromyalgia, and depression, also cause CoQ10 depletion. You can get CoQ10 from foods such as fatty fish, grass-fed beef, chicken, organ meats, such as heart, liver, lungs, Non-GMO soybeans, such as tofu, kefir, and soy protein, and nuts and seeds, such as pistachios, sesame seeds, and peanuts. Supplementing with 100-200 mg of a high-absorption CoQ10 per day is an option, especially if you use a statin drug to lower cholesterol. And at Number 1, we have “Omega-3 Fatty acids”. Studies have revealed that consuming ample amounts of omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce blood lipid levels, LDL cholesterol, inflammation, and high blood pressure. The Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, are best sourced from fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and herring. Additionally, alpha-linolenic acid – a plant-based Omega 3 – is found in high amounts in flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts. The cardiovascular benefits of Omega-3s are related to the ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3. An ideal ratio is 1:1; however, today’s average diet contains a ratio up to 16:1. This is largely due to the consumption of oxidized Omega-6 in refined vegetable oils, such as soybean and corn oil, that are used in processed foods. Studies show that improving the ratio to just 4:1 is associated with a 70% decrease in cardiovascular-related death. When supplementing, take 2-3 grams of a high-quality purified fish oil or krill oil per day. There you have it: the seven nutrients you need to stay on top of to lower your blood pressure. Essentially, you have just been given seven reasons to include more fish, nuts, and vegetables in your weekly diet.

https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20240117/cm/moderation-is-key-when-it-comes-to-drinking,How Much Alcohol Is Safe to Drink? 'Not Much' May Be the Answer,1,"Jan. 17, 2024 – When it comes to alcohol consumption, moderation is everything. Many studies over the past 20 years have suggested that people who have a drink a day or less may have a lower risk of cancer, heart disease, or all-cause mortality than those who abstain from drinking. Yet a growing body of newer research shows that those claims may be a mirage. A JAMA review of 107 studies published from 1980 to 2021 found that occasional or low-volume drinkers did not have a lower risk of all-cause mortality than lifetime nondrinkers did. But there was a significantly increased risk of mortality among those who had a few drinks per day or more. The study, which included nearly 5 million people, found that low-volume drinkers had a significantly lower mortality risk than did lifetime abstainers. After adjusting for biases in the studies, such as non-representative samples and the inclusion of people who used to drink in the abstainer groups, the mortality risk from alcohol consumption increased for all drinking categories but became insignificant for low-volume and occasional drinkers. One reason that might explain the link between moderate drinking and lower mortality risk seen in some studies, the authors said, is that light and moderate drinkers tend to be healthier than abstainers. On average, they have a better diet, exercise more often, and have better dental hygiene than people who don’t drink at all. Why would moderate drinkers engage in healthy behavior to a greater extent than abstainers? William Schaffner, MD, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, said it might be because many of them are religious. “Their abstinence can be an isolated commitment in life, while they go about over-indulging in food and becoming chubby, not exercising, smoking, etc.,” he said. “Those factors don’t always relate to abstaining in that population. So the total abstainers are influenced substantially by religious commitments.” Mirza Rahman, MD, president of the American College of Preventive Medicine, said that good health behavior in areas such as diet, exercise, and sleep may not be enough to reduce the negative impact of moderate drinking. Large studies published in the past several years, he said, have established that no level of drinking is safe. A 2018 review paper in The Lancet, including more than 1,200 studies worldwide, found that while light drinking offers some protection from heart disease, the harmful effects of alcohol on health start with even low-volume drinking. For example, alcohol use had a significant link to cancer in people over 50, especially women. Twenty-seven percent of cancer deaths in women and 19% of those in men were linked to their drinking habits. The JAMA study didn’t go as far as the Lancet article in linking low levels of drinking to mortality risk. While moderate drinking doesn’t equal a health benefit, it also doesn’t seem to raise the risk of death by very much, the authors said. But heavier drinking is definitely dangerous, in their view. The paper also found a significant interaction between the age of study subjects and their mortality risk. While there wasn’t much of a difference in risk between younger and older groups who drank moderately, younger people in the study had greater mortality risks than the older ones at high consumption levels. The study also found that female drinkers had a higher risk of all-cause mortality than male drinkers did. According to Rahman, this finding “might be a surrogate for weight.” While both men and women can be overweight, he said, “women have more fatty adipose tissue and can convert hormones into potentially carcinogenic substances. Heavier women, for example, have a particular risk of breast cancer.” Other studies have looked at claims that light drinking has a health benefit. For example, one study noted that drinking at all levels is linked to a higher risk of high blood pressure and coronary artery disease. But, the study said, “Light to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with healthier lifestyle factors.” Another study found that it is widely assumed that light or moderate drinking is the safest way to to drink alcohol. “Non‐drinkers, both ex‐drinkers and lifelong teetotalers, consistently show an increased prevalence of conditions likely to increase morbidity and mortality compared with occasional or light drinkers. In addition, regular light drinkers tend to have characteristics extremely advantageous to health,” the authors wrote. A third paper goes even further. Of 30 things linked to diseases of your heart and blood vessels, it said, 90% are found more often among nondrinkers, including body weight. Neither Schaffner nor Rahman could explain why light drinkers have a lower risk of all-cause mortality than nondrinkers. But they agreed that alcohol is a major public health challenge, not only in the U.S. but around the world. There are 140,000 alcohol-related deaths in this country each year, Rahman said, and there were 2.8 million deaths globally in 2016, according to the Lancet paper. So whether you raise a glass to Schaffner’s takeaway from the review paper (“don’t drink too much”) or lower it in response to Rahman’s (“don’t drink”), it’s best to imbibe responsibly, if at all.",7,0.21278937,0.20137815,False

https://dailyhealthpost.com/symptoms-of-low-potassium/,Top 10 Symptoms of LOW Potassium You May Be Ignoring,0,"Does your heart regularly skip a beat? Do your muscles cramp up often? Is your thinking slower than it used to be? If any of these sounds like you, this could be because you have lower-than-normal levels of potassium in your body. The medical name for this condition is hypokalemia. A full 98% of the potassium in your body is found in your cells-and for good reason! Potassium is an electrolyte-this means it helps carry electrical signals to cells in your body. Your body uses this electricity to keep fluid balance, transmit nerve signals, and contract muscle cells, particularly the heart muscle cells. Potassium helps your heartbeat stay regular, your kidneys function properly and stop your sodium levels from spiking too high. Potassium deficiency is more common than you think. Studies show that 9 out of 10 Americans—that’s upwards of 290 million people—are only getting about half the 4.7 grams of this essential mineral they need each day. The normal range for blood potassium is between 3.5 to 5.5 mmol/L. Below this level, hypokalemia occurs. Very low levels of potassium in the body (less than 2.5 mmol/L) can lead to irregular heart rhythms and trigger cardiac arrest—which can be deadly. So, what causes a potassium deficiency, and what are the symptoms that warn you of low potassium? How can you restore your potassium? This is exactly what we’ll talk about in the rest of this video. First, let’s look at what causes hypokalemia. A potassium deficiency is rarely caused by a low intake of fruits and vegetables alone. The most common cause of low potassium is excessive loss through urine. This happens in people who take prescription medications called diuretics or water pills, which make them urinate more often. These medications are often prescribed for high blood pressure or heart disease. Another reason is the excessive loss of potassium in your digestive tract. This may be due to frequent vomiting, diarrhea, or laxative use. Other physical conditions that contribute to potassium loss include: Eating disorders such as bulimia. Excessive sweating. Chronic Kidney Disease. Other medications such as insulin and antibiotics. Excessive alcohol use. Low magnesium levels. Magnesium actively transports potassium across your cells. So when your magnesium levels dip, your potassium levels suffer too. Next, what are the symptoms of hypokalemia? Often, the symptoms of low potassium are easily overlooked, until they become serious. Let’s begin with our Number 10. “High Blood Pressure”. High blood pressure, or hypertension, can be caused by excess weight, genetics, or eating a lot of processed foods that are high in sodium. Maintaining healthy blood pressure requires the perfect balance of electrolytes. Potassium and sodium are electrolytes that work inversely in the body. When you eat potassium-rich foods, your kidneys get rid of excess sodium through urine. If your cells don’t have enough potassium, the kidneys reabsorb sodium back into the blood vessels, and your body holds on to more water. Extra water in your blood means there is extra pressure on your blood vessel walls, and this raises your blood pressure. Potassium helps to widen blood vessels and lower blood pressure. Coming up next, Number 9 is “Irregular Heartbeat”. For most people, heart palpitations or a skipped heartbeat now and then are not a big deal. But if you have low potassium levels, this can cause cardiac arrhythmias or an irregular heartbeat, especially for people who are at risk of heart disease. This is because low potassium levels change the flow of potassium in and out of heart cells. As a result, electrical signals that control your heartbeat don’t work properly, and your heart beats too fast, too slow, or irregularly. If you notice any changes to your heart rate, seek medical attention right away. Next up, we have Number 8. “Muscle Weakness and Cramps”. If you often experience painful cramps in your legs, a lack of potassium could be to blame. This is because you lose electrolytes, including potassium, after an intense workout. Potassium is important for muscles because it helps relay signals from your brain to make them contract. It also helps end these contractions by leaving the muscle cells. When blood potassium levels are low, your brain cannot relay these signals as effectively. This can be a problem for athletes because it can lead to reduced blood flow and problems with the muscles contracting. Cramps are unlikely with mild or moderate hypokalemia, but they may occur if potassium levels drop below 2.5 mmol/L. In rare cases, severe hypokalemia can also cause rhabdomyolysis in which muscle tissue breaks down quickly, often resulting in kidney damage. Therefore, it’s recommended to take electrolytes before, during, and after vigorous exercise. Our Number 7 is “Weakness and Fatigue.” A lack of potassium can lead to weakness and fatigue for two reasons. First, potassium helps regulate muscle contractions. When blood potassium levels are low, your muscles produce weaker contractions. Second, low potassium also causes your body to release less insulin. This leads to high blood sugar levels, which means less sugar is converted by your cells into energy. Many factors can make you feel weak, which makes it hard to pinpoint low potassium as the cause. However, if you’re feeling exhausted after working out and getting enough sleep, low potassium levels might be the cause. Coming up, Number 6 is “Digestive Issues”. Low levels of potassium can cause constipation. Potassium helps relay signals from your brain to the muscles in your digestive tract so they can contract and propel food along. When potassium levels drop, the contractions become weaker and the churning of food slows down. If potassium levels drop too low, the intestines may stop moving and this can cause nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, bloating, and abdominal pain. Are you enjoying the information? Make sure you like, share and subscribe and click on notifications so you never miss a video. Next on the list is Number 5, “Frequent Urination”. Low potassium levels may prevent your kidneys from concentrating urine and keeping electrolyte levels balanced. This can lead to excessive urination (polyuria) and excessive thirst (polydipsia). Excessive urination may lead to lower potassium levels. Seek medical attention if your frequency of urination changes suddenly. Next up, Number 4 is “Tingling and Numbness”. Low potassium levels can weaken nerve signals and lead to tingling and numbness in the hands, arms, legs, and feet. This condition is called paresthesia. When you sit in an uncomfortable position, this may cause tingling and numbness—and is no cause for concern. However, when these symptoms persist, it’s time to seek medical attention. Getting into our top 3, Number 3 is “Breathing Difficulties”. If your blood potassium levels are severely low, it can cause shortness of breath by restricting the expansion and contraction of your lungs. This is because potassium is vital for sending the right signals to the lungs so they know when to contract and expand. One study found that people with low blood potassium levels or high blood potassium levels (hyperkalemia) were at a much higher risk of respiratory failure and needing a ventilator in the hospital, compared to people who had healthy potassium levels. As mentioned earlier, low potassium levels can cause an irregular heartbeat because of faulty electrical signals in the lower heart chambers. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to the rest of the body. Less blood means less oxygen delivered and this may cause shortness of breath. Number 2 is “Brain Fog and Mood Swings.” When potassium levels are low, the neurons in your brain cannot fire electrical signals rapidly. This results in confusion, forgetfulness, and difficulty concentrating. A lack of potassium can reduce blood circulation and disrupt hormone production. This includes the mood-regulating hormone, serotonin. A potassium deficiency may manifest through severe changes in mood and behavior, such as increased depression, anxiety, or irritability. One study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that people who ate a low-sodium, high-potassium diet enjoyed reduced stress and depression while also having more energy. And at Number 1, we have “Kidney Stones”. It is estimated that over 1 in 10 people will have a kidney stone in their lives. If you develop kidney stones, they may be a sign of low potassium. In one study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993, men who took in less than 2.9 grams of potassium daily were twice as likely to develop kidney stones as those who took in over 4 grams of potassium daily. Kidney stones are hard masses of minerals and other substances that form crystals inside your kidneys. These small stones are most commonly made up of calcium and oxalate. When these stones become lodged in the urinary tract and block the flow of urine, they can cause excruciating pain. Potassium helps your kidneys flush excess calcium through your urine. If you don’t get enough potassium in your diet, this can cause the masses to form. Next, how do you get more potassium? The best way to replenish potassium is to add fruits and vegetables to each meal. This includes bananas, but there are plenty of other foods that contain potassium. You can find it in whole foods like leafy greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, eggplant, avocado, pumpkins, potatoes, carrots, raisins, beans, dairy products like milk and yogurt, meat, poultry, fish, and nuts. Your doctor may prescribe supplements if you have a medical condition or are taking specific medications. If your case is more severe, your doctor may give you potassium intravenously. If you decide to supplement with potassium on your own, talk to your doctor first. As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors.

https://www.webmd.com/obesity/news/20240111/cm/no-link-between-obesity-diabetes-drugs-and-suicidal-thoughts,"No Link Between Obesity, Diabetes Drugs and Suicidal Thoughts",1,"Jan. 11, 2024 -- The FDA said Thursday that a review of a class of popular diabetes and obesity drugs found no connection between the medications and a rise in suicidal thoughts. The drugs include Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro. The FDA urges anyone with concerns to talk to their health care provider and said “a small risk may exist” since a link has not been completely ruled out. NBC News noted that the announcement came after research was published last week showing that people taking semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, had a lower risk of suicidal thoughts than patients taking other drugs for obesity and diabetes. European officials had said earlier that they were looking into unscientific reports that some people taking semaglutide had thoughts about hurting themselves. “FDA's preliminary evaluation has not found evidence that use of these medicines causes suicidal thoughts or actions,” the FDA said Thursday. The agency is reviewing reports about more than a dozen drugs approved since 2005 known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. These medicines help control blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of heart disease in people with Type 2 diabetes. Some of these drugs are also used by obese or overweight people to lose weight. The FDA said it will continue to look into the situation. Patients with concerns should not stop taking their medication without speaking to their health care professional first, the FDA advised.

https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20240110/cm/at-home-covid-tests-now-taking-longer-to-show-positive-result,At-Home COVID Tests Now Taking Longer to Show Positive Result,1,"Jan. 10, 2024 – Some health care providers are warning that it can now take longer after COVID symptoms appear for tests to return a positive result. Rapid tests that people typically use at home may not turn positive until the 4th day after symptoms appear. Earlier in the pandemic, many rapid tests returned positive results after 1 or 2 days of symptoms. “It’s actually pushing back the time that people’s COVID tests are coming up positive. So some people are testing at day 1 and day 2 and saying, ‘Oh, it’s negative, I don’t have COVID,’” Elizabeth Hudson, DO, regional chief of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, told the Los Angeles Times. “If they probably tested themselves a couple of days later, there’s a pretty good chance that it actually would turn out to be COVID.” The CDC still advises that people who have any of 11 common COVID symptoms like a fever or cough to test immediately. If using an at-home rapid test, also known as an antigen test, anyone who gets a negative result should re-test after 48 hours, the CDC says. Another option is to take a more sensitive type of test called a PCR test. For people who know they’ve been exposed to COVID but do not have symptoms, the instructions from the CDC for testing are slightly different. Absent of symptoms but with a known COVID exposure, people should wait at least 5 full days before testing. For people with no symptoms who take two at-home rapid tests spaced 48 hours apart and the test is negative both times, the CDC recommends taking a third test another 48 hours later. People who test positive should isolate and take other precautions, including contacting a health care provider to see if certain treatments, like taking antivirals, are needed, the CDC says. People who were exposed but don’t have symptoms should take precautions like masking for 10 full days, the CDC instructs. One possibility for positive results taking longer may be due to the immunity levels people have accumulated at this point in the pandemic, from vaccinations or previous infections, Hudson told the Times. Going to a health care provider to get the more sensitive PCR test would likely return a positive result sooner for people who are infected, Hudson said. Antigen tests are accurate about 80% of the time, compared to a 95% accuracy rate of PCR tests, according to FDA information published in 2022. Free at-home COVID tests can still be ordered online at the government website COVID.gov. Adults who are uninsured or who have certain insurance like Medicare, Medicaid, coverage through Veterans Affairs, or coverage through the Indian Health Service may be eligible for free testing and free virtual medical appointments if they are positive through the Home Test To Treat program. The CDC also now offers a special webpage to search for nearby, no-cost COVID testing.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/detox-your-arteries-with-this-drink/,Detox Your Arteries With This Drink,0,"Today, we look at how you can lower bad LDL cholesterol and detox your arteries with three natural foods. We also give you a recipe for a drink made with these 3 ingredients. Although cholesterol is essential for the body, having too much of one type can be dangerous. If you eat a lot of junk food and sugar, it can ruin your cardiovascular health. This is because when you eat unhealthy foods, it can cause bad cholesterol and fat to build up in your arteries. This makes it harder for your heart to function properly. Many people use blood thinners and statins to lower their cholesterol levels. However, you can also manage your cholesterol levels by eating the right foods. In this article, we will show you how to do this. High cholesterol specifically refers to high levels of oxidized cholesterol. When cholesterol is oxidized, it can cause a build-up of plaque in the artery walls. This can lead to a condition called atherosclerosis, which is when the arteries become narrower and hardened. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, cellular waste products and fibrin that build up on the inside of our arterial walls, which damages the existing cells and cause inflammation. This makes it harder for cells and tissues to get the oxygen and nutrients they need. Arteries that are stiff and narrow can impair blood flow throughout the body, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke in the brain. Now, what is oxidized cholesterol? Cholesterol is mainly comprised of two main types: LDL and HDL. HDL or “good” cholesterol helps to take away cholesterol that is not needed. This type of cholesterol goes back to your liver so it can be cleared away. LDL cholesterol is “bad” because it transports fat and cholesterol throughout your body. Too much of it can build up in the walls of your arteries, which can lead to health problems. We now know that LDL cholesterol only poses a health risk if it is oxidized. Cholesterol and fat that have been oxidized are the enemies of a healthy body. Our bodies treat these as harmful substances and stimulate cytokines to damage and kill them with inflammation. Because LDL cholesterol is highly oxidation-prone, an increase in LDL cholesterol levels normally causes a corresponding rise in coronary artery disease risk. There are two sources of the oxidized cholesterol that clogs our arteries and causes coronary artery disease. One. Some of the fats and oils we eat are oxidized. That means that they turn into chemicals that can damage cells. Two. We produce the rest of it internally. Oils and fats go rancid more quickly when they’re heated, dried, aged, exposed to light or otherwise chemically processed. A diet rich in vegetable oils is unquestionably dangerous, and should be avoided. Did you know that sugar oxidizes just like oils and fats? Many oxidation products are produced when glucose, and especially fructose, is heated or processed in any way. Numerous studies have illustrated that individuals who are in danger of heart attacks and require bypass surgery often have high oxidized LDL cholesterol, not normal LDL cholesterol. The good news is, you can consume antioxidants through food to stop free radicals and repair the damage they’ve done to cells and organs. Next, a 3-ingredient cholesterol-lowering recipe: This drink is packed with nutrients that help break down unhealthy cholesterol and clear your arteries, perfect for aiding your journey to a healthier lifestyle. Ingredients: 1 gallon (4 liters) of clean water. Organic lemons – 8 Organic garlic – 8 cloves 1.9 inches (4-5 cm) of organic ginger Instructions: Thoroughly clean the lemons by scrubbing the rind, but do not peel them. After you slice the lemon, peel the ginger and garlic. After you crush the garlic, let it sit for 15 minutes. This will activate the allicin, which is a powerful and medicinal compound. that gives garlic its benefits. Add all ingredients to the blender except for the water and pulse until smooth. In a saucepan, add the paste to water and heat over medium flame. As soon as it starts to boil, take the mixture off the heat. After the liquid has cooled, strain it. Pour your drink into glass jars or bottles with lids and store them in the fridge. How to Use: For best results, drink this daily on an empty stomach two hours before meals. Combine this protocol with exercise three times a week for best results. How It Works. Ginger. Dried ginger powder, administered at 0.1 g/kg of body weight per day, has been shown to reduce the risk of atheroma by up to 50% in as little as 75 days. Atheroma and plaque are terms used to describe the build-up of fatty deposits and scar tissue in the walls of arteries. This can restrict blood circulation and increase the risk of blood clots. Ginger can help prevent heart disease by keeping platelets from accumulating in arteries. It also reduces plasma cholesterol. Not only does it not have the negative side effects, but it is just as effective as other medication such as aspirin. Garlic. Garlic has been used for centuries as a preventative measure against heart conditions such as atherosclerosis. Not only does it lower cholesterol and blood pressure, but it also strengthens the immune system. A 4-year study concluded that those who took 900 mg of standardized garlic powder daily had a significantly lower development of atherosclerosis. In addition, it contains antioxidants that scavenge harmful free radicals, helping to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease. Lemons. The regular intake of lemons and daily walks helped to lower blood pressure and increase the number of red blood cells. Lemon also helps the liver detox and clear excess cholesterol. And that’s your cholesterol-lowering drink! SOURCES",3,0.4933957,0.20067881,False
https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20240108/cm/flu-rates-swell-post-holidays-covid-severity-down-cdc,"Flu Rates Swell Post-Holidays, but COVID Is Less Severe: CDC",1,"Jan. 8, 2023 – Flu season continues to worsen nationwide, as 38 states have high or very high levels of the respiratory virus known for causing an onslaught of symptoms like a fever, sore throat, runny nose, and body aches. January and February are the typical months for flu to peak, but it’s unclear whether this year’s edition of the virus’s annual rampage will become even more fierce. Health officials predict it will, at the very least, stay this bad for a while. “We expect it to be elevated for several more weeks,” Alicia Budd, MPH, of the CDC’s influenza Division, told The Associated Press. She said that so far, this year’s flu season has been moderate. Last week, CDC Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, predicted the flu would peak by the end of January, the AP reported. More than 20,000 people were hospitalized for the flu during the week ending Dec. 30, up significantly from just under 15,000 the week prior. Health officials use hospitalization as an indication how severely the flu is affecting people. The latest data shows that nearly 1 in 5 flu tests are coming back positive. On the COVID front, the variant JN.1 continues to expand. It now accounts for 62% of cases in the U.S., up from 44% 2 weeks ago. It’s also the most common variant worldwide. The CDC said in a Friday update that COVID activity nationwide is high, but cases are less severe than earlier in the pandemic. “Wastewater viral levels, in particular, have increased rapidly over the last several weeks,” the update stated. “By comparison, measures of COVID-19-related illness requiring medical attention, such as emergency department visit rates, have also increased, but to a lesser extent and remain 21% lower than they were at the same time the year before.” Another sign that COVID cases tend to be less severe is that the hospitalization rate is 22% lower than a year ago, and deaths linked to COVID are much lower, too. The CDC said the COVID cases are less severe not because of the virus's traits, but because 97% of people have some immunity from vaccines, prior infection, or both. “This immune protection can fade over time but tends to last longer for preventing severe disease than for preventing infections,” the CDC explained in the Friday update, noting that “not enough Americans are vaccinated.” “As of December 30, 2023, only 8% of children and 19% of adults report having received the updated COVID-19 vaccine. Only 38% of adults age 65 years and older report having received this vaccine, which is concerning given that they are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID-19.” Meanwhile, cases of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) appear to be on the decline. CDC data showed 9,083 cases nationwide for the week ending Dec. 30, down from a monthlong stretch of more than 11,000 weekly cases.",4,-0.3010614,0.22139682,False

Right lower corner image source. by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News The Western media narrative today continued to portray the bombing and murder of Arab children in the occupied territory of the Golan Heights over the weekend as a “terrorist attack” by Hezbollah against Israeli citizens, while the voices of the Arabs who actually live there and experienced these horrible deaths are not being reported. Fox News is an example of this media charade that completely ignores the voices of the victims: The looming Israeli reaction against the Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorist movement in Lebanon is said to be imminent in response to the group’s rocket attack on a children’s soccer field on Saturday, resulting in the murders of 12 young people. On Monday, Netanyahu visited Majdal Shams and announced on X that Israel’s response to the massacre of children at the location “will come and it will be severe.” Netanyahu told the Druze Israeli community: “We are brothers. We have a covenant of life but, I regret that it is also a covenant of bereavement and sorrow. We embrace you.” (Source.) “We are brothers”?? Seriously? How are these Syrian Arabs in the occupied Golan Heights any different from the Arabs in occupied Gaza and the occupied West Bank? Has he ever called them “brothers”? What is not being reported in most Western media outlets is that the local people protested his coming, and even tried to stop him, calling him a war criminal. The families of the children who were murdered refused to meet with Netanyahu. Residents of the occupied Syrian Majdal Shams village demonstrated against Netanyahu on Monday and blasted him as a “war criminal” and “child killer”. Syrian residents of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan attempted to kick out Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the village, calling him a “fascist” and a “criminal”, the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported. Netanyahu had arrived in Majdal Shams, where a vicious strike killed 12 children on the town’s football field, alongside a convoy of high-ranking security officials. Netanyahu, Israeli officials, and politicians are accusing the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon of firing a rocket at the town, a claim that Hezbollah categorically rejects. The Israeli Prime Minister spoke from the football field on Monday, pledging a “harsh response”. Netanyahu and other officials have seized the opportunity, provided by the atrocious massacre, weaponizing it in order to justify a presumably intense aggression on Lebanon. “Hezbollah, with Iranian backing, launched an Iranian rocket here, which took the lives of 12 pure souls,” Netanyahu said as he built up a justification for a controversial attack on Lebanon. Netanyahu also said that his “heart is torn apart by the severe tragedy,” failing to realize his responsibility for the blood of at least 16,000 Palestinian children in the Gaza Strip. How did the residents of Majdal Shams confront Netanyahu? Al Mayadeen’s correspondent in the occupied territories reported that Netanyahu arrived in Majdal Shams at around 2:00 pm (local time) and was received by the town’s council chief in a local administrative building. Netanyahu entered through the back door of the building to avoid being seen. It is worth noting that the chief is appointed by the Israeli occupation’s government. After news had gotten around to the town’s residents, hundreds gathered outside the said building, protesting Netanyahu’s visit to the occupied Syrian town. The demonstrators berated the Israeli Prime Minister, denouncing him as a “child killer” and a “criminal”. Netanyuahu’s visit to the town did not last for more than 15 minutes, locals told Al Mayadeen, after the incident had enraged residents who refused to receive the Israeli Prime Minister. Al Mayadeen also found that several locals refused to allow Israeli occupation forces to use their homes and rooftops as guarding points on Monday morning, ahead of Netanyahu’s arrival. The residents were told that an official would visit the town, however, the official’s identity was not revealed to locals until it was reported in Israeli media outlets. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said the representatives of some of the families that fell victim to the attack on Majdal Shams refused to meet with Netanyahu. Authorities attempted to arrange a meeting between the Prime Minister and the victims’ families, but it failed due to the families’ refusal. (Full article.) As to whose rocket blast killed these innocent children, here is the Arab version. Israel says an Iranian-made rocket was used in the incident, yet Hezbollah insists that a misfired Iron Dome missile was responsible On Saturday, an explosive slammed into a football pitch in the Golan Heights’ Majdal Shams, killing 12 children. The apparent attack ratcheted up tensions between Israel, which occupies the Golan, and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which began clashing with the Israeli military along the Lebanese border in October in solidarity with Hamas and the Palestinians under attack in Gaza. Though the slain children were not Israeli citizens – Druze that live in the occupied Syrian territory tend not to take Israeli citizenship – Israel has blamed Hezbollah and insisted that it will retaliate in Lebanon. Hezbollah denies it was responsible, saying the children were killed instead by a misfired Israeli Iron Dome air-defence missile. Middle East Eye breaks down the claims and counter-claims on the incident in Majdal Shams. Israel’s claims Israel has brought forward what it says is evidence to prove that an Iranian-made rocket struck the children. Iran is a key backer of Hezbollah, which is the most powerful non-state military power in the world. On Sunday, the Israeli army posted pictures that show shrapnel, which it said were found at the scene of the attack and matched an Iranian-made Falaq-1 rocket. However, none of the images appear to have been taken of the alleged rocket shrapnel in situ at the blast site. The Israeli army also published a map showing what it said was path of the rocket, claiming it was launched from southeast Lebanon’s Shebaa Farms area. Yet, these claims were refuted by an anonymous Israeli paramedic, who told al-Araby TV that witnesses told him the shrapnel belonged to an Israeli Iron Dome missile. The paramedic, who was reportedly wearing a Star of David shirt, said he would be “imprisoned” if he documented his testimony on air. Middle East Eye was not able to independently verify the claims. Other witnesses who spoke to al-Araby on condition of anonymity said they saw the rocket flying from Mount Hermon on the Lebanon-Syrian border falling towards the football field. Al-Mayadeen, a Lebanese media outlet with close ties to Hezbollah, published an article saying the blast site in Majdal Shams was not consistent with the kind expected after the impact of a Falaq-1 rocket, which it said would have made a larger crater. Hezbollah had earlier on Saturday claimed responsibility for four other attacks before Majdal Shams was struck. Read the full article. Image source. Meanwhile, in a story that was barely mentioned in the Western media last week, 14 Palestinian factions met in Beijing, China, to sign the “Beijing Declaration on Ending Division and Strengthening Palestinian National Unity“. On July 23, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi attended in Beijing the closing ceremony of the reconciliation talks of Palestinian factions and witnessed the signing of the Beijing Declaration on Ending Division and Strengthening Palestinian National Unity by 14 Palestinian factions. In his remarks, Wang Yi noted that since entering the new era, President Xi Jinping has put forward proposals and propositions on addressing the Palestinian question, contributing Chinese wisdom and solution for addressing the question. Now, 14 Palestinian factions are gathering in Beijing with the greater good of their nation in mind. This is an important historical moment in the Palestinian liberation cause. China commends the reconciliation efforts made by all the factions, and congratulates them on the success of the Beijing dialogue and the signing of the Beijing Declaration. (Source.) China, of course, is part of BRICS, and Pepe Escobar discusses the significance of China supporting the Palestinian cause. The Beijing Declaration cements the idea that global conflict resolution is now Made in China. But it also throws a wrench in US–Israeli efforts to manufacture a collaborator Palestinian government after the war in Gaza. HONG KONG – The Beijing Declaration, signed earlier this week, constitutes yet another stunning Chinese diplomatic coup, but the document goes far beyond affirming China’s pull. The gathering of representatives of 14 Palestinian factions to commit to full reconciliation showed the entire world that the road to solving intractable geopolitical problems is no longer unilateral: it is multipolar, multi-nodal, and features BRICS/Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) member China as an inescapable leader. The concept of China as a peacemaking superpower is now so established that after the Iran–Saudi Arabia rapprochement and the signing of the Beijing Declaration, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba chose to tell his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing that Kiev is now finally ready to negotiate the end of the NATO–Russia proxy war in Ukraine. Palestinians who came to Beijing were beaming. For Fatah Vice Chairman Mahmoud al-Aloul, “China is a light. China’s efforts are rare on the international stage.” Hamas spokesman Hussam Badran said the Palestinian resistance movement accepted the Chinese invitation “with a positive spirit and patriotic responsibility.” All Palestinian factions have reached a consensus on “Palestinian demands to end the war,” adding that the “most important” part of the declaration is to form a government that builds Palestinian national consensus to “manage the affairs of the people of Gaza and the West Bank, oversee reconstruction, and create conditions for elections.” (Read the full article.) As I publish this early on Monday, 7/29/24, Israel’s Security Cabinet has allegedly approved an all out war against Lebanon and escalated the war in the Middle East, and it is based on a lie that Lebanon bombed and killed Israeli children, when in fact the children who died were children of Syrian parents who maintain their Syrian identity in the occupied Golan Heights. They are no more Netanyahu’s “brothers” than the Palestinians are, but most Americans will trust Netanyahu anyway, as is evidenced by the numerous standing ovations he received last week in the U.S. Congress celebrating his lies.",2,-0.21917447,-0.35610622,False

In fact, taking Wegovy and Ozempic resulted in reduced risk of suicide ideation, compared to non-semaglutide drugs, researchers from Case Western Reserve University found. Researchers examined electronic health data on 240,258 U.S. patients prescribed Wegovy or other drugs for weight loss and about 1.6 million people taking Ozempic or other drugs for type 2 diabetes. At 6 months, people taking Wegovy had a 73% lower risk of first-time suicidal ideation and a 56% lower risk of recurrent suicidal ideation, compared to users of other weight loss drugs, the study said. People taking Ozempic had a 64% and a 49% lower risk of first-time and recurrent suicide ideation, respectively, compared to people taking other drugs. The study is significant because the FDA said this week that it is investigating reports that people who took those drugs had suicidal thoughts or two other health problems. “These findings provide evidence that semaglutide, which helps regulate appetite and insulin levels by targeting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptors (GLP1R) in the body, does not appear to increase the risk of suicidal ideation, contrary to the claims of some anecdotal reports,” the National Institutes of Health said in a media advisory published Friday. “Outside of anecdotal and case reports, this association had not yet been explored by comprehensive studies.” The National Institutes of Health backed the study done by Case Western researchers. Case Western researchers said they launched their study after European health regulators announced last summer that they were studying reports linking semaglutide and suicidal ideation. “The exploding popularity of this drug makes it imperative to understand all its potential complications,” study co-author Pamela Davis, MD, PhD, of Case Western Reserve School of Medicine said in a statement. “It’s important to know that prior suggestions that the drug might trigger suicidal thoughts is not borne out in this very large and diverse population in the U.S.”",8,0.09379378,0.2039917,False

Image Source. by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News While the U.S. Media is echoing the claims of Benjamin Netanyahu and others in his cabinet that Lebanon shot a rocket into the Israeli occupied territory of the Golan Heights which killed 12 children, which were Syrian Arab children and NOT Jewish children, Syria and other nations in the region are reporting that this tragedy was a false flag attack by Israel itself. Hezbollah has obviously denied attacking their fellow Arabs, which doesn’t even make any sense, especially because Hezbollah has not shied away from taking responsibility for REAL attacks they have made into Israel, as it makes them a hero in eyes of the people in the Middle East. This obvious false flag attack by Israel is apparently being used to justify an all-out war against Lebanon. Here is the Arab side of this tragic event: “Israel’s” actions are an attempt to escalate tensions in the region by scapegoating the Lebanese resistance over the incident as a means for the Israeli regime to justify its daily aggressions. SANA reported on Sunday that the Syrian government holds “Israel” accountable for committing a brutal massacre in Majdal Shams on Saturday. According to a statement published by the Syrian Foreign and Expatriates Ministry, “Israel’s” actions are an attempt to escalate tensions in the region by scapegoating the Lebanese resistance over the incident as a means for the Israeli regime to justify its daily aggressions. “As part of attempts to escalate the situation in the region, the Israeli occupation entity committed a heinous crime on Saturday in Majdal Shams town and then held the Lebanese National Resistance accountable for this crime,” the statement read. It further condemned the systematic aggressions committed by the Israeli regime and warned that the current pace of events would trigger a region-wide escalation. Syria also reaffirmed that the people in the occupied Golan, who have persevered in maintaining their Syrian identity for decades, will not be deceived by “Israel’s” scapegoating strategies. The statement added that the residents of the Syrian Golan remain an integral part of the resistance against the occupier and its aggressive policies that violate their land and identity. On Saturday, an Israeli Iron Dome interceptor missile struck a playground in the town, which is made up entirely of Druze Syrians, killing at least 12 civilians, including children, and wounding at least a dozen others. “Israel” was quick to pin the blame on Hezbollah and claimed that the Lebanese group targeted the town with an “Iranian rocket”. (Source.) Members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party even allegedly tried to attend the Arab funeral trying to show their fake support, but were allegedly attacked instead. (I’m sure the Zionists are blaming this on Hezbollah as well.) The Israeli Channel 13 reported that residents of Majdal Shams attacked members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party who attended the funeral. Meanwhile, the Israeli news website Walla mentioned that Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was met with rejection and protests upon his arrival in the town. (Source.) Here is a good primer on the Israeli occupied Golan Heights that CNN published: The Golan Heights is a strategic plateau that Israeli seized from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967, before formally annexing it in 1981. The hilly landscape, which spans some 500 square miles, also shares a border with Jordan and Lebanon. Syria’s capital Damascus is visible from atop the rocky Golan. The Israeli-occupied part of the region is separated from Syria by a buffer zone supported by the United Nations. The Golan Heights is considered to be occupied territory under international law and UN Security Council resolutions, and Syria continues to demand it be returned. The area has often been a flashpoint, most recently in 2019 when former President Donald Trump said the US will recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights – a move that overturned years of policy and worsened tensions with Syria. Israel sees the Golan Heights as key to its national security interests and says it needs to control the region to fend off threats from Syria and Iranian proxy groups there. (Source.) Israel’s Security Counsel is reportedly meeting today (Sunday) to plan a new military offensive into Lebanon, something that will escalate the situation in the Middle East. Israeli jets struck southern Lebanon overnight as diplomats worked frantically to prevent a regional war after a rocket strike that killed 12 children in the occupied Golan Heights. Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, visited the scene of Saturday’s rocket attack in Majdal Shams, a predominantly Druze village, calling the strike “a terrible tragedy”. The attack killed 12 children between the ages of 10 and 16 as they were playing football and wounded dozens more. “Hezbollah is responsible for it and they will pay the price,” said Gallant on Sunday, as thousands of mourners gathered in the village for the victims’ funeral ceremonies. The Israeli foreign ministry echoed his message, saying the Lebanese militant group had “crossed all red lines”, and accused them of having deliberately targeted civilians. The White House agreed in a statement the attack had been “conducted by Lebanese Hezbollah”. “It was their rocket, and launched from an area they control,” it added. Washington had been in discussions with Israeli and Lebanese officials since the attack, it added. Hezbollah has denied responsibility for the strike, claiming that a projectile from Israel’s Iron Dome defence system had hit the town, countering a volley of rocket fire the group said had targeted Israeli military sites. In an apparent initial retaliation for the attack, Israel conducted a series of airstrikes on towns in southern Lebanon overnight on Saturday, as well as one close to the Bekaa valley. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is convening his security cabinet on Sunday afternoon. The outcome of the meeting is expected to be decisive, as diplomats scramble to prevent any further escalation in fighting that they fear could spiral into a regional war. (Source.) So Israel’s Zionists are now planning on blowing this situation wide open into a full-blown war, even though this particular incident killed NO JEWS, only Arabs, no matter which side’s version is true.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/spice-reverse-clogged-arteries/,1 Spice May Help Reverse Clogged Arteries and Lower Blood Pressure,0,"Cayenne pepper has been used as a natural medicine for centuries, and its popularity is only increasing. Cayenne pepper contains capsaicin, which is a compound that has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cardio-protective properties. THIS spice reverses hypertension… When it comes to heart health, read on to learn about the powerful benefits of what cayenne pepper can do for you. In animal studies, cayenne pepper was found to improve blood flow and regulate cardiac function. It also inhibited the growth of cancer cells in test tubes. These findings suggest that cayenne pepper may be able to help reduce the risk of heart disease or stroke. The anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties of capsaicin in cayenne pepper help to reduce the formation of fatty plaques, arteries, and blood vessels. By lowering blood pressure and increasing the release of nitric oxide and other vasodilators, capsaicin promotes blood flow to tissues. Your arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to all parts of the body. Arteries have smooth muscle cells that help control blood pressure and contract the vessel walls in response to stress or excitement. Now, because we’re under lots of stress, and cortisol and adrenaline being raised, what happens is the sympathetic nervous system causes your blood vessels to constrict. Vasoconstriction is the term used to describe the narrowing of blood vessels due to a decrease in blood flow. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, icy hands and feet, dizziness, headache, and fatigue. Now, in order for blood to flow through the arteries to those cells and organs of the body, the heart must pump harder, thus increasing blood pressure. However, cayenne pepper and nitric oxide boosters help to keep the arteries open. Capsaicin keeps your blood pressure in check, and takes pressure off your heart, allowing for adequate circulation to all cells of your body so you can stay healthy. By increasing blood circulation, cayenne pepper helps lower plaque formation in the arteries. The anti-inflammatory properties of cayenne pepper are what make it so powerful. It inhibits the development of inflammation in the arteries which triggers plaque accumulation. It also helps reduce LDL, or bad cholesterol, which is the nasty cholesterol that forms as plaque in the inner layer of our arterial walls. Capsaicin and cayenne pepper, according to studies, also boost your metabolism. When your metabolism rises, you use energy faster to burn fat stores, resulting in an increase in metabolism. It also decreases your appetite, resulting in a sense of fullness that encourages you to eat less. So here’s the bottom line. Yes, cayenne pepper may help you burn more calories. It may help you lose weight by stimulating your metabolism. And when your arteries are healthy, it will have a significant impact on your cardiovascular system. By taking cayenne pepper, hopefully we can avoid heart attacks and strokes, but the most important thing is the powerful anti-inflammatories and antioxidants can be really beneficial for your health. So how often should you take it? There isn’t enough scientific evidence to recommend any specific dosage schedule for cayenne pepper; however, experts usually recommend taking small doses regularly throughout the day (for example, adding 1 or 2 tablespoons to your food or take it raw). Taking large doses at once might not be effective because it could cause nausea or other side effects.",3,0.34241468,0.12862094,False
https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20240102/cm/signs-point-toward-post-holiday-surge-respiratory-viruses,Signs Point Toward Post-Holiday Surge in Respiratory Viruses,1,"Jan. 2, 2024 – The big three respiratory illnesses of the flu, COVID-19, and RSV are showing up at high levels across the country, and further increases due to holiday gatherings are expected. The rate of testing positive for one of the viruses that causes those three main respiratory illnesses is now well above 10% nationwide, with the flu being the most likely culprit. New national data shows that 16% of flu tests are now returning positive and nearly 13% of COVID and RSV tests are positive. The CDC cautioned that some of these figures, which include cases diagnosed through Dec. 23, may be undercounts due to possible data reporting delays. “Remember, all of these numbers are before people got together for the holidays,” Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN. “So don’t be disappointed or surprised that we [may] even see a bigger bump as we head into January.” Six states are now seeing respiratory illnesses at the highest levels of the CDC’s 13-level severity reporting system: Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Nationwide, respiratory illnesses accounted for 8 of every 100 visits to emergency rooms during the week ending Dec. 23, the CDC reported. Public health officials typically watch how many people are being hospitalized due to an illness to see how severe circulating strains are and also to monitor the strain on health care systems. For the week ending Dec. 23, more than 14,700 people were hospitalized for the flu nationwide, and 29,059 people were hospitalized due to COVID. But hospital occupancy rates for any health problem are holding relatively steady around 76% of beds filled nationally, CDC data shows. Wastewater monitoring of COVID, as well as of the flu and RSV, from the private firm Biobot showed more detections in recent weeks for both COVID and the flu, with RSV potentially dipping lower in the week ending Dec. 23. CDC data for RSV case counts also showed a sizable week-over-week drop for that time period. Vaccines are available to protect against severe cases of the flu, COVID, and RSV. Antiviral treatments are available, too, for people who are diagnosed, including Tamiflu to treat the flu and Paxlovid to treat COVID.",4,-0.32061717,0.24539267,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/tablespoon-of-olive-oil/,"1 Tablespoon of Olive Oil Reduces Heart Attack, Clogged Arteries and High Blood Sugar",0,"We look at people in the Mediterranean region that consume a lot of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and their levels of heart disease throughout these nations are so low, and we wonder why. Olive oil not only has polyunsaturated fatty acids but also contains monounsaturated fatty acids, which are beneficial for the heart. Monounsaturated fatty acids help prevent plaque formation by reducing inflammation in the arteries. Too much plaque can impede blood oxygen delivery to the heart, which may lead to a heart attack if it is not treated. Extra virgin olive oil is powerful because of two ingredients. Oleocanthal is the first. It functions as well as Ibuprofen when it comes to pain – it’s a powerful anti-inflammatory agent. Oleocanthal will ease any kind of discomfort you’re having, such as stomach and joint pain, or knee pain. Oleic acid is the second ingredient. The inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein, is lowered by oleic acid, which is the primary fatty acid in olive oil. Oleic acid may help put out the flames of inflammation by lowering C-reactive protein that goes into your bloodstream. Olive oil will do wonders for you if you’re constipated and aren’t regular. It coats and lubricates the intestinal walls and helps you feel better by stimulating peristalsis. Insulin resistance will be improved by olive oil, making you more insulin sensitive. Since it slows down digestion, it will assist with pre-diabetes and diabetes. It allows glucose to enter the cells gradually, rather than putting demands on the pancreas that is producing insulin. And you’ll feel satiated after eating olive oil. Guess what? You’re not going to yearn for that junk food. Olive oil is crucial for weight loss since it will make a significant difference if you consume it. So, how should you take olive oil? The best way is to get up in the morning and take one tablespoon on an empty stomach. Because of its natural, medicinal anti-inflammatory properties, some studies show it may be taken before bed. Sleeping and resting after taking olive oil can be an enormous help for you if you have a lot of inflammation going on. You’ll wake up in the morning feeling refreshed. Don’t underestimate the power of extra virgin olive oil because the research is out there.",3,0.32914087,0.06883277,False
https://www.webmd.com/children/news/20231218/cm/more-kids-under-4-severe-obesity-study,More Kids Under Age 4 Have Severe Obesity: Study,1,"Dec. 18, 2023 – Severe obesity among preschool-age children from low-income families is on the rise in the U.S., according to a new analysis of federal data. An estimated 2% of children ages 2 to 4 years old had severe obesity in 2020, up from 1.8% in 2016, according to the report that appeared Monday in Pediatrics, a journal published by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The increase is “small but significant,” a group of experts not involved in the research wrote in a companion commentary published alongside the research. The new data puts an end to hopes that childhood obesity was on the retreat, since a small decrease had been observed from 2010 to 2016. Instead, the researchers noted that the new childhood obesity figures reflect those of the general population. About 20% of children and teens in the U.S. are obese, and about 42% of adults in the U.S. are obese, according to the CDC. This latest study looked for severe obesity, which was defined as being well above the 95th percentile for the combined height-weight measure known as body mass index. The figures are important because rates of severe obesity among young children can foreshadow health problems that may occur on a scale to warrant concerns among public health officials, policymakers, and health care professionals. Compared to children who have moderate obesity, children with severe obesity “are at a greater risk of various health complications, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and premature death,” the study authors wrote. The largest increases from 2016 to 2020 in severe obesity were observed among 4-year-olds and among Hispanic children. When looking at state-level data, Alaska was the only state to report a decline in severe obesity among young child children from 2016 to 2020. The new estimates were drawn from data on children enrolled in the federal Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also known as WIC. “WIC is a federal assistance program that provides healthy foods, nutrition education, health care referrals, and other services to millions of low-income pregnant and postpartum women, as well as infants and children up to age 5, who are at nutritional risk,” the researchers summarized. The new figures indicate 16.6 million children ages to 2 to 4 years old have severe obesity. Having severe obesity at these early ages is “nearly irreversible,” the authors of the commentary article noted, adding that little research exists that indicates how to effectively treat obesity before age 6. “The study underscores the need for ongoing monitoring ... post-pandemic of children’s health status,” a news release from the American Academy of Pediatrics stated. “It also further supports the need for children and families from households with lower incomes across the nation to have access to early clinical detection, such as healthcare screenings and referrals to effective family-based interventions to support healthy growth.”",7,0.09551132,0.05982618,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/coffee-linked-longer-lifespan/,Popular Drink Linked With Longer Lifespan If You Follow This Rule,0,"Drinking two to three cups of coffee a day is linked with a longer lifespan and lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared with avoiding coffee, according to research published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology. The findings applied to ground, instant and decaffeinated varieties. “In this large, observational study, ground, instant and decaffeinated coffee were associated with equivalent reductions in the incidence of cardiovascular disease and death from cardiovascular disease or any cause,” said study author Professor Peter Kistler of the Baker Heart and Diabetes Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia. “The results suggest that mild to moderate intake of ground, instant and decaffeinated coffee should be considered part of a healthy lifestyle.” There is little information on the impact of different coffee preparations on heart health and survival. This study examined the associations between types of coffee and incident arrhythmias, cardiovascular disease and death using data from the UK Biobank, which recruited adults between 40 and 69 years of age. Cardiovascular disease was comprised of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and ischaemic stroke. The study included 449,563 participants free of arrhythmias or other cardiovascular disease at baseline. The median age was 58 years and 55.3% were women. Participants completed a questionnaire asking how many cups of coffee they drank each day and whether they usually drank instant, ground (such as cappuccino or filtered coffee), or decaffeinated coffee. They were then grouped into six daily intake categories, consisting of none, less than one, one, two to three, four to five, and more than five cups per day. The usual coffee type was instant in 198,062 (44.1%) participants, ground in 82,575 (18.4%), and decaffeinated in 68,416 (15.2%). There were 100,510 (22.4%) non-coffee drinkers who served as the comparator group. Coffee drinkers were compared to non-drinkers for the incidence of arrhythmias, cardiovascular disease and death, after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoea, smoking status, and tea and alcohol consumption. Outcome information was obtained from medical records and death records. The median follow up was 12.5 years. A total of 27,809 (6.2%) participants died during follow up. All types of coffee were linked with a reduction in death from any cause. The greatest risk reduction seen with two to three cups per day, which compared to no coffee drinking was associated with a 14%, 27% and 11% lower likelihood of death for decaffeinated, ground, and instant preparations, respectively. Cardiovascular disease was diagnosed in 43,173 (9.6%) participants during follow up. All coffee subtypes were associated with a reduction in incident cardiovascular disease. Again, the lowest risk was observed with two to three cups a day, which compared to abstinence from coffee was associated with a 6%, 20%, and 9% reduced likelihood of cardiovascular disease for decaffeinated, ground, instant coffee, respectively. An arrhythmia was diagnosed in 30,100 (6.7%) participants during follow up. Ground and instant coffee, but not decaffeinated, was associated with a reduction in arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation. Compared with non-drinkers, the lowest risks were observed with four to five cups a day for ground coffee and two to three cups a day for instant coffee, with 17% and 12% reduced risks, respectively. Professor Kistler said: “Caffeine is the most well-known constituent in coffee, but the beverage contains more than 100 biologically active components. It is likely that the non-caffeinated compounds were responsible for the positive relationships observed between coffee drinking, cardiovascular disease and survival. Our findings indicate that drinking modest amounts of coffee of all types should not be discouraged but can be enjoyed as a heart healthy behaviour.” Reference: “The impact of coffee subtypes on incident cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, and mortality: long-term outcomes from the UK Biobank” by David Chieng, Rodrigo Canovas, Louise Segan, Hariharan Sugumar, Aleksandr Voskoboinik, Sandeep Prabhu, Liang Han Ling, Geoffrey Lee, Joseph B Morton, David M Kaye, Jonathan M Kalman and Peter M Kistler, 27 September 2022, European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.

Much of the weight that people lose while using these drugs comes back when they stop taking it, the study says. The research examined users of weekly injections of tirzepatide, which is the active ingredient in Eli Lilly and Co.’s Zepbound. This drug was approved by the United States last month as a weight loss drug, Science Alert reported. “Tirzepatide is part of a new class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists that were developed to treat type 2 diabetes,” according to Weill Cornell Medicine. “Besides controlling blood sugar, the drugs also resulted in weight loss, so pharma companies created specific formulations to help patients shed pounds.” In the research, 670 adults lost 20.9% of their weight after 36 weeks. Half were placed on a placebo after 88 weeks and regained almost half the weight they’d lost, finishing at 9.9% below their starting weight. Those who continued taking Zepbound continued losing weight – ending up at 25.3% lower than where they began. Participants were mostly women, with an average age of 48. Their average weight at the beginning of the study was 236.6 pounds.

https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20231212/cm/covid-flu-rsv-what-to-know-right-now,"COVID, Flu, and RSV: What to Know Right Now",1,"Dec. 12, 2023 – It’s not necessarily a sign that another tripledemic is looming, but post-Thanksgiving rates of COVID-19 and influenza continue to rise nationwide, the latest federal statistics show. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases have leveled off at higher levels, while hospitalizations due to severe cases of COVID jumped nearly 18%, reaching 22,513 admissions during the week after Thanksgiving, new CDC data shows. Emergency room visits, positive test rates, and weekly deaths related to COVID all rose as well. “The U.S. is experiencing elevated RSV activity, particularly among young children,” the CDC warned in its latest weekly update. “COVID-19 activity has continued to increase, especially in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. Influenza activity continues to increase in most of the country with the southeast and south-central areas of the country reporting the highest levels of activity.” It’s not unusual for respiratory illnesses to increase around the holidays, when people travel and get together, all as colder weather leads to spending more time indoors. COVID hospitalizations have jumped by thousands in the weeks after Thanksgiving every year of the pandemic. Weekly flu hospitalizations reached 5,700 for the 7 days ending Dec. 2, up from about 3,300 two weeks prior. RSV cases reported to the CDC remain around 10,000 for the third straight week, although that is less than half the number of cases seen during a record-setting November peak last year. “Really, this is what we had anticipated would happen,” Marcus Plescia, MD, MPH, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told The Washington Post. “We are not seeing or hearing any reports of hospitals running into capacity issues like we were last year, but we don’t feel we are out of the woods yet.” But health officials are concerned about low vaccination rates, and are urging people to get vaccines to prevent severe illness rather than risk needing to go to the emergency room or be admitted to the hospital. The CDC recommends that people ages 6 months and older get flu and COVID vaccines now, so antibodies have time to build up ahead of Christmas gatherings. RSV vaccines are also available for some infants and young children, and for older people, too. A federal program offers free at-home COVID tests delivered by mail to a person’s home to have on hand if symptoms arise. Another new federal program called Test to Treat offers at-home COVID and flu tests, as well as free telehealth visits and treatment for people who test positive. The Test to Treat program is open to those who are uninsured, receive care through Indian Health Services, and for people who use insurance from Medicare, Medicaid, or Veterans Affairs.",4,-0.3096808,0.25293154,False

The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In the study, expectant mothers who used cannabis had 25.9% unfavorable birth outcomes, compared to 17.4% among those who did not, the research said. More than 9,000 people who were pregnant between 2010 and 2013 participated in the research. Urine samples were used to determine whether pregnant women had used the substance, when, and how much. The negative outcome most strongly associated with cannabis use was low birth weight, less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces. Others included premature births, stillbirths, and hypertensive pregnancy disorders, which can be life-threatening for the pregnant mother and the baby. “Looking at any adverse outcome, we saw that people who had stopped use within the first trimester didn’t actually have a statistically significant increased risk [vs.] those who had continued use,” Torri D. Metz, MD, of the University of Utah Health, who was the study’s lead author, told The Washington Post. According to the Post, there is growing evidence that no amount of cannabis use is safe during pregnancy. Some people use it while pregnant to help with nausea and pain, and its use has surged in recent years as more states have legalized it.",8,0.07471048,0.037249386,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/foods-that-lower-cholesterol-fast/,Top 10 Foods That Lower Cholesterol Fast,0,"Cholesterol plays a crucial part in helping cells function properly. But when your cholesterol levels are too high, your risk for heart disease and stroke skyrockets. In today’s video, we talk about 10 foods that can help lower your cholesterol levels fast. As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors. Did you know that your liver produces 75% of the cholesterol that circulates in your body? The remaining 25% comes from the foods you eat. High cholesterol means your total cholesterol level is 200 mg/dL or higher. There are two main types of cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein (HDL), also referred to as good cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also referred to as bad cholesterol. When LDL cholesterol is exposed to free radicals, it becomes oxidized. While oxidation is inevitable and results from normal cellular activity, an overproduction of oxidized cholesterol can be harmful to heart health. That’s because oxidized cholesterol builds up on the artery walls and leads to the hardening and narrowing of arteries or atherosclerosis. You can prevent this from happening by reducing LDL cholesterol in your body and increasing your intake of antioxidants to fight off free radicals. With that being said, the first item on our list is Number 10. “Legumes.” Legumes are a group of plant foods that include beans, peas, and lentils. A review of 26 randomized controlled studies showed that participants who ate just half a cup or 100 grams of legumes per day lowered their bad LDL cholesterol by an average of 6.6 mg/dl, compared to those who did not eat any legumes. Legumes are packed with essential minerals and proteins. They’re also loaded with antioxidants, which are important to fend off free radicals. But most importantly, legumes contain a good amount of soluble fiber. In the small intestine, soluble fiber attaches itself to cholesterol and exits the body as waste. This prevents any cholesterol that’s been absorbed by the soluble fiber from entering your bloodstream. Eating more legumes can also help decrease blood sugar levels and increase healthy gut bacteria. Next is another food high in soluble fiber. Number 9 is “Oatmeal”. When we don’t eat enough dietary fiber, our LDL ends up much higher than it is supposed to be. Just eating 3 grams of soluble fiber throughout the day is enough to lower your LDL cholesterol, according to the American Dietetic Association. In a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers tested cholesterol-lowering drugs against cholesterol-lowering foods in a group of thirty-four adults with high cholesterol. Oat products were found to lower cholesterol levels about as well as cholesterol drugs. Adding oatmeal into your diet is fairly simple. But keep in mind that not everything with “oatmeal” in the name is healthy. For example, some so-called oatmeal cookies might contain very little oatmeal and lots of fat and sugar. Always pay attention to the nutrition label. Next, add this food to your oatmeal to make it even more nutritious. Number 8 is “Almonds”. Almonds have been found to have a consistent LDL cholesterol-lowering effect in healthy individuals, and in individuals with high cholesterol and diabetes, in both controlled and free-living settings. In a study published in the journal Circulation, participants who ate about a handful of almonds a day lowered their bad LDL cholesterol by 4.4%. And those who ate two handfuls lowered it by 9.4%. Almonds also contain relatively high levels of vitamin E. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that can help stop the oxidation process that causes cholesterol to clog the arteries. One ounce (28.4 g) of plain almonds provides 7.27 mg of vitamin E, which is around half a person’s daily requirement. The next time you have a bowl of oatmeal, add some sliced or whole almonds to make your own cholesterol-lowering breakfast. Next is another nut that lowers bad cholesterol. Number 7 is “Walnuts”. Similar to almonds, walnuts are loaded with vitamin E. But they’re also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the same heart-healthy fat found in oily fish. In one study, researchers found that people who ate about half a cup of walnuts every day for two years lowered their LDL cholesterol levels by an average of 4.3 mg/dL. Walnut-eaters also reduced their number of total LDL particles by 4.3% and small particles by 6.1%. Not many people know this, but LDL particles come in various sizes. Smaller, denser LDL particles are often associated with atherosclerosis or plaque that build up in the arteries. Nuts like almonds and walnuts also contain phytosterols. These plant compounds are structurally similar to cholesterol and help lower cholesterol by blocking its absorption in your intestines. Coming up next is something you should eat every day. Number 6 is “Dark Leafy Greens.” Vegetables are good for your heart, and dark leafy greens are particularly beneficial. Dark leafy greens, such as kale and spinach, contain lutein and other carotenoids, which are linked to a lower risk of heart disease. Carotenoids act as antioxidants to protect your body against free radicals. This helps reduce the amount of oxidized LDL cholesterol and can help prevent cholesterol from binding to artery walls. The fiber in dark leafy greens also helps lower cholesterol levels by binding to bile acids produced by your liver and making your body excrete more cholesterol. Next is a superfood that’s brimming with antioxidants. Number 5 is “Berries”. Blueberries, raspberries, black berries and even strawberries, each contain varying amounts of healthy compounds that have cholesterol-lowering properties like pterostilbene, resveratrol, anthocyanins, polyphenols, vitamins, and phytosterols. In one study, researchers found that drinking a one-liter mixture of freeze-dried and fresh blueberries helped lower oxidized LDL by 28 percent. Next is a popular berry that has almost no sugar. Number 4 is “Avocados”. Avocados are rich in heart-healthy nutrients. They’re an excellent source of monounsaturated fats and fiber. These two key nutrients help lower “bad” LDL and raise “good” HDL cholesterol One cup, or 150 g, of avocado contains 14.7 g of monounsaturated fats, which can help lower the risk of heart disease and strokes. In one study, overweight and obese adults with high LDL cholesterol who ate one avocado daily lowered their LDL levels more than those who didn’t eat avocados. Another delicious food that can help lower cholesterol is Number 3. “Dark chocolate”. Cocoa is the key ingredient in dark chocolate. In one study, healthy adults who drank a cocoa beverage twice a day for a month reduced LDL cholesterol by 6.5 mg/dL. Their blood pressure also decreased and their “good” HDL cholesterol increased. Flavanols contribute a bitter taste to pure cacao and dark chocolate. The flavanols found in cacao include catechins and tannins. Both are also found in tea. Catechins help prevent the LDL cholesterol in your blood from oxidizing. This is a key cause of heart disease. However, store bought chocolate is often high in added sugar, which is bad for your arteries. So make sure to either use cocoa powder alone or choose dark chocolate with a cocoa content of 75–85% or higher. Next is a food staple that is best enjoyed during Fall. Number 2 is “Apples”. Apples contain a type of soluble fiber called pectin, which has been found to help lower cholesterol. Pectin can be found in other fruits, like grapes, citrus fruits, and even strawberries. The mechanism by which pectin lowers cholesterol is like other water-soluble fibers. By increasing gut viscosity, it reduces the re-absorption of bile acids, increasing synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, and reduces circulating blood cholesterol. An analysis of 67 studies in 2,990 adults found that pectin can help reduce LDL cholesterol without affecting HDL levels. Overall, pectin was found to help lower total cholesterol by 5–16%. Last but not least, our Number 1 is “Okra”. Okra, or lady’s fingers, is a warm-season vegetable cultivated throughout the world. Researchers have found that a gel in okra called mucilage can help lower cholesterol by binding to it during digestion. There you have it! The 10 foods that lower bad cholesterol and protect your heart and arteries. For every 10% drop in your total cholesterol level, your heart attack risk drops by 20% to 30%. In addition, it’s important to reduce your consumption of foods that are high in saturated fat and trans fat, like fast food, fried foods, and commercial baked goods. These foods have been found to increase LDL cholesterol levels. See our video, Top 13 Foods That Cause Inflammation.

https://healthimpactnews.com/2024/abiogenic-deep-origin-of-hydrocarbons-disputes-the-climate-change-cult/,Abiogenic Deep Origin of Hydrocarbons Disputes the Climate Change Cult,0,"Comments by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Today I am publishing a guest post by my Australian friend Dr. John Gideon Hartnett about the Abiogenic Deep Origin of Hydrocarbons. I have briefly summarized this kind of research in the past (see: The Myth of “Fossil Fuels” and the Myth that the U.S. is Transitioning Away from Oil to “Green” Energy), but Dr. Hartnett is far more qualified to write on this topic than I am. His bio: Dr John Gideon Hartnett is an accomplished Australian physicist, cosmologist, and noted biblical creationist. A PhD holder from The University of Western Australia (UWA), Hartnett has served at both UWA and the University of Adelaide, contributing to over 200 scientific papers. He was a founding director of a successful startup that has commercialized his research on ultra-stable cryogenic ‘clocks’. He’s known internationally as a speaker on biblical creation, and has written extensively on the subject, especially from an astrophysics and cosmology perspective. Hartnett also writes popular science pieces, frequently critiquing man-made climate change and green energy. He is also a fellow Truth Warrior and my brother in Christ, who stood firm against the tyrannical COVID edicts opposing the Australian Government from 2020 on, and standing on the Truth, even at risk to his own life and career. The theory of abiogenic origin of petroleum and gas challenges the fossil fuel narrative, suggesting primordial formation. Experimental data supports this view. Dr. John Gideon Hartnett Bible Science Forum The Climate Change cult constantly crows about how mankind must end the use of fossil fuels. But there is strong evidence that the oil and gas, which they call fossiliferous (formed from dead creatures allegedly millions of years ago), are in fact primordial. This is the theory of abiogenic origin of hydrocarbons. The above illustration is taken from the paper ‘Abiogenic Deep Origin of Hydrocarbons and Oil and Gas Deposits Formation’ by Vladimir G. Kutcherov published January 16, 2013. The introduction from that paper states: The theory of the abiogenic deep origin of hydrocarbons recognizes that the petroleum is a primordial material of deep origin [Kutcherov, Krayushkin 2010]. This theory explains that hydrocarbon compounds generate in the asthenosphere1 of the Earth and migrate through the deep faults into the crust of the Earth. There they form oil and gas deposits in any kind of rock in any kind of the structural position (Fig. 1 above). Thus the accumulation of oil and gas is considered as a part of the natural process of the Earth’s outgassing, which was in turn responsible for creation of its hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere. Until recently the obstacles to accept the theory of the abyssal abiogenic origin of hydrocarbons was the lack of the reliable and reproducible experimental results confirming the possibility of the synthesis of complex hydrocarbon systems under the conditions of the asthenosphere of the Earth. [my emphases added] The authors present a model for hydrocarbon formation from Calcium Carbonates, Iron Oxides and Water deep below the crust where the temperature and pressure are sufficiently high enough to achieve the reduction reaction necessary. This theory has some similarity to the theory of the late Thomas Gold that oil is a primordial substance, continually manufactured by the Earth under ultra-hot conditions and tremendous pressures. According to Gold, this substance, which he referred to as “deep hot biosphere,” is not of biological origin, but rather a primordial syrup that migrates towards the surface, where it is attacked by bacteria, giving the appearance of an organic origin dating back to the dinosaurs. I do not believe the long ages (billions of years) assigned to the Earth. In fact, biblically the Earth is no more than 6000 years old. The dinosaurs died out primarily with the global deluge in Noah’s day. The global flood laid down enormous deposits of sedimentary strata that nowadays are incorrectly interpreted as being millions of years old using the flawed uniformitarian assumption. During the flood most of the living flora and fauna were buried under sediments which is evidenced by fossils of plants and animals (including dinosaurs) discovered in all layers. In this regard we have a very good mechanism for the formation of coal, which is found even in the form of tree stumps with roots attached. So in that regard there is little doubt that coal is fossiliferous. But what about petroleum and natural gas? In some areas which experienced depleting oil wells it was discovered that the wells started to refill. In this regard a story by Chris Cooper appeared April 16, 1999, in The Wall Street Journal about an oil field called Eugene Island. Here’s an excerpt: Production at the oil field, deep in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana, was supposed to have declined years ago. And for a while, it behaved like any normal field: Following its 1973 discovery, Eugene Island 330’s output peaked at about 15,000 barrels a day. By 1989, production had slowed to about 4,000 barrels a day. Then suddenly—some say almost inexplicably—Eugene Island’s fortunes reversed. The field, operated by Pennz Energy Co., is now producing 13,000 barrels a day, and probable reserves have rocketed to more than 400 million barrels from 60 million. Stranger still, scientists studying the field say the crude coming out of the pipe is of a geological age quite different from the oil that gushed 10 years ago. Another piece of the puzzle was seen in the alkane distribution of petroleum from different oil fields. Alkanes are organic compounds that consist entirely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms and lack any other functional groups. Alkanes have the general formula CnH2n+2 where n ≥1. The relative amounts of these molecules in petroleum found in various locations are distinctly different suggesting non-fossiliferous origin. Experiments were carried out in the lab to produce these alkanes from carbonates, iron oxides and water. The results were published by Kutcherov et al., 2002. The synthesis is described by the following reaction: nCaCO3 + (9n+3)FeO + (2n+1)H2O → nCa(OH)2 + (3n+1)Fe3O4 + CnH2n+2 In various locations below the crust these inputs to the reaction could vary (i.e. different values for n in the equation above) resulting in different proportions of alkanes. We can say that these experiments are consistent with the view that our Creator put in place a supply of hydrocarbon fuels for humanity to use for a very long time. These hydrocarbons are a gift from God. Yet they are falsely attributed to have resulted from ‘evolution’ of the planet over billions of years. It is by design, not by accident, that we have such an abundant supply and they are not fossil fuels. Coal is another matter which defies explanation if you don’t acknowledge the Creator. Coal is a by-product of the global flood in Noah’s time, which covered the entire planet. Coal is found on every continent even Antarctica. Coal contains carbon-14 a radioactive form of carbon with a half-life of about 5730 years. Thus after a million years any carbon bearing mineral should have no carbon-14 left, because it would have all decayed away into the stable (non-radioactive) isotope nitrogen-14. The problem is that ALL carbon bearing minerals on Earth, including coal, oil and natural gas, still contain measurable amounts of carbon-14. If the evolutionary fairy tale of the planet were true that would not be the case. See Earth’s Magnetic Field: A Shield by Design. So no matter how much carbon dioxide the climate cult lunatics sequestrate into the Earth’s crust more of these hydrocarbons will bubble up from deep below adding to the available fuel for mankind. Their feeble efforts are like trying to empty the ocean with a teaspoon. God will not be mocked!

https://dailyhealthpost.com/what-happens-when-you-drink-coffee-on-an-empty-stomach/,What happens when you drink coffee on an empty stomach,0,"Do you start your mornings with coffee? While it has many health benefits, some research suggests that drinking a cup of java on an empty stomach isn’t the best idea. In today’s video, we look at three potential side effects when you drink coffee on an empty stomach. As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors. Did you know that your morning cup of Joe can affect your blood sugar levels? A 2020 study found that consuming strong black coffee on an empty stomach, after a night of poor sleep, could significantly impair people’s blood sugar control. Since it’s important to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range to reduce the risk of conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, you may want to drink your morning coffee after eating first. Another side effect you may experience from consuming coffee on an empty stomach is acid reflux. When you take a bite of bagel or a sip of water, a valve at the top of your stomach called the lower esophageal sphincter opens to allow the food or drink to enter your stomach. Once inside, the valve closes again. But according to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, coffee relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter. As a result, the valve may not shut completely. This allows stomach acid to slip back into your esophagus, which causes a condition called acid reflux. And the most common symptom of acid reflux is heartburn, which can feel like a burning sensation in your chest. In addition, coffee also increases the risk of heartburn because it can stimulate acidity in the stomach. In a 2020 study published in the ​Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology​, participants who replaced two servings of coffee a day with two servings of water had a reduced risk of acid reflux. Occasional acid reflux isn’t usually associated with long-term or serious complications. However, when acid reflux occurs frequently and is left untreated, it can lead to conditions such as esophagitis, ulcers, inflammation, and cancer. If coffee gives you acid reflux, consider switching to green tea. The next side effect that you may experience from drinking coffee on an empty stomach is feeling jittery or anxious. That’s because caffeine is absorbed into the body rapidly. It can take anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours after consumption. And the effects are quicker if you don’t eat prior to drinking coffee. Whether you feel anxious and jumpy or pleasantly alert after drinking a cup of coffee depends largely on your genes, but eating patterns also play a role. A 2018 report found that genetic variations determine how your body metabolizes caffeine. If you’re a fast-metabolizer, drinking one cup of coffee is unlikely to make you edgy, even if it’s on an empty stomach. But it’s a different story for those who digest caffeine slowly, which can make the effects of caffeine more pronounced and long-lasting. If you’re a slow-metabolizer, try to drink your coffee over the course of a full hour in order to micro-dose the amount of caffeine you are getting. Even better would be to have your coffee after eating a fiber-rich meal, which can further slow down the absorption rate of the caffeine. Next, When Is the Best Time to Drink Coffee? The best time to drink coffee is shortly after eating breakfast. If you drink it before you have food in your stomach, you’re at risk for all the symptoms mentioned in this video, blood sugar spike, acid reflux, and jitteriness. What’s more, your cortisol levels peak around seven in the morning. Cortisol is a hormone that gives you an energy boost, so unless you’re not getting enough sleep, you should already be feeling energetic early in the morning. Wait until your cortisol levels start to wane to drink that coffee. Holding off on caffeine for a few hours after you wake up will give you the most bang for your buck. Also, you may want to avoid coffee in the afternoon after around 2 p.m. Having it this late in the afternoon or evening could interfere with sleep. A 2013 study in the ​​Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine​​ found that consuming 400 mg of caffeine or about four cups of home brew, six hours before bed reduced sleep time by more than an hour.

https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20231207/cm/new-covid-variant-could-disrupt-holiday-plans,New COVID Variant JN.1 Could Disrupt Holiday Plans,1,"Dec. 7, 2023 — No one planning holiday gatherings or travel wants to hear this, but the rise of a new COVID-19 variant, JN.1, is concerning experts, who say it may threaten those good times. The good news is recent research suggests the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine appears to work against this newest variant. But so few people have gotten the latest vaccine -- less than 16% of U.S. adults -- that some experts suggest it’s time for the CDC to urge the public who haven’t it to do so now, so the antibodies can kick in before the festivities. “A significant wave [of JN.1] has started here and could be blunted with a high booster rate and mitigation measures,” said Eric Topol, MD, professor and executive vice president of Scripps Research in La Jolla, CA, and editor-in-chief of Medscape, WebMD’s sister site. COVID metrics, meanwhile, have started to climb again. Nearly 10,000 people were hospitalized for COVID in the U.S. for the week ending Nov. 25, the CDC said, a 10% increase over the previous week. Who’s Who in the Family Tree JN.1, an Omicron subvariant, was first detected in the U.S. in September and is termed “a notable descendent lineage” of Omicron subvariant BA.2.86 by the World Health Organization. When BA.2.86, also known as Pirola, was first identified in August, it appeared very different from other variants, the CDC said. That triggered concerns it might be more infectious than previous ones, even for people with immunity from vaccination and previous infections. “JN.1 is Pirola’s kid,” said Rajendram Rajnarayanan, PhD, assistant dean of research and associate professor at the New York Institute of Technology at Arkansas State University, who maintains a COVID-19 variant database. The variant BA.2.86 and offspring are worrisome due to the mutations, he said. How Widespread Is JN.1? As of Nov. 27, the CDC says, BA.2.86 is projected to comprise 5%-15% of circulating variants in the U.S. “The expected public health risk of this variant, including its offshoot JN.1, is low,” the agency said. Currently, JN.1 is reported more often in Europe, Rajnarayanan said, but some countries have better reporting data than others. “It has probably spread to every country tracking COVID,’’ he said, due to the mutations in the spike protein that make it easier for it to bind and infect. Wastewater data suggest the variant’s rise is helping to fuel a wave, Topol said. Vaccine Effectiveness Against JN.1, Other New Variants The new XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccine, protects against XBB.1.5, another Omicron subvariant, but also JN.1 and other “emergent” viruses, a team of researchers reported Nov. 26 in a study on bioRxiv that has not yet been certified by peer review. The updated vaccine, when given to uninfected people, boosted antibodies about 27-fold against XBB.1.5 and about 13- to 27-fold against JN.1 and other emergent viruses, the researchers reported. While even primary doses of the COVID vaccine will likely help protect against the new JN.1 subvariant, “if you got the XBB.1.5 booster, it is going to be protecting you better against this new variant,” Rajnarayanan said. 2023-2024 Vaccine Uptake Low In November, the CDC posted the first detailed estimates of who did. As of Nov. 18, less than 16% of U.S. adults had, with nearly 15% saying they planned to get it. Coverage among children is lower, with just 6.3% of children up to date on the newest vaccine and 19% of parents saying they planned to get the 2023-2024 vaccine for their children. Predictions, Mitigation While some experts say a peak due to JN.1 is expected in the weeks ahead, Topol said it’s impossible to predict exactly how JN.1 will play out. “It’s not going to be a repeat of November 2021,” when Omicron surfaced, Rajnarayanan predicted. Within 4 weeks of the World Health Organization declaring Omicron as a virus of concern, it spread around the world. Mitigation measures can help, Rajnarayanan said. He suggested:",4,-0.463271,0.34504265,False

More people are testing positive, visiting emergency rooms for treatment, and being admitted to the hospital with severe symptoms. The sizable uptick follows a relatively quiet autumn for COVID, and comes as rates of other respiratory illnesses like the flu are also picking up. One in 10 COVID tests reported to the CDC were positive during the week ending Nov. 25, which is a 9% increase, compared to the 2 weeks prior. COVID was diagnosed during nearly 2% of emergency room visits, which although small overall, is an 11% increase over the prior week. Hospital admissions for COVID reached nearly 20,000 for the week ending Nov. 25, marking a 10% jump. COVID is particularly increasing in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., according to the CDC. Nationwide, rates are up for what health officials generically call respiratory illness, which means having a fever and either a cough or sore throat. The CDC even recently highlighted some isolated but surprisingly high rates of pneumonia in children, and noted that pediatric inpatient beds are nearing capacity levels seen last year, when respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) overwhelmed some children’s wards. As of Nov. 25, about 74% of pediatric inpatient beds were being used nationwide, according to CDC data, nearing the 2022 level around the same time of 80%. The latest RSV numbers, though, suggested that the nation isn’t headed toward another nightmare RSV season. RSV rates spiked in mid-November this year, reaching more than 9,000 reported cases nationally, but this past week’s count is down by about 1,000 positive tests. CDC Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, told The Associated Press that “we think we’re near the peak of RSV season or will be in the next week or so.” Meanwhile, flu rates are climbing, with a 6% test positivity rate nationwide and 4,268 hospitalizations for the week ending Nov. 25. Eight children have died due to flu-related causes so far this season, as have about 1,100 adults, according to the CDC’s latest flu summary. “Seasonal influenza activity continues to increase in most parts of the country, most notably in the South Central, Southeast, Mountain, and West Coast regions,” the agency wrote in its weekly FluView publication. The CDC recommends that people ages 6 months and older get both a flu and COVID vaccine. About 38% of children and adults have gotten this year’s flu shots, with rates reaching 62% among people ages 65 and older. About 7% of U.S. children have gotten the latest COVID vaccine.

If you are someone living with prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and neuropathic pain, this article is for you. Our recommended solution for neuropathy pain You already know that high blood sugar is destructive and can damage almost every tissue in the body. Nerves, blood vessels, eyes, heart, liver and skin, you name it, it can probably be adversely affected by elevated blood sugar! Research shows that 50% or more people with diabetes have peripheral neuropathy, or damage to the nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord. When the peripheral nerves are damaged by uncontrolled high blood sugar, their ability to send signals is disrupted. This is called diabetic neuropathy. Nerve damage often affects the feet and legs first, before it spreads to the hands and arms. The symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in the feet include tingling, numbness, muscle twitches and cramps, and sharp, stabbing, or burning pain. The feet become ultra-sensitive to pressure, touch, and temperature. Some people report feeling like they’re wearing socks or shoes when their feet are bare. This is dangerous, because if you have numb feet, it’s easy to hurt your feet by stepping on something sharp or hot. You may also develop a blister caused by badly-fitting shoes and not be aware. And if you do not feel any pain, you may continue walking without protecting against your wound or blister, and it develops into an ulcer. Now, high blood sugar also damages the walls of blood vessels, and reduces blood flow to your feet. This means that the skin and nerves on your feet receive less oxygen and nutrients, and a lower number of infection-fighting cells. As a result, wounds take longer to heal and can lead to gangrene. With that said, let’s get into the three steps to reverse diabetic neuropathy. One, controlling blood sugar levels. Two, prevent or relieve neuropathy symptoms. And Three, correct common nutrient deficiencies found in people with prediabetes and diabetes. Let’s start with a mineral that controls blood sugar. Number 9. Chromium Picolinate. This little-known, yet clinically effective form of chromium reduces insulin resistance, the number ONE root cause of prediabetes, diabetes and neuropathy. Chromium picolinate is the fastest and easiest form of chromium your body can absorb. A study of 833 people with Type 2 diabetes found that taking a daily dose of 500 mcg of chromium picolinate led to significant reductions in blood glucose levels after only one month, and the effects lasted for at least one year. The participants also experienced significant long term reduction in diabetic symptoms such as fatigue, frequency of urination and excessive thirst. This powerful mineral may also decrease cravings for sugar-rich food. You won’t be stressing over sugar cravings anymore, and will probably lose weight and even regain your energy, which is a bonus. Next we have Number 8, Cinnamon. This well-known spice helps improve fasting blood glucose and A1C. However, you’ll want to get REAL cinnamon which comes from Sri Lanka. That’s because TRUE cinnamon barely contains any coumarin, unlike other types of “fake” cinnamon. Coumarin is toxic when consumed in large amounts, and can cause liver damage. Next on our list is Number 7, Vitamin D3. This is the kind of vitamin D your body makes naturally from the sun. Vitamin D3 helps improve insulin sensitivity. This hormone is essential for regulating the removal of sugar out of the blood, thus lowering A1C. Did you know that fixing a vitamin D deficiency can deliver relief from your nerve pain and numbness? In one study, 60 people with diabetic neuropathy, who were deficient in vitamin D, were given oral supplements of vitamin D3 (50,000 IU) once weekly for 12 weeks. Not only did their serum level of vitamin D increase, but there was a significant decrease in the stabbing, burning, and tingling in their hands and feet. Also, new research shows that vitamin D3 may help your body grow new nerve endings. Your nerve endings help detect feelings like pain, cold, and heat. Coming up next is Number 6, Alpha-lipoic acid. For this video, I will refer to it as ALA. ALA is an antioxidant that helps protect the body from inflammation and improves nerve conduction velocity. It has been used for decades in Europe to counter nerve damage in people with Type 1 and 2 diabetes. Because of its effect on glucose metabolism, ALA may improve the glucose-lowering action of insulin. In a clinical trial, researchers gave 328 people with tingling, burning, and stinging in their feet and hands, either ALA or a placebo. The results were truly remarkable. The group taking ALA reduced their nerve pain by up to 52% within three weeks. And those who received 600 mg of ALA daily were found to have the greatest reduction in pain. Now, you would have to eat about 12 bowls of spinach or 8 tomatoes, to get that amount of ALA into your day! R-Lipoic acid, a potent form of lipoic acid with 50% greater biological activity, provides significantly more benefits. Next up, we have Number 5. Vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 repairs your protective myelin coating. This helps your nerves communicate correctly with your brain again. As a result, you can finally get relief from neuropathy symptoms. The myelin sheath is an insulating layer that covers the body of nerves or axons. It enables electrical impulses to travel quickly and smoothly between the nerve cells. There are two types of vitamin B12: cyanocobalamin and methylcobalamin. The first one, cyanocobalamin, is hard to digest. That means you don’t get the full benefit from it. That’s why we recommend methylcobalamin. It’s easy for your body to digest and use, so it can repair your damaged nerves right away. Clinical research from the medical journal, PLOS ONE, shows that B12 deficiencies are more common in diabetics. This is likely because of the use of blood glucose control medications like metformin. Vitamin B12 is found in animal foods and healthy vegan diets are fortified with the vitamin. Coming up is Number 4, Vitamin B6. Research shows that vitamin B6 or pyridoxine can improve nerve density in your feet. This is important because the more nerves you have in your feet, the easier it is for them to send clear and correct messages to your brain. This can help stop tingling, numbness, and stinging. To get vitamin B6, add lean meats, bell peppers, yams, broccoli, sunflower seeds and hazelnuts to your diet. Next up, our Number 3 is Benfotiamine. Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1 in its highest bioavailable form. This vitamin has been shown to significantly decrease symptoms of burning, tingling, prickling or loss of sensation in feet and hands. Its use may also reduce serious complications like deafness, loss of vision, high blood pressure and stroke. Benfotiamine may also help repair and regenerate diabetes-induced damaged cells throughout the body. These include nerve cells in the extremities, and small capillaries in the eyes and kidneys, thus restoring some function to these organs. Benfotiamine works by purging excess levels of potentially damaging glucose metabolites from within the blood vessel cells. In this way, it helps to balance cellular glucose metabolism. The natural version of benfotiamine, thiamine, can be found in foods like whole grains, meat, legumes, and nuts. People with diabetes have been found to have low levels of this vitamin. And now we have Number 2, Acetyl-L-Carnitine. For this article, I will refer to it as ALCAR. ALCAR is an amino acid used to break down carbs and fat more efficiently for mental and physical energy to power through your day. It can also help you lose weight. Studies have shown that supplementing with ALCAR at 1,000 mg per day, helps relieve pain and improve nerve fiber regeneration and vibration perception in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Animal-based foods are excellent sources of carnitine, including beef, chicken, milk and cheese. And at Number 1, we have Choline. Choline is a nutrient found in egg yolks, beef liver, legumes, nuts, beef, and leafy greens. It is an essential component of our cell membranes. Choline is a building block for the nerve cells and helps our bodies create the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It protects the myelin sheath and improves nerve function when combined with vitamin B6 and vitamin B12. Now, choline has been well studied to improve mental health and cognitive function in aging. This is important, because according to new research from the World Journal of Diabetes, people with diabetes run a high risk of developing dementia and cognitive impairment. There you have it! The 9 vitamins that reverse diabetes and repair damaged nerves. This group of nutrients can also prevent and stop other diabetes complications, such as eye problems (retinopathy), kidney problems (nephropathy), gum disease, heart attack and stroke, and sexual problems in men and women.

https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20231129/cm/us-life-expectancy-grows-as-suicide-rates-hit-record-cdc,U.S. Life Expectancy Grows as Suicide Rates Hit Record: CDC,1,"Nov. 29, 2023 – New government data shows U.S. suicides hit another record high in 2022, but the numbers also contain good news about suicides among young people and about deaths in the U.S. overall. The government uses data from death records to calculate life expectancy. U.S. life expectancy is now 77.5 years, with men expected to live 74.8 years and women expected to live 80.2 years. The CDC said its new data from 2022 represents an increase in life expectancy of about a year, compared to 2021 estimates. The increase in longevity is largely due to decreased deaths from COVID-19, and life expectancy would have been even greater, except more people are dying from the flu and pneumonia, health problems during and after pregnancy, kidney disease, and lack of nutrition. But life expectancy of people in the U.S. remains lower than before the pandemic, showing that the nation hasn’t fully rebounded from the effects of the pandemic. In 2019, life expectancy was 78.8 years, which is still more than a year higher than the newly published estimate. Other countries saw smaller impacts on life expectancy from COVID, compared to the U.S., and rebounded more quickly, Steven Woolf, MD, MPH, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University, told The Washington Post. “It’s disturbing but not surprising to me that we have not experienced the recovery that other countries have,” Woolf said. A second newly released CDC report shows that suicides in the U.S. continue to increase, totaling 49,449 deaths in 2022. That’s an increase of 3% from the record-setting count in 2021, and sustains a string of increases spanning the 21st century. The annual suicide rate is now 14.3 deaths for every 100,000 people in the U.S. The suicide rate jumped more among women and girls, compared to the rate among men and boys. The increase among females since 2021 was 4%, while the increase among males was 1%. When looking at suicide rates by age and gender combined, men ages 35 and older were more likely to commit suicide, and women ages 25 and older were more likely to commit suicide. But the suicide rate among men and boys remains about four times the rate of suicide among women and girls. Per 100,000 people, 23.1 males committed suicide in 2022, compared to 5.9 females who committed suicide in the same year. The silver lining of the report was that suicides among younger people, including children and teens, largely declined. After the start of the pandemic, suicides and mental health problems among young people increased at alarming rates, prompting a 2021 advisory from the surgeon general. The report stated that “the challenges today’s generation of young people face are unprecedented and uniquely hard to navigate. And the effect these challenges have had on their mental health is devastating.” The researchers noted that most suicide death data sent to the CDC require investigations to determine the cause of death, and deaths due to drug poisoning take the longest to report. In the past, suicide rates have been adjusted up after early reporting, such as the newly published CDC numbers. One area that may see future adjustment is suicide deaths among women and girls. “Because suicides involving drug poisoning are a larger proportion of suicides among females, the completeness of provisional suicide counts for females typically lags behind that of males,” the authors wrote.",4,-0.16038194,0.2715782,False
https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/news/20231128/cm/small-study-raises-hopes-semaglutide-treatment-alcoholism,Small Study Raises Hopes for Semaglutide Treatment of Alcoholism,1,"Nov. 28, 2023 – A small case study of people taking the popular weight loss drug semaglutide showed that they had a significant reduction in symptoms of addiction to alcohol. Semaglutide is the active ingredient in the weight loss drug Wegovy and in the diabetes drug Ozempic. The findings were published Monday in The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry and arise from what researchers call a “case series” study, which examines in detail the experiences of a small group of people but lacks the statistical power to draw conclusions that come from larger studies. Alcohol use disorder typically involves problems controlling one’s alcohol intake, including being preoccupied with alcohol or continuing to use the drug even when it causes problems. People with alcohol use disorder often have to drink more and more alcohol to achieve the same effect of the drug, and they can experience withdrawal symptoms when they decrease their intake or stop drinking entirely. “This research marks a significant step forward in our understanding of the potential therapeutic applications of semaglutide in the field of addiction medicine,"" said lead author Jesse Richards, DO, director of obesity medicine and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa School of Community Medicine, in a statement. This case series included six people taking semaglutide for weight loss who all experienced a significant decrease in their alcohol use disorder symptoms over varying periods ranging from 1 to 9 months. The people all were patients at a medical weight loss and bariatric surgery clinic, and two took semaglutide to lose weight prior to planned bariatric surgery. Another person in the study had recently had bariatric surgery. One person reported entirely stopping binge drinking behavior while on semaglutide. Five of the six people in the study were women. The researchers from Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma said theirs is the first published paper showing evidence of using semaglutide to reduce alcohol use disorder symptoms in humans. Semaglutide works in ways that can impact the brain’s reward center, so its application to alcohol use disorder has drawn a lot of interest, and two larger studies are underway. Studies have already shown that rodents and monkeys reduce their alcohol intake when taking semaglutide, the authors noted. Semaglutide’s benefits beyond treating diabetes and weight loss continue to emerge, including a recent study that showed it can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in some people. But the medicine also has drawn attention for its side effects, particularly gastrointestinal issues that result in many people stopping the treatment and some getting new health problems. There are only three FDA-approved medications for alcohol use disorder, and less than 2% of people with the disorder use the medications, the authors noted. Other treatments for alcohol use disorder range from inpatient treatment for detox with medical management of withdrawal symptoms to group or individual therapy sessions where people learn how to modify their behavior and set goals, according to the Mayo Clinic. More than 28 million U.S. adults had alcohol use disorder in 2021, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. That equals about 1 in 10 adults. Because of the case study nature of their research, the authors wrote that it’s unclear whether the reduction in alcohol use disorder symptoms due to semaglutide would persist long-term. Previous studies have shown that people who lose weight while taking semaglutide usually regain much of that weight when they stop taking the medicine. The authors wrote that people seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder should use existing treatments until further research on semaglutide is available.",8,0.20068155,0.1283602,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/juice-to-unclog-arteries/,Drink one cup daily of this juice to UNCLOG arteries?,0,"Did you know that something as simple as drinking pomegranate juice could help protect you against heart disease – the #1 cause of death in developed countries? In today’s video, we take a close look at FIVE cardioprotective properties of pomegranates that work together to lower cholesterol, reduce blood pressure, and even prevent atherosclerosis. And the first on the list has to do with a unique compound found in pomegranates that’s responsible for the majority of its health benefits. Number 5. Pomegranate juice reduces oxidative stress. When it comes to cardiovascular disease, reducing damage caused to blood vessels by oxidative stress and inflammation is vital. Pomegranates contain a unique compound known as punicalagins, which has been found to be cardioprotective thanks to its powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Not only is this the most abundant antioxidant in pomegranate, but it’s also responsible for more than half of the antioxidant activity of pomegranate juice. In one study, researchers compared pomegranate juice to other potent antioxidants like grape juice, cranberry juice, green tea, vitamin C and vitamin. The results showed that pomegranate juice outperformed all other sources in reducing the damaging effects of free radicals on cell membranes. Number 4. Pomegranate juice promotes nitric oxide activity. Nitric oxide is a molecule that your body produces naturally. Its main function is vasodilation which means it helps the blood vessels relax, making it easier for the blood to flow. Having inadequate levels of nitric oxide has been found to be associated with heart disease, diabetes and erectile dysfunction. Nitric oxide helps prevent LDL oxidation and plaque buildup within the endothelial cell lining, which often leads to clogged arteries. Combined, these effects help slow down the progression of atherosclerosis. Many studies have found that consuming pomegranate juice can help enhance the biological actions of nitric oxide, while also protecting it from oxidative damage. In one study, researchers found that pomegranate juice and pomegranate fruit extract were able to increase production levels of nitric oxide. Number 3. Pomegranate juice prevents LDL oxidation. LDL oxidation is one of the well-documented causes of heart disease. That’s because oxidized LDL promotes atherosclerosis through inflammatory and immunologic responses that lead to the formation of plaque in the arteries. LDL oxidation also reduces the production of nitric oxide in blood vessels, which reduces blood flow throughout the whole body. In one study, researchers treated human coronary artery cells with pomegranate juice and found a strong increase in levels of nitric oxide production, which is beneficial in preventing heart attacks. Number 2. Pomegranate juice lowers blood pressure. Pomegranates contain key nutrients that can help prevent high blood pressure and atherosclerosis. An old study from 2012 found that consuming 1 cup of pomegranate juice daily for 28 days helped lower high blood pressure in the short term. Another 2017 review of eight human trials found evidence that drinking pomegranate juice consistently lowered blood pressure. Researchers believe that pomegranates help lower blood pressure by reducing levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the body. That’s because angiotensin converting enzymes increase blood pressure by producing the hormone angiotensin II, which constricts blood vessels. To learn about a “10-Second Trick” to erase plaque from your arteries, click the link below after you finish watching this video. Number 1. Pomegranate juice may help reverse atherosclerosis. In a 2004 study published in the journal Clinical Nutrition, researchers administered pomegranate juice to patients over the course of a year. This reversed plaque accumulation in the carotid arteries of patients with severe carotid artery stenosis, which is defined as 70–90% blockage in the internal carotid arteries. The carotid arteries in the neck are responsible for more than 80% of blood flow to the brain, and narrowing of these major vessels is a major risk factor for stroke. Among patients given daily pomegranate juice, atherosclerotic lesions in the common carotid artery decreased by 35% in size. Patients who drank pomegranate juice daily also saw total antioxidant activity increase by 130% compared to before-treatment values. Another study from the California-based Preventive Medicine Research Institute looked at the effects of pomegranate juice in human patients suffering from cardiac ischemia or insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle. A total of forty-five patients were randomly assigned to consume 8 ounces of pomegranate juice or a placebo beverage daily. At the end of the three-month study, scientists found that patients who drank the pomegranate juice daily showed significant improvements in blood flow to the heart muscle compared to the placebo group. Next, How to Eat Pomegranate Without Making a Mess. Removing the edible arils from a pomegranate can be a messy task, but it’s actually easy when you know how to do it. All you have to do is cut it in half around the diameter and then hit the back of the fruit with a large spatula or serving spoon. The edible arils should fall off on their own. When selecting pomegranates, look for a ripe, deep-colored fruit with a red to reddish-brown outer rind that is heavy for its size. The best time to enjoy fresh pomegranates in the United States is between the end of September through November. For those living in other countries, you can also just buy frozen pomegranate arils as they store well in the freezer.

https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20231122/cm/do-you-have-flu-rsv-covid-common-cold-what-to-know,"Do You Have the Flu, RSV, COVID, or the Common Cold?",1,"Nov. 22, 2023 – Winter is almost here, and with it may come runny noses, coughing, and congestion. But how do you know if you have just a common cold or one of the three respiratory viruses that make up the “tripledemic” – RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), COVID-19, and influenza? Based on symptoms alone, it’s difficult to tell which illness you might have. But there are clues that can point you in the right direction: how severe your symptoms are, how long it took for symptoms to set in, what viruses are circulating in your community, and more. We asked experts to break it down for us. How Viruses Set Themselves Apart – or Don’t Nowadays, COVID – especially for people who have received the most recent vaccine – can manifest much like a common cold, so it’s important to keep at-home tests on hand. “Being vaccinated does keep [these viruses] from striking the chest,” said Panagis Galiatsatos, MD, a pulmonary and critical care doctor at Johns Hopkins. “Vaccinated patients may get a mild cough, but a lot of their symptoms stay more as an upper respiratory issue, like nasal congestion – like a bad cold.” One of the unique symptoms of COVID, particularly in the earlier variations of the virus, was the loss of taste and smell. While this still happens in some cases, this symptom isn’t as common anymore, said Galiatsatos. More often than not, patients who have been vaccinated will report loss of smell or taste due to upper respiratory congestion, whereas in the past “it was more of a neurological invasion of the virus,” he said. That’s changed because so many of us now have the antibodies that protect us from the more severe consequences of COVID, from either having recovered from a previous infection, getting immunized, or a combination of the two. Unlike RSV, cold, and flu, COVID may also bring on some gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. While GI issues are a more uncommon symptom, it can be a sign that you should get tested for COVID. RSV in healthy people who are not children or over the age of 65 might look like a cold or a mild case of COVID. But for children and seniors, a telltale sign of a potential RSV infection is when a patient is wheezing or they are having asthma flares, said Peter Chin-Hong, MD, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. What the Timing of Symptoms Can Tell Us Common cold symptoms tend to come on fairly quickly, explained Chin-Hong. If you get RSV, on the other hand, it may take 4 to 6 days before symptoms show. Flu viruses are a totally different story. “The special characteristic of flus is the abrupt onset of symptoms,” Chin-Hong said. “You might be minding your own business, feeling OK, and then all of the sudden you get in your car and you feel like you’ve been hit by a dump truck.” COVID also has some unique symptomatic features. You may not have symptoms at all, or you might have mild, cold-like symptoms for a week before the symptoms worsen and the infection becomes more serious. “COVID has this biphasic pattern, whereas colds and RSV don’t – it’s when you are kind of doing OK, and then you fall off a cliff,” said Chin-Hong. “That’s why early treatment with Paxlovid or remdesivir is so important because it can prevent that second phase from happening.” Testing Is Your Best Bet For Galiatsatos, getting tested for COVID should be your first instinct – and getting two negative tests within a 24-hour period should encourage you to seek out a flu test at a local health care facility if you’re able to. Staying on top of testing can get you access to the right antivirals, like Tamiflu, which can shorten symptoms by a day or more. And when you come down with the flu, those couple of days can make a world of difference. Just assuming you have COVID and not testing could be a mistake, especially if you end up having long-lasting respiratory symptoms of the virus. “One of the things that broke my heart was so many patients who have come into my clinic with symptoms of long COVID, but they never got tested. I can’t test their antibodies anymore because those antibodies could be from an older infection or vaccine,” said Galiatsatos. “It’s hard to get insurance companies to pay for long COVID tests if there wasn’t a positive COVID test to begin with.”",4,-0.22806728,0.27742136,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/eat-crushed-garlic/,Eat Crushed Garlic to Clean Your Arteries and Prevent Heart Attack,0,"Garlic is widely used as a spice, but few people realize just how powerful a healing agent it is for cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Today, we look at how garlic can save your heart, and your life, through its ability to help prevent and treat atherosclerosis. First, let’s briefly mention what is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease where plaque, which is a build-up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances, forms inside the arteries. Over time, plaque can harden and narrow the arteries, which can limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the organs and the rest of the body. Sometimes, plaque breaks off and causes a blockage, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Garlic, in its raw and aged form, possesses 6 major therapeutic properties, that work together to treat and prevent atherosclerosis. Number 6. Garlic helps protect the heart from calcification. Garlic can help prevent too much calcium from building up in the arteries. When this happens, the arteries can become stiff and hard. This is called calcification. Calcium buildup in the heart’s two major arteries is known as “coronary artery calcification”. A 2004 study from UCLA showed that patients on statin drugs who took aged garlic extract for one year had 3 times reduced progression of coronary artery calcification. Another 2013 study published in the International Journal of Cardiology showed that supplement doses of aged garlic extract, B-12, folic acid, B6, and l-arginine over one year, increased the ratio of (active) brown fat to (inactive) white fat surrounding the heart muscle. More brown fat and less white fat around the heart means that the risk of calcification was reduced. The authors concluded that garlic may be beneficial for patients who are at high risk of future cardiovascular events. Number 5. Garlic helps slow the progress of atherosclerosis. Studies done at UCLA found that the garlic and supplement mix mentioned earlier improved oxidative biomarkers, vascular health, and reduced the progress of atherosclerosis. A 4-year clinical trial in Germany showed that garlic powder, when taken daily, reduced the volume of “arteriosclerotic plaque” by up to 18%, and the risk of heart attack and stroke by 50%. In another 2016 study published in the Journal of Nutrition, patients with metabolic syndrome were given 2400 mg a day of aged garlic for 354 days. Metabolic syndrome is a group of health problems that include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, too much body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels. People with metabolic syndrome are at a much higher risk of heart attack and stroke. This condition often occurs together with atherosclerosis. The clear conclusion of the study was that aged garlic prevented plaque buildup in the arteries. Number 4. Garlic helps improve the cholesterol profile. Garlic reliably reduces total cholesterol and Low-density Lipoprotein (LDL), while increasing High-density Lipoprotein (HDL), thus helping to prevent cholesterol from clogging the arteries. Number 3. Garlic helps lower blood pressure. High blood pressure is dangerous because it increases your risk of heart disease and stroke, often showing no symptoms until the damage has already been done. When you eat a garlic-rich diet, it works to keep your blood pressure in check via several mechanisms. First, garlic helps increase nitric oxide production in your cells by increasing the activity of an enzyme called nitric oxide synthase. Nitric oxide is important for healthy blood flow because it helps your blood vessels to dilate or widen. If you don’t have enough nitric oxide, you are at risk for high blood pressure and heart disease. Second, garlic may have a similar effect as popular blood pressure drugs by blocking the hormone angiotensin. This helps to keep blood vessels from narrowing. Third, garlic helps your red blood cells produce hydrogen sulfide. This compound relaxes your blood vessels, which keeps your blood pressure in check. Number 2. Garlic helps prevent blood clots. Garlic contains sulfur compounds that help prevent platelets in the blood from sticking together. This lowers the risk of forming a blood clot and improves blood flow. However, this antiplatelet property of garlic may be a problem for people taking blood thinners, such as aspirin or other anticoagulants. Number 1. Garlic helps reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. Damage to blood vessel linings can be caused by unstable molecules called “free radicals. Too many free radicals can lead to oxidation stress, which leads to inflammation and a higher risk of plaque formation and clogging. Garlic is an excellent source of antioxidants (including selenium, vitamin C, and quercetin), and sulfur compounds, which fight both oxidation and inflammation, making it easier for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body. You probably already guessed by now that garlic’s cardioprotective properties have a lot to do with its sulfur-containing compounds, and you’re right! Now, let’s look at what makes garlic so effective as a natural remedy. Garlic is a member of the lily family and is rich in sulfur compounds-something it shares with onions, leeks, and chives, all of which are from the same family. Garlic contains a molecule called allicin. When garlic is “disturbed” through chewing, slicing, or crushing, it releases allicin. Allicin turns into a variety of fat and water-soluble sulfur-containing compounds. These compounds are so volatile that they give off hydrogen sulfide, which is part of garlic’s unmistakable smell and taste. It is these sulfur compounds that help to prevent and treat atherosclerosis, and heart disease caused by diabetes. They also provide other health benefits like fighting infection and cancer, detoxifying heavy metals from the body, and preventing the common cold. Next, how much garlic should you take daily? The benefit of any garlic or aged garlic extract depends on how it’s processed. One of the best ways to eat garlic is in its fresh, raw form. You can chop it or crush it with your teeth. Raw garlic has a strong taste, but you can reduce it by adding some avocado, tomato sauce, or olive oil. If you’re cooking with it, letting it sit for 10 minutes after chopping may help to preserve more of its health benefits. This “stinking rose” is a simple and tasty addition to many dishes, and getting 3-6 cloves a day into your diet is an easy goal. For supplementation, most studies on garlic use a dosage range of 600-1,200mg a day, usually divided into multiple doses. Aged garlic extract is a popular supplement because it doesn’t have a fresh garlic scent. It may have greater antioxidant benefits. However, garlic supplementation can be done through food alone. Compared to drugs with side effects like statins, garlic is a powerful, time-tested, safe, affordable, and easily accessible natural healing agent with dozens of documented side benefits!

That’s based on how the vaccine performed in the parts of the world where flu season is wrapping up. As flu season sets in across the United States, health officials look to see how flu vaccines performed in countries in the Southern Hemisphere, where the flu season tends to run from about April to September. An analysis published by the CDC that looked at mid-season flu data for South America showed that the flu vaccine was more than 50% effective at preventing flu hospitalizations there. But since that report’s publication earlier this year, the vaccine used in South America was found to be less and less effective as the flu season progressed. So the flu shots in the U.S. were updated to better protect against versions of the virus that were seen toward the end of flu season in parts of South America where the data was collected. “Final estimates can vary from interim estimates, and it does look like – I did look at some of the final season data the other week – and it does look like the effectiveness probably dropped a bit later in the season, and this is what happens when we see changes in the virus circulating, which was mostly a type called influenza A H1N1,” said epidemiologist Annette Regan, PhD, MPH, a co-author of the CDC report on Southern Hemisphere flu. “It does look like we’ve updated the formulation for the Northern Hemisphere based on that change.” “It was a good report because it gave us an indication that in the middle of the season, the vaccine was working really well, but when everything’s said and done and we’re at the end of the season, it doesn’t always look exactly the same. So we have a slightly different formulation in the Northern Hemisphere than what went out in South America,” said Regan, who formerly tracked flu data for the CDC and the Australian government. She’s now an associate professor at the University of San Francisco’s Orange County campus. Tracking flu trends below the equator helps medical teams and public health officials prepare for flu season up north, although the influenza virus is so adept at changing that predictions are helpful but not a guarantee of what’s to come, said Paula Couto, MD, an influenza surveillance epidemiologist with the Pan American Health Organization, which is a regional office of the World Health Organization for the Americas. She said the interim report, which used data from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, can help with preparations such as estimating this season’s needs for health services and also demand for antiviral drugs used to treat flu. “Of course, influenza is a tricky virus because it has pandemic and epidemic potential, so it may not necessarily be the same [between hemispheres], but that’s why we are always monitoring and alert about these viruses,” said Couto, who also co-authored the CDC report. There is no official start date for flu season each year in the U.S. The start date varies because it’s usually determined after the fact, based on a combination of factors such as increasing rates of positive flu tests and hospitalizations. That tends to be in late November. “In the U.S., we tend to see the flu season start in the Southeast, like in Florida and Texas, and surrounding states, and then we kind of see it spread from there,” said Regan. “Usually it doesn’t take too long, like we’re talking a couple weeks max ... because people move a lot and people are much more mobile nowadays than they were during the height of the pandemic.” The U.S. appears to be on the verge of flu season. The CDC indicated that flu cases are on the rise in the Southeast, as well as in South Central and West Coast states, according to the agency’s latest weekly flu report. Currently, about 4% of flu tests are coming back positive nationally. Already, one child has died due to influenza. Children are one of the groups with low flu vaccination rates in the U.S. and around the world, Regan noted. “I just don’t think any kid should die from flu, not in 2023, if we can help it,” she said. The CDC recommends that everyone in the U.S. ages 6 months and older get vaccinated for the flu. After getting a shot, it takes the body about 2 weeks to make enough antibodies for maximum protection, Regan said, and the effectiveness typically lasts at least 4 months. That means the time to get one is now, since flu cases are on the rise. About one-third of U.S. adults and kids have gotten this year’s flu shot, according to the CDC, which is lagging several percentage points compared to last year. The adult vaccination rate varies from one state to another, ranging from 22% to 51%. The severity of flu season can vary, but federal data show there are between 9 million and 41 million cases annually, with up to 710,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 and 52,000 deaths. Between Oct. 1 and Nov. 11 this year, the CDC estimates that in the U.S. there have already been: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted seasonal flu trends, resulting in lower-than-normal flu cases when stay-at-home orders and quarantines were common. Last winter, though, flu returned with a vengeance. Both Couto and Regan said all indicators point toward a return to normal this season. But the risk of serious illness or death from flu remains, particularly among high-risk populations like very young children and older people. Regan urged people, even if they have gotten the flu vaccine, to do other things to prevent the spread of flu in order to protect themselves but also people who are at high risk, like grandparents or newborn babies. Vaccines are not 100% effective, Regan said, so it's vital that people wash their hands and cover their mouths when sneezing and coughing. “And I think the big one is staying home when we’re feeling ill, especially because children are very good spreaders of influenza, there’s good data to show that. So keeping them home when they’re under the weather can be really helpful for helping to control the spread of influenza and RSV and helping to stop these epidemics,"" she said. So just because this flu season is a return to normal or going according to predictions, each person’s actions – from getting vaccinated to washing their hands – is important, Regan and Couto concurred. “In the particular case of influenza, we know that the next pandemic is going to happen,” Couto said. “You can never really know when, and that’s why being vigilant about influenza, it’s key. Of course, the last pandemic was COVID-19, but we cannot forget that influenza is still a threat.”",4,-0.37283787,0.29053825,False
https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20231117/cm/as-rsv-surges-more-doses-of-preventive-medicine-being-released,"As RSV Surges, More Doses of Preventive Medicine Being Released",1,"Nov. 17, 2023 – A new medicine that can help infants avoid hospitalization due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been in short supply as cases of the illness surge in some parts of the country. The CDC announced Thursday that an additional 770,000 doses of a monoclonal antibody treatment, which can be given to babies shortly after birth, are being sent to doctor’s offices and hospitals. The drug is sold under the brand name Beyfortus and can reduce the risk of serious complications from RSV by as much as 75%, the FDA indicated in its July approval announcement. The preventive treatment is considered a breakthrough because RSV hospitalizes between 1% and 3% of all babies under 1 year old annually. Most children have been infected with RSV by the time they are 2 years old. Usually, symptoms are mild, such as a runny nose and fatigue. But for some, the virus can lead to pneumonia or bronchiolitis, a dangerous lung condition that causes wheezing and makes it hard to breathe, the CDC says. In severe cases, babies need to be admitted to the hospital to receive additional oxygen, fluids due to dehydration, and sometimes even have a breathing tube inserted or get help breathing from a machine called a mechanical ventilator. The announcement of additional doses of Beyfortus comes as some areas report overwhelming rates of RSV. In Texas, Cook Children’s Medical Center in Fort Worth posted on Facebook recently that people should expect long wait times at its emergency room as hundreds of people seek care there daily, and the RSV positivity rate reached 33%. “Many infants are suffering from severe RSV with hospitals struggling to find beds for them all,” read an announcement from Cook Children’s that was published in Spanish. In central North Carolina, a spike in RSV cases prompted the Cone Health system to begin requiring masks and banning children ages 12 and under from visiting vulnerable areas, such as labor and delivery wards and neonatal intensive units, at one of its hospitals and also at a medical center. Nationally, more than 6,800 positive cases of RSV were reported to the CDC the week of Nov. 11. The rate of tests for RSV coming back positive for children and adults combined has nearly doubled during the course of the past month. Babies who are less than 1 year old are the most likely to visit emergency departments for RSV, according to CDC data for the week of Nov. 11. But RSV rates are still well below numbers seen this time last year, when a record-setting early wave of the virus overwhelmed pediatric wards of hospitals. This fall, health officials expressed hope that this may be the least severe RSV season ever, due to the approval of Beyfortus and to a new vaccine that can be given to pregnant women who then pass protection against RSV to their unborn babies. The CDC said it has been asking doctors to encourage pregnant patients to get the vaccine, so babies are protected when they are born, rather than relying on Beyfortus. Beyfortus is approved for babies up to 1 year old and for some children up to 2 years old who are at high risk of severe RSV.",4,-0.2002921,0.20553346,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/this-sugar-free-drink-can-triple-your-stroke-risk/,This Sugar-Free Drink Can Triple Your Stroke Risk,0,"According to the American Heart Association (AHA), about 75 percent of patients who had a stroke for the first time have high blood pressure. Because of this correlation, doctors strongly advise patients to focus on lowering their blood pressure to decrease their risk of stroke. However, lowering your blood pressure is not the only risk factor for stroke. Researchers have discovered a common drink that most people think is healthy is in reality associated with an increased risk of stroke and dementia. This study was done by scientists from the Boston University School of Medicine in 2017. The team examined the effect of artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) on the health of adults over the age of 45 for an extended period. About three thousand participants took part in this study. The team measured their daily beverage consumption via the food-frequency questionnaire for ten years. The Boston researchers’ result showed that people who drank a minimum of one diet soda a day had two times the risk of stroke compared to the group who did not drink the beverage. Upon further analysis, the team also found that the diet soda drinkers had a three-times increased risk of experiencing an ischemic stroke attack. The scientists behind this study noted that their findings add to the growing evidence that suggests ASBs significantly increases a person’s risk of stroke especially ischemic stroke. The team analyzed about 1,500 people over the age of 60 for the effect of diet soda consumption on dementia. The result shows that drinking even one soda a day can increase a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The team also pointed out that this study was the first of its kind to show a strong correlation between drinking diet soda and dementia caused by Alzheimer’s and other forms of the disease. They also explained that more research needs to be done to help experts understand the causal link of diet soda. Ralph Sacco, former president of AHA, commented that the result of this study is of great concern because diet soda is marketed as a healthier alternative to sugary beverages. And Sacco also said there is a growing number of studies that shows that despite popular belief both sugary and artificially sweetened drinks could harm the brain. He explains further that major governing bodies such as the AHA have approved the replacement of sugar with artificial sweeteners to manage diabetes, high blood sugar, and other metabolic syndromes without fully understanding the health effects. It is worth noting that the American Heart Association has acknowledged the findings of the Boston study. According to AHA, various studies have linked artificially sweetened beverages to obesity, stroke, vascular diseases, and heart attack. The Boston team highlights that they did not find a correlation between drinking sugary beverages and stroke or dementia. The reason for this result could be that the daily consumption of regular soda is not as high as diet soda, explains the lead scientist of this study, Dr. Matthew Pase. He also warns that people should not use this result as evidence that sugary drinks are healthier than diet soda. Nutritionist Rachel K. Johnson from the University of Vermont commented that people should focus more on reducing added sugar for better weight management and improved nutrition. And that artificially sweetened drinks should be consumed sparingly till there’s further evidence that proves their health effects. She added that it is best for people who want to manage diabetes or obesity to consume water, low-fat milk, or other sugar-free drinks.",3,0.32858577,0.21394886,False

Nov. 14, 2023 – In what looks like a return to a typical pre-pandemic flu season, cases nationwide continue to slowly climb this fall, national infectious disease expert and pharmacy data shows. Flu is still nothing to mess with, and officials are promoting the flu activity results as a reminder for people to get their flu shots as soon as possible – before an expected peak early next year. Seasonal influenza activity is increasing in most parts of the country, primarily in the South Central, Southeast, and West Coast regions, the CDC said in updated numbers released Monday. In the prior week, the number of lab tests positive for the flu was up 3%, and the number of outpatient visits for respiratory illness was up 2.9%. Numbers from a national pharmacy chain shows the same overall slow increase in cases and the highest flu activity across the southern United States. As of Nov. 4, 2023, Puerto Rico, Mississippi, and Louisiana had the most flu activity, the 2023-2024 Walgreens Flu Index shows. “At this time, it is very low activity. There's not much of a flu season yet,” said Pedro Piedra, MD, a professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. The major virus circulating now is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and not influenza. “But that doesn't mean that the flu is not going to come. Viruses come in waves,” Piedra said. “Until then, this is the best time to be vaccinated and to be getting prepared for the flu season.” The number of weekly flu hospital admissions is also increasing, with 1,962 people hospitalized in the past week of CDC surveillance. Admissions are up slightly, compared to the week before, with seniors and children younger than 4 accounting for the most cases. The agency reports that one child has died from the flu so far this season. “While it’s early days and flu season is always unpredictable, our historical data suggest this could be a return to a typical two-wave flu season, where activity starts to peak in December and reaches its highest point in February,” Kevin Ban, MD, Walgreens’ chief medical officer, said in a statement. Index flu activity is based on changes in the number of antiviral medications used to treat influenza every week across Walgreens and Duane Reade drugstore locations in the U.S. Data is provided by state and region as well. “The index is not intended to illustrate flu severity, but rather, based on this methodology, to show which populations are experiencing the highest incidence of influenza within the United States and Puerto Rico each week,” a company release said. Piedra cautioned that other infections could cause people to purchase antiviral medications. Laboratory-confirmed flu infection data, like numbers provided by the CDC, would be more precise, he said.",4,-0.25150412,0.2674803,False
https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/news/20231110/cm/cdc-says-child-vaccination-exemptions-hit-all-time-high,CDC Says Child Vaccination Exemptions Hit All-Time High,1,"Nov. 10, 2023 -- The CDC said 3% of children starting kindergarten in the 2022-2023 school year received an exemption from one of the four key vaccines—the highest exemption rate ever reported in the United States. Of the 3% of children who got exemptions, 0.2% were for medical reasons and 2.8% for non-medical reasons, the CDC report said. The overall exemption rate was 2.6% for the previous school year. Though more children received exemptions, the overall national vaccination rate remained steady at 93% for children entering kindergarten for the 2022-2023 school year. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall rate was 95%, the CDC said. “The bad news is that it’s gone down since the pandemic and still hasn’t rebounded,” Sean O’Leary, MD, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist, told The Associated Press. “The good news is that the vast majority of parents are still vaccinating their kids according to the recommended schedule.” The CDC report did not offer a specific reason for higher vaccine exemptions. But it did note that the increase could be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID vaccine hesitancy. ""There is a rising distrust in the health care system,"" Amna Husain, MD, a pediatrician in private practice in North Carolina and a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, told NBC News. Vaccine exemptions ""have unfortunately trended upward with it."" Exemption rates varied across the nation. The CDC said 40 states reported a rise in exemptions and that the exemption rate went over 5% in 10 states: Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, and Wisconsin. Idaho had the highest exemption rate in 2022 with 12%. While requirements vary from state to state, most states require students entering kindergarten to receive four vaccines: measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR); diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP); polio; and chickenpox.",4,-0.38678795,0.24098958,False

The vaccine, called Ixchiq and produced by Valneva Austria GmbH, is given in a single dose to people over 18 who are at increased risk of exposure to the virus. The safety of the vaccine was determined through two clinical studies involving about 3,500 adults. Common side effects included headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, fever, nausea, and tenderness where the needle went in the skin. Severe reactions that prevented daily activity or required medical intervention occurred in 1.6% of vaccine recipients, the FDA said in a statement announcing the approval. Two people who received the vaccine had to be hospitalized. Chikungunya is “an emerging global health threat” and at least 5 million cases have been reported in the last 15 years, the FDA said. The highest risk of infection is in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Americas. Common symptoms of the virus include fever, joint pain, a rash, headache, and muscle pain. Some people will experience joint pain for months or years. The World Health Organization says deaths and severe illnesses are rare. The CDC says chikungunya cases in the U.S were rare before 2006. From 2006 to 2013, an average of 28 people per year tested positive, all of them travelers returning from affected areas in Asia, Africa, or the Indian Ocean. Beginning in 2014, chikungunya cases were reported among U.S. travelers returning from affected areas in the Americas. Local transmission was identified in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to the federal agency. “Infection with chikungunya virus can lead to severe disease and prolonged health problems, particularly for older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions,” said Peter Marks, MD, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “Today’s approval addresses an unmet medical need and is an important advancement in the prevention of a potentially debilitating disease with limited treatment options.”",4,-0.27127025,0.24607073,False
https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20231108/cm/getting-multiple-respiratory-viruses-at-once,What Happens if You Get Both COVID and Flu (or RSV) at Once?,1,"Nov. 8, 2023 – Getting COVID-19: No fun. The same is true of flu or RSV. But getting more than one of them at the same time? Now you’re talking about what could be a really dangerous situation. As the colder months creep up on us, so does the spread of the big three respiratory viruses: COVID, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. The good news is we now have an updated COVID vaccine, flu shots that protect against multiple strains of the virus, and RSV vaccines for older folks, pregnant people, and infants. Yet despite our prevention efforts, some unlucky few may contract not just one of these viruses, but two at once or in close succession during the winter season. While we can’t predict what the season will look like this year, last year’s data from the CDC showed that RSV, COVID, and flu didn’t all peak at once – which is good news for both patients and health care systems. Here’s why that’s good news: Last winter was the first time Panagis Galiatsatos, MD, a pulmonary and critical care doctor at Johns Hopkins, saw patients coming in with both COVID and flu. Far more often than not, he said, patients had only one of these viruses; still, the number of those with both flu and COVID he saw last year was “alarming.” “Patients that had co-infections were by far our sickest patients,” Galiatsatos said. “This is also a clinical bias because I’m a critical care physician, but all of the patients I met with co-infections were in the intensive care unit.” How Do You Know If You Have More Than One Virus? When it comes to just how many people experience co-infections like this, it’s hard to tell. Most of these diagnoses come from being hospitalized, where doctors will typically test for all three viruses. For those who don’t end up in a hospital, they might not know they have more than one infection, especially because the symptoms are similar. A runny nose, cough, fever, and body aches can happen with all three viruses. Because of the accessibility of COVID tests, it’s more likely that if you get sick and test positive for COVID, you probably won’t seek out a flu or RSV test at a medical facility if your infection isn’t dire enough to prompt a hospital visit. Testing for all three isn’t a necessity for everyone, said Peter Chin-Hong, MD, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. The elderly, very young, and people with weakened immune systems should definitely seek further testing as soon as they’re able to. However, those who don’t fall into those categories can still get tested for all three viruses. Based on what doctors have seen in the past, there’s a higher chance that if you have two viruses, it’s probably COVID and flu, not RSV. And early testing in these cases can save patients a lot of grief because we have antiviral treatments for flu and COVID that we don’t have for RSV. What to Do If You Have Flu and COVID “First thing is, don’t panic,” says Chin-Hong. If you test positive for COVID at home and you have symptoms, seek out the drug Paxlovid within 5 days of being sick. If it turns out you have the flu as well as COVID, you can get antivirals like Tamiflu within the first 48 hours of symptoms, which may shorten the illness by a day or more. There’s been some confusion around who exactly qualifies for Paxlovid. The FDA has said that it is approved for the treatment of “mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19,” but some may assume they aren’t in the high-risk category and don’t seek it out. There is still a reluctance to take Paxlovid, from patients who are worried about the “rebound” and from doctors who are hesitant to prescribe it, said Bernard Camins, MD, an infectious disease expert at Mount Sinai in New York City. “We need to be more willing to prescribe Paxlovid as physicians,” Camins said. “Sometimes doctors will say, ‘Oh, you’re not feeling too bad, let’s not do it.’ The problem is it might be too late by the time [the patient] does get sick enough.” Regarding the infamous COVID rebound -- where patients develop COVID again shortly after recovering -- that many have associated with Paxlovid use, doctors like Chin-Hong and Camins want patients to know that this rebound is pretty typical, with or without Paxlovid. And in the respiratory virus season in particular, Chin-Hong said, what you might think is a rebound of COVID symptoms may very well be another virus, like influenza or RSV. Does One Virus Make You More Susceptible to Getting Another? The short answer: It depends on who you are, what activities you do, and the timing of your infection. Studies on COVID have shown that there can be long-term damage to immune systems after recovering from an infection. Sometimes having two viruses at once can make you sicker, as was the case for Galiatsatos's patients. Researchers have also found that patients who tested positive for influenza had a decreased risk of testing positive for COVID; but for those who did have co-infections, the disease was much more severe and left even more long-term damage to the lungs. Having COVID is the most common denominator when it comes to people with multiple infections, Galiatsatos said, due to its ability to invade the immune cells, weakening patients and making them more vulnerable to catching other viruses. But there is still a lot we don’t know about co-infections with COVID, flu, and RSV. According to William Schaffner, MD, an expert in preventative medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, a non-immunocompromised person isn’t more likely to get infected with another virus if they already have one. “That is, unless their behaviors lead them to greater exposure,” Schaffner said. “If people aren’t vaccinated, don’t wear masks, or have a personal behavioral disposition to constantly expose themselves to vociferous crowds, well, they're more likely to pick up one or more of these infections during the course of the winter. “That’s simply because they're exposing themselves. It doesn't have anything to do with their immune systems.”",4,-0.3888338,0.27962363,False

A U.S. government database that compiles cases listing harmful outcomes while taking a medicine indicated that the three hospitalizations were connected to suspected counterfeit semaglutide drugs, CBS News reported. Semaglutide is the active ingredient in the diabetes drug Ozempic and its counterpart Wegovy, which is specifically approved for weight loss. Both drugs are made by the Danish company Novo Nordisk and have been in short supply. One of the three hospitalized cases specifically mentioned Ozempic. The hospitalizations are among 42 cases in the database that mention semaglutide counterfeits, and 28 of those cases are classified as serious, CBS News reported, noting that outcomes listed on the database included death and all of the reports were submitted to the FDA by Novo Nordisk. “The records do not prove whether the counterfeits caused the complaints or might have been incidental to the report,” CBS News reported. The FDA, Novo Nordisk, and companies that help distribute semaglutide medications have been working to crack down on counterfeits of the drugs. Last summer, a fake Ozempic pen was sold at a U.S. retail pharmacy. Hundreds of fake Ozempic pens were seized in the United Kingdom in October. In an email to the news outlet, an FDA spokesperson told CBS it investigates reports of suspected counterfeit drugs. ""The FDA will investigate any report of suspect counterfeit drugs to determine the public health risks and the appropriate regulatory response.

The FDA approved Zepbound (tirzepatide) for use in addition to a lower-calorie diet and more exercise. Tirzepatide is the active ingredient. It is already approved as Mounjaro for use, along with diet and exercise, to improve blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the FDA said in a press release. “Obesity and overweight are serious conditions that can be associated with some of the leading causes of death such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes,” said John Sharretts, MD, director of the Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders, and Obesity in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “In light of increasing rates of both obesity and overweight in the United States, today’s approval addresses an unmet medical need.” Consumers this year have made Wegovy, for obesity and overweight, popular, along with Ozempic, for diabetes. Some 70% of adults are obese or overweight, and many who are overweight also have at least one weight-related condition, the FDA says. Adults with obesity or overweight can lower their risk of cardiovascular disease by losing 5% to 10% of their bodyweight by eating right and exercising. “Zepbound activates receptors of hormones secreted from the intestine (glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)) to reduce appetite and food intake,” the FDA said. “Zepbound is administered by injection under the skin once weekly, and the dosage must be increased over four to 20 weeks to achieve the target dosages of 5 milligram (mg), 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly. The maximum dosage of Zepbound is 15 mg once weekly.” Zepbound was tested for efficacy in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.

https://healthimpactnews.com/2024/mainstream-media-is-avoiding-the-big-story-on-jeffrey-epstein/,Mainstream Media Is Avoiding the Big Story on Jeffrey Epstein,0,"Comments by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News A meaningless news story made headline news in both the Corporate and Alternative Media yesterday regarding “sealed” names related to Jeffrey Epstein, as there was almost absolutely nothing new revealed by these names. The book on Jeffrey Epstein and who was responsible for bringing him to power was already written at the end of 2022 and widely distributed in 2023, by Whitney Webb, who has extensively documented the three Billionaires who brought Epstein to power: Leslie Wexner, Donald Trump, and Bill Gates. See: None of these men will face justice, and in fact one of them is favorite to become the next President of the United States (again), and neither will the man who runs the world’s most powerful bank that financed the Epstein criminal network, Jamie Dimon, CEO of Chase Bank. by Pam Marten Wall Street on Parade Over the past week, more than a dozen of the biggest mainstream news outlets have published articles about the possibility of scandalous news breaking this week from the unsealing of documents in a federal court case involving the sex trafficker of minors, Jeffrey Epstein. Typically, responsible news outlets wait for the actual news to break before hyping the possibility of it breaking. At 5:59 a.m. this morning, Newsweek updated the story as follows: “Some on social media are speculating that the public disclosure of more than 150 names associated with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has been delayed. “Judge Loretta A. Preska signed an order on December 18 for the public release of the identities of more than 150 people mentioned in court documents from a now-settled 2015 civil lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre that centered on allegations that Epstein’s associate and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated her sexual abuse. “Several prominent figures, including former President Bill Clinton and Britain’s Prince Andrew are expected to be named. The list will also include sex abuse victims and Epstein’s employees.” Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Donald Trump, and dozens of other prominent men in politics, finance and law have already been named, repeatedly, in the media as people who socialized or had suspect dealings with Epstein. So this is not a new story. The real story that mainstream media refuses to investigate is why federal judges in New York have been allowed to secret away in sealed documents the puzzle pieces to how Epstein’s network of powerful men were able to run a sex trafficking ring for two decades with the “active participation” of the largest federally-insured bank in the United States, JPMorgan Chase; and right under the nose of its Chairman, CEO and media darling, Jamie Dimon. This is the Big Story that has been left to wilt on the vine by the likes of the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and their peers. The answers to this Big Story will not be found in the documents slated to be unsealed by Judge Loretta Preska in the Virginia Giuffre case. They have been sealed and locked up tight in Judge Jed Rakoff’s courtroom after he oversaw multiple Epstein-related lawsuits brought against JPMorgan Chase in late 2022 and 2023. One case, Jane Doe v JPMorgan Chase, was a class action on behalf of Epstein’s sex assault and sex trafficked victims. Judge Rakoff approved its settlement for $290 million despite objections from 17 Attorneys General and the settlement’s unconscionable terms that included releasing claims for “harm, injury, abuse, exploitation, or trafficking by Jeffrey Epstein or by any person who is in any way connected to or otherwise associated with Jeffrey Epstein, as well as any right to recovery on account thereof.” Claimants were also required to sign the release form before they learned if they would get a dime from the settlement. Attorneys for the victims were not left in any such doubt. The settlement terms provided them with $87 million in legal fees and $2.5 million in expenses. Releasing claims against “Any person who is in any way connected to or otherwise associated with Jeffrey Epstein” conveniently includes a number of billionaires referred by Epstein to JPMorgan Chase as clients. There are also literally hundreds of high-profile individuals that were listed in Epstein’s little black book that could be considered “connected” to him. Many of the individuals listed in Epstein’s little black book – a total of 1,571 – have had important banking relationships with JPMorgan Chase. In a court filing on July 26 of last year by the Attorney General of the U.S. Virgin Islands, which has since settled its Epstein-related case against JPMorgan Chase for $75 million, it listed the following individuals as people Epstein referred as clients to the bank: Microsoft co-founder and billionaire Bill Gates; Google co-founder and billionaire Sergey Brin; the Sultan of Dubai, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem; media and real estate billionaire Mort Zuckerman; and numerous others. Epstein’s victims charged in their lawsuit that JPMorgan Chase had, for more than a decade, provided Epstein with cozy banking services, which included sluicing to him millions of dollars in hard cash from his accounts, sometimes as much as $40,000 to $80,000 a month. The bank failed to file the Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) that it is legally required to file with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for those payments in cash. Epstein’s alleged quid pro quo with the bank included him referring valuable business deals and clients to JPMorgan Chase. These allegations were substantiated by 22 pages of internal bank emails released in the related case brought against the bank by the U.S. Virgin Islands. A third Epstein-related case was brought against JPMorgan Chase in Rakoff’s court by two public pension funds that owned shares of JPMorgan Chase. That lawsuit named Dimon as a defendant as well as current and former members of JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors. It was brought by a prominent class action law firm on behalf of shareholders of the bank. The lawsuit’s theory of the case was that specific members of the Board of JPMorgan Chase “put their heads in the sand” and ignored that the bank had become a cash conduit for Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring because they were hoping that their own verifiable business ties to Epstein “would go unnoticed.” (We might add an attendant thesis: that Dimon takes very good care of his Board in return for them taking very good care of him.) Mainstream media ignored the allegations that members of the JPMorgan Chase Board of Directors had business ties with Epstein and Judge Rakoff wasted no time in dismissing the case on technical grounds. (This was not the first time that a major scandal involving JPMorgan Chase received a news blackout by mainstream media.) The other Big Story is why after 18 years of police and FBI investigations of Epstein and his wide sex trafficking ring, the U.S. Department of Justice has brought criminal charges against only two people: Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. There is also no indication, at present, that the Justice Department is preparing to bring a criminal case against JPMorgan Chase, despite its recidivist history of felony charges (including two felony counts for money laundering) and a former FBI agent’s statement on how the bank “impeded” a criminal investigation of Epstein. (See: New Court Documents Suggest the Justice Department Under Four Presidents Covered Up Jeffrey Epstein’s Money Laundering at JPMorgan Chase.)

https://dailyhealthpost.com/real-reason-to-drink-olive-oil-every-day/,The REAL Reason To Drink Olive Oil Every Day,0,"Olive oil is a healthy fat and the most common oil consumed in Mediterranean countries. It is high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), which are healthier than animal fats, saturated fats, and other plant oils. Oleic acid is the main MUFA found in olive oil; it makes up 80% of all fatty acids. Olive oil is also rich in vitamins such as alpha-tocopherol, also known as vitamin E! In today’s video, you’ll discover 11 amazing benefits of drinking olive oil every day. Watch till the end, to learn how you can distinguish fake extra virgin olive oil from the real. As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice; we are not doctors. Number 11. “Prevent Heart Diseases.” Olive oil shows vasodilator effects on blood vessels, which means olive oil widens blood vessels, preventing high blood pressure. Studies also showed that extra virgin olive oil high in MUFA, reduced LDL known as bad cholesterol, and increased HDL known as good cholesterol. Polyphenols found in extra virgin olive oil prevent atherosclerosis. They stop the oxidation of LDL accumulated on the wall of blood vessels. Polyphenols do this by capturing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and preventing their attack on blood vessels. Number 10. “Reduce Inflammation.” We are exposed to many environmental pollutants and toxins that cause oxidative damage in tissues and organs, resulting in function loss. Considering oxidative damage and inflammation are the leading causes of degenerative diseases, the antioxidant properties of olive oil have excellent benefits for health. Olive oil’s antioxidant effects come from polyphenols, which are powerful antioxidants found in plants, and it is found in higher amounts in extra virgin olive oil than refined olive oils. Number 9. “Promote Healthy Aging.” Everyone hopes to be disease and pain-free in old age. Olive oil supports healthy aging with its benefits for weight management and skeletal health. Olive oil can prevent a decline in bone mineral density which can lead to osteoporosis. Taking olive oil helps promote weight loss. One review of 11 randomized controlled studies found that people following an olive-oil-enriched diet for at least 12 weeks, compared to a control diet, reduced weight more effectively. Number 8. “Improve Cognitive Function.” Regular intake of olive oil is associated with healthy cognitive function. It protects neurons from oxidative damage, prevents dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, and even improves major depression symptoms. In a study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in 2021, 73 patients with depression were given 25ml extra virgin olive oil daily for 52 days. Patients who were given olive oil showed improvement in symptoms of depression compared to those who were given sunflower oil. Number 7. “Prevent Metabolic Diseases.” Metabolic diseases such as prediabetes, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome can be detrimental to overall health. These diseases are related to impaired blood glucose and lipid levels. Studies showed that olive oil could decrease glucose, total cholesterol, LDL levels and increase HDL levels by almost 50%. Number 6. “Help With Digestion.” Have you ever struggled with constipation? Olive oil can regulate your bowel movement. Importantly, it decreased inflammation and improved the symptoms of ulcerative colitis (UC), a disease of the intestines caused by inflammation. In a study published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2020, patients with ulcerative colitis were given 50 ml of extra virgin olive oil daily for 20 days. Their blood inflammation markers were decreased, and symptoms such as abdominal bloating, diarrhea, and constipation were reduced significantly. Number 5. “Protect the Skin.” The skin is our biggest organ, and it is directly exposed to environmental pollutants and UV radiation. It’s important to increase the skin’s antioxidant capacity to decrease inflammation, and even help to repair skin burns. In a study done in 2015, olive oil was given to patients who had burn-wounds in 10 to 20% of their total body surface. As a result, their wound healing time decreased. Number 4. “Prevent The Growth Of Harmful Bacteria.” The anti-bacterial effects of olive oil come from the high polyphenol content. A study tested olive oil effects on 6 strains of bacteria, including E. coli, which is highly contagious and the most frequent cause of gastrointestinal and urinary infections. The results showed that extra virgin olive oil effectively inhibited the growth of E. coli. Olive oil can also inhibit Helicobacter pylori infection, which can cause stomach cancer. Number 3. “Boost The Immune System.” A healthy immune system is important because it produces cells that fight infection and diseases. Olive oil can be beneficial for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which immune cells attack normal host cells by mistake and damage the joints. An animal study showed that extra virgin olive oil could reduce swelling in joints, and the harmful molecules that cause inflammation in joints. Also, a study done in 2020 showed that even applying and massaging with olive oil, reduced pain in the joints in women with rheumatoid arthritis. Number 2. “Help to Prevent Cancer.” Oxidative damage in DNA can cause cancers. Extra virgin olive oil contains polyphenols and vitamin E that capture reactive oxygen species (ROS) and eliminate them. In a study done in 2011, an analysis of 19 studies from thousands of patients showed that higher olive oil consumption lowered the risk of breast and digestive system cancer. Number 1. “Improve Liver Health.” The liver is the central organ for nutrient metabolism. Taking olive oil improves insulin resistance and decreases triglyceride accumulation, the leading cause of fatty liver diseases. Also, the antioxidant effects of olive oil protect liver cells from the harmful effects of lipid peroxidation, which damages the cells. See our video, 7 Signs and Symptoms of Fatty Liver – “Reverse!” Unfortunately, not all olive oils are the same. There are a lot of frauds who sell refined, and “not” virgin olive oils. These fakes do not show the same beneficial effects as extra virgin olive oil, because refined olive oils have lower or no polyphenol content. Here are some tips to help you choose high-quality extra virgin olive oil. First, taste it. If the taste is bland or it has a plastic taste, it is most likely fake. Olive oil has a rich taste; it should give you a fresh, peppery finish in your throat. Second, check the bottle. It should be dark because olive oil can easily be damaged by light and the taste becomes bitter. Third, check the harvest time. Choose the oil with the most recent harvest date. Fourth, avoid bottles that have “pure,” “light,” and “virgin” labels. Instead, select the one labeled as “extra virgin.” Olive oil has a high smoke point of approximately 190 Celsius. It is healthy to use when cooking in high heat because it is not burned easily. You can add olive oil to your salad, bread, fish, or you can drink it neat. Please share how you take olive oil, and the benefits you experienced in the comments below. Although there is no exact amount of olive oil you have to drink daily, people living in the Mediterranean countries are reported to consume 60 ml or 4 tablespoons of olive oil. You can take 1 tablespoon every day on an empty stomach, or you can use olive oil extensively in your cooking. You can mix 1 tablespoon of olive oil with lemon juice, 1 raw black garlic clove, 1 tablespoon of raw honey, and add a pinch of turmeric. Stir well and drink 30 minutes before breakfast; this is just one of many ways you can take olive oil!

https://dailyhealthpost.com/real-reason-to-drink-lemon-water/,The Real Reason To Drink Lemon Water Revealed,0,"Lemon! A little sour, bitter, but fresh fruit overflowing with nutrients! If you are having problems with your skin, digestion, or feeling a little off, tired, and anxious…..why not try drinking lemon water everyday? Today, we explore 13 REAL benefits of taking lemon, and lemon water daily, according to science. Number 13. “Lemon Water Is Nutritious”. Drinking lemon water can be your safeguard throughout the day. It is a fantastic source of vitamin C, which will boost your immunity. On top of it, lemon water supports your eye health with vitamin A, gives you energy with vitamins B1, B2, and B3, strengthens your muscles with calcium and magnesium, and promotes your cardiovascular health with potassium. To discover the exact benefits of these nutrients coming from lemon, watch this video till the end…..and be prepared to be amazed! Moving on to Number 12. “Better Digestion, Happy Bowels”. As discovered in the last decades, bowel health affects all of your body, from head to toe. Good bowel movement, and a healthy microbiome in the gut, will make you healthier. Lemon contains an ingredient called D-limonene, which increases the motility of your bowel and stomach, giving you a healthy digestive system. It also reduces gastric acid, and prevents unpleasant problems with the stomach, such as gastritis or reflux. Number 11 addresses a modern life problem. “Reduce Stress and Pain”. Mental health issues, especially anxiety, have hit the roof. Mental health affects overall health, so it is important, to manage the stress levels in our daily lives. D-limonene calms you down, by activating serotonin and dopamine, which are known as happiness hormones. It also inhibits pain receptors, so it can act as a painkiller. Next, avoid this painful condition; Number 10 is “Prevent Kidney Stones”. Kidney stones are formed by substances in the urine, including calcium. Approximately 80% of kidney stones are made of calcium. Lemon is rich in citrate, which binds to calcium. So, stone formation is inhibited, because calcium is no longer free. Studies show that drinking one-half cup of lemon juice concentrate, diluted in water each day, or the equivalent amount from two lemons, can increase urine citrate, and likely reduce kidney stone risk. Want to look younger? Next up is Number 9, “Boost Collagen Synthesis”. Collagen is the main element of your skin, hair, bones, and muscle. Vitamin C in lemon water is needed for collagen synthesis. Increased collagen production can give you firmer, younger, and glowing skin. Next, boost blood oxygen levels. Number 8. “Increase Iron Absorption”. Iron is an essential mineral for living cells, especially red blood cells. Iron is needed to synthesize hemoglobin, which carries oxygen to the organs. Considering the prevalence of iron deficiency, lemon water can be beneficial, especially when taken with iron sources, like meat, lentils, nuts, and spinach. Vitamin C in lemon water increases the absorption of iron from the intestines. Next, prevent heart attack and stroke; Number 7 is “Support Cardiovascular Health”. Lemon water may improve your heart health, by decreasing blood pressure. When you have lower blood pressure, your heart and blood vessels are healthier, and your organs can get enough oxygen and nutrients to function properly. Drinking lemon water also lowers the risk of cardiovascular diseases, because it prevents lipid accumulation in the blood vessels. Next, prevent cell damage; Number 6 is “Increase Anti-Oxidant Activity”. Reactive oxygen species, (ROS) are produced by metabolic processes, or environmental pollutants, and accumulate in your body. They are harmful to your cells, and we need anti-oxidant compounds to eliminate them. Here, lemon water comes into play. Lemon is full of flavonoids, which are compounds showing anti-oxidant effects. Some flavonoids found in lemon are hesperidin, naringin, diosmin, and quercetin. The hesperidin in lemon, is an especially strong inhibitor of ROS. This anti-oxidant activity of lemon water, helps protect your cells and DNA, from the harmful effects of ROS. Are you looking to lose weight? Number 5 is “Maintain Healthy Metabolism”. A healthy metabolism is crucial for weight management. D-limonene in lemon water has positive effects on metabolism, and supports weight loss. People with high cholesterol, and glucose levels can benefit from lemon water. Studies showed that D-limonene can decrease LDL, known as “bad cholesterol”, and help maintain healthy blood sugar levels, resulting in obesity prevention. In addition, if the liver or pancreas gets damaged, because of metabolic problems, D-limonene can show therapeutic effects too. Number 4. Drink lemon water every day to “Reduce Inflammation”. Chronic inflammation is detrimental to health. It makes your immune cells attack your own cells, and destroy them, resulting in tissue and organ damage, so it can affect every system in the body. In a study done in 2015, individuals are given a low-calorie diet with 2 liters of lemon detox juice, containing 140 mg of lemon juice, and 2 liters of water every day. The people who drank lemon water every day, had lower C-reactive protein levels, which is an indicator of inflammation and infection in the body. Down to our final 3. Number 3 is “Reduce Allergy Symptoms”. Allergies are widespread, and can be really annoying sometimes. Usually, people with allergies are prescribed anti-histamine drugs. Luckily, lemon water can inhibit the release of histamine, which causes itching in your skin, and increases mucus and gastric acid production. Number 2. Drink lemon water daily to “Protect Against Infections”. Lemon is an acidic fruit. It can inhibit the growth of a wide range of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. For example, it can prevent bacterial infection from Escherichia Coli, which can cause urinary tract infections, or Candida Glabrata, which is a vaginal yeast infection. It also reduces viral infections, such as herpes simplex that causes cold sores. Besides the aforementioned infections, lemon has excellent effects on many microbes and viruses. Finally, our Number 1 is “Protect Against DNA Damage”. Cancer occurs because of genetic changes in the DNA, leading to abnormal growth of the cells. The vitamins and flavonoids in lemon water, can enhance anti-oxidant effects, preventing DNA from getting damaged. Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women. A study done in 2012, showed that lemon seeds have beneficial effects on breast cancer, by inducing the death of carcinogenic cells. Even though 1 glass of lemon water cannot reverse cancer, it can prevent it, by eliminating oxidant molecules, that can be harmful to the DNA of the cells. Lastly, what is the best time to drink lemon water? You can drink lemon water in the morning, on an empty stomach, to get the nutrients to start a day with boosted immunity and energy. Or, you can drink hot lemon water before bed for relaxation. SOURCES And be sure to check out our other videos!",3,0.34692115,0.020033687,False
https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20231027/cm/needle-free-flu-vaccine-for-home-use-may-be-approved-next-year,Needle-Free Flu Vaccine for Home Use May Be Approved Next Year,1,"Oct. 27, 2023 – A self-administered nasal spray flu vaccine could be available next season. Drug-maker AstraZeneca announced this week that the FDA is currently considering approving the needle-free option for home use. Called FluMist, the vaccine must be refrigerated and would be shipped in insulated packaging to people’s homes. FluMist has been around for more than two decades and is approved for people ages 2 to 49 years old. It’s fallen in and out of favor over the years, including one period where a CDC advisory panel highlighted FluMist as the preferred flu vaccine for children. Later, its effectiveness was questioned, leading to a reformulation effort, STAT News reported. AstraZeneca expects the FDA to make a decision on whether to allow home use of FluMist by Spring 2024. The convenience of home administration could increase the number of people who get a flu vaccine, said Ravi Jhaveri, MD, Chief of Infectious Diseases in the Department of Pediatrics at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “Vaccination rates for children and adults under 50 years of age declined in the 2022-2023 flu season, highlighting a need for more accessible solutions,” said Jhaveri in an AstraZeneca press release. “The ability for individuals and parents to choose where to administer an injection-free flu vaccine could help increase access and, subsequently, vaccination rates, and greatly benefit those most impacted by this serious and contagious respiratory illness.” The CDC says flu activity so far this season remains low. In the past week, 1,456 people were admitted to hospitals with the flu. The CDC says 137 million flu vaccine doses have distributed in the U.S., and about 21% of children have gotten the flu shot as of Oct. 14, which is similar to last year, according to the CDC. About 25% of adults were vaccinated for flu as of Oct. 21, and about 18% of pregnant people had gotten a flu shot as of the end of September, which is up slightly from 17% last year. The CDC recommends that everyone age 6 months and older get a flu vaccine.",4,-0.38002858,0.26778513,False
https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20231027/cm/us-says-only-7-percent-adults-gotten-new-covid-shot,U.S. Says Only 7% of Adults Have Gotten New COVID Shot,1,"Oct. 27, 2023 – Only 7.1% of adults and 2.1% of children in the United States have gotten the new version of the COVID-19 vaccine since it was authorized in mid-September, a CDC committee was told on Thursday. The figures were drawn from a survey of about 14,000 Americans conducted Oct. 8 to 14, according to a PowerPoint presentation of the meeting. Adults were more likely to get the vaccine if they were older, insured, and with higher incomes, the presentation said. The survey said 24.6% of adults surveyed said they will definitely get vaccinated and 37.6% said they probably or definitely will not get vaccinated. About a quarter of children have a parent who said they definitely will get their child vaccinated, while 2 in 5 children have a parent that said they probably or definitely will not get their child vaccinated, the presentation showed. (The vaccine is recommended for all children over 6 months.) Medical experts were dismayed at the low number of people getting vaccinated. Camille Kotton, MD, of Harvard Medical School called the numbers “abysmal” and said patient confusion may be a factor, The Associated Press reported. She called for improved public education campaigns. The new vaccine is designed to target currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. The vaccine replaces bivalent visions that targeted the original COVID strain and earlier versions of Omicron. The FDA said the new vaccine is “formulated to more closely target currently circulating variants and to provide better protection against serious consequences of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death.""",4,-0.4285819,0.33980668,False
https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/news/20231026/cm/new-vaccine-meningitis-could-soon-be-available,New Vaccine for Meningitis Could Soon Be Available,1,"Oct. 26, 2023 – A new meningococcal vaccine that better protects against the rare but potentially deadly disease will soon be available. Vaccines are already available that protect against the forms of bacteria that can lead to meningitis, but full protection requires four or five shots typically given at various points from 11 to 18 years of age. The new “pentavalent” version protects against all five types of bacteria that cause most cases, and is completed in only two shots. Meningococcal disease is caused by various types of a bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis that can be spread via saliva. Many people carry the bacteria in the back of their nose or throat without being ill, but sometimes it invades the body and can cause serious illness. Sickened people may have brain swelling called meningitis or bloodstream infections. In rare cases, people die within 24 hours or survive with long-term disabilities. Quick treatment can be life-saving, but the symptoms, like fever and a stiff neck, mimic flu or COVID-19 and sometimes result in less urgency for seeking medical attention. Even with timely antibiotic treatment, 10 to 15 out of 100 people die, and 1 in 5 survivors are disabled, according to the CDC. The new vaccine, which is made by Pfizer and called Penbraya, was approved by the FDA last week. An independent advisory committee issued its recommendation to the CDC for the shot on Wednesday, CNN reported. It is approved for use in people ages 10 to 25 years old and protects against meningococcal groups A, B, C, W, and Y. The vaccine is a two-shot series, with the shots being given 6 months apart. Reducing the number of needed shots could improve vaccine uptake. A presentation at the CDC advisory committee meeting Wednesday showed that only 30% of 17-year-olds are getting even a single vaccine dose, CNN reported. The new vaccine was shown in clinical trials to increase immune response, but in its news release, Pfizer cautioned that vaccination with Penbraya may not protect all people from infection or invasive disease.",4,-0.24395108,0.27965736,False

https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20231024/cm/cdc-issues-rsv-vaccination-alert-because-of-drug-shortage,CDC Issues RSV Vaccination Alert Because of Drug Shortage,1,"Oct. 24, 2023 -- A limited supply of a drug to protect infants from the respiratory disease RSV has led the CDC to issue a health alert. Officials are advising pediatricians to use certain doses of nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody sold by the brand name Beyfortus, for infants with the greatest danger of developing severe respiratory syncytial virus. Cases of RSV have been rising in parts of the country at the start of cold and flu season. “The shortage is pretty disheartening,” said Scott Roberts, MD, of Yale School of Medicine in The Washington Post. “I had hoped we learned lessons from COVID, where we foresee these challenges [because] it seems like this was a preventable shortage where we they should have anticipated the demand.” Drug maker Sanofi told the Post it is trying to speed up supply with its manufacturing partner, AstraZeneca. RSV is highly contagious and mostly hits the respiratory system, especially in older people, young kids, and people with weakened immune systems. The FDA OK’d Beyfortus in July for infants. It is a single shot and can be given to children younger than 8 months and up to 24 months most at risk for a severe RSV infection, the Post reported. It comes in doses of 50 and 100 milligrams, depending on age and weight of the child. The CDC left the 50-milligram recommendations the same. “But to ration the 100-milligram doses, the CDC advises suspending administration of nirsevimab to infants between 8 and 19 months unless they fall into certain categories the agency deems most vulnerable,” the paper said.",4,-0.33840066,0.25467467,False

GAZA: 3,195 Children Killed in Three Weeks Surpasses Annual Number of Children Killed in Conflict Zones since 2019 The number of children reported killed in Gaza in just three weeks has surpassed the annual number of children killed across the world’s conflict zones since 2019, Save the Children said. Since October 7, more than 3,257 children have been reported killed, including at least 3,195 in Gaza, 33 in the West Bank, and 29 in Israel, according to the Ministries of Health in Gaza and Israel respectively. The number of children reported killed in just three weeks in Gaza is more than the number killed in armed conflict globally—across more than 20 countries—over the course of a whole year, for the last three years. (Source.) Earlier today, a refugee camp inside of Gaza was bombed, reportedly leaving hundreds dead, including innocent women and children. ‘A massive massacre’: Al Jazeera reporter describes the scene from Jabalia From the middle of a giant crater that used to be homes in the Jabalia refugee camp, Al Jazeera’s Anas al-Shareef described the scene in front of him, as rescuers desperately dug into the rubble with their bare hands, in footage aired on the network. “There was a little girl in this place, they are trying their best to reach this little girl,” al-Shareef said. Around him, people were attempting to help those trapped or retrieve bodies. Others were in shock at what had happened. “Look at the destruction,” al-Shareef said, as he pointed to the shell of a building. “Most of the victims are kids, children, women. We’ve seen hundreds of victims here. The destruction is huge.” Al-Shareef continued to walk over the rubble, amid an apocalyptic scene. “It’s a massive massacre. You cannot count the number of destroyed buildings in this place.” (Source.) Tim Truth has put together some video footage and commentary: As I reported on Saturday, opposition to the ongoing genocide in Gaza is mounting here in the U.S. as Jews shut down New York City’s Grand Central Station Friday night during rush hour, calling for a cease fire. Today, protesters disrupted a Senate Committee hearing in Washington D.C. on sending aid to Israel, holding up hands and arms painted in blood red, with many of them being arrested. Outside the U.S., opposition to the massacre of thousands of children and the ongoing genocide against the Palestinian people is rapidly rising. That opposition is coming from the Muslim nations, where in a rare show of solidarity Shia Muslims are uniting with Sunni Muslims. In addition to the Muslim nations, China and Russia have issued very stern warnings the past few days. Can the U.S. military, where 68% of its service members are reportedly obese and unfit for combat, take on the entire world? Earlier today, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in a news conference that he was rejecting calls for a cease fire, and the Israeli military is stating that their operations are going to “expand and intensify.” He also rejected calls for a cease-fire to facilitate the release of captives or end the war, which he has said will be long and difficult. “Calls for a cease-fire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas,” he told a news conference. “That will not happen.” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, declined to comment on where Israeli forces are deployed, but said additional forces had entered Gaza and operations would continue to “expand and intensify.” (Source.) Since Netanyahu does not even have the majority of Israelis supporting him, this begs the question: Is Netanyahu committing national suicide? The western media mostly presents the image that Israel is unstoppable, and have won all of their previous conflicts against their Muslim neighbors. But if you look outside of western media and pro-Zionist news sources, you get a very different view. Sam Parker of Behind the News Network published another article today on the Gaza conflict that gives the non-western perspective. Excerpts: Hezbollah This group came into being during Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982. They eventually managed to push Israel out of Lebanon in 2000, after Israel had suffered continuous losses in Lebanon for 2 decades at the hands of Hezbollah. In 2006, under US cover/permission/guidance, Israel invaded Lebanon. In the 34-day war that followed, Israel suffered a massive defeat, losing nearly 500 soldiers and more than 40 tanks. An invasion force of 30,000 was defeated with a loss of about 100 Hezbollah soldiers. In that war, Hezbollah fired around 100,000 to 250,000 rockets into Israel. That was 17 years ago. Since then, Hezbollah has improved its arsenal and technology. Besides it has had extensive battle field experience in the Syrian war. It currently has around 40,000 fighters, an extensive arsenal, and is heavily supported by Iran. In contrast, Israel does not have a military force trained and ready to respond. Most of the IDF is made up of reservists. There are very few full-time military personnel. Then, for the past 2 decades, other than the brief Lebanon war of 2006, the IDF does not have experience fighting. Rather, we can class them more as a “police force”, than a military force- attacking civilians and raiding Gaza or the West Bank. When Israel called up 300,000 reservists, it was found that the army was not ready for this. There have been many complaints on social media from these reservists that they have “NO EXPERIENCE, NO UNIFORMS and NO TRAINING”. Some have even asked for money to buy body armor! It got so bad, that the US had to fly in plane loads of uniforms from Jordan. Many people point to Israel’s comparatively massive army, with over 300,000+ reserves reportedly called up. But one must recall that Israel has a unique system: one of the only countries in the world where men and women are both drafted equally for mandatory conscription—this is why you see such a prevalence of female Israeli TikTok soldiers. Thus the official statistic is that 40% of Israel’s conscript force are female soldiers—so how much of their large army is actually combat capable, it’s hard to know, but probably not commensurate with Hezbollah fighters on a one to one basis. A Defeat for Israel Israel is the least liked country in the world. It represents the visible tip of an invisible empire-that of the Rothschild family, based in London and Paris. It uses the global power of the family to achieve its ends-the protection and growth of Israel – while dismantling/destroying/balkanizing any nations that oppose this expansionist policy. To accommodate the increasing number of Jews moving to Israel, the family needs more land. It needs to expand. Israel is the only country in the world which lacks defined borders. The vast majority of Jews in Israel today are residents of Europe and Russia. The majority of them come from low income backgrounds. Moving to Israel is like paradise for them. These are the cannon fodder of the Rothschild family. Very few billionaire Jews reside permanently in Israel – the vast majority use it as a refuge or transit place. Although the Covid pandemic was a Rockefeller initiative, the Rothschild family jumped on board for its own reasons. We see the evidence that the toughest restrictions were in force in those countries within the Rothschild orbit. Such as the UK, Australia, Canada and the EU, and Israel. And within these countries, Israel was amongst the hardest hit in enforcing restrictions. From this alone, we see that the family couldn’t care two hoots about the welfare of its “cannon fodder”- especially when it comes to geopolitical gains for the family. The Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem is the 3rd holiest site for 2 billion Muslims. So, Hamas is not alone. Behind Hamas stands Iran and its proxies in the region: Hezbollah (around 40,000-50,000 fighters) , Syria, the Iraqi PMUS ( around 100-200,000 fighters) and Yemen. This is the Shia Axis of Resistance. And, it is a formidable force capable of hitting Israel with long distance rockets and missiles. Iran:-When Israel’s strikes on Gaza became over the limit, rumblings began in this Axis. When Israel threatened to invade Gaza, Hezbollah warned that it would enter the fight if Israel did so. This stopped Israel. At this moment, the US stepped in. It sent 2 aircraft carrier groups offshore Israel, moved the 101st Airborne Unit from Romania to Jordan (2,000 troops), beefed up its aviation side, and is transporting more military equipment and supplies to Egypt. Turkey: – Two days ago, Erdogan announced that the Turkish Navy is conducting “Live” drills, and that they would be next to the US ships in the area. It is noticeable that he mentioned “live”, as he said that real bullets and rockets are going to be used in this drill Syria: – The US has activated ISIS in Syria which has launched a series of attacks against the Syrian army. This happened the moment Syria began firing rockets at Israeli positions on the Golan Heights. Egypt: – Egypt has moved tanks to the Gaza border, with an intention of intervening if Israel invades Gaza. Iraq: – The Shia paramilitary groups in Iraq, known as the PMU’s, have started sending forces to Syria and Lebanon in anticipation of entering the war Yemen: – Likewise, the Houthis in Yemen are prepared to use their long-range drones and missiles to strike Israel. We find that the entire region is gearing up for war against Israel first, and the US bases in the region are now in the cross-hairs: from strategic patience to strategic anger. Continuous destruction of Merkava tanks with Russian Kornet anti-tank rockets, disabling radar equipment and surveillance systems, regular rocket barrages bomb Gaza, targeted strikes from the Hezbollah, non-stop bombing of Tel Aviv, Ashkelon and Zionist settler colonies. Recording an unprecedented historical record of casualties , and its citizens and soldiers being taken captives, are achievements which the resistance has achieved in a remarkable short time, and one which should not be ignored. In the world of geopolitics, emotion and bias goes out the door. Cold, hard facts prevail. The Rothschild family of London and Paris did not expect this. All their plans over the past 3 years have collapsed. Its captive EU, Australia, New Zealand and Canada don’t know what to do, except threaten anyone that supports Hamas. This is the same with the Rockefeller family in New York. The old and tried trick of pressuring the Arabs to clamp down on the resistance groups has ended. We witness that from the reception Blinken received from Sissi of Egypt- cold and dismissive. It was even worse in Saudi Arabia when MBS kept Blinken waiting the entire night. And MBS gave it to Blinken. No American official has been so publicly humiliated over the past 8 decades! Then Biden was to meet in Jordan with the King and 2 other Arab leaders. The Arabs called the meeting off. No Arab leader wants to meet with the Americans, as they all blame the US for this conflict. There is also another angle to look at. In January, BRICS will expand by 6 new members, taking the bloc to 11 members, and a new moniker- BRICS +. The most important of the new members are Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. These will significantly boost the influence and power of BRICS. The new BRICS + has the power to cripple the dollar overnight, and turn the US into a “has been” power. With the mutual dislike and hate between MBS and Biden very high, anything is possible. For sure, the Rockefeller Empire and its allies may do something stupid against these three and to MBS in particular, or a new war could erupt in the region. In addition, Russia has now begun to patrol the Black Sea with Mig 31s armed with Kinzhal missiles. What a brilliant move. These Migs have a range of 1,000 kms plus add another 2,000 plus kms for the Kinzhals, giving a total range of 3,000 kms. This means that Russia can control the eastern Mediterranean up to Sicily. The implication is that this was to put the US carrier groups in the crosshairs. Now, you understand why I said that Putin has been the grand chess master of Eurasia, and in this Gaza war as well. Well planned and played out. One must have vision for such, which the West is sorely lacking. The U.S. knows that global sentiment is drastically turning against it and the West in general. To create another ongoing bloodbath in Gaza would mean the U.S. may lose critical support and geopolitical influence. To touch on this last point: one must be aware of how major the global tectonic shifts are, which are in motion at the moment. The entire Arab world is consolidating in solidarity over the Gaza situation. The Iranian and Saudi ministers met in Jeddah again yesterday, which is very significant in its own right: Qatar, Jordan, Turkey and many others have come out with big statements in support of Palestine. Particularly Vis a Vis Saudi Arabia, the motions are huge because KSA has always been one of the key linchpins holding the global Atlanticist Empire afloat. Few people know but back in the early 70s—which the current period is beginning to mimic very closely—Saudi Arabia not only agreed to create the Petrodollar, which brought the U.S. dollar into global dominance, but also secretly bankrolled all the U.S. debt by being the largest purchase of U.S. treasuries under a secret deal which remained classified for 40 years until recently. The scale of how much U.S. debt Saudi Arabia secretly holds is said to be off the charts and if it were to dump it all, it could potentially collapse the entire global financial system in one swoop. So the fact that KSA is now being led increasingly into the arms of Russia and China (recall KSA is now an official member of BRICS, starting on January 1, 2024), is a big deal. Inroads were made toward Israeli normalization but now KSA has cut them off and is increasing its entrenchment with the Eastern bloc. The other reason this is very significant is because if a larger war were to kick off, oil would become the primary geostrategic global issue. That’s because Iran can wreak havoc on global U.S. markets, transits via the known chokepoints of the Persian Gulf, etc. This is underscored by the fact that the Iranian minister called for a total oil embargo on Israel during this meeting: This is why Saudi’s role is particularly relevant because it would have an even larger outsize say if things really hit the fan, because of KSA’s global oil dominance. Thus, these are some of the reasons U.S. is frightened of the risks, and is likely transferring that fear onto Israel, which is now unsure of what to do. But getting back briefly to the U.S. position. The issue is that Blinken’s and Biden’s recent MidEast tour has, by all accounts, backfired as a disaster. Blinken and Biden both experienced major humiliating snubs: Meanwhile Jordan cancelled a Biden summit that was meant to take place along with Palestinian and Egyptian leaders. With Jordanian foreign minister instead vehemently condemning the new ‘Nakba’ attempt as an ‘act of war’: At the UN Human Rights Council, members even turned away from the U.S. ambassador: Observers have been appalled at the unprecedented drop in U.S. influence and prestige in the Middle East. The fact is, while the U.S. continues to stumble into zugzwang traps, isolating itself as the global villain; Russia and China continue to build a new world. Putin as we speak is in Beijing being hosted as the honored guest to the 3rd One Belt One Road Forum. Read the full article at Behind the News Network. This is what Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier today: Killing of civilians in Gaza ‘unjustifiable’ Israel’s indiscriminate airstrikes on Gaza “cannot be justified,” Putin said. He noted that the recent flare-up in the Middle East was triggered by the terrorist attack by Hamas militants against Israeli civilians. However, “instead of going after criminals and terrorists,” Israel has since resorted to “exact revenge [on the Palestinians] in the form of collective punishment.” American-run world ‘falling to pieces’ The US and its allies are the “main beneficiaries of the global instability,” the Russian president said, arguing that the West was making “blood money” from various conflicts. “The American-run world, with its single hegemon, is falling to pieces. It is gradually but irreversibly becoming a thing of the past,” Putin said. (Source.) If people in the U.S. are increasingly protesting against the killing of lives in Gaza and calling for a cease fire, and as the rest of the world moves rapidly to unify against the ongoing genocide against Palestinians and the demonic sacrifice of innocent children, then who is supporting these atrocious, demonic attacks against these children and innocent civilians? Evangelical Christians. The Zionist Evangelical branch of Christianity now appears the be the leaders in the world supporting war, mass murder, and the genocide against an entire race of people and an entire religion. You can hear this rhetoric of hate and murder directly from their many leaders, who call themselves “pastors”. This group supports Netanyahu even more than Jews do. Here is one in Tennessee, Pastor Greg Locke: As I have previously written, Zionism is a cult with hatred and murder preached from the pulpits of these Christian Churches of Satan. How could this cult have become such a part of American culture, and corporate Christianity? Corporate Christianity is a $TRILLION market, employing millions of people, and to dare to oppose Zionism and not support Israel is to potentially lose your career and source of income, and be ridiculed by the Christian Community. A study conducted in 2016 estimated that religion in America, which is primarily Zionist Christianity, was “worth $1.2 trillion, more than the combined revenue of the top 10 technology companies in the country, including Apple, Amazon, and Google.” (Source.) “MinistryWatch” listed the “100 largest Christian ministries in the U.S.” in 2020. (Source.) Just these 100 businesses alone total over $23 billion: $23,844,696,705. Three of these top 5 Christian businesses are universities where Zionism is taught, with each school taking in over $1 billion in revenue each year. When you consider all the Zionist Christian publishing companies producing news, films, TV, books and educational materials, as well as Christian “Pastors” who graduated from these Zionist schools preaching Zionism from the pulpit every week, it is easy to see how the Zionist propaganda infiltrates and saturates American culture and Conservative Right-wing politics. The leaders at the top of this industry are clearly Freemasons, and if they are successful in destroying the current Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, and replacing it with a Masonic “Jewish” Temple, you can be sure all the Zionist Christians will shout for joy in their service to Satan. Jesus prophesied that Herod’s Temple in Jerusalem would be destroyed when he was still walking the earth, which it was in 70 AD. But he also stated that the new “temple” would be his “body,” after he was raised from the dead and his Spirit resided in the “body of believers,” a spiritual “temple” for the “anointed” ones. Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17) So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit. (Ephesians 2:19-22) As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious, you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in Scripture: “Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.” So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, “The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,” and “A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense.” They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. (1 Peter 2:4-9) The believers in Jesus Christ, those who are born spiritually into the Seed of Abraham, are now the “chosen people”, not based on ethnicity or religious affiliation, but by our faith in Jesus Christ.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/improve-blood-flow-to-your-feet/,Top 8 Ways to Improve Blood Flow to Your Feet,0,"If you experience any of these symptoms of poor circulation in the feet and legs:…Cold, aching feet…Swollen ankles and calves…Throbbing, numbness, and tingling…Sores, blisters, and ulcers…Spider and varicose veins…Slow-healing cuts and wounds…It’s time you pay attention, as this means blood is pooling in your legs and feet, and becoming stale and oxygen-starved…instead of flowing back to your heart to be recycled, and returning as fresh, oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to your lower limbs. Without a constant supply of life-sustaining nutrients, the nerves in your feet can gradually become damaged, and atrophy. Discover our recommended compression socks to keep your legs fresh and energized all day. In today’s video, we’ll look at 9 ways to improve blood flow to your feet, and the causes of poor blood circulation. Make sure you watch till the end, cause we’ll explain how one unique food extract has been found to specifically help improve blood flow in your legs. As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors. Number 8. Walking. Walking is the best way to quickly improve circulation. That’s because every step you take, helps activate the muscles in your legs, which helps increase blood flow. As your muscles contract and relax, they squeeze around the large veins in your legs, promoting healthy circulation in your lower body. Going for short walks of just 5 minutes a day can help make a difference. Many studies have found that even small increases in the amount of time you walk daily, can have long-lasting benefits; these include improving overall balance, lowering blood pressure, promoting weight loss, and lifting your mood. Number 7. Wear Compression Socks. If you work at a job where you need to be either seated or standing for the entire day, compression stockings can help to improve your blood flow, as well as reduce swelling and pain. The basic concept behind compression socks is called ‘graduated compression’. This technique works by concentrating the highest amount of compression at the ankle, then gradually reducing it higher up the leg. This helps to gently push old and stagnant blood, “up and out” of the feet and legs. It’s a little like squeezing the bottom of a toothpaste tube! Doctors typically recommend compression socks for preventing deadly blood clots on long-haul flights. Plus, according to studies, the right compression socks can improve endurance, enhance athletic performance, and speed recovery time – which is why athletes wear them. Discover our recommended compression socks to keep your legs fresh and energized all day. Number 6. Stop Smoking. If you want better overall blood flow, then you definitely shouldn’t be smoking. Cigarettes contain high amounts of nicotine. This chemical compound causes your blood vessels to constrict or narrow, and reduces blood flow to your limbs. This happens because over time, the constant constriction makes your blood vessels stiffer and less elastic. In addition, smoking has also been found to cause plaque build-up in your arteries, which can lead to peripheral artery disease (PAD). This may cause symptoms, such as claudication, which means there is pain in your thigh, calf, or buttocks when you walk. Number 5. Eat More Nitrate-rich Vegetables. Besides reducing your intake of highly processed foods to prevent high blood pressure, plaque formation, and diabetes, adding more nitrate-rich foods to your diet can help your body improve blood flow. That’s because nitrates are converted into nitric oxide in the body, which improves blood flow by relaxing blood vessels. Some foods that are naturally high in nitrates include dark leafy greens, beets, cauliflower, carrots, broccoli, citrus fruits, watermelon, and pomegranates. See our video, “Top 11 Foods to Strengthen Blood Flow“. Number 4. Try Horse Chestnut Extract. Extract from the horse chestnut seed contains a natural compound called aescin, which has been found to improve vein health and reduce inflammation. Many studies have found that taking daily doses of 50 milligrams of aescin for up to 8 weeks can help reduce symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), which is a health condition characterized by poor blood flow to the veins of the legs. Another study published in 2015 found that horse chestnut was as effective as wearing compression stockings. Always consult your healthcare provider before taking horse chestnut extract, especially if you have a medical condition or are currently taking medications. Number 3. Manage Your Blood Pressure Levels. Having high blood pressure can create microtears in your artery walls, which increases your risk of plaque buildup. This cholesterol blockage can occur in your lower extremities and reduce blood flow. Exercising, cutting back on sodium, and reducing stress levels are three things you can do to help lower your blood pressure, and improve your circulation at the same time. Also, see our video, “Top 12 Potassium-Rich Foods That Reduce Blood Pressure“. Number 2. Cut Back on Sugar. Eating too many sweets or refined carbs, can cause your blood sugar levels to damage the lining of your small blood vessels. When this happens, the elasticity of your blood vessels decreases and this causes them to narrow, impeding blood flow. Number 1. Focus on Feet Exercises. There are plenty of exercises you can do lying down, or while sitting to keep your blood flowing. Some examples that you can do while lying down include ankle pumping, which involves flexing your foot in the direction of your head. Another popular one that you can do while standing or seated are heel and toe raises. To do this, simply raise both heels until you’re on your toes and hold for 3 seconds before lowering back to starting position. Lastly, you can do ankle rotations pretty much anywhere you want. Simply rotate the ankle clockwise and then counterclockwise. Lastly, let’s summarize the causes of poor blood circulation in your legs and feet. A common cause is living a sedentary lifestyle with too many hours spent sitting down, whether at a desk or traveling in a car, train or plane. According to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, sitting for 8 hours a day can actually cancel out the benefits of regular exercise. Another study from Indiana University showed that after only one hour of sitting, healthy blood flow can be reduced by up to 50%. Other causes of poor blood flow are Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), diabetes, being overweight, smoking, and blood clots.

https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20231019/cm/covid-linked-higher-risk-guillain-barre-syndrome-study,COVID Linked to Higher Risk of Guillain-Barré Syndrome: Study,1,"Oct. 19, 2023 – A large new study links COVID-19 with an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Vaccination against COVID appeared to reduce the risk of GBS, which is a rare illness that can leave people paralyzed. The findings were published Wednesday by the American Academy of Neurology in its journal Neurology. Researchers analyzed health data from January 2021 to July 2022 for more than 3 million people in Israel ages 16 years and older not diagnosed with GBS before. They found that people with a recent COVID infection were six times more likely to have GBS, compared to people without a recent infection. But the disease remains very rare. Of the 3 million people in the study, 76 got GBS. The increased risk of GBS was measured within the 6 weeks after a person had COVID. People who had recently received an mRNA-based COVID vaccine were 50% less likely to get GBS, compared to people who had not been recently vaccinated. “These findings further highlight the benefits of ongoing vaccination programs with mRNA-based vaccines,” study author Anat Arbel, MD, of Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center in Haifa, Israel, said in a news release. “The results have important clinical and public health implications.” The authors noted that not all people in the study had COVID test data on file. That means some people who were considered uninfected may have had SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, but they had no symptoms of COVID or only mild symptoms and did not take a test. The cause of GBS is unknown, and there is no cure. Symptoms begin with weakness in the hands and feet, and can progress to paralysis. GBS can be life-threatening, although most people recover with no further problems. The disease has been linked to having a prior gut or respiratory infection.",4,-0.21721932,0.42816824,False

Right: Beata Kowalski, the mother of Maya who committed suicide when the State of Florida and Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital refused to allow Maya to return home to her family. by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Earlier this year we published an article about the Netflix movie, Take Care of Maya, where I said that this film was the “most powerful film ever produced exposing medical kidnapping.” See: There are several trailers on the Internet for this movie, but I made my own. This is on our Bitchute channel: This film has done more to expose child trafficking in the U.S. through medical kidnapping than any other documentary I have seen since I started covering this topic over a decade ago. It has brought the issue of medical kidnapping and the horrible power granted to a special group of doctors known as “Child Abuse Pediatricians” to the public for everyone to see, showing how easily this class of medical doctors can override the opinions of other medical doctors, parents, and other experts and terminate parental rights, while keeping children in custody in hospitals as prisoners. Maya’s mother committed suicide after she gave up hope that her daughter could ever come back home, and now Maya’s father and brother have joined together with Maya in a civil lawsuit against Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital that is being live-streamed every day, with many reporters and commentators following this case. As of my writing today, the attorneys for Maya’s family, the plaintiffs, are still presenting their case, before the trial switches over to the defense. The trial is expected to last until early November, and every major corporate media outlet is covering this story. One of the many families in Florida who have reported having one of their children medically kidnapped by Dr. Sally Smith. Full story. The doctor who was responsible for medically kidnapping Maya is Dr. Sally Smith. Dr. Sally Smith has a long and troubled history of medically kidnapping and trafficking children, based on the testimony of many families in Florida. Here is an investigative report published by USA Today back in 2019: With this trial in Florida now being live-streamed every day, the public now has, for perhaps the first time in the history of this country, the opportunity to hear from one of these “Child Abuse Pediatricians” testify under oath about how she goes about finding “medical abuse” and removing children from the custody of their parents. These kinds of cases are very common here in the U.S., and seldom does a week go by where someone does not email me a new story about this kind of medical kidnapping. Dr. Sally Smith was deposed several times over the course of a couple of years in preparation for this trial that is now playing out in Florida. Part of those depositions that were recorded have been played by the plaintiffs’ attorneys to the jury this week. I have found one video that was recorded yesterday by Attorney Melanie Little, who copied Dr. Sally Smith’s deposition and then live-streamed it yesterday, along with her legal analysis. I was not familiar with Attorney Little before seeing this video. This is what she writes about herself on her YouTube channel: I’m Melanie Little, and I’m a Recovering Lawyer. With over 30 years experience as a trial attorney and litigator in New York state and federal courts, I am now a legal analyst and commentator putting a fresh spin on the cases and topics of the day. I am also the mother of 5 incredible kids, and while that is the hardest job I will ever have, it is by far the most rewarding. Little covers not only the deposition of Dr. Sally Smith, but also the deposition of the social worker in this case, and her live-stream yesterday ended up being 4.5 hours long. I only watched the first hour and 45 minutes covering the Dr. Sally Smith deposition that was shown to the jury, and I have extracted that portion out and uploaded it to our Bitchute channel, and will also upload it to our Telegram channel. I watched this at 1.75 speed playback, and any video on Bitchute can also be viewed at faster playback speeds if you cannot invest the full 1.45 hours to watch it. View on Bitchute. Download on Telegram. This information, directly from the mouth of Dr. Sally Smith under oath, explaining how her sole purpose in her role as a Child Abuse Pediatrician is to spy on children to try and find how their parents might have medically abused them, is truly historical. As we have repeatedly published over the past decade, these Child Abuse Pediatricians can only maintain their jobs and professions by finding children who were “medically abused”, and since their pediatric sub-specialty is “child medical abuse,” they really are not experts on ANY single medical issue. See: Dr. Sally Smith Unlike the fictional film Sound of Freedom which was funded by billionaire Mormons who got it on to the Big Screen, Take Care of Maya, which was released about the same time, did not make it onto the Big Screen, but there must have been some strings pulled to convince Netflix to air it, where it has reportedly been watched by millions of people, and getting this story out to the public. This is the film that truly exposes child trafficking, and names names. (There are some bootleg copies on some of the alternative video channels if you do not have a subscription to Netflix.) Why Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital has allowed this to go to trial and having this exposed to the public, rather than settling the case quietly, is not clear to me. Have they bought out any of the jury members, or perhaps the judge whom they know will dismiss the trial before the jury even deliberates? I have no idea. But one thing is for certain, and that is the fact that no matter which way this trial goes, it will do nothing to stop medical kidnapping and the trafficking of children in the U.S. Just like the COVID Scam, which pitted some medical doctors who trusted older medicines to effectively treat COVID, against doctors who supported the emergency use of unproven new drugs and vaccines, so too this case is just a trial over which doctors were more trustworthy in diagnosing and treating Maya’s symptoms. What is NOT on trial, and should be, is the corrupt and evil medical system itself! How can we as a society tolerate such evil and abuse at the hands of “medical doctors”?? How can a single doctor, who is licensed for the sole purpose of finding “medical abuse” of parents against their children, which most of the time just means trying to get a “second opinion” and have some choice about the medical care of their children, be given so much power? How can a single doctor make a single diagnosis, that really is NOT even a “medical” diagnosis but a criminal one, and then be prosecutor, judge, and jury all at once, be given authority to destroy families and traffick children through the medical system? Remember, in almost ALL of these cases neither the parents nor the child want to be separated. None of them asked to be investigated. ALL of this is done by the medical system itself, with the help of publicly funded social workers and family court judges, who, like most of the public, give more preference to “medical doctors”, treating them just a bit lower than a “god.” At the very least, the pediatric sub-specialty of “Child Abuse Pediatrician” needs to be invalidated and declared illegal, IMMEDIATELY! But that is NOT what this trial is about, sadly. If you have children and are either using the medical system or planning on using it, you need to download our free book on this very evil medical profession and be informed. Hospitals today, especially Children’s Hospitals, are one of the most dangerous places to bring your children. Related:",9,-0.3306885,-0.2217119,False
https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20231017/cm/government-reduces-paxlovid-stockpile-returns-millions-of-doses,"Government Reduces Paxlovid Stockpile, Returns Millions of Doses",1,"Oct. 17, 2023 – The U.S. government has returned millions of doses of the COVID-19 antiviral medicine Paxlovid to its manufacturer. The move is widely expected to raise the price of the treatment, but the government and Pfizer agreed on measures to reduce out-of-pocket costs through the year 2028. The government’s price per course of the treatment was $530, and one analyst told CNN that the price could rise to as much as $2,500 on the private market. The result may be a copay for people who have private insurance. The return is worth $4.2 billion, Pfizer said, although the deal won’t involve any cash changing hands because the drugmaker will instead provide Paxlovid at no cost to people with Medicaid, Medicare, or to those who don’t have insurance through 2024. Pfizer will also offer a copay assistance program through 2028, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced. The new plan, which will go into effect in November, also provides a government stockpile of enough Paxlovid to treat 1 million people “to ensure preparedness for future COVID-19 surges,” the HHS statement explained. Paxlovid is an antiviral treatment that works by blocking the virus that causes COVID from replicating and infecting healthy cells. A large trial of unvaccinated adults who took Paxlovid within 5 days after the start of symptoms showed the treatment significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization or death from COVID, according to a federal summary. The treatment is currently recommended for people with COVID who are at a high risk of having a severe case of the illness, such as people who are age 50 or older; are unvaccinated or not up to date on boosters; or have certain medical conditions like asthma or cancer, or some lifestyle behaviors like smoking. A new CDC analysis presented at the IDWeek conference in Boston last week showed that high-risk adults who were 50 or older were less likely to get long COVID if they took Paxlovid, compared to older people at high risk who didn’t take the medicine. The study compared the risk of post-COVID conditions between people ages 12 and older who did and did not take Paxlovid. All of the people were at high risk for severe cases of COVID and were treated between April and August 2022. While Paxlovid appeared to offer long-term protection for older people, children ages 12 to 17 years old who took Paxlovid had a slightly increased risk of post-COVID conditions, including high blood pressure, asthma, and type 2 diabetes, Medpage Today reported. Paxlovid is approved for pediatric use for those age 12 and older at high risk for severe illness from COVID. The study showed that people ages 18 to 49 years old had a mostly neutral risk of post-COVID conditions after taking Paxlovid. “Among younger adults and adolescents, associations were observed for only certain conditions. This may be due to a difference in baseline health in these age groups,” the study authors wrote, noting that further research is needed to examine the differences.",6,-0.32418153,0.20962505,False

Big Food wanted in on the booming organic grocery business, and they have successfully watered down U.S. organic standards over the past decade or so. Instead, we started testing all of the products we wanted to purchase for the presence of glyphosate, and if we carried a product that had a GMO equivalent in the marketplace, we also tested for the presence of GMO DNA. It started a very long process for us to find grains that were not contaminated, and in most cases, we had to look outside the U.S. to find such grains that tested clean. Corn was, by far, the hardest product to source that tested clean of GMO DNA, and we even purchased certified organic corn products off the shelves of stores like Whole Foods, that were also GMO “verified,” and all the samples we tested came back positive for genetically modified DNA. We were unable to find a single supplier of organic corn in the U.S. who had corn that tested clean. We finally found a supplier down in Central Mexico, in a Province that at that time had banned the planting of U.S. GMO corn, that finally tested clean of GMO DNA, and we have been selling corn from that region ever since, for almost 10 years now. Now, Mexico has decided to ban U.S. GMO corn nationwide, as well as ban the use of glyphosate, and the U.S. and Canada are trying to bully Mexico into continuing to import GMO corn. Aljazeera recently published an excellent analysis of this “corn war” between the U.S. and Mexico. Mexico has barred the import of GMO corn for human consumption, raising the ire of exporter US where most corn is GMO. by Natalie Alcoba Aljazeera.com Excerpts: Corn is sacred in Mexico. Its roots can be traced to Aztec and Mayan creation stories that exalted the arrival of a crop that was key to their survival. In modern times, maiz, as it is known in Spanish, maintains its cultural, spiritual and political prominence as a staple in Mexican cuisine – and, increasingly, a brewing trade dispute. Mexico has drawn a line in the sand with the United States when it comes to genetically modified corn, barring its use and import for human consumption, and gradually phasing it out for livestock feed or industrial uses. After months of negotiations, US officials announced last month that they were pulling a lever under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), seeking an intermediary to resolve the dispute. For Mexico, the issue is multi-pronged, but rooted in ensuring the affordability and availability of a crucial crop, experts say. For the US, it is about business. Corn is its biggest crop and the vast majority of it is genetically engineered. Far from a regional issue, it is a feud that could have wide-reaching implications for importing and exporting nations, as evidenced also by Canada, which has added its voice to the proceedings and backed the United States in saying that Mexico’s position on biotech is “not scientifically supported” and could “unnecessarily disrupt trade in the North American market”. Mexico’s stand to protect small-scale farmers is one that others are watching closely. “I would say Mexico is at the forefront of the world,” said Ernesto Hernández López, a professor at Chapman University in California, who specialises in international law and food law. It is illegal to grow genetically modified corn on Mexican soil. In 2020, Mexico expanded the prohibition with a decree banning all GMO corn, including imports, as of January 31, 2024, on the grounds that doing so protected its food security, its rural communities, its food heritage and the health of its people. It also announced that it would impose strict limits on the import, distribution and use of the contentious herbicide glyphosate – widely used in GMO farming – culminating in its complete ban by that date. Glyphosate is a well-known weed killer whose potential to cause cancer is the subject of heated debate. “Mexico is the centre of origin of more than 55 strains of maize. The food security policy of the Government of Mexico consists of preserving this biocultural heritage,” the government said in a statement, in addition to preserving the sustainable farming practices of peasant communities. “This has to do with consolidating sovereignty and food security in a central part of Mexican culture.” The move rankled the US, which considered it an affront to the free trade rules of the region. After multiple meetings and consultations with Mexican officials, the US announced in August it would seek to establish a dispute settlement panel under the USMCA, arguing that the Mexican decree “undermines the market access” Mexico had agreed to provide.

https://dailyhealthpost.com/6-ways-to-detox-fluoride-from-the-body/,6 Natural Ways to Detox Fluoride From The Body,0,"Okay, let’s not get into the politics—just the science. Sodium fluoride has been added to the public water supply in most jurisdictions in the US since 1961. Over 60 percent of Americans consume it. Sodium fluoride was used as a rat poison for decades. (Aug 23 2021) In more recent times, there have been studies that show the negative health implications of having fluoride in the water far outweighing any positives of decreasing tooth decay. The results of the current studies are frightening: one 2012 study by the National Institutes of Health showed a marked decrease in children’s IQ scores after fluoride exposure: “Although fluoride may cause neurotoxicity in animal models and acute fluoride poisoning causes neurotoxicity in adults, very little is known of its effects on children’s neurodevelopment. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to investigate the effects of increased fluoride exposure and delayed neurobehavioral development…children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas…The results support the possibility of an adverse effect of high fluoride exposure on children’s neurodevelopment [1].” Research published by the Indian Journal of Pediatrics found thousands of cases of severe skeletal fluorisis in children due to the cumulative effects of fluoridated water [2]. Another report by Scientific American “concluded that fluoride can subtly alter endocrine function, especially in the thyroid—the gland that produces hormones regulating growth and metabolism”. As for its efficacy in preventing tooth decay, there is no conclusive evidence that this is a valid outcome; one study published in 2000 showed a decrease in the incidence of dental cavities in children after fluoridation of the water was stopped [3]. Just to be on the safe side, it’s wise to take measures to purge this chemical from your body. Here’s how.",8,0.057841487,0.10357277,False
https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20231013/cm/more-than-7-million-americans-have-gotten-the-new-covid-vaccine,More Than 7 Million Americans Have Gotten the New COVID Vaccine,1,"Oct. 13, 2023 – About 7 million people in the U.S. have gotten the new COVID-19 vaccine as the nation heads into what health officials now consider cold, flu, and COVID season. The new tally is about 3 million shots higher than the count reported a week ago. But uptake is lagging behind last season by about 600,000 doses. CDC Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, cited the 7 million shots when she got her own COVID booster on Thursday in California at a mobile clinic set up in a senior citizen community, The (San Jose, CA) Mercury News reported. The count of 7 million vaccines given since Sept. 12 was also reported by CNN and Reuters, citing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In its weekly update of virus metrics on its COVID Data Tracker website, the CDC doesn't usually report the number of COVID vaccines given. For the week ending Sept. 30, about 11% of all COVID tests reported to the CDC were positive, and the virus accounted for 1.6% of all emergency department visits. “October is the right time to get vaccinated,” Cohen told the Los Angeles Times. “As we get into late fall and winter … what we expect is to see more COVID circulation in November, December and January.” This is the first time during the pandemic that the nation’s strategy has been to offer an annual fall COVID vaccine, similar to an annual flu shot. It’s also the first time that the rollout of updated vaccines has relied on the private sector, now that the federal public health emergency has ended. The rollout was marked by insurance problems and supply issues. The shots should be given at no out-of-pocket cost through either insurance coverage or federal programs. A summary about COVID vaccines published this week by the CDC said that last year, COVID vaccines prevented 18.5 million hospitalizations and also prevented 3.2 million deaths. “Currently, older adults (aged at least 65 years) and infants aged younger than 6 months are at highest risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization,” the report stated. “During January 1-August 26, 2023, COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates among adults aged at least 75 years were two to three times as high as those among the next youngest age group (adults aged 65–74 years). Rates among infants aged younger than 6 months are similar to those among adults aged 65-74 years.” The CDC recommends all people ages 6 months and older get the new COVID vaccine, which was made to better protect against current variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.",4,-0.47862914,0.35296088,False
https://www.webmd.com/lung-cancer/news/20231013/cm/trend-rolls-on-women-at-higher-lung-cancer-risk,Trend Rolls On: Women at Higher Lung Cancer Risk,1,"Oct. 13, 2023 – Researchers are calling for intensified smoking cessation efforts and lung screenings among young and middle-aged women after a new analysis showed they are increasingly more likely than men to be diagnosed with lung cancer. The trend has been under way in recent years. A new report from American Cancer Society researchers shows that in addition to women ages 30 to 50 years old being more likely than men to develop lung cancer, now women ages 50 to 54 years old are also being diagnosed at higher rates compared to men of the same age. The findings were published Thursday in JAMA Oncology. Overall, the rate of lung cancer among both genders has continued its general downward trend during the past two decades, but the decline has been steeper among men than among women, the analysis showed. The study included health data for about half the U.S. population from 2000 to 2019. The researchers are perplexed at the differing rates of decline between genders, because women are not as likely to smoke as men. According to the CDC, 13% of men in the U.S. smoked in 2021, and 10% of women smoked. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. There were about 238,000 new cases of lung cancer in the U.S. in 2023, and 127,000 deaths, according to National Cancer Institute data. About 75% of people diagnosed with lung cancer do not live at least five years past the year of diagnosis. “These findings are very concerning,” said lead author Ahmedin Jemal, DVM, PhD, senior vice president of surveillance and health equity science at the American Cancer Society, in a statement. “We don’t know why lung cancer incidence rates among younger and middle-aged individuals are now higher in women than men, reversing the historical pattern. Cigarette smoking prevalence, the major risk factor for lung cancer in the United States, is not higher in younger women than younger men, as are other established risk factors such as occupational exposures.” People age 50 to 80 years old who smoked the equivalent of a pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years (or, two packs daily for 10 years) should be screened for lung cancer annually if they still smoke or if they quit within the past 15 years, according to federal guidelines.",7,-0.060083505,0.17640524,False
https://dailyhealthpost.com/magnesium-deficiency-symptoms/,Top 15 Magnesium Deficiency Symptoms (Boost Magnesium),0,"Do you get muscle cramps, restless legs, or toss and turn in your bed at night? Do you have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep? If you answered Yes, this could be because your body is deficient in magnesium. Magnesium is a mineral your body desperately needs, yet rarely gets nearly enough. It is estimated that up to 80% of the U.S. population is deficient in magnesium. And since magnesium is critical for the electrical stability of every cell in the body, a lack of it disrupts bodily processes, and can cause you to struggle with issues like sleep, energy, metabolism, stress, and pain. If magnesium deficiency continues, your risk for heart disease, stroke, osteo-porosis, diabetes, depression, arthritis, and asthma increases. In today’s video, we’re going to talk about the top 15 signs your body needs more magnesium, so you can take immediate steps to remedy it. Which are magnesium-rich foods can you add to your diet? What are some guidelines for magnesium supplementation? And what causes magnesium deficiency? We’ll talk about these and more in this video. What are the foods high in magnesium you can add to your diet? What are some guidelines for magnesium supplementation? And what causes magnesium deficiency? We’ll talk about these and more in this video. Make sure you watch till the end, cause there may be a few things you did not know! As always, this video is educational and does not constitute medical advice, we are not doctors. First, why is this mineral and electrolyte important? Magnesium is a co-factor in more than 300 enzymatic reactions in the body, including DNA and protein synthesis, cellular energy production, nerve signal transmission, bone metabolism, cardiac function, conduction of signals between muscles and nerves, blood pressure, glucose and insulin metabolism, and immune response. So, how much magnesium should be consumed? The recommended dietary allowance is 400 milligrams for adults per day. The medical name for magnesium deficiency is hypomagnesemia. This is defined as having lower than 1.8 milligrams per decilitre of serum magnesium. Next, how can you tell if your body is deficient in magnesium? Signs of magnesium deficiency can manifest in these ways. Number 15. Increased Blood Pressure. Studies indicate that magnesium deficiency may cause or contribute to high blood pressure. Number 14. Troubled Sleep or Insomnia. Magnesium regulates the neurotransmitter GABA, and the hormone melatonin, to calm down nerve activity and guide the sleep-wake cycle. A lack in this mineral can cause interrupted sleep and insomnia. Number 13. Stress and Anxiety. Low levels of this mineral in the brain can result in neuronal excitations, and thereby cause or increase anxiety. As stress continues, magnesium leaves the body more quickly in urine, which induces even more stress and anxiety. Number 12. Increased Glucose Intolerance. Magnesium helps in blood sugar metabolism, and a deficiency causes higher than normal blood glucose levels. This is important for individuals with type 2 diabetes, because low magnesium increases insulin resistance, which in turn decreases magnesium levels, and could end up in a vicious cycle. Number 11. Muscle Spasms. Magnesium helps facilitate nerve connectivity, and a deficiency causes sudden muscle jerks, eye twitches, persistent blinking, and numbness and tingling in limbs, because of distorted nerve connections. Number 10. Irregular Heartbeat. A lack of magnesium can cause palpitations and irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), which increase the risks of blood clots and heart failure. Number 9. Weakness and Constant Tiredness. A lack of magnesium disrupts protein synthesis, muscle and nerve functions, and blood pressure, which are necessary to produce energy. Number 8. Weak or Brittle Bones. Since 60% of the body’s magnesium is stored in bone, a deficiency can negatively impact bone strength and density, leaving them more prone to osteo-porosis, especially for people who are already high-risk, like postmenopausal women. Magnesium is essential for healthy bone structure, along with the other co-factors vitamin D, vitamin K2, calcium and zinc. Number 7. Gastrointestinal Issues. Magnesium deficiency can disrupt the gastrointestinal tract, causing poor digestion, constipation, acid reflux, nausea and vomiting, and a loss of appetite. Number 6. Dry and Dull Skin. A lack in magnesium may make it difficult to manage eczema and poor skin conditions because of fluctuating hormones and decreased fatty acids. Number 5. Migraine Headache. People who are prone to migraines have low levels of serum and tissue magnesium, which could lead to their frequent headaches. Number 4. Hearing Problems. A deficiency in magnesium increases the susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss and ringing in the ears (tinnitus). Number 3. Breathing Difficulties. Magnesium deficiency may cause the buildup of calcium in muscles lining airways, making it difficult to breathe. Number 2. Intense PMS Symptoms. Many women find their premenstrual symptoms are more intense when they lack magnesium. Number 1. Irritability, Confusion, and Depression. Long periods of magnesium deficiency often lead to irritability, confusion, poor memory, and symptoms of depression. Next, what happens to your body when you boost magnesium to optimal levels? Getting enough magnesium through food and supplements has been shown to. help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. ease night time leg cramps and restless legs. relieve joint, muscle, and nerve pain (neuropathy). keep your muscles and joints limber and flexible. lower the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline. increase the happiness hormone serotonin, and reduce symptoms of depression. boost energy and exercise performance. improve digestion and bowel movement. increase insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels. decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure. reduce symptoms of migraines. alleviate symptoms in women with PMS. increase bone mineral density. reduce symptoms of asthma. decrease symptoms of tinnitus. Next, which are the magnesium-rich foods you can add to your diet? Here are 15 good ones. Dark Chocolate with at least 75% cocoa. 2. Avocados or Guacamole. 3. Nuts like cashews, Brazil nuts, and almonds. 4. Legumes like lentils, black beans, chickpeas, and soybeans. 5. Tofu or bean curd. 6. Seeds like pumpkin, flax, and chia seeds. 7. Whole grains like oats and barley, and pseudocereals like buckwheat and quinoa. 8. Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and halibut. 9. Bananas. 10. Leafy greens like spinach, kale, collards, turnips, and mustard greens. 11. Tamarind. 12. Okra. 13. Oysters. 14. Baked Potatoes with the Skin. 15. Raisins. Next, if you plan to supplement with magnesium, here are 7 tips. The standard dose is 200 to 400 milligrams. A magnesium deficiency can be treated by any form of magnesium, except magnesium L-threonate, since it contains less magnesium per dose. Magnesium oxide or magnesium chloride have lower absorption rates, so they are more likely to cause side effects such as diarrhea and bloating. In general, magnesium citrate is a good choice for supplementation, due to its high water solubility and low cost. For cognitive enhancement, magnesium L-threonate can be used. Magnesium should be taken daily, along with food. If you plan to superload magnesium to attenuate a deficiency, consider magnesium diglycinate or magnesium gluconate, as these may have higher bio-availability. To see our recommended magnesium supplement, click the link in the description below. Recommended magnesium supplement Make sure to consult your doctor if you plan to supplement along with your medications. Next, you may be wondering: what causes magnesium deficiency? Industrialized agriculture has long depleted the soil of nutrients, and the fruits, vegetables, and grains grown on them are deficient in minerals. At the same time, the processed foods we do eat further deplete magnesium. While we absorb less magnesium as we age, certain medical conditions, like diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and medications, like diuretics and proton-pump inhibitors, contribute to poor absorption. Other factors that cause magnesium to leave the body include: Excessive sweating, high alcohol consumption, diabetes, chronic diarrhea, Crohn’s disease, and kidney issues. Lastly, how do you test for magnesium deficiency? A blood test. However, do know that less than 1% of magnesium travels through our bloodstream as it’s stored in bones and tissues. To test at the cellular level, a hair mineral analysis is required. If you enjoyed this video, Like, Share, and Subscribe, and Click on the bell icon, so you never miss a video! And now over to you!

Source. by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Are you prepared for the post-technological age? It has been a while since I have published an article on the coming Big Tech crash that began in 2022. There has been a bit of a reprieve to this coming crash here in 2023, with the $trillions of dollars being invested into the AI hype, but all that is doing is creating a huge economic bubble that is going to make the Big Tech crash even worse when this economic bubble bursts. I have not had to write much about this lately because so many others have. Here are some sample recent articles from the financial sector where many investors clearly see the writing on the wall and are beginning to warn others about the AI hype bubble. I began warning about the coming Big Tech crash in 2022, not only because of the financial implications that quickly surfaced after the collapse of the FTX Crypto Ponzi scheme, but because for almost the first time since the PC Computer technology revolution that started in the 1980s, people were finally starting to wake up and see the limitations of this technology, much of which began in the 1980s with the development of hardware and software consumer electronics. These limitations were first observed in the automotive industry, where the illusions of completely self-autonomous self-driving vehicles that has swallowed hundreds of $billions for decades, came crashing down to the realities of truth, the truth that computers will never fully replace humans. See: The huge failures of fully electric vehicles (EVs) has also surfaced this year, and that industry alone threatens to crash the entire U.S. economy as the U.S. Government continues to spend $billions on this sector, which is clearly NOT sustainable. Here are some recent articles that clearly spell doom for the EV industry: As I have written in previous articles, when I write about a “crash” of the technology, and the “post-technological age,” I am NOT stating that all the technology will go away or fail. What is inevitable is that we will recognize the limitations of this technology, including the ways it enslaves us, and we will be forced to use our God-given creativity and ingenuity to make smart uses of the technology, without depending upon it as much as we do now. But there are very few people today who are even thinking about that day, let alone preparing for it, and they will be the ones who suffer the most. So to prepare for the future post-technological age, we need to acknowledge the difference between knowledge and wisdom. Since the complete overhaul of the western educational system which is now built upon the false foundation of Darwinian evolutionary biology, we have exalted the physical sciences over other traditional forms of education that include the humanities and the arts. The English word “science” has been thoroughly corrupted and is today used as a replacement for “truth.” Knowledge and “dataism” have replaced wisdom, and “science” has replaced “religion.” Science IS the new “religion,” because it is mostly based on belief, and not facts or truth. It starts as its basis in the belief that life has formed by random chance over billions of years without any influence of a master designer, or “God”. This is a belief, not a fact, and it certainly should not be called “science,” but “religion.” “Science” today completely ignores wisdom, pretending that knowledge is the totality of truth. This is certainly not a new way of thinking about the universe we live in, but it has taken on new shades of meaning today because of electronic technology that has developed over the past 40 years or so. But remember, “technology” as it is defined today, is almost exclusively “electronic technology”, a very recent development in human history. Electricity is the lifeblood of this technology, and it ALL STOPS WORKING when you cut its power source. How many people in modern society know how to survive in this world for extended periods of time with no electricity, as humans did for many thousands of years prior to the development of this electronic technology? Very few. Having not only our society but our very lives be dependent upon this electronic technology is not only NOT wise, it is pure insanity. All the knowledge and data in the world will be of no use once the electricity stops, and you have to find water and food without it. This is the result of a highly technical society with very little wisdom. To describe the difference between wisdom and knowledge, I like to use the illustration of the modern automobile. There isn’t a single person reading this article today that learned how to drive an automobile by using the “scientific method” to obtain “knowledge.” You could read as many books as you want on auto mechanics, internal combustion engines, or electronic engines and lithium batteries, but they will never teach you how to actually drive an automobile. You could develop some hypotheses and theories about how to go about driving one, and then use trial and error to see if they work to test your hypotheses and theories. But that would not be wise. You would probably crash the vehicle you are attempting to drive, and you might even kill yourself and other drivers. Instead, to learn how to drive a motor vehicle, one looks for someone who already knows how to drive one, someone with more wisdom and experience than themselves, and then asks that person to teach them. The general principle here would be that the more experience one has in successfully driving a motor vehicle, the better able they are to pass on that experience to someone else. How much they “know” about vehicles such as words printed in a book, is pretty much irrelevant in actually using a motor vehicle unless they have actual experience in driving one. A computer, which just reads text (algorithms), cannot teach experience. It is our life experiences that lead to wisdom, or how to apply knowledge. You could read a book about how to start a fire using a flint stone instead of a Bic lighter, for example, but until you attempt to do it and learn how to build a fire that way by experience, you will not truly “know” how to build a fire from a flint stone. And in most cases, you will learn how to accomplish a skill like that by asking someone else who is “wiser” than you to teach you how to do it. You shall stand up before the gray head and honor the face of an old man, and you shall fear your God: I am the LORD. (Leviticus 19:32) Modern society which is built upon the false foundation of Darwinian biology falsely believes that we are the most advanced human race that ever walked the earth, mainly due to our electronic technology. But the records of the Ancient Scriptures record human lifespans reaching above 900 years old, prior to the worldwide flood that dramatically changed the world and human lifespans that began to decrease. We have no idea what kind of wisdom and “technology” existed in ancient times with such long lifespans, where wisdom could be passed down to generations in the double digits. What was travel like back then? What was communication like back then? What did music and art look like back then? We sometimes get glimpses of this technology that possibly remained through some generations after the Flood, with stories like the fall of the city of Jericho, where the entire city was destroyed by a specific pattern of blowing trumpets, using musical notes and energy to bring down walls. (See Joshua Chapter 6) Many ancient artifacts, such as the Great Pyramids in Egypt, show a technology that is unknown to modern man, and which modern man, with all of his electronic technology, cannot reproduce. Wisdom, which is practical knowledge gained mainly through experience, is primarily obtained by seeking out instruction from those older and wiser than ourselves. But look at the way western culture treats our elders and seniors! We pump them up with vaccines and drugs, and then toss them aside as worthless members of society as we exalt youth and external beauty. Aurora Borealis, “Northern Lights” Very little of what we learn throughout our short life here on earth is learned directly through the “scientific method.” Most everything we learn in life is taught to us by others, usually by others older and more experienced (wiser) than ourselves. So who is the oldest and wisest person in the universe? The one who created it. The book of Job in the Old Testament portion of the Bible is one of the most ancient pieces of literature available to us today. This book is very very deep, and someday I might feel qualified to actually write an article about it. The character of Job apparently lived among the first generations after the great flood of Noah, and he was probably well over 100 years old when it was written, and the text states that he lived another 140 years after it was written. It deals with the eternal question as to why many evil people prosper, while many righteous people suffer. After recording some dialog that happened in heaven, the rest of the book is a debate between Job and his accusers, former “friends.” Job maintains his innocence over his accusers, and demands to question his Judge. God then speaks in chapter 38, and this is one of the longest recorded dialogues by God in the Bible. It starts like this: Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said: “Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me. Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding. Who determined its measurements—surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it? On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy? Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb, when I made clouds its garment and thick darkness its swaddling band, and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors, and said, ‘Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stayed’? Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place, that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?” (Job 38) Indeed, who is wiser than the Creator of the universe? When Jesus walked the earth, he claimed to have come from God, and to be one with him. His death and resurrection removed all the barriers between us and God, so that we could know him directly. “Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. And you know the way to where I am going.” Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?” Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.” Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.” Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works. Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else believe on account of the works themselves. Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father. Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it. (John 14:1-14) When the first believers in Jesus began to meet together after his resurrection during the First Century, Paul wrote a letter to some of them who lived in the Greek city of Corinth. He explained who had wisdom, and who did not. For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.” Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, so that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.” (1 Corinthians 1:18-31 – emphasis mine.) This then, is the wisdom that is available to all of us today! We can have direct access to the oldest and wisest person in the universe, if we ask in faith. If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. (James 1:5-8) Faith in technology is insanity. Technology is neither good nor evil in and of itself, but trusting our lives to it will not only disappoint us, it will betray us. Seek true wisdom from the oldest and wisest person in the universe, to understand your own purpose in this life, and what you are supposed to do next. Read the Ancient Scriptures, the Bible, and pray for wisdom, as James wrote. See: But it does take time to read and study the Bible, so do not limit yourself to just studying the Scriptures. God can speak to you directly, through dreams and visions, and even by spending time in nature, surrounded by God-made things, rather than the virtual technology man-made world that so many of us spend most of our day in. I have learned to take more time out to spend outdoors, surrounded by God’s creation. I have some very tall, ancient trees on the property where I am currently staying. Instead of just walking through them each day, I have learned to stop, and examine them, and to just be still in their presence. By doing this I discovered that the path I was walking ran over a huge root system that connected several of these very tall trees that are many hundreds of years old, standing tall probably long before this country was even founded, when only the Native Americans lived here. There is energy there, a kind of energy you can feel from living things that are far older than yourself. It is an ancient energy that far precedes any of our modern technology. What will happen if I decide to spend more time among these ancient trees each day? I don’t know, because that kind of wisdom is mostly lost to this generation I am part of. The Bible has much to say about trees, specific trees in specific locations at different points of history. Maybe this kind of energy among trees that are so ancient can counter the negative energy that flows out of technology, like EMF radiation? I really do not know, as this kind of wisdom is mostly lost to us today. The Japanese do have some knowledge in this area, called “Shinrin-yoku”, or “forest bathing.” GreenMedInfo has a section on some of this research. The Bible is also full of examples where God spoke directly to people through dreams and visions, and most of Corporate Christianity rejects anything like this today, claiming that things like “miracles” only happened in the past. If you bring up any kind of ancient wisdom or ancient forms of healing in Christian Churches today, most will dismiss it as “New Age” and demonic, while they all run to their doctors to get their latest vaccines and drugs. But it is the pharmaceutical medical cult that is “new,” having only existed since the late 1800s. Other practices of healing are much older, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) which is over 5000 years old, and Ayurveda healing in India which is over 4000 years old. There is nothing “new” about them, but even these ancient forms of healing are being snuffed out today in favor of pharmaceutical companies and modern medical systems. So turn off your TV and get off of the computer for a while each day, and go talk to God, and ask him for wisdom, REAL wisdom. Without this kind of wisdom, you have very little chance of surviving what is about to fall upon this planet, or to be able to live independently in the coming post-technological age.",2,-0.24613604,-0.07196228,False

In some cases, offers to pharmacies come from fraudsters impersonating wholesalers and offering deep discounts on Ozempic pens. One counterfeit Ozempic pen was being offered for sale at a U.S. pharmacy earlier this year, CBS News reported. A group representing distributors of U.S. health care products emailed a warning to its members about a wide variety of schemes being investigated by the FDA that are related to Ozempic and knockoff versions of the drug. “The sellers offer sufficient information and documentation to give the appearance the transaction is legitimate,” the alert stated, according to CBS News. “The transaction requires full or partial payment upfront via wire transfer, non-disclosure agreements, establishment of purchase accounts, and on occasions, have involved fraudulent transaction statements.” The fraudulent offers are fueled by high demand for weight loss drugs along with shortages of Ozempic and a similar medication called Wegovy. Both result in significant weight loss using the active ingredient semaglutide, but the two are approved for different uses. Ozempic is approved to treat Type 2 diabetes, while Wegovy is approved to treat being overweight or obese. Earlier this year, the maker of both Ozempic and Wegovy advised people who are prescribed the drugs to “be vigilant in checking their medicine” to make sure it’s authentic. Novo Nordisk, a drug manufacturer, released pictures of counterfeit pens and packages displayed side-by-side with the real ones. Some signs that a pen or package may be counterfeit include: Earlier this year, the FDA warned that knockoffs that contain compounded semaglutide, or in some cases a salt version of semaglutide, may not be safe. Illegal counterfeits have been found worldwide, from Nigeria to Australia, CBS News reported.

Heart disease and cancer have been at the top of the list for more than a decade and caused more than 37% of U.S. deaths in 2021, the most recent data available. COVID-19 has climbed into the top rankings since the pandemic began in 2020. The CDC on Thursday listed the top 10 causes of death based on information from 2021, the most recent year with full data. There were 3,464,231 deaths in the United States that year, a 2.4% increase over 2020, according to an analysis of CDC data from USAFacts. The age-adjusted death rates for cancer and heart disease have dropped over the last 2 decades, USAFacts said, whereas the death rates for Alzheimer’s disease and unintentional injury have nearly doubled between 1999 and 2021. The top 10 causes of death accounted for almost 75% of all deaths in the U.S. in 2021. The average life expectancy is 76.4 years. Men born in the U.S. in 2021 are expected to live an average of 73.5 years, women 79.3 years. Men have higher death rates for cancer and heart disease, while women have higher death rates for Alzheimer’s.

The federal government “has been working directly with manufacturers and distributors to ensure that the vaccines are getting to pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, and other vaccination sites, including long-term care facilities as quickly as possible,"" a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson told the news agency Reuters in an email. The 4 million shots given through Sept. 30 is twice the number reported by Health and Human Services last month. The updated vaccines were approved by the CDC on Sept. 12 but weren’t available in many places until about a week later. The rollout has been hampered by distribution problems and erroneous rejections of insurance coverage, the latter of which has mostly been resolved. During a similar time period last year, about 4.4 million people got updated COVID vaccines. For all of 2022, nearly 56.5 million people got an updated COVID vaccine, which equals about 17% of the U.S. population, CDC data shows. Based on a U.S. population of 335 million, about 1.2% of people have gotten the updated COVID shot so far this year. Public health officials have been hopeful for a strong public reception to calls for a seasonal COVID vaccine similar to the long-standing recommendation that people get a flu shot in the fall. Like the flu shot approach, the vaccine is updated annually to target strains of the virus predicted to be widely circulating through the fall and winter. So far this year, about 10% of adults surveyed by the CDC said they have already gotten this year’s flu shot as of Sept. 16. After a summertime surge, COVID is receding across the U.S., although it is still circulating more widely than the flu. COVID-19 currently accounts for just below 2% of emergency department visits, 19,000 weekly hospital admissions, and nearly 3% of all U.S. deaths, according to the CDC’s COVID Data Tracker. Fall typically signals the start of respiratory illness season, and the current rate of positive COVID tests reported to the CDC is 11.6%, while the rate of positive flu tests is 1%.

That rate is similar to vaccine uptake at a similar point during the fall COVID vaccine campaign last year. There have been widespread distribution challenges, causing appointment delays and thousands of erroneous rejections of insurance coverage since the CDC recommended the shots starting Sept. 12. Around 1 million people got a Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 shot, and nearly 800,000 people got Moderna’s version of the vaccine during the week ending Sept. 22, Reuters reported, citing data from the health care data and analytics firm IQVIA Holdings Inc. Federal officials said late last week that 2 million people in the U.S. had already gotten the shots, although it wasn’t clear what the cutoff date was for that count. Public health officials said at the time that 6 million shots had been shipped to pharmacies. Last season, about 56.5 million people, or 17% of the U.S. population, got a booster shot, CDC data shows. Vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna have said demand may be lower. Pfizer warned it may cut jobs, depending on how widely people choose to get the updated vaccine, and Moderna estimated demand may be around 50 million doses, Reuters reported.

The study from the CDC found that vaccines were 54% effective at protecting infants from COVID-19 hospitalization in the first 3 months of life, and 35% effective at protecting babies from ages 3 months through 5 months old. Infants can be vaccinated against COVID-19 starting at 6 months old. Infants who were hospitalized with COVID-19 whose mothers were unvaccinated were more likely to need help breathing, compared to infants whose mothers had been vaccinated. For the study, researchers analyzed data for 716 babies hospitalized between March 2022 and May 2023. Among the babies in the study, 377 were hospitalized with COVID-19. Mothers were considered vaccinated if they’d had at least two COVID vaccines, one of which was given during pregnancy. All other mothers of babies in the study were unvaccinated. Vaccinated mothers pass antibodies against COVID-19 through the placenta to the fetus. The authors noted that a limitation of the study was that prior infection of mothers was not analyzed, including among unvaccinated mothers. They also said it is possible that “infection-induced antibodies could provide some protection against infant COVID-19–related hospitalization.” “Maternal vaccination during pregnancy provides some protection against COVID-19–related hospitalizations among infants, particularly those aged less than 3 months,” the authors wrote. “Expectant mothers should remain current with COVID-19 vaccination to protect themselves and their infants from hospitalization and severe outcomes associated with COVID-19.” Previous research has shown that having COVID-19 during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth, and that pregnant people are at an increased risk of experiencing a severe case of the illness. COVID vaccination rates among pregnant women range from 16% to 27%, according to the CDC. That’s in comparison to survey data published this week by the agency that showed 47% of pregnant women reported getting a flu shot during the past flu season. Among women who had a live birth, 54% reported getting the Tdap vaccine, which can protect babies from pertussis (sometimes called “whooping cough”). The professional group for obstetricians and gynecologists “strongly recommends” that all pregnant women get vaccinated for COVID-19 and get the latest booster shot, adding that the vaccines are safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that antibodies from the vaccine are passed from mother to baby through the placenta during pregnancy and may be passed to the baby through breast milk, as well. Researchers wrote that they were not able to analyze the timing of COVID vaccination during pregnancy, specific brands or formulations of vaccines, nor whether vaccine effectiveness varied against different subvariants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They also noted that the results could have been influenced by “maternal characteristics or protective behaviors,” and that the impact of breastfeeding, which may transfer antibodies to a baby, also could not be assessed due to incomplete data for some mothers.",4,-0.4117558,0.32064217,False

Nationwide, no state had a prevalence of obesity below 20%, meaning at least 1 in 5 people in every state has obesity. The agency called for a stronger focus on increasing people’s access to health care, to healthy and affordable food, and to safe places for physical activity. The new numbers “send a clear message that additional support for obesity prevention and treatment is an urgent priority,” said Karen Hacker, MD, MPH, director of the CDC’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, in a statement. “Obesity is a disease caused by many factors, including eating patterns, physical activity levels, sleep routines, genetics, and certain medications. This means that there is no one size fits all approach.” The 22 states where 35% or more of adults had obesity in 2022 are: Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Called Neffy, the nasal spray made by ARS Pharmaceuticals would be the first needle-free option for emergency allergic reactions and serve as an alternative to the widely used EpiPen. ARS Pharmaceuticals announced the FDA decision in a press release on Tuesday, noting that an FDA advisory panel had recommended approval in May. “We are very surprised by this action and the late requirement at this time to change the repeat-dose study from a post-marketing requirement, which we had previously aligned on with FDA, to a pre-approval requirement, particularly given the positive Advisory Committee vote,” said company founder, president, and CEO Richard Lowenthal in a statement. The news agency Reuters reported that the maker of the competitor product EpiPen asked the FDA in June to require ARS Pharmaceuticals to conduct more testing. Epinephrine is used to treat life-threatening allergic reactions that can result from insect bites or stings, foods, medications, and other causes, according to the federal drug database MedlinePlus. Epinephrine works by relaxing airway muscles and tightening blood vessels. Earlier this year, NBC News reported that the cost of EpiPens had risen from $30 per pen in recent years to $600 per pen.

But the particular type of chocolate matters, according to the findings published Dec. 7, 2024, in The BMJ. Scientists evaluated the self-reported dietary and health information of about 112,000 healthy middle-aged people who were followed for more than 30 years. Compared with people who rarely or never ate chocolate, those who had at least five ounces of dark chocolate each week had a 21% lower risk of developing diabetes. There were no significant diabetes risk reductions among people who ate milk chocolate. In fact, that treat was tied to weight gain, which can eventually boost diabetes risk. What's the magic of dark chocolate? Even though it has about the same amount of saturated fat and calories as milk chocolate, dark chocolate is lower in sugar and much richer in flavanols — plant chemicals known to have health benefits, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, plus cardiometabolic perks — changes that help your body pump blood and use food for energy. The authors suspect that the flavanols might offset the effects of dark chocolate's fat and sugar content, although more research is needed to confirm this.

So why do so few people know about it? Until recently, most guidelines didn't recommend testing for Lp(a) — but with good reason. Your genes determine your Lp(a) value. Eating and exercise habits have virtually no effect on the levels in your bloodstream. Plus, there were no effective treatments to lower Lp(a), which also elevates the risk of stroke and aortic stenosis (a thickened, stiff aortic valve). Now, with five promising therapies to lower Lp(a) in development, the landscape is changing. Here's the latest advice and information about Lp(a).

The report also focuses on treatments based on the latest scientific evidence, including the pros and cons of statins and other medications, and provides the lowdown on other substances advertised to lower cholesterol. Managing Your Cholesterol can also help you work with your doctor to individualize your treatment. Read More ""Recent data show that only 0.3% of people received Lp(a) screening between 2012 and 2019,"" says Harvard Medical School associate professor Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Also, about half of those tests were ordered by a very small number of health care providers, she adds. But Lp(a) testing should soon become more widespread, for several reasons. First, the tests are now covered by most insurers in most states. Second, even though targeted therapies to lower Lp(a) are not yet on the market, people with high levels (see ""Lp(a) readings: Check the units"") may benefit from more intensive treatment to manage their overall risk of heart disease, says Dr. O'Donoghue. ""This may include taking cholesterol-lowering drugs like statins, even if your LDL cholesterol is normal,"" she says. Low-dose aspirin is also being investigated as a possible therapy for preventing heart attacks in people with high Lp(a). Lp(a) readings: Check the units Labs report lipoprotein(a) values in two different units. The preferred method is nanomoles per liter (nmol/L), but many labs still use milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Currently, there's no universal consensus on what constitutes an abnormal Lp(a) level, but the thresholds shown below are commonly used. Lp(a) nmol/L mg/dL Normal Below 75 Below 30 High 125 and above 50 and above A one-time test? Unlike LDL, which rises with age and is influenced by diet and exercise, Lp(a) remains largely constant over a person's lifetime, so a one-time test suffices for screening. However, researchers are working to better understand changes that may occur in Lp(a) in women around the time of menopause and for men and women with certain medical conditions. The following groups of people are specifically recommended for testing: people with premature cardiovascular disease, defined as those who've had a heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or aortic stenosis before age 55 (for men) or 65 (for women) people who have a father, mother, sister, or brother with premature cardiovascular disease people with very high LDL cholesterol (190 mg/dL or higher) close relatives (siblings, children, and parents) of anyone with an elevated Lp(a) level. Therapies to lower Lp(a) Most of the drugs in development for lowering Lp(a) work by interfering with RNA, the molecule that copies and transfers genetic instructions from DNA, the cell's genetic blueprint. Currently, there are four RNA-based drugs that effectively silence the gene that makes Lp(a) in liver cells: lepodisiran, olpasiran, pelacarsen, and zerlasiran. All are administered by injection every one to six months and have been shown to lower Lp(a) levels 80% and 100%. The side effects appear to be limited to mild, short-lived pain at the injection site. Larger, longer trials looking at whether these drugs will help prevent heart-related problems are currently under way, with results expected within the next one to two years, says Dr. O'Donoghue, who is a lead investigator on the clinical trials of olpasiran.

While some people prefer pills over shots, injectable drugs have the advantage of much less frequent dosing, Dr. O'Donoghue notes. Image: © Md Babul Hosen/Getty Images",7,0.3508915,0.2838704,False
https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20230919/cm/closely-watched-covid-variant-detected-10-us-states,Closely Watched COVID Variant Detected in 10 U.S. States,1,"Sept. 19, 2023 – The highly mutated version of the COVID-19 virus called BA.2.86 has already infected people in 10 U.S. states, according to a worldwide COVID tracking database. BA.2.86 has more than 30 mutations in the part of the virus responsible for entering healthy cells, therefore causing an infection. The sheer number of mutations has caught the attention of scientists and public health officials, who fear the design may be a recipe for the next COVID wave as winter approaches. The data, published on GISAID, showed infections with BA.2.86 have happened in Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington state. BA.2.86 has also been detected in wastewater in the U.S., according to the CDC’s wastewater tracking report. But cases in the U.S. are still so rare that BA.2.86 is not reported by the federal agency's regular variant tracker. CDC officials concluded that BA.2.86 is spreading within communities, according to a Friday update, but isn’t increasing rapidly or driving the current rise in infections or hospitalizations. In a study widely reported earlier this month and published Monday the journal The Lancet, Japanese researchers raised concerns that BA.2.86 may be “spreading silently worldwide.” Led by a team from the University of Tokyo, scientists conducted laboratory tests that showed the protection from vaccines or prior infection may not be as effective against BA.2.86 compared to other widely circulating strains of the virus. “Altogether, these results suggest that BA.2.86 is one of the most highly immune evasive variants so far,” the authors wrote. Other early laboratory experiments have shown that antibodies produced by vaccines and prior infection do mount an antibody response against BA.2.86, the CDC reported Sept. 8. At that time, the agency advised that real-world data will be the best way to tell how well immunity from vaccines or prior infection protects against severe illness from BA.2.86 infection.",4,-0.35927227,0.21406047,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-simple-ways-to-improve-gut-health,5 simple ways to improve gut health,1,"Gut health is an easy thing to take for granted — or to ignore completely, if everything is generally functioning well. But poor gut health can impact your overall health in a variety of ways, from the obvious (stomach discomfort) to less obvious effects on mood and immune function. Why gut health matters People are talking about gut health and their microbiome more than they used to, but if it's not something that comes up around your dinner table, here are some basics. When people talk about their gut microbiome, they're referring to all the microorganisms (both good and bad) living in your gastrointestinal tract (primarily your large intestine). Most people have hundreds — or even thousands — of different species of bacteria, viruses, and fungi living in their gut. Gut diversity is important because different microorganisms may help support health in a variety of ways, including: improved digestion and nutrient absorption immune-system regulation protection against harmful bacteria reduced inflammation better brain health. Plus, a healthy and diverse gut microbiome may help reduce your risk of conditions including diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, some cancers, GI disorders, and cardiovascular disease. Five keys to a happy gut The good news is that you can take steps to support a healthy gut microbiome. 1. Add more fiber to your diet Fiber serves as a prebiotic, or food for the good bacteria that live in your gut. Eating plenty of fiber is associated with increased microbial diversity and a reduced risk of gastrointestinal issues like constipation and Crohn's disease. Fiber helps keep the colon healthy by reducing inflammation; it also helps keep you regular. However, most of us don't get enough fiber. Aim to get 21 to 38 grams of fiber per day. Fiber is found in a variety of foods including legumes, whole grains, avocados, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, tofu, berries, leafy greens, and nuts and seeds. 2. Stay hydrated Water is critical for healthy digestion. It helps your body absorb and transport nutrients; it helps with keeping your core body temperature steady; it aids in the production of mucus to protect your digestive tract; and it helps prevent constipation. When you become constipated, your gut microbiota changes, becoming less abundant. If you become dehydrated, your body will let you know, as not drinking enough can manifest as thirst, headache, dry mouth, less frequent urination, dizziness, and tiredness. So drink up — around four to six cups per day for most people. 3. Manage stress Increased stress often manifests itself in digestive discomfort. Stress causes hormones like adrenaline and cortisol to spike, leading to symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. This gut-brain connection is powerful; it's why we get butterflies before a big presentation, or feel nauseous when we're in a high-stakes situation. And while we can't avoid stressful situations entirely, it's possible to learn to manage stress through techniques like belly breathing, relaxation therapy, and meditation. 4. Get enough sleep Healthier gut, better sleep? Perhaps, according to research published in Frontiers in Microbiology, which found that certain bacteria in your gut may impact your sleep in a variety of ways, from your likelihood of experiencing insomnia, to how frequently you need to nap, to how long you stay asleep at night. Most people should aim to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night. If you're struggling to hit that goal, try improving your sleep hygiene, getting plenty of daytime exercise, and trying some of the stress management tips above. 5. Stay physically active It's not hard to find good reasons tostay active, but here's one more: According to a systematic review published in Nutrients, participating in 150 to 270 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity exercise per week for at least six weeks has a positive effect on your gut microbiota, particularly if you combine aerobic exercise with resistance training. We already know that people who are sedentary have different gut microbiota characteristics than active people; this research suggests that you might be able to improve your gut health through exercise even if you're not currently active.",1,0.3104229,0.13631146,False
https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20230913/cm/when-and-why-to-get-shots-for-covid-rsv-and-flu,"When and Why to Get Shots for COVID, RSV, and Flu This Fall",1,"Sept. 13, 2023 – We’re at the start of fall respiratory season, and already this week there is a lot of attention on FDA authorization and CDC support for the new COVID-19 booster shot. But it’s not just COVID. This is also the first fall with a vaccine available for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is recommended for people over 60 and pregnant women. Plus there are the evergreen worries about the flu. Who should be most concerned? What is the optimal time to get one or more of these shots? And how long should you wait to get the new booster if you had COVID this summer? Two experts addressed these and other practical questions at a news briefing sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Higher Risk Means Higher Urgency Even though the CDC now recommends the new COVID vaccine for every American over 6 months, people at higher risk -- older than 65, those with underlying conditions -- should get the vaccine as soon as possible, said Jeffrey Duchin, MD, health officer for Public Health-Seattle & King County in Seattle. “I want to emphasize that although people of all ages can benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, the greatest benefit is for people at increased risk for severe COVID-19 with respect to hospitalizations and deaths,” Duchin said. People at higher risk “should take the vaccine as soon as it’s available and that will be over the coming weeks.” Regarding the timing of the flu and RSV vaccines, they can be combined. Also, for people “who have the luxury of making multiple visits” to their doctor or pharmacy, the shots can be spaced out. “Maybe time your flu shot a little bit more towards when the flu activity is picking up in your community,” Duchin said, “because we know that the effectiveness of the flu vaccine ranges over several months as well.” For RSV, “I wouldn't say there's an urgent need for everybody to run out today and get that vaccine,” he added. People should talk to their doctors about eligibility and timing. So why offer the vaccine to almost the entire U.S. population? An analysis presented at a meeting of CDC advisors this week revealed that having the vaccine available to almost everyone, known as a “universal recommendation,” will save about 200,000 hospitalizations and 15,000 deaths from COVID over the next 2 years, compared to only vaccinating individuals 65 and older. Young, healthy people truly at low risk “need to look at their willingness to become infected and take their chances with the disease that can be serious even in a small proportion of young, healthy people,” Duchin said. They also should consider their home and work environments and if they could expose someone else at higher risk. Not a ‘Slam Dunk’ for Everyone Sometimes higher risk for COVID is more obvious, like older age, and for this group the vaccine is strongly recommended, Duchin said. “It's a slam dunk.” Others may not realize they are at high risk, including some with underlying conditions, he said. “Why should people [at] low risk consider vaccination? One reason is that many people who think they're at low risk really aren't.” The CDC lists many underlying conditions and factors that can place an individual at higher risk for serious outcomes from COVID. Below are the major categories, in alphabetical order. There can be other rare conditions that increase risk, so people should check with their health care professionals. What if I Had COVID This Summer? The official CDC recommendation is to wait on a booster for a minimum 2 months after your last immunization and 3 months if you had a COVID virus infection recently. “Now, that said, everybody needs to look at their own personal situation,” Duchin said. Someone at very high risk, for example, might want to get their COVID booster earlier in their eligibility period, he said. On the other hand, someone at lower risk of exposure who uses a lot of precautions “might want to wait a little bit longer and see if they can extend that protection out a little bit further after a natural infection.” It’s Flu and RSV Season, Too As important as COVID protection is, “we need to think about other vaccines that can we can put to use to protect individuals against these other respiratory viruses that are going to be circulating,” including flu and RSV, said Tina Q. Tan, MD, a pediatrician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago and vice president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America’s board of directors. “We know that millions of children become ill with influenza each year,” Tan said. Children under 5 years of age, and especially those younger than 2, are at increased risk for flu complications. The recommendations are to vaccinate all children 6 months and older against the flu. “It really is a critical tool for protecting individuals against severe influenza and its complications. It's also important to not just immunize the child, but also everyone, especially if there are infants in the household under 6 months.” Regarding RSV, each year more than 2 million medical visits for children under 5 are related to RSV, with most visits among otherwise full-term, healthy infants. While there is no RSV vaccine approved for young children, the CDC in August recommended a new monoclonal antibody for all infants under 8 months and some older babies, Tan said. This preventive treatment is important because “RSV can cause serious disease and complications in this very young infant population.” RSV is associated with up to 80,000 hospitalizations and 300 deaths in young children every year. Older adults are also at higher risk for severe RSV illness. “Many of us know about the importance of getting the annual flu vaccine, but most don't know what a big problem RSV can be for older adults,” Duchin said. The CDC estimates that RSV is responsible for about 160,000 hospitalizations and between 6,000 and 10,000 deaths among older adults. Risk is highest for older Americans with chronic heart or lung disease, weakened immune systems, and adults living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. Duchin added that people 60 and older should have a conversation with their doctor, or whomever administers their vaccines, to determine if RSV vaccination will be beneficial for them.",4,-0.318142,0.37355632,False
https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20230913/cm/covid-hospitalizations-rise-for-eighth-consecutive-week,COVID Hospitalizations Rise for Eighth Week in a Row,1,"Sept. 13, 2023 – Hospitalizations from COVID-19 rose for an eighth straight week for the period ending Sept. 2, although the increase dipped into single digits for the first time in that stretch. New hospital admissions ticked up 9%, to 18,871 people, the CDC reported in its latest dispatch of virus metrics. Newly recommended COVID booster shots are expected to be available within days after a flurry of required approvals and recommendations this week from the CDC and the FDA. On Wednesday morning, the Walgreens website advised COVID vaccine seekers to “check back soon for additional details” and stated that existing vaccine appointments would be rescheduled pending arrival of the updated shots. The CVS website’s online scheduling tool offered COVID vaccine appointments beginning Saturday, Sept. 16. An estimated 97% of people in the U.S. ages 16 and older had protective immunity against COVID by the end of 2022, either from infection or vaccination, according to an article summarizing the current state of the pandemic published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Meanwhile, the age-adjusted death rate from COVID dropped from 115.6 per 100,000 people, in 2021, to 61.3 per 100,000 people in 2022, which is a 47% decrease. But the authors of the article warned that reliance on prior immunity may put people at risk because the protection from a past vaccine or infection decreases over time. “Among adults who are otherwise healthy (‘immunocompetent’), recent estimates of vaccine effectiveness of a bivalent vaccine against hospitalization for COVID-19 were 62% compared with no vaccination in the 2 months after the bivalent dose but decreasing to 24% 4 to 6 months after the bivalent dose,” wrote Carlos del Rio, MD, executive associate dean of the Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta, and JAMA Deputy Editor Preeti N. Malani, MD, MSJ. They also noted that for people ages 65 years and older, the immunity provided by vaccines decreases even faster. It’s unclear what the demand will be for the newly formulated booster, which targets a strain of the virus that was dominant in January called XBB.1.5. The new formulation has been shown to boost antibodies against the virus variants currently causing the most infections. In their JAMA article, del Rio and Malani said the impact of COVID this season may heavily depend on what people do when they feel sick. “Regardless of test results, any person with symptoms of a respiratory infection should remain home and avoid going to school or work,” they advised. “While COVID-19 is no longer a public health threat, waves of infection will occur for the foreseeable future. How disruptive these are will depend on the behavior of the virus but also, more importantly, on the behavior of humans.”",4,-0.42767742,0.39710712,False

Sept. 12, 2023 – New COVID-19 vaccines, designed to target more recent variants of the virus, will be arriving in doctor's offices, pharmacies and clinics this week after the CDC gave the new formula final authorization today. Earlier Tuesday, a CDC advisory committee of doctors and nurses voted 13-1 to recommend all Americans age 6 months and up get an updated COVID-19 vaccine designed to target newer versions of the virus. CDC Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, followed suit a few hours later, allowing the shots to be given. Vaccine makers Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have said they are the ready to make the shots available. “We have more tools than ever to prevent the worst outcomes from COVID-19,” Cohen said in a statement. “CDC is now recommending updated COVID-19 vaccination for everyone 6 months and older to better protect you and your loved ones.” Reports of a mutating virus and COVID hospitalizations of about 17,000people a week in the United States, according to the health protection agency, led to a 13 to 1 vote by the committee. With CDC action, Medicaid, Medicare and private insurance companies would be required to cover the cost of the vaccines with no charge to patients. On Monday, the FDA approved the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech updated vaccines for people ages 6 months or older. In an announcement of the approval, the FDA stated that the new version of the shot better targets the currently circulating variants of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, and will “provide better protection against serious consequences of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death.” With Tuesday's CDC decision, the bivalent vaccine, approved last fall, will be discontinued. Close to 153 million doses of that version of the vaccine have been administered in the U.S. and now, vaccination rates are declining. It is a concern that was raised in the meeting with predictions showing hospitalizations are expected to rise again this year. ""I'm astonished by the number of people who are not vaccinated,"" committee member Camille Nelson Kotton, MD, from the infectious diseases division of the Massachusetts General Hospital said at the meeting. ""We need a universal recommendation to add clarity for people. Let's keep America strong, healthy and do away with COVID,"" she said before casting her vote. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices discussed current variants and virus lineages, vaccine effectiveness, an “economic analysis of COVID-19 vaccination,” safety, and a program that provides free vaccines to people without insurance or who are under-insured. There will also be a public comment period, according to the meeting agenda. Opposing the decision was Pablo Sanchez, MD, from the Ohio State University Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus. In the one lone vote against the universal vaccine mandate, Sanchez voiced his preference to focus vaccination efforts on the most at-risk groups of the elderly, immunocompromised and pregnant. ""I'm not against the vaccines,"" he said, ""but I'm not in favor of a universal mandate this time and I'd prefer we wait for more data.""",4,-0.46429375,0.43105143,False

Depending on the dose, statins also increase the risk of developing diabetes by 10% to 35%, possibly by preventing your body's insulin from working well, which causes blood sugar to rise. This side effect is most common in people with obesity and prediabetes, who are already prone to developing diabetes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/gum-disease-and-heart-health-probing-the-link,Gum disease and heart health: Probing the link,1,"About two-thirds of people over 65 have gum disease — more formally known as periodontal disease. It starts when plaque, a sticky film of bacteria and food, builds up around the teeth. In its earliest stage, gingivitis, irritated gums can bleed easily. Left untreated, periodontal disease can worsen and, in its most severe form, cause the teeth to loosen and fall out. Compared with people who have healthy gums, people with periodontal disease are about twice as likely to have a heart attack. Shared risk factors — including smoking, an unhealthy diet, or lack of access to health and dental care — may explain some of this association. However, some bacterial and viral infections also appear to increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. And growing evidence suggests that bacteria and inflammation may underlie the link between the mouth and the heart. ""Your mouth is a gateway to the rest of your body, so it's not surprising that your oral health can affect your overall health and vice versa,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, a prosthodontist in the Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Hundreds of different types of bacteria occur naturally in the mouth. Some, fed by sugars, release acids that break down the outer layer of your teeth, causing cavities. Other types of bacteria form plaque that — if not removed by regular brushing and flossing — hardens into tartar, Dr. Jiang explains. Only a professional dental cleaning can remove these hard, calcified deposits. Signs of gum disease If you experience any of these signs, you may have periodontal disease: swollen, red, or tender gums gums that bleed easily pus between the teeth and gums bad breath buildup of hard yellow or brown deposits along the gum line teeth that are moving apart or loose dental appliances no longer fit well. Bacteria on the move? The bacteria responsible for periodontal disease can travel to blood vessels throughout the body. In fact, periodontal bacteria have been found in the fatty debris (atherosclerosis) that clogs arteries located far from the mouth — and in blood clots from people who have experienced heart attacks. ""In both gum disease and heart disease, we find bacteria in places where they're not supposed to be,"" says Dr. Jiang. The body's immune response to these misplaced bacteria triggers an outpouring of white blood cells. The resulting inflammation may lead to tiny clots and cause a heart attack or stroke. In addition, many factors linked to a higher risk of heart disease—diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity — are all more common in people with periodontal disease, according to a 2021 review article about oral health and cardiovascular disease in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology. One way to treat periodontal disease is for dentists and hygienists to use manual scalers or ultrasound devices to scrape away tartar above and below the gum line. Known as scaling and root planing, this deep cleaning is more extensive than the twice-yearly cleanings people typically get at the dentist. But while treating periodontal disease may help bring down levels of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream, there's limited evidence it can reduce heart attacks or other cardiovascular problems. Preventing periodontal disease To prevent gum disease, daily brushing and flossing is essential — and can even reverse gingivitis before it worsens. If you've slacked off on your flossing, you may notice a little bleeding when you start up again, says Dr. Jiang. When that happens, some people get nervous and stop flossing. But don't worry; just get back into the habit and chances are the bleeding will improve within a few days, she advises. If it doesn't, and you notice other signs of gum disease (see box), schedule an appointment with your dentist. A healthy diet can also help, says Dr. Jiang. Most people know that hard or chewy candy and other sticky sweets promote cavities. But sugary drinks like sodas (especially if you sip them throughout the day) also feed the bacteria that cause cavities and gum disease. ""That's also true for refined carbohydrates that stick to your teeth, like crackers and breads made with white flour,"" says Dr. Jiang. What's more, a sugary diet is itself associated with higher heart disease risk.

Three sign-offs are expected in the coming days, ABC News reported. First, the FDA will formally authorize the vaccines. Second, an independent panel of CDC advisers will meet on Sept. 12 and recommend who should get the shots. After that, the CDC’s director will need to sign off. If that happens quickly, the shots may be available as soon as Sept. 13, according to the news outlet.

After an investigation cleared her of any drug abuse, they allegedly continued to hold her baby and stipulated that to get her baby back she had to “stop talking on Social Media.” Jennifer writes: As an infant, I was adopted by a family in NY who subsequently sold me to various individuals and entities throughout my childhood. I’ve been to Epstein Island and on multiple Lolita Express types of flights. I’ve witnessed high-profile individuals forced to rape children while being filmed under threat of death for themselves and their loved ones. Shortly after going public with my story, Child Protective Services opened a Substance Exposed Newborn case, even though all drug tests came back negative, and took my child “In case of neglect”. Their stipulation for her return? Stop talking on Social Media. The question becomes – How many other families has CPS done this to? How many times has CPS opened a fraudulent case, taking a child(ren) “In case of neglect”, and lie about key aspects of their case to the court to facilitate the termination of parental rights? I am not the first. (Source.) We did a thorough review of her case and her story back in 2018: Today, her daughter is 5 years old and back in their life, but Jennifer is trying to fight back and expose this corrupt business of child trafficking that is done under the color of law and referred to as “Foster Care” and “Adoption”, but is mainly a system that rakes in $billions annually to traffick children, something we have been exposing for almost a decade now through our MedicalKidnap.com website with hundreds of stories. See: Jennifer and her daughter Iris. Photo supplied by family. When Jennifer states that “I am not the first” in reference to the child welfare system’s attempts to blackmail her by forcing her to take her story down off of the Internet as a requirement to get her child back, she is telling the truth, because we have been documenting many cases where this has happened for years now. The evil child welfare system does not want their crimes exposed to the public, as it is a very lucrative child trafficking business that employs hundreds of thousands of people nationwide, from social workers to attorneys to judges and many others who earn their living from this corrupt system. I myself and Health Impact News have been threatened more times than I can count, by judges, lawyers, district attorneys and others demanding that we take down certain stories that expose their corruption. But we have never once complied, and to this day every story we have published that exposes this evil still exists on our network, by the Grace of God. Jennifer Guskin has recently filed a lawsuit against Baltimore County (case # C-03-CV-23-001844) for the crimes they committed against her and her daughter, but she has been forced to file it Pro Se, since no attorney would dare to take on a case like this, and she needs the help of the public to continue this case. First, she needs the prayers of the Saints to fight against the evil forces that feed this system. Second, she needs legal experts to work with her on her case. And third, she needs a little bit of financial help since she is funding this all by herself, and you can visit her page on Give Send Go to come and stand with her and offer your support. Besides Give Send Go, Jennifer can be reached by email at jennifer.guskin@proton.me, and she has a Substack page here. This evil MUST be exposed, and I greatly admire the strength and the courage of this young mother, who herself has suffered so much, to take on this battle to fight for the abused and trafficked children suffering through government taxpayer-funded programs that keep this system operating. But she can’t do it alone. She needs a nation of warriors committed to the truth who will not back down from evil, to expose this depth of corruption and start the process of holding them accountable.",9,-0.29234323,-0.28319603,False
https://healthimpactnews.com/2023/mexicos-proposed-ban-on-gm-corn-angers-the-u-s-and-canada/,Mexico's Proposed Ban on GM Corn Angers the U.S. and Canada,0,"Mexican Heirloom Corn varieties are in danger from GM corn imports from the U.S. and Canada. Image source. by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Certain states in Mexico have banned the planting and cultivation of genetically modified corn from the U.S. in recent years, in order to preserve heirloom varieties of corn (maize) that have existed in Mexico for thousands of years. In 2022, Mexico proposed a ban on imports of GM corn as a country, and now the U.S. and Canada are teaming up to protest and to try and force Mexico to keep importing GM corn. The AP reported last week: Canada joins US in trade dispute hearings against Mexico’s proposed ban on GM corn MEXICO CITY (AP) — Canada said Friday it will join a trade dispute panel that the United States requested over Mexico’s proposed limits on imports of genetically modified corn. The U.S. government asked that the dispute process be formally opened on June 2, after talks with the Mexican government failed to yield results. The panel of experts would have about half a year to study the complaint and release its findings. Trade sanctions could follow if Mexico is found to have violated the U.S.-Mexico Canada free trade agreement. Mexico wants to ban GM corn for human consumption, and perhaps eventually ban it for animal feed as well, something that both its northern partners say would damage trade and violate USMCA requirements that any health or safety standards be based on scientific evidence. “Canada shares the concerns of the U.S. that Mexico’s measures are not scientifically supported and have the potential to unnecessarily disrupt trade in the North American market,” Canada’s Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Food said in a statement. Mexico is the leading importer of U.S. yellow corn, most of which is genetically modified. Almost all is fed to cattle, pigs and chickens in Mexico, which doesn’t grow enough feed corn. Corn for human consumption in Mexico is almost entirely domestically-grown white corn, though corn-meal chips or other processed products could potentially contain GM corn. Mexico argues GM corn may have health effects, even when used as fodder, but hasn’t yet presented proof. (Full article.) For U.S. and Canadian politicians to state that the claims that GM corn are hazardous to one’s health “are not scientifically supported” is similar to saying that “the science is settled” when it comes to the “safety” of vaccines. It is a total lie. The science showing how dangerous genetically modified food is, including the use of glyphosate herbicides sprayed on GM crops, is ABUNDANT. But similar to studies showing the toxicity and harms of vaccines, these studies are almost always censored, or if they get published, are usually later retracted due to the pressure of Big Ag interests. One such study was published in 2012 in the Food and Chemical Toxicity journal in 2012, by French researcher Dr. Gilles-Eric Séralini: Abstract The health effects of a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize (from 11% in the diet), cultivated with or without Roundup, and Roundup alone (from 0.1 ppb in water), were studied 2 years in rats. In females, all treated groups died 2-3 times more than controls, and more rapidly. This difference was visible in 3 male groups fed GMOs. All results were hormone and sex dependent, and the pathological profiles were comparable. Females developed large mammary tumors almost always more often than and before controls, the pituitary was the second most disabled organ; the sex hormonal balance was modified by GMO and Roundup treatments. In treated males, liver congestions and necrosis were 2.5-5.5 times higher. This pathology was confirmed by optic and transmission electron microscopy. Marked and severe kidney nephropathies were also generally 1.3-2.3 greater. Males presented 4 times more large palpable tumors than controls which occurred up to 600 days earlier. Biochemistry data confirmed very significant kidney chronic deficiencies; for all treatments and both sexes, 76% of the altered parameters were kidney related. These results can be explained by the non linear endocrine-disrupting effects of Roundup, but also by the overexpression of the transgene in the GMO and its metabolic consequences. (Source.) Big Ag was outraged, and forced the journal to retract the study. The researchers published their response: Abstract Our recent work (Séralini et al., 2012) remains to date the most detailed study involving the life-long consumption of an agricultural genetically modified organism (GMO). This is true especially for NK603 maize for which only a 90-day test for commercial release was previously conducted using the same rat strain (Hammond et al., 2004). It is also the first long term detailed research on mammals exposed to a highly diluted pesticide in its total formulation with adjuvants. This may explain why 75% of our first criticisms arising within a week, among publishing authors, come from plant biologists, some developing patents on GMOs, even if it was a toxicological paper on mammals, and from Monsanto Company who owns both the NK603 GM maize and Roundup herbicide (R). Our study has limits like any one, and here we carefully answer to all criticisms from agencies, consultants and scientists, that were sent to the Editor or to ourselves. At this level, a full debate is biased if the toxicity tests on mammals of NK603 and R obtained by Monsanto Company remain confidential and thus unavailable in an electronic format for the whole scientific community to conduct independent scrutiny of the raw data. In our article, the conclusions of long-term NK603 and Roundup toxicities came from the statistically highly discriminant findings at the biochemical level in treated groups in comparison to controls, because these findings do correspond in an blinded analysis to the pathologies observed in organs, that were in turn linked to the deaths by anatomopathologists. GM NK603 and R cannot be regarded as safe to date. (Source.) So once again, the term “science” is used as a weapon to attack truth, where REAL science should welcome debate, and not suppress it. I have operated an online ecommerce store selling healthy food and products for over 21 years now, called Healthy Traditions. We began testing all the food we sold online for the presence of glyphosate and other herbicides and pesticides in 2014, when we discovered that even USDA certified organic grains were contaminated with these herbicides and pesticides. And if a particular food we sell has a GMO equivalent in the market, we also test the product for the presence of GMO DNA. It took a long time to find agricultural products that were not contaminated, and today most of these products that we sell and test clean, are imported from outside the U.S. from countries that have a stricter policy regarding these herbicides and pesticides, and the use of GMOs. Corn was the hardest one for us to source, because literally every sample we tested in the U.S., even when USDA certified as organic, or certified as GMO-free, were ALL contaminated. For about two years we did not sell any corn products, because we could not find a source in the U.S. that consistently tested clean from GMOs and glyphosate. We finally found an heirloom white corn variety from a state in Central Mexico, where GMO corn was banned by the governor of that particular state, and today that is the only corn we sell. Mexico needs to STAND FIRM against the corrupt American and Canadian corporations trying to enforce their will on them, and proceed with a total ban on imported GM corn. Mexico is known as the birth place of “maize”, which is their staple, and many of their traditional heirloom varieties are already being threatened by cross contamination from GM corn imported from the U.S. and Canada. If the American consumer will become more informed about the quality of the food they purchase, and seek out uncontaminated food, such as GMO-free corn from Mexico, the poorer countries of Central and South America, which all still have a much higher percentage of their populations involved in sustainable, traditional small-scale production, could find a very lucrative market in the U.S. among the informed public that demands healthier and cleaner food. But that will only happen if the American consumer decides to take their food purchases more seriously, and not settle for cheap, contaminated and subsidized mass-produced commodity food.

https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20230905/cm/highly-mutated-covid-strain-cant-evade-immunity-as-feared,Highly Mutated COVID Strain Can’t Evade Immunity as Feared,1,"Sept. 5, 2023 – The new highly mutated COVID variant BA.2.86 does not have a heightened ability to evade the protection of COVID vaccines or immunity from prior infection, new laboratory tests show. The BA.2.86 variant grabbed the attention of public health officials in recent weeks due to its quick spread across the globe and a large number of mutations. Having so many mutations increased the chance that it would behave differently than previous versions of the virus, possibly making it more dangerous. Now, experiments conducted by two teams of U.S. scientists show that antibodies from COVID vaccinations or prior infections can recognize and fight off the BA.2.86 version of the virus, CNN reported, noting that the protection may be “perhaps even better” than antibody responses to other currently circulating strains of the virus. The new studies showed that people infected within the past 6 months with an XBB-version of the virus had the strongest immune responses to BA.2.86. “BA.2.86 really doesn't appear to be a huge hit to neutralization after XBB infection. What does this mean? New COVID vaccine (likely coming soon) should provide good protection against infection even against BA.2.86,” former White House COVID coordinator Ashish Jha, MD, MPH, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. The CDC expects the updated COVID vaccine to be available in mid-September. Just like the annual flu shot, the new approach to COVID vaccines is to formulate a new version annually to target strains that are anticipated to be widely circulating. The new COVID vaccine has been optimized to protect against an XBB strain called XBB.1.5. Last week, the CDC indicated BA.2.86 has been found in four U.S. states, either in people or in wastewater, but it’s still so rare that it’s not even listed as a standalone strain on the CDC’s variant tracker. The current predominant virus strains all remain subvariants of Omicron. Currently, EG.5 accounts for 21.5% of cases, FL.1.5.1 accounts for 14.5% of cases, and several XBB strains account for 8% to 9% each. FL.1.5.1 is a recombinant of two XBB virus strains and may be more worrisome than BA.2.86 because it showed some ability to evade immunity in lab tests, CNN reported. “If there wasn’t so much hype about BA.2.86, that would actually be the focus of the paper,” Dan Barouch, MD, PhD, told the news outlet, referring to the FL.1.5.1 strain. Barouch is director of one of the labs that conducted the new tests, and he also directs the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Massachusetts. Since June, there has been an upward climb of serious COVID cases resulting in an increasing number of people being hospitalized with the virus. About 15,000 people were hospitalized during the week ending Aug. 19, which is the most recent week for which data is available from the CDC. Deaths rose from about 500 per week since June to over 600 deaths during the first week of August. Still, the metrics are far lower than during the height of the pandemic, when more than 20,000 people died per week and more than 100,000 weekly hospitalizations were reported. The CDC in last week’s COVID risk assessment update on BA.2.86 indicated that 97% of people in the U.S. have antibodies from previous infection, vaccination, or both, which “likely” will provide protection against severe cases of COVID-19.",4,-0.3644278,0.32421696,False

Trever Frodsham (left), Devani (center), and Ryan Frodsham (right). by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News One of the most horrific stories Health Impact News has ever covered involving child sex trafficking through the foster care system is a story we have been following and reporting on in Arizona since 2017. It started with the story of Devani, a 2-year-old child who was removed from the family who loved her, simply because the mother had a previous history of drug abuse, and then was put into the home of David Frodsham, a top civilian commander at Fort Huachuca, a major Army installation in Arizona, where 2-year-old Devani became part of a pedophile ring and was repeatedly raped. David Frodsham was eventually arrested and is currently in prison, but Devani was not placed back with her family, but with another foster family, where 80% of her body was burned. See: This story is so horrible, that the national corporate media has also reported on it, and last year (April, 2022), Michael Rezendes, writing for the Associated Press, provided new details of the Frodsham child sex trafficking ring operating through the Arizona Foster Care system, as three of his adopted sons came forward to file lawsuits for the years that they too were sexually abused and trafficked. (David) Frodsham pleaded guilty to sex abuse charges in 2016 and is serving a 17-year sentence. But records reviewed by the AP show that the U.S. Army and the state of Arizona missed or ignored multiple red flags over more than a decade, which allowed Frodsham to allegedly abuse his adopted son and other children for years, all the while putting national security at risk. The state permitted Frodsham and his wife, Barbara, to foster, adopt and retain custody of their many children despite nearly 20 complaints, and attempted complaints, of abuse, neglect, maltreatment and licensing violations. Meanwhile, the Army gave Frodsham security clearances and sensitive jobs at a time when his illicit sexual practices made him vulnerable to blackmail. Frodsham, former Sgt. Randall Bischak and a third man not associated with the Army are all serving prison terms for the roles they played in the child sex abuse ring. But the investigation is continuing because Sierra Vista police believe additional men took part. Now, the criminal investigation is spilling over into civil court, where two of Frodsham’s adopted sons have filed separate lawsuits against the state for licensing David and Barbara Frodsham as foster parents in a home where they say they were physically and sexually abused throughout their lives. A third adopted son filed suit Tuesday in Arizona state court in Cochise County, said attorney Lynne Cadigan, who represents all three. In the latest complaint, 19-year-old Trever Frodsham says case workers missed or overlooked numerous signs that David and Barbara Frodsham were unfit parents. These included a 2002 sex abuse complaint filed with local police by one of the Frodshams’ biological daughters against an older biological brother, and the fact that David and Barbara Frodsham were themselves victims of child sex abuse. (Full article.) And while David Frodsham is currently serving out his term in prison, the people employed by the State of Arizona and tasked with protecting Arizona foster children, who ignored complaints against the Frodshams for years, have not been punished yet for their complicit crimes to allow this evil system to continue. One of the adopted Frodsham boys, Trever Frodsham, has filed a suit against the State of Arizona, but Joe Duhownik of Courthouse News Service reported last week that the State of Arizona is claiming that the caseworkers should have “immunity” for their crimes in allowing this pedophile ring to not only exist, but be funded by the State of Arizona for years now. Arizona claims immunity in negligence case over foster home sex abuse One of the many victims of a former civilian army leader’s sex abuse ring asked a federal judge to find the state negligent in placing him in the man’s care. A child sex abuse victim argued for partial summary judgment Friday in a negligence suit against the state of Arizona over its placement of foster children. Trever Frodsham says the state and its cooperating agencies were grossly negligent in placing Trever and his siblings in the care of former civilian army leader David Frodsham and leaving him there despite numerous complaints of abuse and sexual misconduct. He says his foster father sexually abused him from age 2 to age 14, when David Frodsham was arrested in 2016. He’s currently serving a 17-year prison sentence for leading a sex abuse ring, forcing multiple children he fostered to perform sex acts on both him and his friends, sometimes in the presence of his wife, Barbara. Both he and Barbara are named as defendants as well in the civil case against the state. The state allowed the couple to retain custody of their foster children and later adopt them despite nearly 20 complaints of misconduct. Arizona says in its reply to the 2022 lawsuit that Catholic Community Services and Arizona Partnership for Children, the agencies that aid the Arizona Department of Child Services in placement of foster kids, investigated each complaint but couldn’t substantiate any of them until David Frodsham was arrested. Trever, now 20, moved for summary judgment in November on the counts pertaining to the state’s negligence, leaving claims of assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and more to be decided by a jury. The state countered his motion in December, arguing that both it and the caseworkers responsible for Trever’s foster family have qualified immunity. Because the decisions to place and keep him in David Frodsham’s home required the exercise of professional judgment and discretion, the state says those caseworkers cannot be held liable for making a call they thought was in the best interest of the child. “There’s no reason a caseworker shouldn’t have qualified immunity, otherwise we’re always gonna be in court,” state attorney Mark Lammers said in a Friday morning hearing. “The caseworker is in a tough spot sometimes and has to make tough professional calls.” (Full article.) The state attorney, Mark Lammers, does not have strong legal case law on his side when he states “There’s no reason a caseworker shouldn’t have qualified immunity, otherwise we’re always gonna be in court.” “Qualified immunity,” however, is not a blanket rule that can be invoked to cover up negligence and abuse by those employed by the state to wrongfully kidnap children from loving families and put them into the homes of known pedophiles at the expense of taxpayers funding the Child Welfare system. When that happens, as it clearly did in this story, they should “always be in court.” Kentucky mother Nikkie Holliday and her daughter. Image source. In Kentucky, Senior Judge William Bertlesman has ruled twice in recent years that “qualified immunity” could not be claimed in cases where social workers were negligent in protecting children who were in the custody of the State, and one of those cases was upheld by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, setting legal precedence. Judy Clabes, writing for the Northern Kentucky Tribune, reported in 2020 that Senior Judge William Bertlesman of the U.S. District Court in Covington ruled that social workers are not entitled to qualified immunity in their case with Maureen ‘Nikkie’ Holliday versus the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services. As “qualified immunity” for police and other public employees comes to the forefront nationally, the practice as it applies to state social workers has been dealt another blow in the U.S. District Court in Covington by Senior Judge William Bertlesman. The judge has ruled in the case of Maureen ‘Nikkie’ Holliday versus the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services social workers who imposed a restrictive “Prevention Plan” the single mom was coerced into signing. It required her to have strictly supervised contact with her four-year-old daughter. The threatened penalty was foster care for her child. Bertleman has ruled that Holliday’s due process claims and her emotional distress claims are legitimate and that the social workers are not entitled to qualified immunity. Holliday is a single mother and an army combat veteran. She worked two jobs and was going to school at the time of her unfortunate experience with CHFS, so her daughter was enrolled in a Florence daycare center. She has since graduated from the University of Cincinnati (in social work) and is working with a homeless veterans’ group. Her daughter had a bruise on her buttocks that she said she got when another child at the daycare bit her. When the daycare was alerted to the bite, they involved the Cabinet and social worker Alecia Leigh took charge and threatened to take the daughter into custody on the spot if Holliday did not sign the Prevention Plan agreement. She signed under duress. As required, Holliday took her daughter to Children’s Hospital to be examined and the discharge instructions read: “AH (the child) was seen and evaluated by the emergency department. She explained that she was ‘bitten on the butt’ by her friend Lola. My exam was consistent with bite marks on both butt cheeks. The marks were simply minor bruises and no puncture marks. There were no other injuries noted. AH otherwise appears to be a healthy and happy child. Images were taken for her medical record.” Despite this report, Holliday endured several months under the “Prevention Plan’s” restrictions while the Cabinet proceeded to question Holliday’s friends, family and associates and questioned two young cousins at school. Holliday and her daughter lived in three homes over that period, were denied their normal family support system — and Holliday feared losing her jobs and falling behind in school. On December 27, 2016, Leigh and her supervisor Danielle Sneed decided to close the case as “unsubstantiated” though Holliday was not notified until January 13, 2017. (Source.) Ms. Holliday then sued CHFS and the social workers. Holliday’s attorney Paul Hill filed suit against Alecia Leigh, Danielle Sneed and ‘Jane Does(s),’ supervisors and others in the CHFS. Bertlesman writes in his opinion that “there was no compelling purpose to impose restrictions on Holliday,” that Leigh misrepresented her legal authority, and that Sneed acquiesced to the alleged deprivation of Holliday’s constitutional rights. “Qualified official immunity applies to the negligent performance by a public officer or employee of (1) discretionary acts or functions, i.e., those involving the exercise of discretion and judgment, or personal deliberation, decision, and judgment; (2) in good faith; and (3) within the scope of the employee’s authority. . . “Given that. . the defendant’s actions violated a clearly established constitutional right, defendants are not entitled to state-law qualified immunity. . .” Bertlesman denied the social workers’ claims related to Holliday’s “substantive and procedural due process claims,” as well as her IIED (intentional infliction of emotional distress) claim. The decision means that the lawsuit can proceed to a jury trial. (Source.) Holly and David Schulkers. Image source. This was the second time that Judge Bertlesman had ruled against qualified immunity of social workers abusing parental rights and illegally removing children from their home. The other case involved Holly and David Schulkers, in Schulkers v. Kammer, and his judgment in that case denying qualified immunity to social workers was upheld by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, setting forth important legal precedence. Judy Clabes of the Northern Kentucky Tribune reported on that story as well. A Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruling was cause for celebration at the Fort Thomas home of Holly and David Schulkers and five of their children, as the court ruled in their favor in a lawsuit against individual social workers for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. The lawsuit involves the social workers’ mishandling of the drug test of a new mom’s urine sample – a “false positive” for opiates – that extended into threats of sending their children into foster care and onerous rules saying Holly could not be with her children alone in her own home. Federal District Judge William Bertlesman in February 2019 denied “qualified immunity” for the social workers at a hearing in Covington on one count in the couple’s lawsuit and upheld it on another count. The Cabinet and the social workers, Elizabeth Kammer and Alison Campbell, appealed. But the Sixth Circuit judges – Martha Craig Daughtrey, Eric Clay, and Richard Griffin – unanimously said the social workers should not have qualified immunity on either count which can send the Schulkers’ case to a jury trial for damages. In a nutshell, with a lot of twists and turns: Holly Schulkers is a busy mom and stepmom to six young children, including the baby born in February 2017 and five others, aged 9-14. At St. Elizabeth Hospital for the birth of the baby, she unknowingly had a urine test that was “presumptive positive” for opiates (perhaps her doctor noted on her chart because she consumed a snack with poppy seeds on it and “poppy seeds are among the products that can cause a false positive on a drug screen”). She was breastfeeding her healthy baby. Meanwhile, the baby’s umbilical cord was sent for testing. Without waiting for the results of that test or a second urine test and a follow-up hair follicle test, all of which were later negative for drugs, the hospital social worker entered “Substance Use Disorder” on Holly’s chart and reported the “positive drug screen” electronically to the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services. Enter social workers – and Holly’s nightmare. Kammer and Campbell told the Schulkers they could not take the baby home unless they signed a “Prevention Plan” that required that Holly not be left alone with any of the children at any time. Meantime, in full knowledge of the new test results, Kammer and another CHFS employee went to the children’s schools and had the Schulkers’ children – without the parents’ permission – brought into a private room one by one – with no school personnel present – and asked them about “mommy’s drug use.” The children were understandably upset. Despite repeated requests, the conditions of the “Prevention Plan” were not lifted until two months after the Schulkers left the hospital, at which time the case was marked “unsubstantiated.” (Full story here.) This represents a trend in the federal courts in recent years of “piercing through the veil” of “qualified immunity” for social workers who behave badly and take advantage of their government positions to kidnap children and participate in child trafficking with no legal consequences. Similar cases have been litigated in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court in San Francisco, which has jurisdiction over the State of Arizona. In 2018 in the U.S. 9th Circuit a family in Arizona had their children removed from their home without a warrant, simply because they had taken photos of their 3 children after a bath when they were laying on a towel naked. They went to develop the photos at a Walmart, and an employee reported them to the police. The police investigation was extensive, including medical and forensic exams of the children looking for sexual abuse, as well as obtaining a warrant to search the family’s home, where police “seized all the evidence that might be relevant to a child pornography investigation: computers, printers, photographs, cell phones, undeveloped film, floppy discs, DVDs, CDs, VHS tapes, and cameras.” Police found no evidence of wrongdoing, so no charges were filed against the parents, and the children were returned home. Police detective John Krause wrote in his report: “[a]pparently after the forensic interviews and medical exams were completed, [Child Protective Services] declined to remove the children from the parent’s custody, and had directed [his partner] to return the girls to Lisa and A.J.” According to court records: None of the photographs portrayed children engaged in sexual activity. None portrayed the children’s genitalia frontally. The parents stated they simply wanted the photos to look back at years later to see how “cute” the children were. The matter should have ended after the investigation, but it did not. Child Protective Services (“CPS”) investigating officer Laura Pederson discussed the case with Detective Krause, according to court records, and decided to drive over to the house and take the children into custody. The ruling of the court was made by a 3-judge panel at the 9th Circuit. Judge Marsha S. Berzon was the leading concurring judge. The court stated: As this court has stated repeatedly, families have a “well-elaborated constitutional right to live together without governmental interference.” Wallis v. Spencer, 202 F.3d 1126, 1136 (9th Cir. 2000); accord Kirkpatrick v. Cty. of Washoe, 843 F.3d 784, 789 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc); Burke v. Cty. of Alameda, 586 F.3d 725, 731 (9th Cir. 2009); Rogers v. Cty. of San Joaquin, 487 F.3d 1288, 1294 (9th Cir. 2007); Mabe v. San Bernardino Cty., 237 F.3d 1101, 1107 (9th Cir. 2001); Ram v. Rubin, 118 F.3d 1306, 1310 (9th Cir. 1997). Judge Marsha S. Berzon in her concurring opinion addressed the issue of traumatizing children by removing them from their home: I concur in the per curiam opinion in full. I write separately to emphasize why it is essential that the courts scrupulously guard a child’s constitutional right to remain at home absent a court order or true exigency. Taking a child from his or her home, family, and community constitutes a separate trauma, in and of itself. Our cases so recognize, and so ordinarily permit that trauma to occur only after a court determination that the alternative is worse. The fact that the Demaree family’s constitutional rights under the 4th Amendment were violated by removing their children from their home without a warrant was apparently not in dispute in this appeal. The parents had already successfully sued the police officer, John Krause, who settled out of court. The courts have consistently ruled against law enforcement who remove children from homes without a warrant issued by a judge. The law and court cases defining the exceptions where a warrant is not needed, where the children’s lives are in imminent danger and there would be no time to get a warrant, are clear, and were quoted in this decision also. However, most states have “qualified immunity” laws for social workers, under the justification that when a child is in danger, it is better to err on the side of caution. In this 9th Circuit ruling, however, the court ruled that social workers are not above the law and do not have the right to violate the Constitution. The Demarees claimed that CPS social workers violated their constitutional rights: The Demarees, on behalf of themselves and their children, claim Pederson and Van Ness violated their clearly established constitutional rights when Pederson removed the children from the home without a court order and absent an emergency. The 9th Circuit Court agreed: Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Demarees, the social workers did not have reasonable cause to believe the children were at risk of serious bodily harm or molestation. Pederson and Van Ness did not represent that the Demaree children might “again be beaten or molested,” Rogers, 487 F.3d at 1294, if left in their home—the children were never beaten or molested in the first place. The 9th circuit was very thorough in their opinion regarding the 4th and 14th Amendments and how social workers cannot violate the Constitution even if state laws offer “qualified immunity.” They quoted many other cases as precedent: In 2007, the year before the events in this case took place, Rogers held that a social worker violated a family’s clearly established federal rights by removing children with no warrant because of reports that a three-year-old and five-year old “were not toilet-trained, were locked in their rooms at night and in a room at their parents’ business during the day, were not receiving medical or dental care, that [one] had lost his teeth due to bottle rot, that [the other] was still being fed with a bottle, that their home was dirty and maggot-infested, and that there were unsecured guns in the home.” Rogers, 487 F.3d at 1291. The social worker in that case “could have obtained a warrant within hours,” and “[t]here [was] no indication in the record that so short a delay could have resulted in a significant worsening of the children’s physical conditions or an increase in the prospects of long-term harm.” Id. at 1295. One child’s “‘pain’ was not so serious that he ceased to be ‘playful’ and ‘alert,’” the physical risk the children faced from being locked in a room for the time it would take to obtain a warrant was “very low,” and “the mess in the Rogers living quarters . . . was a chronic, ongoing problem.” Even in the face of this significant accumulation of neglect and bodily harm, which all parties agreed had resulted in bodily injury to the small children, we held that there was no reasonable cause to believe an exigency supported the children’s warrantless removal. Id. at 1296. We concluded that their removal therefore violated their clearly established rights. Id. (Full article.)",9,-0.31075442,-0.3273114,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sleep-apnea-and-heart-disease-a-weighty-matter,Sleep apnea and heart disease: A weighty matter,1,"In addition to helping control diabetes and obesity, the popular drugs known as GLP-1 agonists may also alleviate another disorder that's closely linked to cardiovascular problems: obstructive sleep apnea. This common condition — which is marked by brief pauses in breathing, often accompanied by loud snoring — doesn't just leave people groggy and sleepy during the day. Left untreated, this serious disorder raises the odds of high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. Excess weight is the strongest risk factor linked with sleep apnea, which affects about 25% of men and 10% of women in the United States. More than half of people with the condition are overweight or obese, and the risk rises as body size increases, according to Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Extra fat tissue in the neck and throat can narrow the airway, and extra weight on the chest and belly puts pressure on the lungs, which makes the normal process of inhaling and exhaling less effective,"" she explains. What happens during sleep apnea? The 10- to 30-second breathing pauses that characterize sleep apnea occur when the airway in your nose or throat becomes partially or completely blocked by large tonsils, a large tongue, or too much tissue in the airway. Image: © Blueastro/Getty Images Treating sleep apnea In sleep apnea, the breathing pauses happen when the airway briefly closes (see ""What happens during sleep apnea?""). The first-line treatment is positive airway pressure (PAP), which uses a small bedside machine to push a forceful stream of air to a mask covering the nose or the nose and mouth to keep the airway open. A recent study found that one of the GLP-1 drugs, tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for obesity) can slash the number of breathing interruptions during sleep — a key measure of sleep apnea severity. Published June 21, 2024, in The New England Journal of Medicine, the yearlong study included 469 people with obesity and moderate-to-severe sleep apnea, some of whom used PAP machines when sleeping. Compared with people who got a placebo injection, those treated with tirzepatide had a nearly 59% drop in their apnea-hypopnea index, a measure that describes the number of times a person's breathing slows or stops during an hour of sleep. Those taking tirzepatide lost close to 20% of their body weight. Ditch your PAP machine? ""At least once a week, I see people in my clinic who have lost so much weight on one of the obesity drugs that they don't need to use their PAP machine any longer,"" says Dr. Javaheri. (The other GLP-1 obesity drug, semaglutide, is sold as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss). ""Several patients lost between 50 and 60 pounds, which was enough to completely cure their sleep apnea."" While tirzepatide is not approved for treating sleep apnea, it's currently under consideration by the FDA for that use. However, even if you qualify for a prescription for either semaglutide or tirzepatide based on your medical conditions, these medications can be challenging to obtain due high demand, limited supplies, cost, and other factors. That said, the growing list of health benefits from GLP-1 agonists (see ""Anti-obesity drug lowers heart-related problems"" in the February 2024 Heart Letter) may make them both more accessible and affordable in the future. If and when tirzepatide is approved for treating sleep apnea, sleep medicine clinics will likely provide the medication, says Dr. Javaheri. Weight loss has long been recommended for sleep apnea sufferers who are overweight or obese. After people lose at least 10% of their initial weight (that is, their weight at diagnosis), insurance companies usually pay for another sleep study to see if they've improved enough to stop using PAP, which people often find cumbersome and inconvenient. ""But I advise people using anti-obesity drugs to wait until they reach their goal weight before getting retested,"" says Dr. Javaheri. Other contributors to sleep apnea Finally, it's worth noting that obesity is just one of the factors that predispose people to sleep apnea, which also occurs in people who aren't overweight. ""Some people are born with anatomical differences that leave them prone to sleep apnea, such as a narrow airway, a thicker neck, a large tongue, enlarged tonsils, or a small, receding chin,"" says Dr. Javaheri. ""Smoking also increases the risk of sleep apnea significantly, and alcohol can cause sleep apnea or make it worse,"" she adds. Image: © vitapix/Getty Images",5,0.341172,0.11044599,False
https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20230831/what-to-know-about-ba-286-pirola,Q&A: What to Know About the New BA 2.86 COVID Variant,1,"Aug. 31, 2023 –The CDC and the World Health Organization have dubbed the BA 2.86 variant of COVID-19 as a variant to watch. So far, only 26 cases of “Pirola,” as the new variant is being called, have been identified: 10 in Denmark, four each in Sweden and the United States, three in South Africa, two in Portugal, and one each the United Kingdom, Israel, and Canada. BA 2.86 is a subvariant of Omicron, but according to reports from the CDC, the strain has many more mutations than the ones that came before it. With so many facts still unknown about this new variant, we asked experts what people need to be aware of as it continues to spread. What is unique about the BA 2.86 variant? “It is unique in that it has more than three mutations on the spike protein,” said Purvi Parikh, MD, an infectious disease expert at New York University’s Langone Health. The virus uses the spike proteins to enter our cells. This “may mean it will be more transmissible, cause more severe disease, and/or our vaccines and treatments may not work as well, as compared to other variants,” she said. What do we need to watch with BA 2.86 going forward? “We don’t know if this variant will be associated with a change in the disease severity. We currently see increased numbers of cases in general, even though we don’t yet see the BA.2.86 in our system,” said Heba Mostafa, PhD, director of the molecular virology laboratory at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. “It is important to monitor BA.2.86 (and other variants) and understand how its evolution impacts the number of cases and disease outcomes,” she said. “We should all be aware of the current increase in cases, though, and try to get tested and be treated as soon as possible, as antivirals should be effective against the circulating variants.” What should doctors know? Parikh said doctors should generally expect more COVID cases in their clinics and make sure to screen patients even if their symptoms are mild. “We have tools that can be used – antivirals like Paxlovid are still efficacious with current dominant strains such as EG.5,” she said. “And encourage your patients to get their boosters, mask, wash hands, and social distance.” How well can our vaccines fight BA 2.86? “Vaccine coverage for the BA.2.86 is an area of uncertainty right now,” said Mostafa. In its report, the CDC says scientists are still figuring out how well the updated COVID vaccine works. It's expected to be available in the fall, and for now, they believe the new shot will still make infections less severe, new variants and all. Prior vaccinations and infections have created antibodies in many people, and that will likely provide some protection, Mostafa said. “When we experienced the Omicron wave in December 2021, even though the variant was distant from what circulated before its emergence and was associated with a very large increase in the number of cases, vaccinations were still protective against severe disease.” What is the most important thing to keep track of when it comes to this variant? According to Parikh, “it’s most important to monitor how transmissible [BA 2.86] is, how severe it is, and if our current treatments and vaccines work.” Mostafa said how well the new variants escape existing antibody protection should also be studied and watched closely. What does this stage of the virus mutation tell us about where we are in the pandemic? The history of the coronavirus over the past few years shows that variants with many changes evolve and can spread very quickly, Mostafa said. “Now that the virus is endemic, it is essential to monitor, update vaccinations if necessary, diagnose, treat, and implement infection control measures when necessary.” With the limited data we have so far, experts seem to agree that while the the variant's makeup raises some red flags, it is too soon to jump to any conclusions about how easy it is to catch it and the ways it may change how the virus impacts those who contract it.",4,-0.27452782,0.26884294,False

Wegovy reduces heart failure symptoms, results in weight loss, and improves the ability to exercise in people with obesity with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), says the study funded by the company that makes Wegovy. In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the heart doesn't fill with blood properly when it's at rest between heartbeats. The study said 529 people with obesity with HFpEF were given a 2.4-milligram weekly dose of semaglutide, the drug that is sold as Wegovy, or a placebo. After a year, the people who took Wegovy had a 16.6-point improvement on a 100-point scale in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, whereas the people who took the placebo had an 8.7-point improvement. People who took Wegovy lost around 13.3% of their weight, compared to a 2.6% weight loss for people who took the placebo. In a 6-minute walk test, people who took the drug ended up being able to walk an average of 20 meters farther than people who took the placebo. “This is the largest treatment benefit we’ve ever seen for that endpoint in this patient population with any drug,” the heart doctor who led the trial, Mikhail Kosiborod, MD, told CNN. (Kosiborod is also the vice president for research at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, MO.) The study “heralds a possible fundamental paradigm shift in how cardiologists approach HFpEF in people with obesity,” he said in a news release from the drug's maker, Novo Nordisk. The study was funded by Novo Nordisk and was scheduled to be presented on Friday to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress in Amsterdam. In the news release, Novo Nordisk said 64 million people worldwide live with heart failure, with HFpEF making up 50% of all cases. About 80% of people with HFpEF are overweight or obese, the company said. On Aug. 8, the company announced that problems in the heart and blood vessels such as heart attacks and strokes were reduced about 20% among patients taking Wegovy.",8,0.16723607,0.22517593,False
https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/news/20230822/cm/fda-approves-rsv-vaccine-given-during-pregnancy,FDA Approves RSV Vaccine to Be Given During Pregnancy,1,"Aug. 22, 2023 – The long-awaited vaccine for RSV that can be given to pregnant people was approved by the FDA on Monday. The vaccine is called Abrysvo and can be given between weeks 32 and 36 of pregnancy, and will in turn protect infants from the respiratory virus from birth to 6 months of age. Most children are infected with the highly contagious virus as least once by the time they reach 2 years old. Very young children are at particular risk of severe complications like pneumonia or bronchitis, and in studies the new vaccine reduced that risk by up to 82%. Prior to the vaccine’s availability, up to 3% of infants infected with RSV needed to be hospitalized, according to the CDC. Treatments, the CDC says, may include “oxygen, IV fluids (if they aren’t eating and drinking), and mechanical ventilation (a machine to help with breathing). Most improve with this type of supportive care and are discharged in a few days.” RSV typically causes common cold symptoms, but the virus poses the risk of severe complications that could lead to death among young children and among older people. The CDC estimates 100 to 300 deaths of children under 5 years old and 6,000 to 10,000 deaths of people ages 65 and older are linked to RSV annually. Earlier this year, the FDA approved drugmaker Pfizer’s Abrysvo vaccine for use in older adults. This is also the first year that an antibody shot is available to be given after birth to prevent severe RSV in infants under 1 year old. “We are incredibly grateful to the clinical trial participants and study investigator teams around the world, as well as our Pfizer colleagues, for their commitment to making this vaccine available,” said Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Annaliesa Anderson, PhD, in a statement. “Today, a long-sought-after goal to deliver a maternal vaccine that will help protect infants six months of age or younger – when they are at greatest risk of possible serious consequences from RSV – has been achieved.” In its approval announcement, the FDA noted that a dangerous high blood pressure disorder that can occur during pregnancy called preeclampsia occurred in 1.8% of pregnant people who received Abrysvo, compared to 1.4% of those who received a placebo. The FDA also reported that low birth weight and jaundice in infants occurred at a higher rate among the pregnant Abrysvo recipients, compared to the placebo group. Studies also showed that pregnant people who got the vaccine experienced preterm birth at a rate of 5.7%, compared to a rate of 4.7% among those who got placebo. The FDA called the difference “a numerical imbalance,” but said in the approval announcement that a “causal relationship” could not be established, further noting that people already at high risk of preterm birth were excluded from clinical trials. Pfizer must conduct ongoing studies to monitor the risk of preeclampsia as well as preterm birth, the FDA said.",4,-0.2944281,0.27387226,False

Weekly hospitalizations for the virus are up 22%, and deaths are up 8%, according to CDC data for the week ending Aug. 12. While 12,613 new hospital admissions is relatively low, compared to this time last year, it is twice the number that hospitals reported at the end of June. The uptick of COVID activity has captured the attention of nearly half the nation, according to a recent Ipsos-Axios poll that showed 46% of people said they were concerned. Public health experts are eager to talk about autumn vaccines, particularly after last fall’s “tripledemic” that overwhelmed some hospitals amid a surge of flu, RSV, and COVID. The CDC recommends that most people get a flu shot in September or October. The agency is expected in the coming weeks to recommend whether the COVID and flu shots should be given together, The New York Times reported. Getting the vaccines in early fall is meant to ensure people are protected by the time the viruses are circulating more widely during the colder months. Last year, the flu surged earlier than normal, peaking in November. Experts told CNBC that people should consider getting the updated COVID vaccine as soon as it’s available, and for most people, it’s probably safe to wait until the end of September, when the new vaccine is expected to come out. “Some of us may get impacted, but I don’t expect us to see a huge wave in a short period of time between now and the next month or two,” Mark Mulligan, MD, director of the NYU Langone Vaccine Center, told CNBC.",4,-0.43855283,0.38632596,False

A new study of more than 1 million young men in Sweden has found connections between being in good physical shape and having a much lower risk of developing cancer. The research showed that men who had high cardiorespiratory fitness as young adults had a lower risk of getting nine types of cancer later in life These included cancers in the head, neck, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal system. The study was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Cardiorespiratory fitness is a measure of how well a person’s cardiovascular and respiratory systems supply oxygen to the muscles, NBC News wrote. Researchers followed the Swedish men an average of 33 years, beginning when they took a military fitness test using a stationary bike. They then compared rates of cancer among those men to the fitness levels recorded during the military tests. “They found that the people with high fitness levels had a 19% lower risk of head and neck cancer and a 20% lower risk of kidney cancer compared to the low-fitness group,” NBC reported. “The risk of lung cancer, meanwhile, was 42% lower for the fittest participants, though that was explained mainly by people’s smoking habits.” The odds against developing cancer continued to get better the higher participants’ fitness levels rose, said the lead author of the study, Aron Onerup, MD, of the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.

E-cigarettes are known to contain flavorings and chemical compounds that can damage the lungs, and an estimated 14% of U.S. youths use them. The resulting study included teams from Ohio State University, the University of Southern California, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “This study contributes to emerging evidence from human and toxicological studies that e-cigarettes cause respiratory symptoms that warrant consideration in regulation of e-cigarettes,” the researchers concluded.

Once per year in 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018, people who were part of the study completed a questionnaire that asked about e-cigarette and marijuana use during the past 30 days, and also asked about respiratory symptoms. The 2014 questionnaire was completed by nearly 2,100 people in 11th and 12th grades whose average age was 17 years old. Follow-up questionnaires were completed each year by between 1,600 and 1,500 of the people in the study. The questionnaire asked about the following symptoms: wheezing, signs of bronchitis, and shortness of breath. Wheezing was defined as reporting a wheezing or whistling in the chest in the previous 12 months. Bronchitis was defined as reporting a daily cough for 3 months straight, or a bronchitis diagnosis in the previous 12 months, or congestion or phlegm not linked to a cold. Shortness of breath was considered a condition if someone said they were troubled by shortness of breath when hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight hill. The researchers found that the symptoms were linked to e-cigarette use regardless of whether the people in the study also reported exposure to secondhand smoke or using other tobacco products or marijuana.

Hospitalizations reached an all-time low of about 6,300 per week in July. The CDC stopped tracking the number of people infected by the virus earlier this year, and now relies on hospitalization data to gauge the current impact of COVID-19. “We have to remember that we're still dealing with numbers that are far less than what we've seen for the pandemic,” John Brownstein, PhD, a Harvard Medical School professor of biomedical informatics, told ABC News.

When taking into account people who’ve never had COVID-19, an estimated 6% of the U.S. adult population had long COVID as of June 2023, down from 7.5% in June 2022. That’s according to a new CDC report analyzing data from the monthly online Household Pulse Survey. The survey tracks pandemic related health data, including mental health indicators and insurance coverage. Among people who have ever had COVID, the percentage of people reporting they have long COVID has fallen from 19% last summer to around 11% in January and that rate has held steady throughout 2023. The report authors said the reason for the stabilization could be a combination of factors, including fewer people being infected, less severe infections, better treatments such as antivirals, and protection by vaccines. As part of the survey, people are asked if they’ve had symptoms lasting at least 3 months that they didn’t have prior to COVID-19 infection. Symptoms could include tiredness or fatigue, difficulty thinking or concentrating, memory problems, difficulty breathing, joint or muscle pain, fast heartbeat, chest pain, dizziness on standing, menstrual changes, changes to taste or smell, or inability to exercise. More than 1 in 4 people who have long COVID said in the survey that the condition significantly limits their ability to carry out day-to-day activities, compared to the time before they had COVID-19. The rate of people reporting significant limitations has remained steady over time, the authors wrote. Last month, the federal government announced the formation of the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice to head up the government’s response to aiding the estimated 7.7 million to 23 million people in the U.S. who have long COVID.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-hidden-dangers-of-prediabetes,The hidden dangers of prediabetes,1,"Approximately 98 million Americans — more than one in three — have prediabetes, meaning the average amount of sugar (glucose) in their blood is high but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. Prediabetes occurs when the body has trouble using glucose for energy because cells become less responsive to insulin produced by the pancreas, a state known as insulin resistance. (Insulin facilitates the transport of glucose out of the blood and into the cells.) The unused glucose builds up in the bloodstream. The difference between diabetes and prediabetes is how high blood sugar levels get. ""If you have prediabetes, you obviously want to stop it from progressing to a diagnosis of diabetes,"" says Dr. Howard LeWine, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and editor in chief of Harvard Men's Health Watch. ""But if left alone, prediabetes can be dangerous on its own, as it increases your risk for other serious issues, like cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and fatty liver disease, even if you never get full diabetes.""

Research has found that people with prediabetes have a 15% greater risk for cardiovascular disease compared to people who don't have it. That's why it's so important to pay attention to other cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, blood pressure, and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. ""People with prediabetes must quit smoking and strive for lower levels of blood pressure and LDL cholesterol compared to those with normal blood sugar,"" says Dr. LeWine. The American Diabetes Association recommends people with prediabetes aim for a blood pressure of less than 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). However, Dr. LeWine suggests those with prediabetes aim for lower numbers, closer to 120/80 mmHg. ""But you and your doctor can decide the best goal for you,"" he says. Guidelines suggest people with prediabetes keep LDL levels less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Dr. LeWine says that the lower the LDL, the better, and recommends that people with prediabetes strive for levels of 70 mg/dL or less. ""By driving down your blood pressure and cholesterol, you are less likely to accumulate fatty plaque in your arteries, offsetting the excess risk of heart disease and stroke related to prediabetes,"" says Dr. LeWine. He recommends lifestyle changes as your primary approach to manage both blood pressure and cholesterol, adding medication if needed. Chronic kidney disease. Having prediabetes puts extra strain on the kidneys as they work to filter sugar and other waste products from the blood. Over time, this can damage the kidneys. In fact, studies have found that people with prediabetes are up to twice as likely to develop chronic kidney disease compared to people with normal blood sugar levels, and the risk increases the longer a person has prediabetes. Fatty liver disease. Prediabetes increases the risk for fatty liver disease — now formally known as metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease — in several ways. Elevated glucose levels can cause the body to convert excess glucose into fat, which gets stored in the liver. Insulin resistance can impair the liver's ability to process and break down fats, also leading to fat buildup. Testing for prediabetes Prediabetes usually has no symptoms, which is why an estimated 80% of people with the condition are unaware they have it. Therefore, overweight people are advised to get screened for prediabetes even if they're otherwise in good overall health. Most doctors order a blood test for hemoglobin A1c, which provides an average of blood sugar levels over the prior three months. According to the American Diabetes Association, prediabetes is diagnosed with an A1c from 5.7% to 6.4%. Lifestyle changes Lifestyle changes like weight loss, exercise, and diet are the best ways to manage blood sugar levels and prevent prediabetes from progressing to full diabetes. (Getting sufficient vitamin D also may help.) ""But making healthy lifestyle choices doesn't just help lower blood sugar levels. It also helps reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, and fatty liver,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""Even if you need medication to reach your blood pressure and LDL cholesterol goals, you will likely need lower doses if you focus on these three areas."" Weight loss. If you are overweight, losing 5% to 10% of your current body weight can improve blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Weight loss if needed is also a key strategy to both prevent and treat fatty liver disease, according to Dr. LeWine. Exercise. Federal guidelines suggest that everyone get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise weekly. ""Also add two or three hours of resistance exercises per week using free weights, machines, or body weight,"" says Dr. LeWine. The combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training is linked to better blood sugar control, reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, and a healthier liver. Diet. Reduce your intake of foods high in simple carbohydrates, such as bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, processed foods, and high-sugar beverages like fruit juice and soda. These carbs are quickly digested and can cause blood sugar levels to quickly rise and fall. Replace them with complex carbs, such as those in whole grains, beans, green peas, and lentils. Also, increase your intake of fiber-rich foods. ""Fiber helps with weight loss by slowing digestion, which helps you feel full and less hungry between meals,"" says Dr. LeWine. And by slowing the body's absorption of glucose, it smooths out spikes in blood sugar. Image: © Drazen Zigic/Getty Images",7,0.28247434,0.27814364,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/short-bursts-of-intense-exercise-may-benefit-stroke-survivors,Short bursts of intense exercise may benefit stroke survivors,1,"For stroke survivors, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) may boost fitness more than moderate-intensity workouts, a new study finds. The study included 82 people who'd had a stroke between six months and five years earlier. Researchers randomly assigned them to one of two exercise regimens. Both were done on recumbent step machines three days per week for 12 weeks. One group alternated between one minute of high-intensity exercise and one minute of low-intensity exercise for a total of 19 minutes. The other group did 20 to 30 minutes of steady, moderate-intensity exercise. After 12 weeks, the people in the first group improved their fitness twice as much as those in the second group, on average. While the findings support to benefits of HIIT, it's important to note that the study participants were generally healthy with good physical function. Anyone who's had a stroke should check with their doctor before starting any exercise regimen. The study was published Aug. 7, 2024, in the journal Stroke.

The findings, published Tuesday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, suggest that between 31% and 54% of all breast cancer diagnoses in women ages 70 years and older could be considered overdiagnoses, meaning that the cancer found during the screening would not have caused symptoms in a person’s lifetime. (For context, the average life expectancy of a woman in the U.S. is 79 years old, according to the CDC.) Overdiagnosis can be harmful because it carries the risks of complications from overtreatment, plus financial and emotional hardships and unnecessary use of limited resources. For the study, researchers analyzed data for 54,635 women ages 70 and older and compared the rate of breast cancer diagnosis and death among women who did and did not have mammograms during a 15-year follow-up period. The rate of breast cancer in the study among women ages 70 to 74 was 6% for women who were screened and 4% for women who were not screened. The researchers estimated that 31% of the cases were potentially overdiagnosed. Among women ages 75 to 84, breast cancer was found in 5% of women who were screened, compared to less than 3% of unscreened women. Their estimated overdiagnosis rate was 47%. Finally, 3% of women ages 85 and older who were screened had breast cancer detected, compared to 1% of women in the unscreened group. For the older group, the overdiagnosis rate was 54%. “While our study focused on overdiagnosis, it is important to acknowledge that overdiagnosis is just one of many considerations when deciding whether to continue screening,” researcher and Yale assistant professor of medicine Ilana Richman, MD, said in a statement. “A patient’s preferences and values, personal risk factors, and the overall balance of risks and benefits from screening are also important to take into account when making screening decisions.”",7,-0.04524679,0.18133779,False
https://www.webmd.com/obesity/news/20230808/cm/wegovy-may-help-prevent-heart-attacks-strokes,Weight Loss Drug Wegovy May Help Prevent Heart Attacks,1,"Aug. 8, 2023 – Problems in the heart and blood vessels such as heart attacks and strokes were reduced 20% among patients taking the popular but expensive weight loss drug Wegovy, according to a trial of more than 17,000 people with overweight or obesity who also had cardiovascular disease. The finding should fuel improved patient access to this drug, a weight loss agent that has historically been hindered by skepticism among U.S. health insurance companies who now may see broader health benefits than just the treatment of overweight and obesity. Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk released the study results this morning. The study found that people who received 2.4-milligram shots of semaglutide (whose brand name is Wegovy) showed a significant 20% reduction in heart-related deaths, heart attacks, or strokes. The company said semaglutide treatment also significantly reduced how often each of these issues occurred. The results also showed a level of safety and patient tolerance for weekly shots that were consistent with prior reports. The FDA approved semaglutide as Wegovy in 2021 for weight loss, and as Ozempic, with a maximum dose of 2.0 milligrams, for blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists. ‘A Good Result for Patients’ “The top line results … are exciting as preventing heart attacks and stroke with a drug that also lowers weight is very important for many patients, especially if the data also show, as I suspect they will, a meaningful improvement of quality of life for patients due to associated weight loss,” said Naveed Sattar, PhD, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow in Scotland who was not involved with the study. “This is a good result for patients,” said Sattar, who also noted that “we do not know to what extent the weight loss effects of semaglutide, as opposed to its other direct effects on blood vessels or the heart, account for the 20% reduction in cardiovascular events, and more data are needed to try to work this out.” Despite this lack of clarity over the role weight loss itself played in driving the results, the findings challenge a long-standing prejudice against the medical necessity and safety of weight loss drugs when used for the sole point of helping people lose weight. Changing How Obesity Is Regarded ""To date, there are no approved weight management medications proven to deliver effective weight management while also reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death,” Martin Holst Lange, MD, PhD, executive vice president for development at Novo Nordisk, said in the company’s news release. Several of the early medical options for aiding weight loss had substantial adverse effects, including increased major issues in the heart and blood vessels, a history that led to a lot of caution among doctors over the safety of anti-obesity agents and the wisdom of using medically aided weight loss to produce health benefits. This attitude also helped dampen health insurance coverage of weight loss treatments. For example, Medicare has a long-standing policy against reimbursing the cost of medications that are used for weight loss, and a 2003 federal law prohibited Part D plans from providing this coverage. According to the Novo Nordisk announcement, there will be a full report on results from the trial at a scientific meeting later this year.",8,0.0087106675,0.31082422,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/diverticulosis-and-diverticulitis-a-to-z,Diverticulosis and diverticulitis,1,"What are diverticulosis and diverticulitis? In diverticulosis, small pouches develop and bulge out through weak spots in the walls of the colon, typically in the part of the colon called the sigmoid colon on the left side of the abdomen. These small, balloon-like pouches are called diverticula. The condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States ages 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men. If the diverticula become inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can lead to serious complications such as abscess, perforation, intestinal blockage from internal scarring, or fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two organs. A rare but life-threatening complication called peritonitis can occur when diverticula rupture, leaking infection into the abdominal cavity. Symptoms of diverticulosis and diverticulitis Most people who have diverticulosis don't have any symptoms, but some have mild cramps, constipation, or bloating. Diverticulitis causes more severe symptoms, including any of the following, but particularly the first two: steady abdominal pain tenderness to pressure in the lower abdomen, especially on the left side fever nausea vomiting chills cramping change in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea) sharper pain with breathing or jarring movements such as walking. Lower intestinal bleeding can occur in people with diverticulosis. The loss of blood can cause weakness and dizziness. Diagnosing diverticulosis and diverticulitis The condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States aged 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men. However, unless you have had a colonoscopy, CT scan of your abdomen, or barium enema, you would not be aware they exist. On the other hand, diverticulitis almost always causes symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your medical history, bowel habits, and diet and will conduct a physical examination. Your doctor will press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. Based on the location of your symptoms and the location of abdominal pain and tenderness, your doctor may be able to make the diagnosis without further testing. If your doctor is unsure or concerned that you may have an abscess or other complication, he or she will likely order additional studies. These usually include blood tests for signs of infection and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. Lower intestinal bleeding is commonly caused by a broken blood vessel within a diverticula. But it is often very difficult to identify the exact bleeding site, even with colonoscopy. Expected duration of diverticulosis and diverticulitis Diverticula do not disappear unless the section of colon is removed surgically. Diverticulosis is a lifelong condition that can be managed, primarily with adjustments in diet. Symptoms of diverticulitis or bleeding from diverticulosis may subside within a few days after treatment, may continue, or may get worse in the case of severe illness or complications. Preventing diverticulosis and diverticulitis People whose diets contain large amounts of fiber are less likely to develop diverticular disease. The recommended daily fiber intake is at least 20 grams per day, but a healthier goal is 35 grams of fiber daily, preferably from fruits, vegetables, and grains. Your doctor also may recommend unprocessed bran or a fiber product. It is important to increase fiber intake gradually and to drink more water to increase the bulk of the bowel movements, which reduces pressure inside the bowel. Physical activity also may lower the risk of diverticulosis. Many doctors previously recommended that people with diverticulosis avoid eating nuts, popcorn, and foods with seeds. This restriction has not been proven to prevent diverticulitis. Treating diverticulosis and diverticulitis The only possible treatment for diverticulosis is to increase fiber in the diet. Fiber will not heal existing diverticula, but it may prevent more from forming. If you have symptoms of mild diverticulitis, your doctor may recommend a short period of observation without antibiotics. There are no specific dietary recommendations, but many doctors suggest a low-fiber diet until symptoms resolve. If the diagnosis is uncertain, an abdominal CT scan is usually ordered. Depending on the results, your doctor can then decide if treatment at home with oral antibiotics versus intravenous (IV) antibiotics, either at home or in the hospital. If fever and pain continues, you may be developing complicated diverticulitis, For example, an abscess can develop when a diverticulum becomes perforated (develops a hole). An abscess is a collection of pus. A surgeon then will help your doctor plan the next step: drainage or surgery. The choice depends on the extent of the problem and your overall health. Drainage means that the surgeon cleans out the pus. Surgery also may be required during the hospital stay to treat a particularly severe episode of diverticulitis. Emergency surgery is required if the abscess breaks open and causes peritonitis, the most serious potential complication of diverticulitis. Peritonitis requires surgical repair as well as intravenous antibiotics. For persistent or recurrent bleeding from diverticulosis, surgery may be the only option. The most common procedure, known as a colon resection, involves removing the part of the colon that contains the bleeding diverticula and reattaching the ends. When done during emergencies, a colon resection is often done as a two-stage process. First, a section of colon is removed, but because of infection, it is not safe to rejoin the ends. Instead, the surgeon creates a temporary hole, or stoma, in the abdomen and connects the colon to it, a procedure called a colostomy. A bag is attached to collect the stool. Later, a second operation is done to reattach the end of the colon, and remove the colostomy. After successful treatment for diverticulitis, your doctor normally will recommend a high-fiber diet. Later, you may need to have a procedure called a colonoscopy, which is an internal examination of the colon. In general, surgery is not recommended after only one or even two attacks without complications. However, it is usually recommended after a third episode occurs in the same location within the colon. Repeated episodes of diverticulitis can lead to internal scarring and narrowing of the colon, which also may require surgery to remove a piece of the colon. When to call a professional Call your doctor if abdominal pain in one spot lasts for longer than a few hours, especially if it becomes worse or is accompanied by fever. Prognosis With proper treatment and a high-fiber diet, the outlook for people with diverticulosis and uncomplicated diverticulitis is excellent. Most people with diverticulosis never have symptoms. People who have diverticulitis usually improve within two to four days after treatment begins. Over 85% of patients recover with bed rest and liquid diet, with or without antibiotics. Most never have a second episode of diverticulitis. The prognosis varies if complications develop and is particularly serious in the case of peritonitis. About 90% of people who have a colon resection do not have symptoms return after the surgery.

https://www.webmd.com/depression/postpartum-depression/news/20230807/cm/fda-approves-first-pill-for-postpartum-depression,FDA Approves First Pill for Postpartum Depression,1,"Aug. 7, 2023 – The FDA has approved the first oral drug for postpartum depression, a condition that affects an estimated one in seven mothers in the United States. The pill, zuranolone (brand name Zurzuvae), is a steroid that acts on certain receptors in the brain that regulate mood, arousal, behavior, and cognition, according to drugmaker Biogen. The recommended dose for Zurzuvae is 50 milligrams taken once daily for 14 days, in the evening with a fatty meal, according to the FDA. Postpartum depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated. Many mothers are hesitant to reveal their symptoms to family and doctors, fearing they'll be judged on their parenting. A 2017 study found that suicide accounted for roughly 5% of deaths before or after delivery among women in Canada, with most of those deaths occurring in the first 3 months in the year after giving birth. ""Postpartum depression is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition in which women experience sadness, guilt, worthlessness – even, in severe cases, thoughts of harming themselves or their child,” Tiffany R. Farchione, MD, director of the Division of Psychiatry at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement about the approval. It can also impact the maternal-infant bond, she said, and ""have consequences for the child's physical and emotional development"" as women cope with “extreme, and sometimes life-threatening, feelings."" The other approved therapy for postpartum depression is an IV drug. But the product requires long infusions in hospital settings and costs $34,000. FDA approval of Zurzuvae was based in part on data reported in a 2023 study in the American Journal of Psychiatry, which showed that the drug led to significantly improved depressive symptoms at 15 days, compared with a placebo group. Improvements were seen on day 3, the earliest assessment, and were sustained at all visits during the treatment and follow-up period (through day 42). Patients with anxiety who received the active drug showed improved symptoms, compared with patients who received a placebo. The most common side events reported in the trial were sleepiness, drowsiness, and headaches. Weight gain, sexual dysfunction, withdrawal symptoms, and increased suicidal behavior were not seen. The packaging for Zurzuvae will include a boxed warning noting that the drug can affect a user's ability to drive and perform other potentially hazardous activities, possibly without their knowledge of the impairment, the FDA said. As a result, the agency said that people who use Zurzuvae should not drive or operate heavy machinery for at least 12 hours after taking the pill.",8,-0.025201548,0.062586844,False

Called “Eris” among avid COVID trackers, the strain EG.5 now accounts for 17% of all U.S. COVID infections, according to the latest CDC estimates. That’s up from 12% the week prior. EG.5 has been rising worldwide, just weeks after the World Health Organization added the strain to its official monitoring list. In the United Kingdom, it now accounts for 1 in 10 COVID cases, The Independent reported. EG.5 is a descendant of the XBB strains that have dominated tracking lists in recent months. It has the same makeup as XBB.1.9.2 but carries an extra spike mutation, according to a summary published by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. The spike protein is the part of the virus that allows it to enter human cells. But there’s no indication so far that EG.5 is more contagious or severe than other recent variants, according to the CIDRAP summary and a recent podcast from the American Medical Association. The CDC said that current vaccines protect against the variant. U.S. hospitals saw a 12% increase in COVID admissions this past week, with 8,035 people being admitted due to the virus, up from an all-time low of 6,306 the week of June 24. In 17 states, the past-week increase in hospitalizations was 20% or greater. In Minnesota, the rate jumped by 50%, and in West Virginia, it jumped by 63%.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-does-it-mean-to-have-a-heart-attack,What does it mean to have a heart attack?,1,"Envision a heart attack, and you probably think of someone clutching his chest in agony, being rushed to the hospital, maybe even dying before he arrives. While this scenario does occur, the reality is often quite different. The reason is that heart attacks don't follow a linear path. Symptoms can be severe or subtle. The underlying process that causes a heart attack can differ. People may experience significant heart damage or little to none. ""Not all heart attacks strike in the same way, so diagnosing a heart attack requires the combination of a doctor's judgment, signs and symptoms, and test results,"" says Dr. Peter Libby, a cardiologist with the Heart and Vascular Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. What exactly is a heart attack? Most heart attacks occur when one of the coronary arteries (the vessels that supply blood to the heart) is unable to deliver enough blood to an area of the heart, or to deliver any at all. The most common underlying cause is formation of fatty plaque in one or more coronary arteries. There are two different mechanisms that cause this compromised blood flow. Doctors define them as type 1 and type 2 heart attacks. ""The distinction is important because the various types of heart attacks may be treated entirely differently,"" says Dr. Libby. Here is a look at each one. Type 1. With a type 1 heart attack, the cap over a plaque deposit ruptures and releases chemicals that trigger the formation of a blood clot. The clot blocks the artery, interfering with blood flow to part of the heart. Type 2. A type 2 heart attack does not involve a ruptured plaque. Instead, it happens when there is a mismatch between the amount of blood a portion of the heart muscle needs and the blood supply in the coronary artery feeding that area of the heart. The trigger for this type of heart attack can be a condition that puts extra stress on the heart, like the flu or pneumonia, an abnormal heart rhythm resulting in an accelerated heart rate, or a significant spike in blood pressure. Heart attack symptoms When a heart attack strikes, it can trigger a variety of symptoms. The most common is the stereotypical chest pain, usually described as crushing, squeezing, pressing, heavy, or occasionally stabbing or burning. Chest pain tends to be focused either in the center of the chest or just below the center of the rib cage, and it can spread to the arms, abdomen, neck, or lower jaw. It's also possible to have a heart attack and not know it. This is known as a silent heart attack. Symptoms lack the intensity of a classic heart attack. Instead, they can appear as chest discomfort that comes and goes; pain in one or both arms, neck, or jaw; sudden shortness of breath; breaking out in a cold sweat; or feeling nauseated or lightheaded. ""Because these symptoms can feel so mild and brief, they often get confused for regular discomforts like indigestion or heartburn,"" says Dr. Libby. Diagnosing a heart attack If you have any suspicion that you may be having a heart attack, don't hesitate: call 911. Once you arrive for medical care, the staff will do a quick review of your symptoms. With any concern for a heart attack, the doctor will immediately order an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a blood test to measure levels of troponin, a protein in heart muscle cells that spills into the bloodstream when any type of heart damage occurs. Doctors look for high troponin levels and certain changes in the electrical pattern on the ECG to make a diagnosis. Both tests are used because either one can be normal or show only minimal changes in the earliest stage of a heart attack. In fact, even with normal ECG and troponin results, emergency department doctors will begin immediate treatment if your symptoms are highly suggestive of a heart attack, especially if you have multiple heart risk factors. Initial treatment If your test results suggest you're having either a type 1 or type 2 heart attack, most often the doctor will give you several pills right away. These include aspirin; a high-dose statin, such as atorvastatin (Lipitor) or rosuvastatin (Crestor); and a beta blocker to slow your heart rate and reduce heart stress. You'll also get an intravenous infusion of heparin, a drug that discourages blood clotting. If you're diagnosed with a likely type 1 heart attack with full artery blockage, the doctor will probably send you to the cardiac catheterization lab for angioplasty and stent placement, a minimally invasive procedure to clear the artery and prop it open. This can restore blood flow to the injured heart muscle and minimize permanent damage. For a type 2 diagnosis, the goal is to restore the mismatch between blood supply and demand. In addition to the medications noted above, you'll need treatment for any medical problem that stressed the heart, such as an infection or an abnormally fast heart rhythm. Once your condition is stable, your doctor will design a strategy to help with recovery. ""The goal after the first heart attack is simple — to prevent a second one, and prevent further weakening of the heart muscle that can lead to heart failure,"" says Dr. Libby. This includes diet changes, exercising regularly, a personalized medication regimen, and perhaps referral for cardiac rehabilitation. Image: © champpixs/Getty Images",7,0.19397973,-0.04381922,False

RSV usually causes mild cold symptoms, but babies with their first infection are at a heightened risk for severe complications, such as pneumonia or swelling of the small airways in their lungs. An estimated 1% to 3% of children under the age of 12 months are hospitalized each year due to RSV. “As we head into respiratory virus season this fall, it’s important to use these new tools available to help prevent severe RSV illness,” said CDC Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH. “I encourage parents of infants to talk to their pediatricians about this new immunization and the importance of preventing severe RSV.” The move comes less than a month after the FDA approved the injection for babies and some high-risk toddlers. The CDC also recommends that high-risk children under the age of 19 months old get nirsevimab, which is marketed under the brand name Beyfortus. Beyfortus contains monoclonal antibodies, which the CDC describes as human-made proteins that mimic naturally occurring ones that help the immune system fight infections. The single shot is expected to last the duration of one RSV season, which typically occurs during the fall and winter months. Clinical trials showed that Beyfortus can reduce the risk of both hospitalizations and outpatient clinic visits for RSV in infants by about 80%. The shot will be free for about half of eligible U.S. children under the income-based Vaccines for Children program.",4,-0.23819125,0.21829267,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/chronic-loneliness-may-raise-stroke-risk,Chronic loneliness may raise stroke risk,1,"Older adults who are chronically lonely are significantly more likely to suffer a stroke, a new Harvard-led analysis suggests. Published online June 24, 2024, by eClinical Medicine, the study evaluated data from 2006 through 2018 from nearly 12,200 people ages 50 and up (average age 67, 61% women). None of the participants had suffered a stroke before the study began. All answered questions from a standard test gauging loneliness, and about 9,000 participants answered the questions a second time four years later. Based on those answers, the researchers placed participants into four categories of loneliness: consistently low; remitting (scoring high at baseline and low at follow-up); recent onset (scoring low at baseline and high at follow-up); and consistently high (scoring high at both baseline and follow-up). Over 12 years of follow-up, 601 strokes were recorded among participants who had been surveyed about loneliness at two time periods. People categorized as ""consistently high"" in loneliness had 56% higher odds of having a stroke compared to those in the ""consistently low"" group, even after researchers accounted for other psychological factors such as isolation and depression. However, participants in the ""remitting"" or ""recent onset"" loneliness groups did not show a pattern of higher stroke odds, suggesting that loneliness over the long term weighs more heavily on risk.

The two drugs, which are FDA-approved to treat type 2 diabetes, have become well known for their weight loss properties. Ozempic is made by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, and Mounjaro is made by Indiana-based Eli Lilly and Co. In the lawsuit, Jaclyn Bjorklund, 44, of Louisiana, asserts that she was “severely injured” after using Ozempic and Mounjaro and that the pharmaceutical companies failed to disclose the drugs’ risk of causing vomiting and diarrhea due to inflammation of the stomach lining, as well as the risk of stomach paralysis. (The medical term for stomach paralysis is gastroparesis.) The prescribing labels for Mounjaro and Ozempic state that each “delays gastric emptying” and warn of the risk of severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions. The prescribing labels for both drugs state that the most common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain. The Ozempic label does not mention gastroparesis, and the Mounjaro label states that the drug has not been studied in people with the condition and is therefore not recommended for people who have it. Bjorklund has not been diagnosed with gastroparesis, but her symptoms are “indicative of” the condition, her lawyer, Paul Pennock, told NBC News. Bjorklund used Ozempic for more than one year, and in July 2023 switched to Mounjaro, the lawsuit states. The document, posted on her law firm’s website, details that using the drugs resulted in “severe vomiting, stomach pain, gastrointestinal burning, being hospitalized for stomach issues on several occasions including visits to the emergency room, [and] teeth falling out due to excessive vomiting, requiring additional medications to alleviate her excessive vomiting, and throwing up whole food hours after eating.” Novo Nordisk spokesperson Natalia Salomao told NBC News that patient safety is “of utmost importance to Novo Nordisk,” and she also noted that gastroparesis is a known risk for people with diabetes. The FDA declined to comment on the case, and Eli Lilly did not immediately respond to a request for comment, NBC News reported.",8,0.03714892,0.15630458,False
https://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20230802/cm/updated-pfizer-covid-boosters-may-be-approved-by-end-of-august,Updated Pfizer COVID Boosters May Be Approved by End of August,1,"Aug. 2, 2023 -- Pfizer’s CEO says the FDA could approve the company’s updated COVID-19 booster shots by the end of the month. Albert Bourla made the statement Tuesday during an investor call, NBC News reported. Pfizer and Moderna asked the FDA in June to approve a new version of their boosters aimed at the XBB.1.5 subvariant, which started spreading widely in the winter. That was right after the FDA advised them to update the shots against XBB.1.5 before the fall booster efforts. The subvariant makes up 12.3% of recent new cases, the CDC says. A related strain, XBB.1.16, accounts for about 15%. FDA advisers have said there won’t be much difference in effectiveness against the strains because they are so similar. NBC said the FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Bourla’s statements. COVID hospitalizations are rising in the United States and are expected to continue to increase as cooler seasons approach. Hospitalizations are still lower than at any point during the pandemic, NBC reported. “We expect a new Covid wave to start in the U.S. this fall,” Bourla said. NBC said it isn’t known whether the boosters will be recommended for everyone in the country. The CDC will decide that, probably after the FDA authorizes the shots. The CDC says only 17% of Americans have opted to receive the booster shots so far.",4,-0.37667072,0.34856784,False

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/postpartum-depression-a-to-z,Postpartum depression,1,"What is postpartum depression? Postpartum refers to the period immediately after childbirth. When a woman has significant symptoms of depression during this period, she is said to have postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is not the same as the ""baby blues,"" a much more common condition that affects as many as 85% of new mothers. New moms often are emotionally sensitive and tend to cry easily. The baby blues is uncomfortable, but usually doesn't interfere with functioning as a mother, and it almost always goes away within a few weeks. Postpartum depression is a different matter. It affects up to 15% of new mothers. It may begin at any time in the first two to three months after giving birth. The mother feels sad or hopeless and sometimes guilty or worthless. She is unable to concentrate and unable to take any interest in anything, even the baby. In some cases, the mother may feel overwhelmed by the baby's needs and become intensely anxious. This may lead to persistent troubling thoughts or obsessions about the baby's well-being and compulsive repetitive actions, such as checking on the baby constantly or phoning the pediatrician repeatedly to ask questions. A woman is more likely to develop postpartum depression if she has: a previous history of depression, including depression during pregnancy a troubled marriage very few supportive family members or friends a recent stress difficulty caring for her new infant, especially if the child has serious medical problems. Teenage mothers, particularly if they come from families with few economic resources, have a particularly high risk of postpartum depression. In a rare form of this disorder, which occurs in one out of 1,000 births, the mother becomes psychotic — that is, she is unable to recognize reality. This condition is sometimes called postpartum psychosis. The mother may have hallucinations (altered perceptions, for example, hearing or smelling things that are not there) or delusions (false beliefs, such as the idea that her baby is possessed by the devil). This condition is most commonly associated with bipolar disorder. It is extremely dangerous for both the mother and the baby. And once it has happened it is highly likely to happen again if the mother has another child. Researchers have many reasons to assume that biological changes contribute to these mood problems. In the weeks after delivery, significant swings occur in sex hormone levels and in the regulation of stress hormones. In postpartum depression, perhaps as a response to the hormonal shifts, there may be subtle changes in the parts of the brain that process emotion and in the brain regions responsible for managing social interactions. These changes are important not just for the mother, but also for the new baby. Fewer than half of women with postpartum depression seek treatment for the problem. Some new mothers are unaware that postpartum depression is a real, treatable illness. Others believe that they are expected to feel happy after having a baby, and are so embarrassed about their symptoms that they do not ask for help. Symptoms of postpartum depression A woman with postpartum depression can have any of the following symptoms: feeling depressed, with tearfulness or crying spells feeling anxious, sometimes with obsessions and compulsions, often about the baby's welfare or about being able to carry out responsibilities as a mother feeling hopeless, worthless, or guilty feeling irritable or burdened losing interest or pleasure in all activities, including pleasure in being a mother changes in appetite (either overeating or not eating enough) sleep problems (for example, difficulty falling asleep or waking especially early) appearing slowed or agitated extreme exhaustion beyond the normal fatigue caused by caring for a newborn poor concentration or indecisiveness persistent thoughts about death, including suicide difficulty caring for the baby. These symptoms may develop in the first days after birth or as long as three months later. Diagnosing postpartum depression Primary care physicians, obstetrician/gynecologists and pediatricians may screen for postpartum depression by asking questions about the mother's quality of life. If you are a new mother, your doctor may ask about your emotions, your sleep and your appetite. You may be asked two questions for screening purposes: Have you felt down, depressed or hopeless? Do you feel little interest or pleasure in doing things? Another scale frequently used for screening is the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This is a 10-question scale that you can answer to give you and your doctor a measure of how depressed you might be. The scale with instructions is freely available online. If your primary care doctor or obstetrician/gynecologist believes you have symptoms of postpartum depression, and these symptoms have lasted for several weeks without improving, he or she may offer you an antidepressant or refer you to a psychiatrist or other mental health clinician for further evaluation. If your doctor is concerned that some of your symptoms may be caused by a medical illness, he or she may order blood tests to check for such conditions as anemia or an underactive thyroid. Expected duration of postpartum depression Usually, symptoms of postpartum depression last for a few weeks before the condition is diagnosed. Without treatment, symptoms can last for months. With treatment, many women feel better within weeks. Preventing postpartum depression If you are pregnant, you may be able to decrease your risk of postpartum depression by preparing yourself before the birth for the changes in lifestyle that motherhood will bring. Talk to other mothers and to your doctor in very practical, day-to-day terms about what it's like to care for an infant. Don't underestimate how much time you'll need with your newborn. Clear out as much time as you can during the period after birth. Also, don't hesitate to ask for help from your partner and others who care about you. Often, postpartum depression is difficult to combat without antidepressant treatment. If you have a history of depression, postpartum depression or bipolar disorder, you should talk with your doctor before the birth about the possibility of starting antidepressant medication soon after your baby is born. As a general rule, doctors try to minimize the amount of medication prescribed during pregnancy, but sometimes the risks of depression are more significant than the risk to the fetus. It is very important to discuss these trade-offs with your doctor. Treating postpartum depression As with other types of depression, a combination of psychotherapy and medication is most helpful. If a mother is exhibiting signs of psychosis, she needs immediate medical attention. A number of psychotherapy techniques have been proven helpful depending on the nature of the stress, the cause of the depression and personal preference. Every woman with postpartum depression needs support as well as education about depression. Various types of psychological therapy are available. Cognitive behavioral therapy is designed to examine and to help correct faulty, self-critical thought patterns. Psychodynamic, insight-oriented, or interpersonal psychotherapy can help a person sort out conflicts in important relationships or explore past events or issues that may have contributed to the symptoms. Couples therapy can help the mother and father figure out how to manage possible areas of disagreement or how best to organize child care and muster support. The antidepressants used for treating other types of depression are also effective for postpartum depression. Among others, the choices include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine. As with depression treatment in general, there are many medication options available. The treatment you choose will be influenced by such factors as potential side effects or past treatments. If you are breastfeeding, you are likely to have questions about the possibility of passing medication to your newborn. There are wide variations in the concentration of antidepressant in breast milk, depending on such things as the dose, your metabolism and when your baby feeds. Fortunately, most studies show little effect on the baby. Many mothers do choose to take antidepressants, but it is important to discuss the choices with your doctors to assess the risks and the benefits in your situation. You may begin to feel relief soon after starting treatment, but it usually takes at least two to six weeks before a clear improvement can be seen. You may need to try a few different approaches to psychotherapy or medication before you find the method most helpful to you. Keep trying until you get the help you need. When to call a professional If you are a new mother, contact your doctor if you develop any symptoms of postpartum depression, especially anxiety, feelings of intense sadness or hopelessness, or difficulty sleeping. Call your doctor immediately if you have thoughts about harming yourself or the baby, or if you feel that you can no longer cope with caring for your new baby. Prognosis Most mothers with postpartum depression recover completely. This is especially true if the illness is diagnosed and treated early. About 50% of women who recover from postpartum depression develop the illness again after future pregnancies. To decrease this risk, some doctors suggest that women with a history of postpartum depression should start antidepressants immediately after the baby is delivered, before the onset of depression symptoms.

https://www.webmd.com/alzheimers/news/20230801/cm/alzheimers-blood-test-becomes-available-to-consumers,Alzheimer’s Blood Test Becomes Available to Consumers,1,"Aug. 1, 2023 -- The first direct-to-consumer blood test for an early Alzheimer’s indicator is now available from Quest Diagnostics, revealing the risk for the disease years before symptoms appear. “The AD-Detect Test for Alzheimer's Disease on questhealth.com – the first blood test available for consumer purchase that helps assess potential risk of developing Alzheimer's disease based on a brain protein that contributes to the condition,” Quest said in a press release. The test costs $399 and uses the same technology as the test Quest provided for doctors last year. More than 6 million Americans have Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia. The number is predicted to hit 14 million by 2060. ""One of the advantages of having an amyloid test is that it lets you know, potentially years in advance of even being symptomatic, that you are at risk for Alzheimer's,"" said Michael Racke, MD, Quest's medical director of neurology to Reuters. The new test is for people over 18 who have mild memory loss or a family history of Alzheimer’s who want to know more about their own risk, Racke said. “Users must first pay for the test on Quest's website,” Reuters reported. “A telemedicine doctor will review the purchase to ensure it is medically necessary and place an order on their behalf. Patients can review their results online and have the option to speak to a physician at no extra cost.” Test takers would not qualify for further testing and potential new treatments if they have no symptoms, Reuters reported. Still, they could benefit from adopting certain behaviors to lower their risk or delay onset, such as diet and exercise, Racke said. They also could be eligible for trials in pre-symptomatic individuals.",7,0.03931304,0.22216375,False
https://healthimpactnews.com/2023/no-fooling-the-end-of-private-banking-starts-today-with-bank-enrollments-in-the-new-fednow-program/,"No Fooling: The End of ""Private Banking"" Starts Today with Bank Enrollments in the New FedNow Program",0,"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Note: While I am writing and publishing this article on March 31, 2023, most of you will be reading this on April 1, 2023, or later. The first week of April, 2023 marks the beginning of the enrollment and certification process for financial institutions to start participating in the Federal Reserve’s new FedNow “Instant Payments” services, which is scheduled to launch in July, 2023. (Source.) What is FedNow? The FedNow Service is a new instant payment infrastructure developed by the Federal Reserve that allows financial institutions of every size across the U.S. to provide safe and efficient instant payment services. Through financial institutions participating in the FedNow Service, businesses and individuals can send and receive instant payments in real time, around the clock, every day of the year. Financial institutions and their service providers can use the service to provide innovative instant payment services to customers, and recipients will have full access to funds immediately, allowing for greater financial flexibility when making time-sensitive payments. The FedNow Service will be deployed in phases, with the initial launch taking place July 2023. The video below follows a payment over the FedNow Service from start to finish, highlighting what financial institutions need to know about their role in the process. Source. While many in the alternative media (myself included) have linked the FedNow program to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), technically speaking, FedNow is NOT part of the development of CBDCs. Michelle Bateman, Director of Product Management, Payments at Finastra, is a member of FedNow’s pilot program, and she has stated that the project to develop CBDCs is completely separate from the FedNow Instant Payment service. And what about central bank digital currency (CBDC)? As has been widely reported, the Fed, like most other central banks in developed nations, is investigating the potential of a digital currency or digital dollar. Bateman noted that it is still being reviewed, and the two projects are completely separate. (Source.) The main difference is that once CBDCs are rolled out, consumers will have accounts with a Federal Reserve Bank, while the FedNow program does not. The FedNow program will be offering “Master Accounts” at the Federal Reserve for financial institutions only. However, as I have previously stated, rolling out CBDCs is a mammoth project, and cannot be done overnight. It would be foolish to believe that the FedNow program is not a stepping stone towards CBDCs. As you can see from the flow chart at the top of this article, with the implementation of the FedNow Instant Transfer program, all the data involving a financial transaction between two “End-Users” will flow through the Federal Reserve banks. So while they are advertising the FedNow program as a new system that will make payments and wire transfers much quicker and much more convenient, it is also a mass data collection system for the Fed to begin storing private bank information. Will this include all the personal details of account holders in private banks? Yes, apparently it does, based on “Operating Circular 1 (OC 1)“, a document on the Federal Reserve website under “Rules and Regulations Resources.” In that document, Section 6.0 deals with “FEDERAL RESERVE BANK RESPONSE PROGRAM FOR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO SENSITIVE CONSUMER INFORMATION OBTAINED IN THE COURSE OF PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES.” Section 6.1, “THE RESERVE BANK’S POSSESSION AND USE OF CONSUMER INFORMATION” states: The Reserve Banks do not hold accounts for individuals and do not provide Reserve Bank services to individuals. In the course of providing Financial Services to Depository Institutions and other authorized users of Reserve Bank services, the Reserve Banks obtain, store, and transmit information that includes Sensitive Consumer Information. Under the general supervision of the Board of Governors, the Reserve Banks have implemented information security measures designed to protect the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information obtained by them, to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, and to protect against unauthorized access to or use or reuse of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a Depository Institution’s customer. In other words, the Fed needs all of your “Sensitive” information to protect you from hackers. What is that “Sensitive Consumer Information”? Section 6.2 defines that: Sensitive Consumer Information means a consumer’s name, address or telephone number, in conjunction with the consumer’s social security number, driver’s license number, account number, credit or debit card number, or a personal identification number or password that would permit access to the consumer’s account, if the Reserve Bank or any other party that holds Sensitive Consumer Information as an agent of the Reserve Bank obtains such information in the course of providing Financial Services. (Source.) How convenient. So when they are ready to roll out CBDCs and establish an account for you, they will already know everything about you and be able to open an account for you at the Federal Reserve, even if you choose not to participate, if your bank was already participating in the FedNow program. This will save months, if not years, in trying to collect this data in order to implement CBDCs. It still remains to be seen how many financial institutions decide to participate in FedNow, since it is voluntary. The U.S. Treasury is already part of the program, so if someone wants their tax returns instantaneously, the FedNow service will be very attractive. Visa and Mastercard are also already part of FedNow. Banks will undoubtedly be pressured to participate for fear of being left out of the advantages of “Instant Payments.” This appears to be the beginning of the end for “private banking” in the U.S., no fooling. !function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src=""https://rumble.com/embedJS/u4""+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+""/?url=""+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+""&args=""+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, ""script"", ""Rumble""); 15 seconds 15 seconds Rumble(""play"", {""video"":""v2cuj13"",""div"":""rumble_v2cuj13""});",2,-0.11258574,-0.12116252,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/xylitol-what-to-know-about-this-popular-sugar-substitute,Xylitol: What to know about this popular sugar substitute,1,"The next time you pop a stick of sugar-free chewing gum in your mouth, take a look at the list of ingredients: Chances are you'll see an ingredient called xylitol. This sugar alcohol that tastes as sweet sugar but has fewer calories and negligible effects on blood sugar levels and insulin. For this reason, xylitol is used in many sugar-free gums, candies, baked goods, and diabetes-friendly foods. You'll also find xylitol in toothpaste, mouthwash, and other types of oral-care products. What is xylitol? A naturally occurring sugar alcohol found (in trace amounts) in many fruits and vegetables, xylitol can be processed from certain trees or from a plant fiber called xylan. It tastes about as sweet as regular sugar, but with only about half the calories per serving. Store-bought xylitol is a white, crystalline powder that can be used as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in recipes. What are the health benefits of xylitol? Eating too much sugar has been linked to a host of serious health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and tooth decay, so sugar-free sweeteners like xylitol are a compelling alternative. Xylitol is lower in calories and carbohydrates than sugar Xylitol is an excellent alternative to sugar for people who need to watch their weight, their blood sugar levels, or both. The sugar alcohol contains about 2.4 calories per gram (compared with 4 calories per gram in regular sugar). That makes it a good option for those who want to limit their simple carbohydrate intake, like people with diabetes or related metabolic syndromes. Xylitol doesn't cause blood sugar spikes When measured on the glycemic index (GI), a measure of how quickly food raises blood sugar, xylitol's GI score is 7, while regular sugar has a GI score of about 60. Xylitol's lower GI score correlates to more sustained energy without the spike and plunge associated with a sudden intake of regular sugar. Xylitol is good for your dental health Xylitol may help prevent tooth decay by reducing levels of bad bacteria in your mouth. According to a review published in the Journal of International Society of Preventive & Community Dentistry, consuming 5 to 10 grams per day of xylitol-containing products (like lozenges, candies, chewing gum, toothpaste, or mouth rinse) significantly prevented cavities and tooth decay compared with products that do not contain xylitol. So don't be surprised if your dentist recommends a xylitol-containing chewing gum at your next checkup. Xylitol in everyday products Many sugar-free products contain xylitol, including sugar-free candy, gum, baked goods, mints, cough syrup, chewable vitamins, some nut butters, ice cream, and oral hygiene products like toothpaste and mouthwash. You can also buy xylitol in bulk at most grocery stores or online retailers to use in cooking and baking. Possible side effects Most people can add xylitol to their diets without noticing any side effects. But some people may experience digestive problems like gas, bloating, and diarrhea if they consume too much too quickly. If you notice uncomfortable digestive problems, cut back your xylitol intake and reintroduce it slowly. And if you have other digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), you may want to avoid sugar alcohols entirely. Additionally, an observational study published in the June issue of European Heart Journal found that high levels of xylitol were associated with greater risk of heart attack or stroke in adults years later. While more research is needed (the study was small, and observational versus experimental), it's best to keep your consumption of xylitol in check. Keep xylitol away from your dog Xylitol is highly toxic to dogs, causing dangerously low blood sugar, liver failure, and even death. Keep sugar-free products out of your dog's reach, and always check the ingredient label on ice cream and peanut butter before offering it to your pup.",3,0.32099655,0.05417621,False

The study included more than 12,000 adults ages 50 and older who had never had a stroke. All completed a 20-item test designed to measure loneliness and social isolation. Four years later, the nearly 9,000 people remaining in the study repeated the test; researchers then tracked them for six to eight more years. People with high loneliness scores only during the initial assessment had a 25% higher risk of stroke than those not considered lonely. But those who were lonely during both assessments had a 56% higher risk of stroke than those with consistently low loneliness scores, even after researchers accounted for a range of other risk factors. In addition to classic risk factors for stroke, such as high blood pressure and smoking, these included measures of social isolation and symptoms of depression, which are related to but distinct from loneliness.

https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20230727/cm/is-olive-oil-the-ultimate-superfood,Olive Oil Is Having a Moment. Is It the Ultimate Superfood?,1,"July 27, 2023 – If you could take a single pill that lowered your risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, neurological diseases like dementia and Parkinson’s, and early death in general, would you? Bad news: There’s no medication that can do all those things. But if you believe the headlines, one food can: Extra-virgin olive oil. It may be the ultimate superfood. “There really is no other food that offers this range of benefits,” said Mary Flynn, PhD, an associate professor at Brown University who’s been researching olive oil for more than 20 years. “There’s no medicine.” Just this week, new research out of Harvard University showed that people who eat more than half a tablespoon a day had a 28% lower risk of dying from dementia than folks who rarely eat it. After decades of headline-making research, the olive oil bandwagon has plenty of passengers. On TikTok, videos about drinking daily shots of olive oil have received more than 1 billion views. Several companies now offer “medical-grade” olive oil that contains higher levels of beneficial compounds. Actors Brie Larson and Chloe Grace Moretz use it to clean their faces, and Jennifer Lopez credits olive oil, not Botox, for her age-defying glow. Earlier this year, Starbucks introduced a line of coffee drinks made with extra-virgin olive oil. So how much is hype, and how much is backed up by research? Olive Oil and Health: The Big Picture For 6 decades, since the initial Seven Countries Study called attention to the Mediterranean Diet and its generous use of olive oil, researchers have been examining the health benefits of that golden fluid. And there are many. A 2022 analysis of previous studies, covering hundreds of thousands of people, found that each additional 5 grams you eat daily – that’s a little over a teaspoon – can lower your risk of dying overall by 4%. Extra-virgin olive oil is rich with polyphenols, a powerful group of antioxidants that fight inflammation. “Inflammation is the base of any disease,” said Kristin Kirkpatrick, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the Cleveland Clinic. “So if we look at inflammation as the base, then we can see that olive oil can help with the reduction of a lot of different conditions.” Researchers haven’t been able to pinpoint how, exactly, those polyphenols work, but they’ve consistently found similar effects across a wide variety of areas. “As a scientist, I'm curious: What is the mechanism? How does this thing work?” said Tassos Kyriakides, PhD, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health and one of the organizers of Yale’s annual Symposium on Olive Oil & Health. “But big picture, does it really matter if it's giving somebody a healthy outcome at the end? Does somebody who lives in a village in Sicily care about how this thing helps me be 95 and as sharp as ever?” Olive Oil and Your Heart The Seven Countries Study looked specifically at cardiovascular disease. Sixty-five years later, the notion that olive oil helps your heart is accepted as fact, because it’s high in heart-healthy monounsaturated fat and polyphenols. The European Food Safety Authority permits extra-virgin olive oils with enough of a certain polyphenol to make heart-related health claims on their labels. “That’s a big, big statement, based on a lot of accumulated evidence,” Kyriakides says. Kristin Koval, a 53-year-old writer from Boulder, CO, started eating olive oil daily 3 or 4 years ago. Her family has a history of heart problems related to genetically low HDL, the “good” cholesterol. “There really isn’t a good drug to bring the level up, and I don’t love to take medicine if I don’t have to,” she said. “I read about some foods that help. I couldn’t eat salmon or sardines daily, but olive oil you can incorporate into your everyday life, so I did.” Since she started, her HDL numbers have gone up. For the last 2 years, they’ve been in the normal range. “My doctor is happy, and so am I.” Olive Oil and Your Brain That new Harvard study on olive oil and dementia-related deaths builds on previous findings. Anne-Julie Tessier, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, presented the findings at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition. She said they started the study because there’s so much evidence that the Mediterranean Diet helps with cognitive function, cognitive decline, and dementia risk. “Olive oil is a significant proportion of the calories in the diet, so it made it very interesting to look at fatal dementia specifically,” she said. Replacing just one teaspoon of margarine or mayonnaise with the same amount of olive oil each day lowered the risk by 8%-14%. Kyriakides, too, has researched olive oil’s effects on the brain. One small study produced promising results: Daily consumption significantly improved dementia symptoms in people with mild cognitive impairment. Olive Oil and Cancer, Diabetes, and More While olive oil’s effects on cardiovascular and brain health have received the most attention, researchers have found numerous other benefits: How to Choose and Use Olive Oil for Your Health To get these health benefits, you must use extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO). It comes from the first pressing of the fruit, made with no heat or chemical extractions – consider it the fresh-squeezed juice of the olive. Because it’s so fresh, it contains the highest levels of polyphenols. There’s no universally agreed-upon dosage, but most clinical trials aim to replicate the amount in the average Mediterranean diet: two to four tablespoons a day. That adds up to quite a bit. In Greece, for example, the average person consumes two liters a month! Here in the U.S., we average a paltry one liter each per year. “If we all had two tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil a day, we’d be at a liter a month,” says Kyriakides. “That’s a magnitude of difference.” And you may see some benefits take effect in as little as 3 weeks, according to Flynn.

The research matches other evidence advising that healthy older adults without a history of heart conditions or warning signs of stroke should not take low-dose aspirin. The findings also support the recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force that low-dose aspirin should not be prescribed for preventing a first heart attack or stroke in healthy older adults, The New York Times reported. “We can be very emphatic that healthy people who are not on aspirin and do not have multiple risk factors should not be starting it now,” said Randall Stafford, MD, of Stanford University, who was not involved in the study, in The Times. It’s not as clear for others, he said. “The longer you’ve been on aspirin and the more risk factors you have for heart attacks and strokes, the murkier it gets,” he said. Some cardiac and stroke experts say daily aspirin should remain part of the regimen for people who have had a heart attack or stroke. The JAMA report was based on data from a randomized control trial of 19,000 people from Australia and America. Participants were over the age of 70 and did not have heart disease. The data covered an average of almost 4.7 years and revealed that aspirin lowered the rate of ischemic stroke but not significantly. An ischemic stroke happens when a clot forms in a blood vessel that sends blood to the brain. There was also a 38% higher rate of brain bleeds for people who took aspirin daily compared to those who took a placebo. The Times wrote, “In the past, some doctors regarded aspirin as something of a wonder drug, capable of protecting healthy patients against a future heart attack or stroke. But recent studies have shown that the powerful drug has limited protective power among people who have not yet had such an event, and it comes with dangerous side effects.”",7,0.15288232,0.27375913,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/body-roundness-may-beat-body-mass-for-identifying-risky-fat,Body roundness may beat body mass for identifying risky fat,1,"Body roundness index (BRI) might be a more accurate measurement than body mass index (BMI) for predicting weight-related health risks, according to a study published online June 5, 2024, by JAMA Network Open. BMI has long been the standard to classify a person's body weight as too low, normal, overweight, or obese. While BMI often reflects a person's body fat amount, it doesn't account for fat distribution or the amount of muscle mass. (Muscle weighs more than fat, and BMI can overestimate body fat in people with a lot of muscle.) BRI addresses these shortcomings by focusing on a person's height, waist size, and hip size. By taking weight out of the equation, BRI provides a better indicator of how much belly fat (visceral fat) surrounds the organs inside the abdomen. High amounts of belly fat are linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. In the study, researchers recorded the BRIs of about 33,000 people and followed them for 20 years. They found that a higher BRI was associated with an increased risk of death during that period compared with a lower BRI. For example, people with a BRI of 6.9 or higher had an almost 50% greater risk of early death compared with individuals with a BRI of 4.5 to 5.5. On the other end of the spectrum, individuals ages 65 and older who had very low BRIs (less than 3.4) also had a higher risk of early death. That's not surprising, because a too-low number often means the person is malnourished or has a significant medical condition causing weight loss.

That changed in 2019, when evidence about aspirin's limited benefits and increased bleeding risks in low-risk adults prompted new recommendations against such therapy. But many people haven't gotten the message, according to a research letter published online June 24, 2024, by Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers analyzed data from national health surveys of 186,000 people ages 40 or older, collected between 2012 and 2019 and again in 2021. While aspirin use declined after 2019, nearly a third of healthy adults ages 60 or older reported that they were still taking aspirin in 2021, and about 1 in 20 were using it without medical advice. If you're taking a daily low-dose aspirin — 81 milligrams (mg) — but you're at low risk for heart disease, stroke, or bleeding risks (say, from a peptic ulcer), talk to your doctor as soon as possible about whether you should continue taking it. Aspirin therapy remains a mainstay for people with a high risk of having a heart attack. Image: © Julia Klueva/Getty Images",7,0.10956379,0.26761472,False

""U.S. COVID-19 rates are still near historic lows after 7 months of steady declines,” CDC spokesperson Kathleen Conley said in a statement. “Early indicators of COVID-19 activity (emergency department visits, test positivity and wastewater levels) preceded an increase in hospitalizations seen this past week.” She said most of the country is at low hospital admission levels, not reaching the point at which the CDC urges extra precautions to slow the spread of the virus. It was a different story at this time last year. CBS News said, “July 2022 peaked at more than 44,000 weekly hospitalizations and 5% of emergency room visits with COVID-19 during a summer surge that strained many hospitals.” Conley pointed out that the country has seen increases in COVID-19 over the last three summers, so the current increases are not surprising.

https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/news/20230725/cm/intermittent-fasting-vs-calorie-counting-for-type-2-diabetes,Intermittent Fasting vs. Calorie Counting for Type 2 Diabetes,1,"July 25, 2023 – Losing weight is an important part of type 2 diabetes care – it could help lower blood sugar and reduce the need for some diabetes drugs. To shed the extra pounds, new research shared on Monday shows that intermittent fasting is an effective way to cut calories for people with type 2 diabetes. Intermittent fasting refers to eating only within a limited time window. In this study, featured at the annual conference of the American Society of Nutrition, patients assigned to that group could only eat between noon and 8 p.m. each day – a practice also called time-restricted eating – with a 1-hour grace period. The people in the calorie restriction group were asked to cut their calories by 25%, and a control group continued eating as normal. In total, the results included 57 overweight and obese people with type 2 diabetes who were randomly assigned to each of these groups. After 6 months, those in the intermittent fasting group lost about 4.3% of their body weight – equal to about 10 pounds of weight loss for a person weighing 230 pounds – and people in the calorie restriction group lost about 2.5% of their body weight. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two groups for weight loss, meaning one method of dieting isn’t necessarily better than the other. ""Let's not think of this as an approach that's better than calorie restriction,"" said William Yancy, MD, an internist and weight management specialist at Duke Lifestyle and Weight Management Center in Durham, NC. ""It's an alternative approach to calorie restriction."" The reason for the small percentage difference could be because calorie restriction diets tend to be harder to follow, and people have probably tried to cut calories before, according to study author Vasiliki Pavlou, a registered dietitian nutritionist in the Chicago area. ""People that have type 2 diabetes, they've already been to the doctor, they've already been told to count calories,"" said Pavlou, a doctoral student at the University of Illinois Chicago. There were many weeks, she said, when people in the study did not track their eating as required, and “we'd have to encourage them to start tracking again."" Sticking to the diet seemed to be more of a problem for the calorie restriction group – about a third didn’t stay within 200 calories of the goal, according to Pavlou. The intermittent fasting group reported that they stuck to the diet 6 out of the 7 days of the week. That meant the fasting group cut about 100 calories more per day than the calorie restriction group, which was reflected in their weight loss, Pavlou said. A1c levels – the measure of a person’s average blood sugar level over time – dropped by about 1% in both the intermittent fasting and calorie restriction groups. Up to 90% of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese, and losing weight is an important part of care. Studies have shown that even a 5% reduction in body weight can reduce blood sugar, and type 2 diabetes remission can occur after a 10% loss in body weight – but it depends on the person. ""It depends on the individual, their metabolic situation, how long they've had diabetes, what kind of approach they're following, maybe what medicines they're taking,"" Yancy said. ""There's a lot of different factors involved in remission."" Intermittent fasting could work well for the right person – but it depends on a person's eating habits and whether their meals usually fall outside the time-restricted window, or it could depend on how well a person follows rules, according to Yancy. ""Some people might not eat much after 8 o'clock, and some people might skip breakfast,"" he said. ""And if that's the case, then it's not going to make a big impact on their weight, probably."" The people in the study generally had advanced type 2 diabetes and were taking a mix of medications, so the results might not apply to people with a more recent type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Considering the effect of the diet on medications is also important. Not eating can be dangerous for patients taking short-acting insulin or sulfonylureas, Yancy said. These findings show intermittent fasting is another option for patients with type 2 diabetes who are trying to lose weight. ""If you've tried calorie counting, that's not working for you or if you're kind of burnt out, this is something else that you could try,"" he said.",3,0.32857123,0.11959316,False

The Saudis almost single-handedly crashed the U.S. Stock Market (and stock markets around the world) this morning when they announced that they were not going to put any more money into the failed Swiss bank. Problems at Switzerland’s second-biggest lender are causing stocks around the world to falter—and reigniting fears for the banking sector. On Wednesday, Credit Suisse ‘s top shareholder said in a Bloomberg interview that it wouldn’t invest additional money in the Swiss bank. Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy told the media outlet that taking a stake of more than 10% in Credit Suisse would trigger regulatory complications. That pushed shares of Credit Suisse to a new low on Wednesday. The stock closed down 24% in Zurich and its American depositary receipts (CS) were down 25% in U.S. trading. (Full article.) While the U.S. Stock Market did end lower today, it most assuredly would have been a blood bath if Swiss Regulators had not stepped in to ensure the world that it was going to bail out their troubled bank. This was after European markets had closed, however, and European banks’ stock values lost 7% at end of trading in Europe today. Swiss National Bank Issues Statement: “Will Provide Liquidity If Necessary” Summary: The Swiss National Bank and the country’s regulator said Credit Suisse meets the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks and that the SNB will provide the bank with liquidity if necessary, in a statement. (Full article.) Since a simple statement made by Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy almost crashed the entire world’s financial system today, what does that tell you about the frailty of the current banking system? Others are now waking up to the fact that this financial crash is related to Big Tech failing, something I have been saying since last year. Graham Summers of PHOENIX CAPITAL RESEARCH wrote an analysis that was published on ZeroHedge News today. Tech is finished. Ever since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the Fed has been primarily in an accommodative framework. For most of 2008-2023, interest rates were at ZERO or 0.25%. The below chart shows where rates were from 2007 until today. You’ll see that with the exception of 2017 to mid-2019, rates were effectively at ZERO for most of this time. The Fed didn’t just keep rates at zero either. It printed money and used that money to buy assets/ debt securities to prop up the system anytime things started to break down. We’re not talking about a little money printing either. Between 2007 and 2023, the Fed printed over $8 TRILLION. This suppression of interest rates… combined with the money printing and easy access to credit had one primary beneficiary… The Tech sector. Tech, particularly high beta garbage Tech (apps, texting companies, social media, etc), NEEDs low interest rates to even exist because these companies require a TON of capital/ debt to reach profitability (assuming they even do that, which 95% DON’T). And remember, we’re not talking about the Fed creating an artificial environment for a few months. They’ve been doing it for most of 15 years. And every time the system began to break down, the Fed would do even MORE extreme versions of these policies… which in turn made the environment even more favorable to the Tech industry. How bad did this get? Talk to anyone who wants to become an entrepreneur today and he or she will say they want to found a Tech company. NO ONE says they want to go into energy, or materials, or manufacturing. It’s all about apps, social media, search engines, etc. Think of it this way, as of 2021… The largest automaker in the stock market was a tech stock (Tesla). The largest commerce company in the stock market was a tech stock (Amazon). The largest consumer discretionary company in the stock market was a tech stock (Apple). And so on… The Tech sector was the largest sector by weighting in the S&P 500 by almost a factor of two. In fact, Tech was larger than both the 2nd and the 3rd heaviest weighted sectors COMBINED! The below chart shows the performance of the Tech Sector relative to the broader market (S&P 500 since 1999). As you can see, Tech outperformed the broader market non-stop from 2008 onward. By the time 2022 rolled around, it was at levels that EXCEEDED those established by the Tech Bubble of 2000! All of this is due to the Fed. Most of the people who work in Tech are not geniuses, nor are they the best entrepreneurs on the planet. They were simply the beneficiaries of an artificial environment created by the Fed. In the simplest of terms, Tech is to the bubble today, what Banks were to the bubble in 2007: the sector that benefited most, generated the largest profits, and consumed the largest percentage of talent/ aspirations. That period is now OVER. And it’s not coming back. So what does this mean for the markets? Well, if the largest sector in the market is in a spectacular bubble the likes of which won’t return for at least another decade… what do you think? The Silicon Valley Bank bailout is the Bear Stearns moment for this bubble. Lehman is coming… as is AIG… and this entire mess won’t end until the stock market hits levels most cannot even imagine today. Indeed, from a BIG PICTURE perspective my proprietary Crash Trigger is now on the first confirmed “Sell” signal since 2008. This signal has only registered THREE times in the last 25 years: in 2000, 2008 and today. Read the full article on ZeroHedge News. And here are just a few more examples seen today of the actual technology (not just its stock value) failing. In Vancouver, Canada, a man who owned a Tesla opened the door of a Model 3 parked in a supermarket lot with his smartphone app. He got into the car and drove to a nearby school to pick up his kids. However, he later realized he had accidentally taken someone else’s Model 3. According to Rajesh Randev’s statement to Global News, he noticed a stranger’s Tesla parked beside his own car, which happened to be the same model and color. He then used his Tesla smartphone app to unlock the vehicle and drove away. During his drive to pick up his kids from school, Randev began to realize that something was amiss. “I was able to get access, a hold of that person’s car but while I start driving it, I realized there was a crack on the windshield,” he said. So he called his wife to ask why and she did not know. He also noticed his charger was not where he usually had it. Then this happened: “After, five, 10 minutes I got a text on my phone that said ‘Rajesh are you driving Tesla?'” He said the person who messaged him told him he was driving the wrong Tesla. It was only after he parked that Randev noticed the wheels were different from his car. He then called the person who messaged him and they realized he had taken the other person’s Tesla. Surprisingly he was able to get back into the and met up with the owner. Randev said he did not know how it happened. “We were both laughing and I called the police as well,” he added. “The police said they have my statement but they cannot give me a file number because nothing happened but if something does happen to let them know and they will investigate.” “Apparently, I found some glitch,” Randev said.

Expert calls decision “damning,” says it’s time for regulators to get involved. An entire team responsible for making sure that Microsoft’s AI products are shipped with safeguards to mitigate social harms was cut during the company’s most recently layoff of 10,000 employees, Platformer reported. Former employees said that the ethics and society team was a critical part of Microsoft’s strategy to reduce risks associated with using OpenAI technology in Microsoft products. Before it was killed off, the team developed an entire “responsible innovation toolkit” to help Microsoft engineers forecast what harms could be caused by AI—and then to diminish those harms. Platformer’s report came just before OpenAI released possibly its most powerful AI model yet, GPT-4, which is already helping to power Bing search, Reuters reported. Emily Bender, a University of Washington expert on computational linguistics and ethical issues in natural-language processing, joined other critics tweeting to denounce Microsoft’s decision to dissolve the ethics and society team. Bender told Ars that, as an outsider, she thinks Microsoft’s decision was “short-sighted.” She added, “Given how difficult and important this work is, any significant cuts to the people doing the work is damning.” (Full article.)

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/take-control-of-your-knee-pain,Take control of your knee pain,1,"If you've got sore knees, exercise might seem like the hardest thing you can do — but it's also one of the best. ""Exercise is one of the most important things you can do for knee pain,"" says Dr. Lauren Elson, an instructor in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School. The right combination of strengthening and stretching exercises can relieve pain by helping to improve the way the joint moves and functions. ""The knee is often an innocent bystander between the hip and the foot. Knee pain is often caused by problems occurring above or below,"" says Dr. Elson. For example, weak hip muscles may cause more strain on the knee, intensifying your pain. Strengthening the muscles around the hip joint can help relieve it, says Dr. Elson. In addition, knee pain is sometimes caused or aggravated by tight muscles around the knee, a problem that is often successfully addressed by stretching. If the muscles aren't flexible, the knee joint sometimes won't move properly, says Dr. Elson. What conditions can exercise help? Knee exercises and stretches can help relieve knee pain caused by many conditions, including these three that commonly affect older women: Patellofemoral pain. This condition typically causes a dull, aching pain in the front of the knee that's made worse by daily activities, such as squatting, going up or down stairs, or standing up after sitting for a long period of time. The pain is caused by irritation of the cartilage underneath the kneecap when it does not glide or sit properly. Exercise can help to eliminate problems that lead to this irritation. Stretches can loosen tight muscles on the side of the knee that may be pulling the kneecap out of its groove as it moves. Strengthening weak hip muscles or stretching tight muscles in the front or back of the legs can also reduce discomfort. Chronic degenerative meniscal tears. When one or both pads of cartilage that cushion each of your knee joints deteriorates or tears, you may feel pain and a sticking or locking sensation. While surgery is sometimes necessary, doctors usually first recommend physical therapy to help build up the muscles around the knee to take the pressure off the joint and reduce discomfort. Osteoarthritis. If you're over age 50 and you have stiffness, pain, or swelling, it may be osteoarthritis. Years of wear and tear can break down the cartilage in the knees, leading to chronic joint inflammation. A past injury may also lead to arthritis. While nothing can reverse these physical changes, you can reduce pain by building up the muscles around the knee as well as in the pelvis and core. Strong muscles act like scaffolding, taking some of the pressure off the joints. Stretching to increase flexibility can help the joint function properly. Know when to see your doctor While many conditions that cause knee pain can be helped by exercise, in some instances it may not be appropriate, says Dr. Lauren Elson, an instructor in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School. You should stop exercising and see a doctor if you have any of the following symptoms: fever pain that is not improving pain that intensifies with activity pain that wakes you up in the middle of the night. Image: © ipopba/Getty Images Exercises to try To ease knee pain, you'll want to perform exercises that work a number of different muscles, from the hip abductors to the hamstrings and quadriceps, says Dr. Elson. Two to add to your routine are the side-leg raise, and the single-leg lift. Do this workout at least two days a week to start and ideally work up to every other day. How many exercises you do in each session is your choice. But keep in mind that rushing through exercises can be counterproductive. ""It's more important to have good form than it is to have volume,"" says Dr. Elson. Start slowly with fewer repetitions to ensure you get your form right. Then add more as it becomes easier. Side-leg raise Starting position: Lie on your right side, with your legs straight. Bend your right forearm upward and rest your head on your hand. Movement: Keep your legs straight and slowly lift your left leg up toward the ceiling. Pause, then slowly return to the starting position. Finish all repetitions, then repeat on the left side. Tips and techniques: Throughout the movement, keep your hips straight and still as if you were lying with your back against a wall. Contract your abdominal muscles and keep your pelvis still (no rocking) throughout. Lift your leg up as high as possible without letting your hip move and while maintaining good form. Make it easier: Lift your top leg a shorter distance, or lean your back against a wall for support. Make it harder: Tie resistance tubing around your upper thighs, or increase the number of repetitions. Single-leg lift Starting position: Lie on your back with your legs straight. Extend one leg, foot slightly flexed. Rest your hands at your sides on the floor. Movement: Tighten your thigh muscles and slowly lift the leg in the air until your knees are aligned. Pause, then slowly lower your leg to rest on the floor. Finish all repetitions, then repeat with the other leg. Tips and techniques: Keep your abdominal muscles contracted. Keep your hips on the floor as you lift one leg. Exhale as you lift. Make it easier: Lift your leg a shorter distance. Make it harder: At a slow, controlled pace, try tracing the letter T with your leg in the air. Lift up one leg four inches, move the leg four inches to the left, return to center, move the leg four inches to the right, return to center, then lower your leg to the floor. Finish all repetitions, then repeat with the other leg. Stretching You should also incorporate daily stretching into your routine. Try using a foam roller to work out the kinks in your muscles. The roller targets tight, rigid, and painful areas in both the muscles and the myofascial tissue (a layer of connective tissue around the muscles). This process, called myofascial release, which can also be performed through a hands-on massage, is designed to relax this tissue to reduce pain. It does this by releasing tension in muscles that are pulling abnormally on the knee joint, says Dr. Elson. Below are two stretches to try. Ideally, you should aim to do three or four repetitions of each, holding for 10 to 30 seconds each time. Hamstring stretch Starting position: Lie on your back with your legs straight and your arms by your side. Movement: Grasp your right leg with both hands behind the thigh. Extend your leg to lift your right foot toward the ceiling, foot flexed. Straighten the leg as much as possible without locking the knee to feel a stretch along the back of the right thigh. Hold. Return to the starting position and repeat with the left leg. Tips and techniques: Stretch the leg extended toward the ceiling to the point of mild tension without any pressure behind the knee or any pain. Relax your shoulders down and back into the floor. Make it easier: Don't lift your leg as high, or use a strap instead of your hands to support your leg. Make it harder: Pull your leg closer to your chest. Quadriceps stretch Starting position: Stand on the floor with your feet spaced shoulder-width apart. Movement: Bend your right knee and bring the heel toward your right buttock. Reach back with your right hand and take hold of your foot. Hold the stretch, then slowly lower your foot to the floor. Repeat the stretch with your left leg. Tips and techniques: Stand straight. Keep your bent knee aligned with the hip, not pointing out to the side. Make it easier: Lie on your stomach to do the same stretch. Place a yoga strap around your foot and hold on to both ends as you get into the starting position. Then use the strap to assist with the stretch. Make it harder: Doing the stretch on your stomach, lift your knee off the floor slightly, without pulling your foot, to increase the stretch.

Researchers analyzed self-reported data from more than a million people surveyed during 2011 to 2013 and again in 2020 to 2022. In the decade between the surveys, stroke rates remained the same in people ages 65 or older but increased almost 16% among people 45 to 64 years old, and almost 15% among people ages 18 to 44. Scientists say the increase might be due to higher rates of obesity, high blood pressure, and opioid use. It's a good reminder to follow a healthy lifestyle no matter how old you are — eating a healthy diet, exercising, managing stress, and getting enough sleep — and to learn to recognize the signs of a stroke: weakness or numbness on one side of the body, vision changes, difficulty speaking or understanding, dizziness, and an excruciating headache. All stroke symptoms come on suddenly. Image: © Rossella De Berti/Getty Images",7,0.2542537,0.17991711,False

Bank Runs, Trading Halted on Some Banks",0,"Bottom image source. by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Silicon Valley Bank became the second FDIC-insured bank to collapse in 3 days today. They are reportedly the 16th largest bank in the U.S., and the largest bank to collapse since the 2008 financial meltdown, and the second largest bank to ever collapse in the U.S. While it was still not the main headline news this morning in the corporate media, a glance at the headlines as I began to write this article shows that it is apparently now getting the headline news it should receive, as bank runs are starting, and some banks suspended trading today to stop the carnage. The Alternative Media is mostly still asleep, ranting and raving about new “Jan. 6 footage” and the Tucker Carlson show. This is still a very rapidly moving story, so let me attempt to summarize everything that has happened today, so far. If you have not yet read our lead story from yesterday that broke all this news, please see: First, the FDIC took over Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) today. And just a reminder, the FDIC only insures accounts up to $250,000. Only 2.7% of Silicon Valley Bank deposits are less than $250,000. Meaning, 97.3% aren't FDIC insured. Ouch. pic.twitter.com/ZCmtOkZr2d — Genevieve Roch-Decter, CFA (@GRDecter) March 10, 2023 Silicon Valley Bank, one of the tech sector’s favorite lenders, is shutting down. The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation announced Friday that it was taking over and closing the distressed bank to protect deposits, naming the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as its receiver. The FDIC has formed a separate entity where all insured SVB deposits are being transferred. The closure marks the biggest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis and the second-largest on record after Washington Mutual collapsed during that industry-wide meltdown, according to FDIC data. Like other FDIC-member banks, deposits are insured up to $250,000 per depositor. The agency said it is “working over the weekend” to determine how many SVB deposits are insured. The shutdown came after a tumultuous morning for the Santa Clara, California-based bank — the 16th largest bank in the country — during which trading of its shares was halted after they fell by double-digits before markets opened. That downslide came on the heels of a more than 60% decline Thursday. In view of the tumult, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told House lawmakers Friday morning, “There are recent developments that concern a few banks that I’m monitoring very carefully, and when banks experience financial loss it is and should be a matter of concern.” (Full article.) This news has led to a dramatic drop in value in trading for ALL banks, and several of them reportedly suspended trading on the NYSE for a while today. Bank runs have also been reported.

The Information reports: Startups and VCs Scramble to Pay Employees After SVB’s Collapse The sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank sowed panic at hundreds of startups and venture capital firms that banked there and now must seek new ways to pay employees and access funds from their investors and customers. Founders and VC firms, which also kept billions of dollars worth of assets with SVB, on Friday rushed to figure out whether they could get loans to cover payroll if their funds were still tied up in the bank, which a federal banking regulator took under receivership on Friday. “The reality is sinking in among founders who are realizing, ‘I have payroll this week and I’m not able to log into my SVB account right now.’ And maybe the money will be there in the future, but they need it right now,” said Billy Libby, CEO of startup debt and equity investor Upper90. The scramble highlighted Silicon Valley Bank’s deep connections with the tech industry. Besides clients that deposited cash or took out loans from the bank, hundreds of startups and dozens of venture capital firms had received investments from the bank’s venture capital arm. Its startup portfolio includes crypto compliance firm Chainalysis and credit card startup Jeeves, PitchBook said. Many VC firms, including Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins, have also held their money at the bank, according to PitchBook. One startup founder said they had about $10 million in an SVB checking account when the bank failed. The company’s finance team is now trying to open a new bank account and use the company’s Treasury bills and other securities to pay vendors and employees. “I am talking to people whose only bank account was at SVB and they are trying to figure out how to make payroll. That’s a true statement. That’s scary for a lot of people,” said Andy Boyd, who used to lead tech investing at Fidelity Investments and now runs Bramalea Partners, a VC firm.

As this story is now exploding, at least in the corporate media, it is almost comical to read all the varying views and commentary over what has just transpired over the past 3 days with two FDIC-insured banks collapsing. They range from “Don’t worry, everything is fine, this is nothing like 2008” to others, like myself, who see this as an infection in the financial sector that has been growing for years now. Wall Street on Parade reported today (note: SVB had not collapsed yet when this was written): Bank Stocks Plummet as Bank Runs in the U.S. Gain Momentum at Federally-Insured, Non-Traditional Banks If you keep a diary or news journal, be sure to write down March 9, 2023 as the day that a full-blown bank run began at non-traditional banks in the U.S. Bank depositors were already nervous after federally-insured Silvergate Bank (ticker SI) announced on Wednesday evening that it was closing and liquidating. Its publicly-traded stock had already lost over 90 percent of its market value over the prior 12 months at that point. Now, for the second time in less than two weeks, depositors are panicking over the fate of another federally-insured bank. This time it’s Silicon Valley Bank (ticker for holding company is SIVB) which, like Silvergate Bank, had become a go-to bank for a special niche customer. Instead of crypto, its niche was venture capital outfits and private equity firms. Silicon Valley Bank is not a small bank. According to its regulatory filings, as of December 31 it held $161.4 billion in domestic deposits and $13.9 billion in foreign deposits. (Full article.) Another bank heavily invested in Big Tech and crypto, Signature Bank, is the one being named most often today as being in trouble, and perhaps being the next one to fail. Crypto bank Signature slides on Friday amid troubles at Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Signature Bank shares dropped as much as 32% on Friday and were at one point halted amid a sell-off in bank stocks that continued for a second day. Signature, one of the main banks to the cryptocurrency industry, was last down by 24%. The initial move followed a big day for its crypto banking peer Silvergate Capital, which announced earlier this week that it would liquidate its bank. Its losses deepened Thursday after shares of SVB Financial, whose Silicon Valley Bank lends to tech startups, announced a plan to raise more than $2 billion in capital to help offset losses on bond sales. By late Friday morning, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp had closed Silicon Valley Bank and taken control of its deposits, making it the largest U.S. bank failure since the global financial crisis. First Republic Bank, PacWest Bancorp, Western Alliance Bancorp were among the other names whose trading was at one point halted for volatility. Signature has said it has minimal exposure to crypto, but Silicon Valley Bank’s need to recapitalize on the heels of the Silvergate event has linked the two events in some people’s minds. Valkyrie chief investment officer Steve McClurg said the Signature Bank was already hurting on the back of Silvergate’s losses, which now total almost 50% for the week. Its Friday losses are a spillover effect from the Silicon Valley Bank woes, he added. Ed Moya, an analyst at Oanda, emphasized Signature is caught in the middle of both narratives. “Signature Bank is getting hit with a one-two punch as concerns grow that any crypto-related bank could be in danger and as financial instability concerns grow for parts of the banking sector,” he said. “There are only a handful of publicly traded banks that have crypto exposure and lots of traders are rushing to bet against them.” (Full article.) Signature Bank is not the only bank being mentioned, however. Market Watch identified 20 other banks with “huge potential securities losses” like SVB. 20 banks that are sitting on huge potential securities losses—as was SVB Silicon Valley Bank has failed following a run on deposits, after its parent company’s share price crashed a record 60% on Thursday. Trading of SVB Financial Group’s stock was halted early Friday, after the shares plunged again in premarket trading. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said SVB was one of a few banks she was “monitoring very carefully.” Reaction poured in from several analysts who discussed the bank’s liquidity risk. California regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank and handed the wreckage over to the Federal Deposit Insurance Administration later on Friday. Below is the same list of 10 banks we highlighted on Thursday that showed similar red flags to those shown by SVB Financial through the fourth quarter. This time, we will show how much they reported in unrealized losses on securities — an item that played an important role in SVB’s crisis. Below that is a screen of U.S. banks with at least $10 billion in total assets, showing those that appeared to have the greatest exposure to unrealized securities losses, as a percentage of total capital, as of Dec. 31. Full article. As I reported yesterday, this banking infection is not limited to just the U.S. financial tech sector. It is an infection that is spreading outside the U.S., and into other sectors, and this infection is just going to get worse. SVB failure triggers shockwaves across biotech industry Silicon Valley Bank’s failure has sent shockwaves across the biotech industry and spurred a panic among top venture capital firms, some of whom have confirmed to Fierce Biotech that they have urged their companies to withdraw deposits. Nearly half of all U.S. venture-backed technology and life science companies bank with SVB—the 16th largest bank in the country—with a total of $342 billion in client funds and $74 billion in total loans. Vida Ventures Co-Founder and Managing Director Arjun Goyal, M.D., said in an interview with Fierce Biotech that the firm has advised companies to examine their exposure to SVB and transfer that to other banks. Goyal did not explicitly mention the companies that were advised, but Vida has invested in biotechs such as Volastra Therapeutics, Alterome Therapeutics, Capstan Therapeutics and Aktis Oncology in the past year. (Full article.) The Information is reporting that the infection has also spread to China. The panic over the status of Silicon Valley Bank intensified on Friday, as the stock of SVB’s parent fell another 66% in pre-trading hours. Meanwhile, anxieties spread to China overnight, prompting local venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to follow their U.S. counterparts and look for alternative banks for their U.S. dollar holdings. The fate of SVB is a huge concern in China, the world’s second-largest venture capital market after Silicon Valley, because SVB was among the first financial institutions to start catering to Chinese startups when traditional banks shunned them. The bank established its first Chinese arm nearly two decades ago, “Silicon Valley Bank has played an instrumental role for us,” said Guanchun Wang, founder of Laiye, a Beijing-based enterprise software startup. “We opened our first bank account with them when the likes of Citi wouldn’t have anything to do with us.” (Full article.) Corporate executives at Silicon Valley Bank are being criticized today because they allegedly sold over $4.4 million in stocks two weeks ago, suggesting that they knew ahead of time what was coming and that their bank was going to fail. Silicon Valley Bank CEO, CFO and CMO sold +$4.4MM in stock over the last 2 weeks. But they didn’t know anything right? pic.twitter.com/mipeaRKgn6 — Genevieve Roch-Decter, CFA (@GRDecter) March 10, 2023 This begs the question as to whether or not we are seeing the beginning of a planned take down of the financial system in order to replace the monetary system with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). As I have previously reported, there is strong opposition to the roll-out of CBDCs, especially among smaller banks and credit unions. See: This liquidity crisis is due mainly to the Fed’s policies of driving up interest rates, and if more bank runs are going to take place, which seems most likely at this point, which banks are going to be the ones that suffer the most? Smaller, local regional banks are the ones that could easily be driven out of business, or swallowed up by the larger banks. One of the best analyses I read today about what has been happening for the past few days was an article published this morning on ZeroHedge News. And while this article does not address the issue of rolling out CBDCs, it explains very well why the smaller, local regional banks are the ones most in trouble right now. Here is a quote: Which boils down to the following: if depositor confidence in the regional/small bank sector is now shot – and after both Silvergate and SIVB it very well may be – we will see a small (to medium if not larger) deposit run among the regionals which could prove devastating for these reserve-constrained banks which will need to scramble to raise capital a la SIVB in what eventually transforms into a death spiral for the sector, especially if depositors take one look at what is going on with regional bank prices – which have been in freefall in the past two days – and extrapolate what may come next – there’s a reason why banking is the ultimate confidence game. There is one way to short-circuit this process and it, of course, involves the Fed which would need to step in the way it did in September 2019 when it was the big banks – namely JPMorgan – that were reserve-constrained, and forced the Fed to launch “Not QE” (but only after the US repo market suffered some historic rollercoaster moves). Ironically, even if the Fed does somehow whisper words of reassurance, the question is why would depositors park their money at “suddenly” risky banks when they can just buy a 6M T-Bill and get the same return with zero risk. Yes, the Fed may have no choice but to cut rates if it wishes to save the (regional) banking system. But then again, the Fed is still stuck fighting runaway inflation, which means that Powell is now trapped, and as we tweeted previously, Powell is now trapped: More hikes: regional banks collapse; Less hikes: inflation target must be raised. So will Powell let America’s small, regional banks risk failure as a result of his rate hikes (an outcome the likes of JPMorgan would find quite beneficial as it will make them even bigger), or will the Fed chair step in the way he did in 2019 even if it means gambling with runaway inflation? The right answer to that question could make some traders extremely rich. The entire article is well worth reading at ZeroHedge News.",2,-0.23097911,-0.21102828,False
https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/news/20230719/cm/your-heart-benefits-even-if-you-exercise-as-a-weekend-warrior,Your Heart Benefits Even If You Exercise as a ‘Weekend Warrior’,1,"July 19, 2023 -- It’s well known that exercise is beneficial to one’s health and particularly that it protects against heart disease. But how much exercise should people get? And how should they apportion their exercise time? Current guidelines (such as those from the World Health Organization and the American Heart Association) recommend at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of moderate-to-vigorous exercise weekly to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and death, but these guidelines don’t specify how those hours should be divided up. The U.K. National Health Service recommends spreading the exercise evenly over 4 to 5 days, or doing some every day. The question is whether exercise is just as helpful if it’s concentrated over 1 or 2 days -- sometimes called a “weekend warrior” pattern because many people who can’t exercise during the busy workweek can make the time to do so on the weekend. A new study has encouraging news for weekend warriors: It’s the amount of exercise, not the pattern of exercise, that counts, even if the workouts aren’t evenly distributed over the week. Improving Cardiovascular Risk Lead study author Shaan Khurshid, MD, MPH, instructor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, shared the researchers’ motivation for conducting the study. “The weekend warrior pattern has been studied previously, but typically relying on self-reported data, which may be biased, or too small to look at specific cardiovascular outcomes,” Khurshid said. The researchers wanted a more objective measure of how much exercise individuals were actually getting and also wanted to investigate the question in a much larger sample. To do so, they studied 89,573 participants in the U.K. Biobank, a huge biomedical database and research resource that has in-depth genetic and health information from half a million U.K. residents. The average age of the participants was 62, and a little over half were female. For 1 week, participants wore a device on their wrist that recorded their total physical activity, as well as the amount of time spent at different levels of exercise intensity. The researchers compared three exercise patterns: “We saw the opportunity to leverage the largest sample of measured activity to date in order to more definitively address the question of whether activity pattern affects specific major cardiovascular diseases differently,” Khurshid said. Participants were followed for a median of 6.3 years to see if they had developed one of four types of heart problems: atrial fibrillation, heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. A little over a third of participants (33.7%) were classified as inactive, while close to a fifth (24%) were active-regular. The largest percentage (42.2%) was active-weekend warriors. After adjusting for other factors that can affect the risk of developing heart problems (such as age, sex, racial/ethnic background, tobacco use, and self-reported health and diet quality), the researchers found that both exercise patterns were associated with a lower risk of developing these conditions: “The take-home is that efforts to optimize activity, even if concentrated within just a day or 2 each week, should be expected to result in improved cardiovascular risk profiles,” Khurshid said. Maintaining Good Habits Pinchas King, a 53-year-old publisher from Passaic, NJ, exercises on a regular basis. “I try to exercise every day by going on a treadmill, and I start with high-intensity exercise,” he said. King exercises for many reasons. “It gives me ongoing energy and also has multiple health benefits, such as preventing cancer, heart disease, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s,” he said. He considers himself fortunate to be able to include exercise in a regular routine but is aware that many people aren’t able to do so. “The results of this study sound good and for those people who don’t have time during the week [to exercise], the study is useful,” he said. But he expressed concern that people who already have an exercise regimen spread over the course of the week “might give up that good habit and postpone exercise until the weekend, and then maybe not end up doing it at all or doing less than the recommended amount.” King considers the “2-day option” as a “nice substitute when necessary” -- for example, if you’ve been sick or have been particularly busy and were unable to exercise on a given week. “But I think it’s better that people find time to incorporate exercise into their daily lives because waiting until the weekend might make it harder to implement.” ‘Every Minute Counts’ According to the CDC, only 28% of U.S. adults get the amount of exercise recommended by the guidelines. One reason many people don’t exercise enough is that their busy schedule may not allow them time. Peter Katzmarzyk, PhD, associate executive director for population and public health sciences at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, LA, said the study findings are encouraging for people in this situation. “These results are important as they point out that physical activity can be accumulated throughout the week in different ways, which opens up more options for busy people to get their physical activity in,” said Katzmarzyk, co-author of an accompanying editorial in which he writes, “every minute counts” — especially among the three-quarters of U.S. adults who don’t achieve the recommended exercise goal. Khurshid agrees. “Patients should be encouraged to achieve recommended activity levels and should not be discouraged if, for whatever reasons, they are only able to focus exercise within only 1 or a few days of the week,” he said. “Instead, our findings suggest that it is the volume of activity, rather than the pattern, that matters most.”",5,0.2511394,0.049736142,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/rethinking-hdl-cholesterol,Rethinking HDL cholesterol,1,"Cholesterol, a waxy, pale yellow fat, travels through the bloodstream in tiny, protein-covered particles called lipoproteins that mix easily with blood. You need cholesterol to create cell membranes, make hormones, and synthesize vitamin D, among other things. But if you're trying to avoid heart disease, you should keep tabs on your blood cholesterol values — especially your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol. Too much LDL in the bloodstream helps to create artery-clogging plaque, raising your risk of a heart attack. Your cholesterol report (also called a lipid profile or lipid panel) also includes your high-density lipoprotein (HDL); see the table below for recommended values. HDL has long been referred to as ""good"" cholesterol, based on observational studies dating back decades showing that people with high HDL levels are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease. However, the scientific understanding of HDL has evolved in the ensuing years, and many cardiologists now believe that HDL may be more of a bystander rather than a ""good guy"" that helps lower heart disease risk. ""Higher HDL levels are closely linked with behaviors like eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise,"" says Dr. Stephen Wiviott, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Talking trash about HDL Researchers have also discovered that the way HDL functions and its role in the body are more complex that once believed. ""The analogy that's often used to describe HDL is a garbage truck, because it picks up extra cholesterol, or garbage, from the bloodstream and the arteries and then transports it to the liver, where it's recycled or disposed,"" says Dr. Wiviott. That was the rationale behind the creation of experimental drugs that raised HDL levels dramatically — between 60% and 100%. Over the past decade, large clinical trials tested five of these drugs (known as CEPT inhibitors) in people with low HDL levels. But while the drugs reliably raised HDL levels, they didn't achieve the most important goal: preventing heart attacks, strokes, and other complications from clogged arteries. Maybe, the thinking went, it wasn't the number of garbage trucks that mattered but how good they were at picking up trash. That is, maybe the drugs increased the wrong kind of HDL cholesterol. It turns out that HDL comes in different shapes and sizes. Some types are spherical, while others are doughnut-shaped. Some types of HDL are great at plucking excess cholesterol from LDL and artery walls (a process referred to as reverse cholesterol transport), while some are not. Lipid lowdown: What numbers are best? The desirable values are for people without known heart disease. LEVEL CATEGORY TOTAL CHOLESTEROL Less than 200 mg/dL Desirable 200–239 mg/Dl Borderline high 240 mg/dL and above High LDL CHOLESTEROL Less than 100 mg/dL Optimal 100–129 mg/dL Near optimal/above optimal 130–159 mg/dL Borderline high 160–189 mg/dL High 190 mg/dL and above Very high HDL CHOLESTEROL Less than 40 mg/dL Low 60 mg/dL and above High TRIGLYCERIDES Less than 150 mg/dL Normal 150–199 mg/dL Borderline high 200–499 mg/dL High 500 mg/dL and above Very high Source: Adapted from the National Cholesterol Education Program. A better garbage truck? What if you had an HDL-based drug specifically designed to improve reverse cholesterol transport? Think of it as an empty garbage truck with a better trash compactor. But when investigators tested four weekly infusions of this type of experimental drug on more than 18,200 recent heart attack survivors, it was no better than a placebo in preventing heart attack, stroke, or death, as detailed in a study published May 2, 2024, in The New England Journal of Medicine. ""It's yet another point of reference to suggest that targeting HDL with medications may not be helpful,"" says Dr. Wiviott. But these findings shouldn't distract you from focusing on the factors you can control — namely, making sure your LDL is below 100 milligrams per deciliter, or even lower if you have heart disease (see advice about LDL-lowering strategies). That's true even if you have a high HDL level, which shouldn't be considered overly reassuring or a reason to ignore an elevated LDL value, says Dr. Wiviott.

https://www.webmd.com/brain/news/20230719/cm/study-strengthening-brain-health-with-diet-may-take-many-years,Study: Strengthening Brain Health With Diet May Take Many Years,1,"July 19, 2023 -- Researchers studying a diet designed to improve brain health say were surprised by the results of a recent experiment because subjects on the MIND diet did not show greater brain health than those on a control diet after three years. About half of the 604 participants followed the Mediterranean–DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet for three years. The other half had only mild caloric restrictions. “Among cognitively unimpaired participants with a family history of dementia, changes in cognition and brain MRI outcomes … did not differ significantly between those who followed the MIND diet and those who followed the control diet,” the study’s authors wrote. The MIND diet did improve the brains of those who followed it for three years. Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed fewer tiny lesions and more grey matter and white matter, the brain’s cognitive center and “communication highway,” respectively, CNN reported. But the brains of the participants who were not following the MIND diet showed similar improvement. “We really expected that the MIND diet would show an effect above the control group, so we were quite surprised by the outcome,” said lead author Lisa Barnes, associate director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The MIND diet includes much of the Mediterranean diet, an eating approach that favors fish, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, and olive oil. The MIND diet also includes part of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which aims to improve blood pressure and lower risk of heart attacks, strokes and some conditions that can lead to dementia. CNN reported concerns about the new study. “My main concern with this trial from the beginning has been that three years may be too short a time to have an impact on a disease process that develops over many decades,” said Walter Willett, MD, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Willett pointed to an older clinical trial which found eating more beta-carotenoids, the antioxidants found in red, yellow, orange and dark green fruits and vegetables, produced cognitive benefits — but only after years on the diet. Barnes said previous research showed that following the MIND diet and the Mediterranean diet gave significant protection against cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease, but that those studies were much longer than the new, three-year study.",3,0.2657046,0.056659102,False

But now, that percentage of “excess deaths” has bottomed out and is “no longer historically abnormal,” as The New York Times put it. The measure has been important over the last several years because counting the true effects of COVID has been challenging. This statistic reveals whether COVID-19 has been underdiagnosed. It also accounts for increased deaths related to COVID-19, like car crashes and missed medical treatments. TheTimes cites the Human Mortality Database, which says that fewer Americans than normal have died since March, and The Economist, and the CDC, which say the excess-death number is less than 1%. “After three horrific years, in which Covid has killed more than one million Americans and transformed parts of daily life, the virus has turned into an ordinary illness,” The Times reported. The improvement is due to three main factors, The Times reports: “Nearly every death is preventable,” Ashish Jha, MD, President Biden’s former top COVID-19 adviser, told The Times. “We are at a point where almost everybody who’s up to date on their vaccines and gets treated if they have COVID, they rarely end up in the hospital, they almost never die. “Even for most — not all, but most — immunocompromised people, vaccines are actually still quite effective at preventing against serious illness.”",4,-0.27836186,0.36621433,False

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/is-extra-virgin-olive-oil-extra-healthy,Is extra-virgin olive oil extra healthy?,1,"Q. I know olive oil is part of a heart-healthy diet, but is extra-virgin olive oil healthier than regular olive oil? A. Many studies continue to confirm the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, which cuts the risk of heart disease and stroke. The diet's nutritional benefits probably come from various sources, but the generous use of olive oil appears to be a key contributor. Regardless of the type, olive oil is high in monounsaturated fatty acids, containing about 75% by volume. When substituted for saturated fat, monounsaturated fats help lower your ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. The health benefits of olive oil have been attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In fact, observational studies have shown a link between lower risks of cardiovascular disease, some cancers, and even dementia in people who consume higher amounts of olive oil than those who use little or none. Still, extra-virgin olive oil does offer something extra that regular olive oil does not. Extra-virgin olive oil is pressed mechanically from ripe olives and processed without high heat or chemical solvents. This protects chemicals in the oil called phenols. In contrast, regular, highly processed olive oils lose these chemicals. Small laboratory-based experiments suggest that higher concentrations of phenols may provide extra antioxidant effects. Even so, there are no definitive studies that show extra-virgin olive oil has a greater ability than refined oil to prevent heart problems, cancer or other diseases. Keep in mind that olive oil is not the sole healthy ingredient in a Mediterranean diet. Think of it as just one aspect of the Mediterranean style of eating, which includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and nuts; whole grains; and limited amounts of red meat.

Our goal in sharing with the public these statistics in VAERS that were NOT being reported in the corporate media, was to warn the public that these shots were NOT safe, and that they were not even vaccines in the traditional definition of vaccines, but bioweapons designed to reduce the world’s population while bringing in great profit to the pharmaceutical companies producing them. And now 2 years later here in 2023, after 670,987,625 doses of COVID-19 bioweapon shots have been injected into the bodies of Americans, and with people currently receiving COVID-19 shots at the lowest level since they were given emergency use authorizations, Florida’s Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo has issued a “Health Alert on mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety” on February 15, 2023 based on the Government’s own statistics in VAERS. If people like me and many others have been able to pull these statistics out of VAERS and warn the public for over 2 years now, what took Ladapo so long? And now that he is finally admitting this problem, what is he doing about it? Is he calling for an immediate halt to these killer shots? Is he calling for prosecution of the murderers who implemented these weapons of mass destruction? No, he issued a “scathing letter” to the FDA and CDC “requesting” that they “promote transparency in health care professionals to accurately communicate the risks these vaccines pose.” I’m sure the people at the FDA and CDC are shaking in their boots over this letter. (Sarcasm) So what do you think readers of Health Impact News? Did Ladapo issue this “alert” because he is truly concerned about the safety of the people in Florida, or is he using this to grab the spotlight and prepare himself for a potential position in Ron DeSantis’s administration should he be elected as President of the United States?",6,-0.512198,0.33750504,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heart-failure-might-be-the-most-common-complication-of-atrial-fibrillation,Heart failure might be the most common complication of atrial fibrillation,1,"Doctors have long warned that atrial fibrillation (afib), a common heart rhythm disorder, can lead to a stroke. Afib describes a condition in which the heart's upper chambers beat erratically, which can make blood pool and form clots that travel to the brain or other parts of the body. But a large observational study from Denmark, published online April 17, 2024, by The BMJ, suggests that heart failure might be an even bigger risk from afib. Researchers evaluated the health information of more than three million people (ages 45 to 95) who were afib-free and followed for more than 20 years. Among people who developed afib during the study, heart failure occurred about twice as often as a stroke (41% vs. 21%) and more than three times as often as a heart attack (41% vs. 12%). How does afib contribute to heart failure? The erratic and ineffective beating of the upper chambers of the heart probably forces the lower chambers to work harder. Over time, that toll can reduce the heart's ability to pump enough blood to meet your needs. That's one more reason why it's important to seek treatment for afib and minimize symptoms.

The analysis, published in December 2023 by JAMA Network Open, involved more than 460,000 adults (average age 56, 55% women) who participated in the UK Biobank study over a four-year span. Participants reported how frequently they added salt to meals: never or rarely, sometimes, often, or always. Researchers tracked participants for an average of nearly 12 years to determine how many developed CKD, which increases the risks of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. After adjusting for factors such as smoking, weight, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, the researchers found that participants who regularly added salt to meals faced higher odds of CKD. The risk increased by 2% among occasional salters, 5% among frequent salters, and 6% among people who said they always added salt.

Levels of cholesterol and triglycerides have long been linked to heart problems. Now, this latest analysis shows that people ages 60 and older who had the greatest variations in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels over the course of 5 years had up to a 23% increased risk of developing dementia. Researchers also found that the increased risk due to fluctuations in total cholesterol or in triglycerides was present even for people who took medication to manage their cholesterol. The study also looked at LDL and HDL cholesterol variations, but fluctuations in those standalone measures didn’t have a link to dementia. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Neurology. Researchers analyzed health records for 11,571 people, who all lived in the Minnesota county where the Mayo Clinic is located. The average age of people in the study was 71 years old, and 96% of them were White. None of them had a previous dementia diagnosis at the start of the study. During the following 10 years, 21% of the people had Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia. Dementia refers to problems with memory, thinking, and decision-making that are so severe, they interfere with a person’s everyday life. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia. More than 5 million people ages 65 and older in the U.S. have dementia, and the CDC projects that number will grow to 14 million by 2060. The researchers noted that previous research has shown that total cholesterol variation is a predictor of heart problems and of early death. Although their findings were not able to point to a cause, the researchers wrote that one theory of how lipid variation contributes to dementia is that narrowed arteries can lead to decreased blood flow to the brain. “Routine screenings for cholesterol and triglyceride levels are commonly done as part of standard medical care,” researcher Suzette J. Bielinski, PhD, of the Mayo Clinic, said in a statement. “Fluctuations in these results over time could potentially help us identify who is at greater risk for dementia, help us understand mechanisms for the development of dementia and ultimately determine whether leveling out these fluctuations could play a role in reducing dementia risk.”",7,0.3089153,0.23386364,False
https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20230706/cm/loneliness-epidemic-tied-cancer-dementia-diseases,"Loneliness Epidemic Tied to Cancer, Dementia, Other Diseases",1,"July 6, 2023 – Loneliness, once considered a mere longing for connection, is gaining recognition from doctors and scientists as something much more dangerous: a risk for heart disease, dementia, certain cancers, and even death. A growing body of research points to strong links between social isolation, or lack of social connections, and loneliness, the feeling of being disconnected regardless of human contact. Researchers have found a 26% increase in the risk of early death for people who are socially isolated and a 14% increase for those who are lonely, according to a new meta-analysis published in Nature Human Behaviour. Loneliness also increases the risk of dementia by 50%, heart disease by 29%, and stroke by 32%, according to a 2020 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). If a person with heart disease experiences loneliness, they face four times the risk of early death and a 68% higher risk of hospitalization. “In recent years, people have recognized that loneliness, as well as social isolation, are related to worse health status,” said Sarah Goodlin, MD, a geriatrician, palliative care doctor, and professor of medicine at Oregon Health & Science University. “And it’s a common condition. Even people who are not socially isolated can feel lonely.” Increased Focus on Loneliness In May, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, MD, issued an advisory on the dangers of loneliness as a public health issue. “Our epidemic of loneliness and isolation has been an underappreciated public health crisis that has harmed individual and societal health,” he said. “Given the significant health consequences of loneliness and isolation, we must prioritize building social connection the same way we have prioritized other critical public health issues such as tobacco, obesity, and substance use disorders.” The American Medical Association adopted a policy last month to “encourage research to assess how forming networks earlier in life helps to reduce loneliness and social isolation for adults, with a special focus on marginalized populations and communities with limited access to resources.” Among groups most at risk are low-income adults, young adults, older adults, people with chronic diseases and disabilities, migrants, and those in the LGBTQ community. Link Between Loneliness and Illness Still a Mystery Research indicates loneliness and social isolation may be linked to higher levels of inflammatory chemicals in the body: C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and interleukin-6. People who are lonely may also have active pituitary hypothalamus hormones that are released under stress, which could account for negative heart effects, Goodlin said. But for now, these are only potential links. “The actual causation is just proposed – it has not been determined,” Goodlin said. “There are no answers right now.” Social Isolation vs. Loneliness Loneliness is the feeling of being alone or disconnected, despite having human contact, while social isolation is having little interaction with other people and few social connections. “Someone can appear isolated but not feel lonely, and maybe they prefer being by themselves,” said Tiffani Bell Washington, MD, a psychiatrist, public health specialist, and obesity medicine/lifestyle medicine specialist. “Finding ways to minimize loneliness is not simply an ask to live like a socialite or change your entire life or become an extrovert and party all night,"" she continued. ""This is about your health.” What Can Be Done? While there is plenty of research on the health effects of loneliness, there has been little exploration into solutions. The U.S. health care reimbursement system is not set up to treat loneliness as a health issue, Goodlin said, so even if doctors addressed the problem at routine visits, there would still be few options for intervention. But some researchers are beginning to examine how people can address feelings of loneliness. One study published in Leisure Sciences last year looked at two particularly vulnerable populations – international students and nursing home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic – and found that activities that require focus and engagement reduced feelings of loneliness, even in the face of isolation. “Loneliness isn't as strong when we engage in activities that are meaningful for us, that give us the opportunity to be authentic,” said John Dattilo, PhD, a professor in Penn State University’s Recreation, Park and Tourism Management Department, and a co-author of the paper. Researchers found that when people are absorbed in an activity that challenges them and leads to skill development, time passes faster and loneliness eases. “One of the first steps is to understand ourselves. What is it that brings us joy?” Dattilo said. “People get into a routine, into a pattern, and do things out of a sense of obligation rather than a sense of joy. Being self-aware is one of the first steps.”",7,0.16994159,0.09789114,False

PFAS (short for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are synthetic chemicals that contaminate the environment from a variety of products. They can be present in water, food, the ground, and the air; and long-term exposure results in the chemicals building up in the body over time, which can be harmful, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This latest study was done by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and published last month in the journal Environment International. The USGS analyzed data from 269 private wells and 447 public water supplies, and then created a national estimate from the results. (The USGS is a government agency that makes maps and analyzes national natural resource data.) “USGS scientists tested water collected directly from people’s kitchen sinks across the nation, providing the most comprehensive study to date on PFAS in tap water from both private wells and public supplies,” study author and USGS research hydrologist Kelly Smalling, MSPH, said in a statement. “The study estimates that at least one type of PFAS – of those that were monitored – could be present in nearly half of the tap water in the U.S. Furthermore, PFAS concentrations were similar between public supplies and private wells.” The water sampled for the study spanned the country and U.S. territories, including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Researchers classified sample sites as low, medium, or high human-impact areas. High human-impact areas include urban areas and waste sites, where the researchers estimate that just 25% of tap water may be free of PFAS. In rural areas, 75% of tap water is estimated to be free of PFAS, they wrote. The regions of the country where PFAS-contaminated water was most often observed included the Great Plains, Great Lakes, Eastern Seaboard, and Central/Southern California regions. PFAS can be filtered out of water, according to the EPA, which is considering regulating drinking water for the presence of some specific PFAS.",8,-0.06556612,-0.039203435,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-bird-flu-primer-what-to-know-and-do-202405083039,A bird flu primer: What to know and do,1,"A bird flu strain that began circulating in 2020 continues to evolve globally and locally within the United States. If you're wondering what this means, understanding the basics — what bird flu is, how it spreads, whether foods are safe, and prevention tips — can help. More information will come in as scientists learn more, so stay tuned. 1. What is bird flu and how does it spread? Bird flu, or avian flu, is a naturally occurring illness. Just as certain flu viruses spread among humans, Type A influenza viruses often spread among wild birds. The strain of virus circulating now is H5N1, named for two proteins on its surface. Avian flu infections are highly contagious. Infection often spreads first among wild water birds, such as ducks, geese, and gulls, and shore birds, such as plovers and sandpipers. The viruses are carried in their intestines and respiratory tract and shed in saliva, mucus, and feces. Wild birds can easily infect domestic poultry, such as chickens, turkeys, and ducks. Some bird species, including ducks, may carry and spread infection without appearing sick. Domestic flocks are more likely to sicken and possibly die from bird flus. However, not all avian flu viruses are equally harmful: Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) may cause no signs of illness, or signs of mild illness like fewer eggs or ruffled feathers in domestic poultry. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) causes more severe illness and high rates of death in infected poultry. The current H5N1 virus is considered an HPAI. 2. Can humans get bird flu? Yes, though this doesn't usually happen. When flu viruses mutate, they may be able to move from their original hosts — birds in this case — to humans and other animals. As of early April 2024, only two cases of bird flu in humans had been reported in the US since 2022. In May, two more cases were reported. Newer case numbers of bird flu will continue to be reported by the CDC, which offers weekly snapshots of influenza in the US. The virus may be introduced into the body through the eyes, nose, or mouth. For example, a person may inhale viral particles in the air (droplets, tiny aerosolized particles, or possibly in dust). Or they might touch a surface contaminated by the virus, then touch their eyes or nose. Bird flu in humans typically causes symptoms similar to seasonal flu, such as fever, runny nose, and body aches. 3. Which animals have been affected by bird flu? A surprisingly long list of animals affected by the current H5NI bird flu infection includes: wild birds, chickens, ducks, geese, and other domestic and commercial poultry in 48 states and more than 500 countries livestock, such as dairy cows in nine states at this writing, and other farm animals marine animals, such as seals, sea lions, and even dolphins wild animals, such as foxes, skunks, and racoons, and some domestic animals, such as farm cats. 4. Why are experts concerned about this bird flu outbreak? It might seem odd that there's been so much concern and news coverage about bird flu lately. After all, bird flu has been around for many years. We've long known it sometimes infects nonbird animal species, including humans. But the current outbreak is unique and worrisome for several reasons: Fast, far-reaching spread. The virus has been found throughout the US, Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, multiple sub-Saharan African countries, and even Antarctica. Many species have been infected. Previously uninfected species have been affected, including animals in our food supply. Economic impact. If large numbers of beef and dairy cows and chickens sicken or must be culled (killed) to contain outbreaks, this could have a major economic impact on farmers, agriculture businesses, and affected countries' economies. This could also mean higher prices at the grocery store. Opportunities for exposure. Though only two human infections were reported in the US in recent years — both in people working with animals — the more exposure humans have to bird flu, the more chances the virus has to develop mutations that allow easier spread to humans. Potential for fatalities. Severe strains of bird flu have led to H5N1 infections in nearly 900 people in 23 countries since 2003. More than half of these reported cases were fatal. Keep in mind that the math isn't straightforward. It's likely that many more cases of bird flu in humans occurred, yet people experiencing few or no symptoms or those not tested weren't counted, so lethality is likely overestimated. New mutations. It's rare, but possible: If this H5N1 bird flu develops mutations that enable efficient person-to-person spread, bird flu could become the next human pandemic. 5. Are milk, beef, chicken, and the rest of our food supply safe? Public health officials emphasize that the food supply is safe. But concern has understandably run high since the discovery that this outbreak has spread from birds to dairy cows for the first time. More alarming? A study found fragments of bird flu DNA — which is not the same as live virus — in 20% of commercially available milk in the US. So far, there's been no indication that bird flu found in pasteurized milk, beef, or other common foods can cause human illness. Even if live bird flu virus got into the milk supply, studies show that routine pasteurization would kill it. Initial tests did not find the virus in ground beef. Of course, if you are particularly concerned, you could avoid foods and beverages that come from animals affected by bird flu. For example, you could switch to oat milk or almond milk, even though there's no convincing scientific justification to do so now. 6. What if you have pets or work with animals? Bird flu rarely spreads to pets. While that's good news, your pets could have exposure to animals infected with bird flu, such as through eating or playing with a dead bird. So, it's safest to limit your pet's opportunities to interact with potentially infected animals. If you work with animals, especially birds or livestock, or hunt, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends precautions to minimize your exposure to bird flu. 7. What else can you do to stay safe? The CDC recommends everyone take steps to avoid exposure to bird flu, including: Avoid contact with sick or dead animals and keep pets away from them. Avoid animal feces that may be contaminated by birds or bird droppings, as might be common on a farm. Do not prepare or eat raw or undercooked food. Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat raw milk cheese or raw or undercooked foods from animals suspected of having bird flu infection. Wear personal protective equipment (PPE), such as safety goggles, gloves, and an N95 face mask, when working near sick or dead animals or their feces. Right now, available evidence doesn't support more dramatic preventive measures, such as switching to an all-plant diet. 8. Is there any good news about bird flu? Despite all the worrisome news about bird flu, this recent outbreak may wind up posing little threat to human health. Virus strains may mutate to spread less efficiently or to be less deadly. Efforts are underway to contain the spread of bird flu to humans, including removing sick or exposed animals from the food supply and increased testing of dairy cattle before transport across state lines. And there is other encouraging news: Some birds appear to be developing immunity to the virus. This could reduce the chances of continued spread between birds and other animals. Developing a vaccine to protect cattle from bird flu may be possible (though it's unclear if this approach will be successful). If spread to humans does occur, genetic tests suggest available antiviral medicines could help treat people. So far, human-to-human transmission has not been detected. That makes it less likely that the H5N1 bird flu will become the next pandemic. And if human infections with bird flu did become more common, researchers are working on human vaccines against bird flu using virus strains that match well with those causing the current outbreak. 9. How worried should you be about bird flu? Though there's much we don't know, this much seems certain: bird flu will continue to change and pose challenges for farmers and health experts to stay ahead of it. So far, public health experts believe that bird flu poses little health risk to the general public. So, it's not time to panic about bird flu. But it is a good idea to take common sense steps to avoid exposure and stay current on related news. For updated information in the US, check the CDC website .",4,-0.19074482,0.07806681,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/how-to-silence-snoring,How to silence snoring,1,"Snoring is generally harmless, but it can be annoying, especially for your bed partner. Fortunately, you can take steps to alleviate the problem. Start by making lifestyle changes and trying simple home remedies. You can also try one of the many products marketed as stop-snoring aids. But if you snore and you also wake up gasping for air or frequently feel sleepy or tired during the day, you likely have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea can cause hypertension and more serious medical problems. Consult a doctor if your snoring affects the quality of your sleep. Lifestyle changes and home remedies You can try these do-it-yourself suggestions to help keep your airway open during sleep: Avoid alcohol — or don't drink alcohol within three hours of bedtime. This will help prevent your airway muscles from becoming slack while you sleep. Lose weight if you are overweight or obese. Extra fat tissue in the neck and throat can narrow the airways. Losing some weight could help to open the airways for someone who is overweight or obese, although many people who are lean also snore. Try home remedies for nasal obstruction issues. If your nose is stuffy due to mucus, try rinsing your sinuses with saline. If you have allergies, reduce dust mites and pet dander in your bedroom or use an allergy medication. If swollen nasal tissues are the problem, a humidifier or medication may reduce swelling. If you smoke, quit. In addition to smoking's many other negative health effects, people who smoke are also more likely to snore. Possible reasons include nightly nicotine withdrawal, which can disrupt sleep, as well as increased swelling and irritation in the upper airway. In fact, even secondhand smoke from another member of your household may increase your risk of snoring. Sleep on your side or elevate your head. When you sleep flat on your back, your tongue falls back and presses against the top of your airway, so sleeping on your side may help. To help you stay on your side, try pressing a long, oversized body pillow against your back. You can also wear a small fanny pack filled with tennis balls, or tape a tennis ball or rolled-up pair of socks to the back of your pajamas. This makes lying on your back uncomfortable. Or you can try elevating your head by using an extra pillow or a wedge pillow, or by propping up the head of your bed using blocks of wood under the top of the bed frame. These lifestyle changes and home remedies may help with simple snoring. However, if you have periods of gasping during sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness as well as snoring, it could be sleep apnea and let your doctor know.

What does this mean? It means that the financial collapse of the economy is getting closer, and this is the plan of the Central Bankers to replace the current monetary system. If you are unaware of what CBDCs are, and how they can be used for evil purposes to try and control every aspect of our lives, then it is time to take notice, because this is a train that has left the station, and is not coming back. It is not a new monetary system that can be implemented overnight, however, but will need to be rolled out in stages, and those roll outs have already begun in many countries around the world. As with anything in life, tyrants cannot control people without their consent. They fear the masses, because they are outnumbered. If there is massive resistance among the public, it can thwart their plans. They will use fear as their main tool, and we have seen just how powerful fear is, with the COVID-19 operation that began in 2020. So there is a window of opportunity here to wake up as many people as possible to resist converting over to a new, cashless society, where digital currencies issued by Central Banks will completely dominate our lives and eliminate any remaining remnant of “privacy.” I am publishing today the latest article by Jim Rickards to give us an update on just where we are today with U.S. CBDCs, and then a video by James Corbett that was just published and explains more in depth just what CBDCs are, along with sources of information on how to learn to opt out of CBDCs. Do NOT skip or browse through quickly this information, because I am not exaggerating when I say that your future, and the future of our society, depends upon you understanding what is at stake here, and how to resist it. by James Rickards Daily Reckoning Another warning shot across the bow just happened… I warned my readers a few weeks ago about how the Federal Reserve, in cooperation with giant global banks, has launched a 12-week pilot project to test the message systems and payment processes on the new CBDC dollar. A pilot project is not research and development. That’s already done. The pilot means that what I call “Biden Bucks” are here, and the backers just want to test the plumbing before they roll the system out on the entire population. That project is due to be completed next month. In other words, Biden Bucks are getting closer to becoming a reality for us all. Now there is another big development to keep you up to speed… This month, the Digital Dollar Project (DDP) released an updated version of its white paper called “Exploring a U.S. CBDC.” The project expanded the paper in order to examine central bank digital currency projects internationally, though its focus is still on the United States. Since its original white paper release in 2020, CBDC projects worldwide have increased from 35 to 114. Here is one statement in the updated paper: It [is] imperative that the U.S. government consider ways to maintain the use of the dollar in digital global payment systems and develop a strategy related to the use of alternative payment systems. “Alternative payment systems” is simply a technical term for Biden Bucks, which means replacing the cash (“fiat”) dollar we have now. What’s this mean for you? Let’s first consider the kind of freedom that physical cash offers you. Above all, cash is untraceable and anonymous. When you buy something with cash, there’s no way to trace the purchase to you individually. In that sense, cash is like gold or silver. It doesn’t leave a digital fingerprint. And that’s why the government wants to eliminate cash — with cash out of the way, it can trace anything and everything. At that point, the pigs (all of us) will be in the slaughterhouse ready for the digital slaughter of negative interest rates. All of your money will be locked in the banking system. If you don’t want to spend your money, the government can punish you by imposing negative rates. It doesn’t want you saving your money. And in a completely digital world, what would stop the government from having individualized interest rates for every citizen? Biden Bucks would also allow for account freezes, tax withholding and outright confiscation in some cases. After all, this is a government-approved digital wallet without any access to physical cash as you know it now. When the government is in full control of your money, it opens up the door for manipulating the economy by using you as a pawn and your assets as chess moves. If they need to slow down the economy (as they are attempting to do now with increasing interest rates), they could freeze a certain percentage of your cash so you can’t spend it. If they feel the economy is too slow and needs a jolt of spending, they could punish people who are saving too much with a “spend it or lose it” policy. That’s the reality behind negative interest rates. It would make your money less truly your own and under government control. We are already seeing how many retailers are not accepting cash across America. Another thing about physical cash: It’s not hackable. Under Biden Bucks, all the data that the government will have on every aspect of your life would be a dream come true for hackers. Identity theft would become commonplace. And forget privacy. That would be a thing of the past. What happens when physical cash is eliminated from any payment transactions? Imagine this alarming possibility… To further advance the climate change agenda, what if Joe Biden or his successor decided that gasoline needed to be rationed? Your Biden Bucks could be made to stop working at the gas pump once you’ve purchased a certain amount of gasoline in a week! They could justify it based on “national security concerns” or whatever, and that it’s something they just have to do. They’ll say, “We really don’t have a choice. We have to do it!” In other words, Biden Bucks would create new ways for the government to control how much you could buy of an item, or even ban certain purchases altogether. Government would keep score of every financial transaction you made. In a world of Biden Bucks, the government will even know your physical whereabouts at the point of purchase. It’s a short step from putting you under FBI investigation if you vote for the wrong candidate, buy the “wrong” reading material or give donations to the wrong political party. They may deny that this is part of some grand plan to control the population, that it’s just a way to make the financial system more efficient. The rest of it is just a conspiracy theory that only kooks believe. And they may mean it. They may not have bad intentions. But history clearly shows that once the government acquires a specific power, it will eventually use it to the fullest extent it can. And when corrupt people are running the government, they’ll use that power for political purposes, even if they might not set out to originally. The temptation is just too strong. If any of this sounds extreme, fantastical or otherwise far-fetched, well, it’s not. I simply invite you to look at what’s happening around the world. China is already using its CBDC to deny travel, employment and educational opportunities to political dissidents. Canada seized the bank accounts and crypto accounts of nonviolent trucker protesters last year. Nigeria put a cap on ATM cash withdrawals at $45 to promote digital payments. Don’t think that other governments, including the U.S. government, haven’t noticed. They have. The simple fact is “social credit scores” and political suppression will be even easier to conduct when Biden Bucks are completely rolled out in the U.S. With Biden Bucks, the government will be able to force you to comply with its agenda, like with the climate change example I mentioned above. Because if you don’t, they could turn off your money. But you can fight back. How? One, I recommend keeping some physical cash at home or in a safe place. I wouldn’t recommend too much cash because the time may come when cash is declared illegal and you have 60 days to hand in your cash for digital credit. Handing in too much cash may cause you to be put on a watchlist from a tax or money laundering perspective, even though the money is yours and you obtained it legally. Second, buy some gold. Gold is a non-digital, non-hackable, non-traceable form of money you can still use. Also, one-ounce silver American Eagles are the best form of money for day-to-day transactions. These are ways to protect your freedom and your savings. The time to prepare is now, before it all hits.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/microplastics-in-arteries-linked-to-heart-disease-risk,Microplastics in arteries linked to heart disease risk,1,"Concerns about the health effects of microplastics continue to mount. Now, a new study finds that people with microplastics in the plaque clogging their neck arteries were far more likely to have a heart attack or stroke than people with plastic-free plaque. When researchers tested the plaque removed from the neck arteries of 257 people, they found tiny particles of plastic — mostly polyethylene but also polyvinyl chloride — in 58% of the people. After nearly three years, the rate of heart attack, stroke, and death was 4.5 times higher in people with microplastics in their plaque than those without. These observational findings can't pinpoint microplastics as the culprit, as other unmeasured exposures or habits may be to blame, says the authors, whose study was published in the March 7, 2024, issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. Used to make plastic bags and bottles, polyethylene slowly breaks down and is found in food and water, which may explain how microplastics enter the body.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/many-older-adults-still-follow-outdated-aspirin-advice,Many older adults still follow outdated aspirin advice,1,"A nationwide poll suggests that one in four older adults takes aspirin regularly in hopes of preventing a heart attack or stroke, even though updated guidelines from 2019 advise against that practice in many cases. Aspirin helps prevent blood clots that can cause a heart attack or stroke, but the drug can also cause serious bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract and brain. Thanks to a better appreciation of that risk, daily low-dose aspirin is now recommended mainly for people who've already had a heart attack or face a very high risk of one. But 57% of adults who said they take aspirin regularly also said they have no history of cardiovascular disease. And nearly one-third of these people don't appear to know about aspirin's bleeding risk. People who do not have heart disease should talk to their doctor before starting, continuing, or stopping daily aspirin use. The March 2024 poll, from the University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Aging, surveyed a national sample of 2,657 adults ages 50 to 80.

https://healthimpactnews.com/2023/mislabeling-vaccination-deaths-for-50-years/,Mislabeling Vaccination Deaths for 50 Years,0,"Source: CDC Source. Comments by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Since last year (2022) I have been warning the public about the new class of “experts” that have arisen since COVID warning about the dangers of the COVID-19 injections, but who endorse and recommend all the other vaccines that have been approved by the FDA for the past 30+ years. The corruption in the pharmaceutical industry and the injection of toxic vaccines that cause injuries and deaths did not begin in 2020 with the COVID shots, and there are many of us who have been warning the public on these killer vaccines for decades now. I have also stated publicly that I am PROUD to be labeled as an “Anti-vaxxer”! Like evil and the Devil, there are just certain things it is good to always be against, because there is nothing good in them. Vaccines have never been proven safe nor effective – none of them. See: So I was very pleased to see an author on Substack, Marc Girardot, dig up some older information previously published by Neil Z. Miller who years ago exposed the fact that infant deaths due to vaccines are never listed on death certificates, because there are no CDC codes for cause of death due to vaccines. Instead, they are labeled as SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). Page from a pediatrician manual showing how to give multiple vaccines to babies in one office visit. We have reported on the work of Neil Miller and others on this topic for over a decade now. See: If you read the above 3 articles, you will clearly see how infant deaths due to the heavy CDC infant vaccination schedule have been covered up for decades now. Thanks to Marc Girardot for taking the time to dig all this up and report on it. by Marc Girardot Covid Myth Buster Series Friends – and foes – keep asking me: “Why are you absurdly stubborn on your Bolus Theory?”… The reason for my self-harming insistence is that if we let this crisis go down simply to a vaccine design flaw, a collective panic, a systemic corruption, or even manufacturing quality issues, if we find a variety of semi-truths, we will not addressed the profound reality of what has happened these past 3 years… – let me rephrase and correct this statement! – We will not address collectively the public health disaster that has been happening for nearly 60 years. This public health disaster was driven essentially by the underlying authoritarian belief within part of Public Health Authorities and the Medical community that they know better, and therefore our informed consent can be nudged and manipulated for the greater cause of perceived collective health. Whoever has kept his/her eyes opened these past 3 years can have a grasp as to the extent to which this hubristic lunacy can go… but, in my observation, the reality is far worse. I want to give credit to and compliment Neil Z. Miller of the Institute of Medical and Scientific Inquiry in Santa Fe, New Mexico, for a courageous and insightful article that triggered and inspired me today : “Vaccines and sudden infant death: An analysis of the VAERS database 1990–2019 and review of the medical literature”. All of you should read it. It’s an eye opener. There was a time – a long time ago – when I studied Language as a theme in philosophy. “Putting a name on things” is critically important in our collective life. It is indispensable to understanding the world, to building our intelligence, to communicating and solving problem…and therefore more generally to surviving. What if a group of few individuals had the ability to un-name a concept or a thing? Would that reality disappear? … Not really. If the name in question were attributed to a real thing, say a coconut, the coconut would not stop existing. An alternative name would likely be found, may be someone from another country would bring “noix de coco1”. What if it were a concept, something intangible? Well, that certainly would make things more complicated, but again, clear minded people would figure out a new way to express that concept and find another name… What if that same group of people would impose a strict NewSpeak worldwide, a novel name, a unique standard that means a radically different thing? Well then the concept would literally disappear of the records of society, drowned into a conceptual pot-pourris. And the concept would become fuzzier requiring extensive ressources and time to resurface. Most don’t have time to dedicate to phantomatic treasure hunts, specially to unearth a painful concept… What if I told you this actually happened?! In 1979, the W.H.O. and the C.D.C. redesigned the ICD coding list – International Classification of Diseases – and erased the possibility for the world’s coroners to label a cause of death related to vaccination! You heard me. A coroner had no longer a clear code to input if he/she believed someone died of a vaccine. [vaccines are not therapeutic, they are prophylactic. And the poisoning carries legal implications which coroners probably would never venture into.] Have Big Brothers W.H.O. and CDC been “guiding” coroners to mischaracterise vaccination deaths ? In any case, this suppression means that “Informed Consent” has been corrupt for decades as the extent of vaccine harm necessarily was downplayed considerably. In the US alone, in the past 25 year, nearly $ 5 billion have been awarded to 9,946 victims2 of vaccination, or to their families. Obviously, ten thousand people represents the tip of a much larger iceberg. Those who had the clairvoyance to acknowledge vaccination harm, who had the fortitude and ressources to fight for compensation and who benefitted from the good fortune to win in court are a happy few in the tens of millions of vaccines injured, most of whom lived through their pain and health drama never knowing the vaccination was the cause of their Parkinson’s disease, or their cancer. However there’s no question : In front of the Law, despite public health manipulations, vaccines harm exists and vaccination has been recognised as a killer in many cases, notably of babies. Though I have more and more doubts on the efficacy and the very justification of many vaccines – call me anti-vaxxer! I’ll wear it as a badge of honour – what I am trying to highlight today is that if we hide reality, there’s no way people will actually find a solution to this never-ending flow of illnesses, however dramatic and sad. We can continue with this dramatic circus forever. To be honest, I find it infuriating that some doctors dared telling me – when I was a young father – that it would be my fault if one of my toddlers would die. Seeding doubt and guilt as to whether I would have positioned the baby right in bed. I can’t imagine the guilt some parents have had to face – and still face every day – finding their little baby dead in the crib. Taking the responsibility and the guilt upon themselves when, in reality, the injection was to blame! Data show that for decades, public health officials and doctors have been playing Gods, indiscriminately injecting kids with an ever growing arsenal of products, occasionally killing them, often harming them for life. Prior to the 1960s, the concept of sudden infant death syndrome didn’t even exist, and was not listed in the main causes of mortality. So, between 1960 and 1980, public health had to realise immunisation was a cause for serious concern. In 1979, they chose to hide it from the public and to protect vaccine manufacturers. And so harm has continued … as if nothing could be done to avoid vaccine adverse effects. Between 1990 and 2019, 2,605 infant deaths were reported in VAERS, 78.3% of these deaths occurring within a week of vaccination! For the record, using a 59x myocarditis under-reporting factor (likely conservative) as per the Engler et al study 3 on SmallPox vaccines – one can estimate that nearly 153,700 babies died of vaccination over thirty years. Some 5,120 families sorrowed each year during decades. That’s no coincidence. In any other business, that synchronicity would be evidence enough, specially given: But “No!” in public health, a scientist reporting that will be shamed and his carrier ruined for questioning the official narrative, as we have witnessed these past 3 years. Except if it’s truly for the greater good, why are they spending so much energy trying to: Let’s be honest, presumably to avoid vaccine hesitancy, we are causing harm to our new-borns and to our children! We are no different than Incas practicing human sacrifice. Actually, we are far worse as the numbers are staggering. Whether it is to capture billions of dollars in revenue, or to pay tribute to the vaccine God (some are religious and utterly irrational about vaccines), we have sacrificed our collective health to this lunacy, and the emotional and economic consequences of this are simply gigantic. As we are witnessing in the gruesome aftermath of COVID vaccination, immumisation accidents occur frequently 4. Pr. Muëller from Basel University Hospital showed 2.8% of vaccinated staff had clinical cardiac issues, and that 100% had some degree of cardiac impact… Throughout multiple articles, I have demonstrated that inadvertent intravascular injection of vaccines is a reality, and that the mechanism of harm 5 can – and will – apply across the endothelium according to the exposure of the endothelium. And so to SIDS, one needs to add clinical and sub-clinical damage to: May be it’s time for our generation to wake up, dig into our ancestors’ self-preservation DNA and resist this man-made dystopia. Contrary to what we have been made to believe, vaccination is neither safe for our children, nor for us. Poor vaccination protocols have been the likely premier cause of illnesses for over a century. The stakes are enormous, civilisational, I would risk. A civilisation that doesn’t care for its children inevitably will flounder. Does our generation have the grit to tackle this monster? For our children, I pray we will find the force. Let’s start by demanding a change in the W.H.O. ICD codes and ask – as my friend John Beaudoin has been asking for months – that vaccine databases be tied with mortuary databases.",6,-0.46295223,0.33971906,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-low-should-ldl-cholesterol-go,How low should LDL cholesterol go?,1,"When it comes to reducing ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, how low should you go? ""People who are at high risk for cardiovascular diseases can benefit from driving LDL levels as low as possible to help reduce their risk for heart attacks and strokes,"" says cardiologist Dr. Christopher Cannon, editor in chief of the Harvard Heart Letter. ""Across many large clinical trials, for LDL, the lower the better."" The good and the bad Cholesterol is a fatty substance that occurs naturally in the body. The body uses it to make cell membranes and certain hormones. The fat you consume from food is absorbed in the intestine and transported to the liver, which converts it into cholesterol and then releases it into the bloodstream. Eating high-cholesterol foods often has only a modest impact on cholesterol in the blood, but many such foods are also high in saturated fats, which have a greater effect on cholesterol levels. ""Most of your cholesterol level is determined genetically,"" says Dr. Cannon. There are two main types of cholesterol: LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). LDL is called ""bad"" because excess amounts in the bloodstream can lodge inside artery walls. These deposits, called plaques, can rupture and trigger clotting that blocks blood flow to the heart or brain, causing a heart attack or stroke. By comparison, HDL has in the past been considered ""good"" because some forms of HDL collect excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and artery walls. Still, notes Dr. Cannon, ""many clinical trials have found that raising blood levels of HDL does not lower the risk of heart attack or stroke, so the focus is on lowering LDL."" By the numbers Current guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology set optimal LDL levels for the general population at below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL); 100 to 159 mg/dL is deemed high, and 160 mg/dL and higher is considered dangerous. People with known cardiovascular disease should aim for LDL levels below 70 mg/dL. ""Thus, across the spectrum of patients, the higher risk ones have a lower goal for LDL,"" says Dr. Cannon. Besides high LDL levels, having one or more other factors also can contribute to your cardiovascular risk, such as a family history of premature heart disease (a father or brother who was diagnosed at 55 or younger, or a mother or sister diagnosed before age 65) smoking obesity diabetes high blood pressure low levels of HDL (below 40 mg/dL). Why the focus on 70 mg/dL? ""Studies have shown that when LDL falls below this number, plaques in arteries get smaller and they stabilize, which lowers the risk for heart attacks and stroke,"" says Dr. Cannon. But how far below 70 mg/dL should you go? Clinical trials have shown and European guidelines recommend that people with cardiovascular disease at the highest risk should aim for LDL levels below 55 mg/dL. Dr. Cannon notes that the U.S. guidelines have not been updated since 2018, and believes they will eventually follow Europe's lead and make 55 mg/dL the new target for high-risk individuals. What about people who are not at high risk? In most people in this group, LDL levels between 100 and 130 mg/dL may be acceptable. ""However, we still generally aim for LDL levels below 100, since benefits have been seen in trials that look at ways to prevent cardiovascular disease,"" says Dr. Cannon. ""Ultimately, your doctor can suggest the ideal target LDL based on your cardiac risk factors and history."" Lifestyle and medications The first step to lowering high LDL levels is making dietary changes — cutting down on saturated fat by adopting a heart-healthy diet like the Mediterranean, DASH, or other similar plant-based diets — losing weight, and increasing exercise. But often medication is needed to help drive down very high LDL levels and keep them low. This usually begins with a type of drug called a statin. Statins work to lower LDL by blocking an enzyme in the liver that helps make cholesterol. The drugs also have anti-inflammatory properties, and inflammation is a known contributor to plaque buildup. Another benefit: statins help prevent plaques from breaking open and releasing chemicals that stimulate blood clot formation, which leads to heart artery blockage and a heart attack. Depending on your LDL level, your doctor will recommend the best statin and dosage for your situation. The downside to statins is the possible side effects. The most common are achy muscles. If this happens to you, your doctor can temporarily lower the dose or switch to a different statin. While statins are the first-line drug choice, three other classes of medications also can help reduce LDL — ezetimibe (Zetia), bempedoic acid (Nexletol), and PCSK9 inhibitors (Repatha, Praluent, or Leqvio). ""Any of the three can be added to or substituted for statin therapy if people have not reached their LDL goal, or if they cannot tolerate statin side effects,"" says Dr. Cannon. Ezetimibe blocks cholesterol absorption in the intestine. Bempedoic acid and PCSK9 inhibitors work on liver cell receptors to increase the uptake and destruction of LDL cholesterol, thereby lowering LDL blood levels. Can your LDL be too low? Not really, says Dr. Cannon. ""Driving down LDL to really low levels might increase the risk of medication side effects, but there are no problems directly related to very low LDL levels.""

https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/news/20230630/cm/cdc-backs-limited-call-for-rsv-vaccine,CDC Signs Off on RSV Vaccine for Older Adults,1,"June 30, 2023-- The CDC gave a green light this week to two new vaccines to protect against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, in older adults. On Thursday, CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, MD, MPH, agreed with and endorsed the recommendations made last week by CDC advisors that people age 60 and over may get one of two new vaccines for RSV. Decisions should be made based on discussions with one’s health care provider about whether the vaccine is right for them, the federal health agency said. The new vaccines, the first licensed in the U.S. to protect against the respiratory illness, are expected to be available this fall. On June 21, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an independent panel, stopped short of recommending the vaccines for everyone age 65 and above, which was the original question the committee was to consider. The experts amended that question, changing it to whether the panel should recommend the vaccine for those 65 and above if the person and their doctor agreed. The committee voted 9 to 5 in favor. RSV Vaccines RSV leads to 6,000 to 10,000 deaths a year in the U.S. among those age 65 and older and 60,000 to 160,000 hospitalizations in that group. Seniors and infants are among the most vulnerable to the lower respiratory infection, marked by runny nose, wheezing, sneezing, decreased appetite, and fever. The FDA in May approved two vaccines — GSK’s Arexvy and Pfizer’s Abrysvo — for adults age 60 and above. The vote recommending shared decision-making about the vaccine, instead of a routine vaccination recommended for all, “is a weaker recommendation,” said William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Schaffner is a non-voting member of ACIP. He attended the meeting. He said the experts voiced concern about a number of issues, including what some saw as a lack of sufficient data from trials on the most vulnerable groups, such as nursing home residents. Experts also wanted more information about the duration of protection and exactly when a second dose might be needed. At the meeting, a GSK official said its vaccine was 84.6% effective after one and a half seasons, down from 94.1% after one season. A Pfizer official said its vaccine decreased the risk of RSV with three or more symptoms by 78.6% after a season and a half, down from 88.9% after one season. The panel also wanted more data on whether the RSV vaccines could be administered at the same time as other vaccines recommended for adults. Both companies gave a range of cost estimates. Pfizer expects its vaccine to cost $180 to $270 but said it could not guarantee that range. GSK said it expects a price of $200 to $295. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, recommended vaccines are covered under Medicare for those with Part D plans, which 51 million of 65 million Medicare patients have. Commercial insurance is likely to cover the vaccines if the CDC recommends them.",4,-0.39737603,0.34421384,False

The study, published in the March 2024 issue of Menopause, tracked 15 years of data from nearly 2,000 women who were 18 to 30 years old at the study's start. Participants who reported having migraines and persistent ""vasomotor symptoms"" — the medical term describing hot flashes and night sweats — earlier in adulthood were 51% more likely to develop cardiovascular disease over the next 15 years when compared with women who seldom or never experienced the same problems. Stroke risk was even higher — 70% — among women with migraines and persistent vasomotor symptoms over the study period. Women who experience both migraines and early, persistent hot flashes and night sweats can offset the risks for heart disease and stroke by quitting smoking and promptly treating conditions such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, the study authors said.

Aim for at least an hour of exercise per week,1,"Regular exercise promotes better sleep quality and reduces the risk for insomnia. But how much exercise does it take to get sleep benefits? A study published online March 26, 2024, by BMJ Open suggests an answer. Researchers evaluated the sleep questionnaire responses of about 4,400 people (ages 39 to 67) in Europe. Participants reported on their overall health and various aspects of their physical activity and sleep habits (including how long they usually slept each night and any insomnia symptoms they had, such as difficulty falling asleep, nighttime awakenings, or daytime sleepiness). Answers were collected at two points in time, 10 years apart. People who said that they exercised at least twice a week (for a total of at least an hour a week) for the entire 10 years were much less likely to report sleeping difficulties compared with people who reported that they were either inactive or less active during the study period. The study is observational and can't prove conclusively that exercising an hour or more per week will improve sleep. But we know that any amount of exercise is beneficial for health. This study provides an additional incentive to get more active. Image: © kali9/Getty Images",5,0.32960567,0.02998297,False

The single father told the Associated Press he had to in order to control pain enough to support his 9-year-old diabetic son, Jakob. “I wasn’t getting high. I wasn’t abusing them. I was using them to be able to work and provide for my son,” Blodgett said. “Unfortunately, they are illegal. I can’t get around that. But they were stronger than my meds, and they were working.” Original image source. Arizona authorities arrested Blodgett for drug possession, and the state’s family police agency threw his son into foster care. Just two weeks later the boy was dead. From the AP story: A medical examiner listed Jakob’s death in late December as natural with complications from diabetes, a condition he was diagnosed with as a toddler. Specifically, Type 1 diabetes, which means his body was unable to produce enough insulin to survive. Blodgett said he suspects the Arizona Department of Child Safety failed in its duty to protect his son, either by not monitoring his blood sugar levels or not ensuring that Jakob had enough insulin to prevent a serious, life-threatening complication known as ketoacidosis. “They couldn’t keep him alive for two weeks, two weeks,” the father told the Associated Press … The story reminded me of another parent with a similar history of addiction. Back in the 1960s and 1970s, long before my family moved to Alexandria, Virginia, this addict raised her children in our neighborhood. It happened to her as it does to so many others. It started with prescription opioid painkillers. She got hooked. Unlike Blodgett, this addict got hooked on booze, too. “I liked alcohol, it made me feel warm,” she would later say. “And I loved pills. They took away my tension and my pain.” On top of that, this addict had serious mental health issues. She was what the tabloids would have called a “druggie mom” – if she were poor, and especially if she were poor and nonwhite. Yet during all this time, no one took away her children. She was never even investigated. And in 1974, when her husband suddenly got a new job and they had to move to D.C., no one from a family police agency ever knocked at the door of the family’s new address: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. On the contrary: Betty Ford was hailed as a hero, and deservedly so, when she publicly disclosed her addictions and got treatment. She even established a celebrity rehab center. Gallup polls found she was one of America’s ten most admired women every year through 1991 – the year she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And the house where this “druggie mom” raised her kids is now a National Historic Landmark. Ah, defenders of this double standard might say, there was no evidence Betty Ford’s addiction impaired her ability to raise her children. Of course it didn’t. Because she had money. She could get all the childrearing help she may have needed and, eventually, the best drug treatment money could buy. There’s no evidence Richard Blodgett’s drug use impaired his ability to raise his child, either, even without all that help. In fact, the available evidence suggests that the biggest dangers to Jakob Blodgett were the police who arrested his father and the family police who forced the boy into foster care. The fact is, the world is full of Betty Fords – people who, for all sorts of reasons, use drugs without endangering their children. And where there really is a danger, the solution is giving those other parents a small fraction of the resources Betty Ford had. We need to apply the Betty Ford standard to all parents with substance abuse issues. If only someone in Arizona had thought of that, Jakob Blodgett might be alive today.

The FDA warns that it has not reviewed the safety and effectiveness of these devices, and using them could result in inaccurate blood sugar measurements. That could be dangerous for people with diabetes, who must manage their condition by checking their blood sugar levels regularly — typically with a finger prick blood test or a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) that uses tiny sensor wires that pierce the skin frequently and send information to a smartphone app. The FDA warning does not apply to CGMs, only to smart rings or smart watches with marketing promises for needle-free monitoring. If you have concerns about the accuracy of your monitor, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about whether it's an FDA-authorized, reliable blood glucose–measuring device.

https://healthimpactnews.com/2023/new-u-s-government-research-is-finally-admitting-that-glyphosate-weed-killer-causes-cancer/,New U.S. Government Research is Finally Admitting that Glyphosate Weed Killer Causes Cancer,0,"Comments by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News If you have already had something to eat today prior to reading this article, chances are very high that you have already ingested glyphosate, the active ingredient in herbicides such as RoundUp, the most widely used agrochemical in the world. Since I have earned my living for the past two decades by selling clean food, I have been warning the public now for many years about the dangers of these agrochemicals and the contamination of our nation’s commercial food supply. If you do a search on “glyphosate” at Health Impact News, you will get search result list of over 380 articles that we have published during the past decade. The advent of genetically modified (GMO) seeds in the late 1990s, particularly corn and soybeans, has allowed the agricultural chemical giants, such as Monsanto, to spray greater quantities of herbicides and pesticides onto the nation’s crops. In 2014 we began testing commercial grain products to verify that North America’s wheat and grain supply was contaminated by the herbicide glyphosate, even though there are currently no GMO varieties of wheat or other grains. We found it to be true, due to the practice of “desiccating” crops in the fall with glyphosate in the northern states and Canada to allow the farmers to harvest their wheat before the first snowfall. Next, we tested our own USDA certified organic grains that we sold in our online store, and were shocked to find out that they were just as contaminated with glyphosate as non-organic grains. See: We immediately stopped selling our USDA organic grains, including corn, and began an intensive period of our company’s history in searching out clean sources of grains and corn that tested free of any glyphosate contamination. In fact, we now test ALL of the food we sell for the presence of glyphosate, and if a test turns out positive, we don’t sell it. Click or tap here to learn more about our standards. This has forced us to source much of our food from outside the U.S. We only know of a few wheat and grain farmers in the U.S. who consistently harvest grains that test free of glyphosate, and many of our grain products are actually imported from Italy where we have had greater success in finding small farms that protect against glyphosate contamination. Corn produced the biggest challenge for us, and to this day we cannot find consistent clean sources of corn in North America, that not only test free of glyphosate, but also test free of GMO contamination, and that includes USDA certified organic corn. For the past several years we have been sourcing and selling corn from central Mexico where GMO corn is banned. This means that if you do any shopping at a grocery store chain, the most dangerous aisle, by far, is the aisle that contains cereals. I don’t even bother going down that aisle on the rare occasions where I visit a grocery store selling commodity food, as it is like choosing which kind of poison you want. Outside of corn, oats are also among the most contaminated grains in America, with some testing done on American oat products showing 100% contamination. We are probably one of the only places in the U.S. where one can purchase oats that have tested clean for the presence of glyphosate. We import them from Italy. If you are new to this topic, I encourage you to read some of the articles we have published over the years on the glyphosate contamination issue, and the earlier works of scientists who were censored, such as Dr. Anthony Samsel and Dr. Stephanie Seneff. Many people believe today that they are “gluten-insensitive” when in fact they are probably just allergic to glyphosate and other poisons in our grain supply. Others go even further, especially those who follow the “paleo diet” philosophy, and wrongly conclude that grains were never meant to be consumed by humans. And that is just false. Jesus himself referred to grains as an analogy of “life.” Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will not be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.” (John 6:35) by Carey Gillam The New Lede New research by top US government scientists has found that people exposed to the widely used weed killing chemical glyphosate have biomarkers in their urine linked to the development of cancer and other diseases. The study, published last week in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, measured glyphosate levels in the urine of farmers and other study participants and determined that the presence of high levels of the pesticide were associated with signs of a reaction in the body called oxidative stress, a condition that causes damage to DNA. Oxidative stress is considered by health experts as a key characteristic of carcinogens. The authors of the paper – 10 scientists with the National Institutes of Health and two from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – concluded that their study “contributes to the weight of evidence supporting an association between glyphosate exposure and oxidative stress in humans.” They also noted that “accumulating evidence supports the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of hematologic cancers,” such as lymphoma, myeloma and leukemia. “Oxidative stress is not something you want to have,” said Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and former director of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences. “This study increases our understanding that glyphosate has the potential to cause cancer.” The study findings come after the CDC reported last year that more than 80% of urine samples drawn from children and adults contained glyphosate. The CDC reported that out of 2,310 urine samples taken from a group of Americans intended to be representative of the US population, 1,885 were laced with detectable traces of glyphosate. Glyphosate is the most heavily applied herbicide in history, both in the US and globally. One of the best-known glyphosate-based products is Monsanto’s Roundup weedkiller. Roundup has been used by farmers as well as consumers for more than 40 years. Officials with Monsanto and its German owner Bayer AG have always assured the public and regulators that exposure to the weed killer does not pose a threat to human health. Bayer said the new NIH study has many “significant methodological limitations that affects its reliability,” and said the results conflict with other government research. “The increased oxidative stress found in the study could have been caused by any number of non-glyphosate related factors or a combination of them, and the study does not support the conclusion that glyphosate is the cause,” Bayer said in a statement. People are exposed to glyphosate by using products made with the chemical and also by eating food and drinking water contaminated with the pesticide. Scientists have found glyphosate residues in an array of popular foods and in waterways across the US. Notably, in the new paper, the NIH and CDC scientists said that while their study focused on farmers who were exposed to glyphosate when they sprayed it on fields, they saw similar results in “non-farmers.” The findings suggest “these effects may apply more broadly to the general population who are primarily exposed through ingestion of contaminated food and water or residential applications,” the study authors wrote. The study is so significant that it warrants regulatory attention, said some independent scientists. “This is a top level team of investigators and a highly credible study to which regulators need to pay attention,” said Phil Landrigan, a pediatrician and epidemiologist who worked for years at the CDC and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and now directs the Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good at Boston College. Michael Antoniou, a scientist with the department of medical and molecular genetics at King’s College in London who has been researching glyphosate for years, said the results were “worrying,” with “major health implications.” The new government-funded study comes at a time when both the EPA and European regulators are completing updated assessments of glyphosate safety, and as health advocates are pushing for limits on use of the chemical or requirements that products such as Roundup be labeled with a cancer warning. A European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) spokesperson said the agency was aware of the study and would consider whether or not the findings add “new evidence” as the agency completes its new glyphosate assessment. EFSA’s conclusions are due in July. The EPA also said it was looking over the new study and would “carefully review” the findings as it finalizes its assessment. “EPA takes very seriously our duty to protect human health and the environment,” the agency said in a statement. The study also comes as Monsanto and Bayer remain mired in litigation brought by tens of thousands of cancer patients who claim exposure to Roundup caused them to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The company has already agreed to pay out more than $11 billion to settle the bulk of the claims – without admitting any liability – but many cases have not settled and civil trials are continuing. Bayer is also facing a surge in investor unrest and calls for a break-up and the ouster of top leaders after the company lost 40% of its market value following its 2018 acquisition of Monsanto. Bayer maintains that glyphosate does not cause cancer and that products made with it can be used safety. The company states on its website that EPA and other regulatory reviews provide an “extensive body of research” that back the company’s safety pledge. Though some countries have moved to ban glyphosate products, regulatory agencies in many countries say there is a lack of evidence connecting glyphosate herbicides to cancer, and that it is one of the safest and most effective herbicides available. Last year, a risk assessment committee of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) concluded after reviewing multiple studies that there was no justification for classifying glyphosate as a carcinogen. Many large US farm groups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Cotton Council, and American Sugarbeet Growers Association, also say that glyphosate doesn’t cause cancer. The EPA has said for years that it considers glyphosate as “not likely” to be carcinogenic, and in a 2020 updated review, the agency reiterated it saw no “human health risks of concern.” But the agency was forced to withdraw that safety determination last year after a federal appellate court invalidated the EPA’s assessment. The court ruling said that the EPA did not properly follow scientific guidelines when it determined glyphosate was not carcinogenic, ignoring expert advice from scientific advisers and using “inconsistent reasoning.” The EPA now is revisiting its glyphosate evaluation and expects to issue a decision for glyphosate in 2026. Debate over the safety of glyphosate has persisted for years and intensified after the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a unit of the World Health Organization, declared it “probably carcinogenic to humans” in 2015. The new findings are not the first to look at glyphosate and oxidative stress. Animal studies and cellular studies have also found an association. But there are only a handful of such studies in humans. The NIH study is the “largest investigation to date of the relationship between glyphosate exposure and oxidative stress markers,” said Jonathan Hofmann, an author of the study from the NIH’s National Cancer Institute. Scientists say it is important to examine substances that may cause oxidative stress because a large body of scientific evidence suggests that long-term oxidative stress contributes to the development not only of cancer but also a range of chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and reproductive problems, including male infertility. One prior human study related to glyphosate and oxidative stress was published last year by a team of scientists specializing in public and environmental health at several US universities. Those researchers analyzed 347 urine samples collected from pregnant women, finding that higher levels of oxidative stress biomarkers were seen in the samples containing concentrations of aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA), a substance created when glyphosate breaks down in soil and water. The authors of that paper noted that glyphosate and AMPA have been shown to disrupt hormone function and warned that more research was needed due to glyphosate’s “persistence within the environment, and potential for adverse effects during pregnancy.” The new NIH study is considered part of the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a long-term examination of the health impacts of pesticide use on farmers funded by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in collaboration with the EPA. Other AHS studies have provided sometimes conflicting findings on the question of whether or not glyphosate can cause cancer, but the scientists authoring the latest research said their study was distinctive for several reasons, including using urinary glyphosate exposure measurements and pesticide exposure histories for study subjects and including people who are not farmers. The researchers said that though the associations between glyphosate and biomarkers of oxidative stress “mainly appear to reflect effects of recent occupational exposure, there was also some evidence of associations with longer-term exposure.” Investigators at the NIH are exploring potential opportunities to follow up on these findings and address needs for future research, Hofmann said. Lorette Picciano, executive director of the Rural Coalition alliance of farm workers, said she hopes the EPA will pay attention to the study. “People are dying of these cancers,” she said. “This study is very important.” Read the full article at The New Lede.",8,-0.058066647,0.022547409,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ptsd-how-is-treatment-changing-202405153041,PTSD: How is treatment changing?,1,"Over the course of a lifetime, as many as seven in 10 adults in the United States will directly experience or witness harrowing events. These include gun violence, car accidents, and other personal trauma; natural or human-made disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina and the 9/11 terrorist attacks; and military combat. And some — though not all — will experience post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. New guidelines released in 2024 can help guide effective treatment. What is PTSD? PTSD is a potentially debilitating mental health condition. It's marked by recurrent, frightening episodes during which a person relives a traumatic event. After a disturbing event, it's normal to have upsetting memories, feel on edge, and have trouble sleeping. For most people, these symptoms fade over time. But when certain symptoms persist for more than a month, a person may be experiencing PTSD. These symptoms include recurring nightmares or intrusive thoughts about the event feeling emotionally numb and disconnected withdrawing from people and certain situations being jumpy and on guard. The National Center for PTSD offers a brief self-screening test online, which can help you decide whether to seek more information and help. Who is more likely to experience PTSD? Not everyone who experiences violence, disasters, and other upsetting events goes on to develop PTSD. However, military personnel exposed to combat in a war zone are especially vulnerable. About 11% to 20% of veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan have PTSD, according to the National Center for PTSD. What about people who were not in the military? Within the general population, estimates suggest PTSD occurs in 4% of men and 8% of women — a difference at least partly related to the fact that women are more likely to experience sexual assault. What are the new guidelines for PTSD treatment? Experts from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense collaborated on new guidelines for treating PTSD. They detailed the evidence both for and against specific therapies for PTSD. Their findings apply to civilian and military personnel alike, says Dr. Sofia Matta, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital and senior director of medical services at Home Base, a nonprofit organization that provides care for veterans, service members, and their families. The circle of care is widely drawn for good reason. ""It's important to recognize that PTSD doesn't just affect the person who is suffering but also their families and sometimes, their entire community,"" Dr. Matta says. The rise in mass shootings in public places and the aftermath of these events are a grim reminder of this reality, she adds. Which treatment approaches are most effective for PTSD? The new guidelines looked at psychotherapy, medications, nondrug therapies. Psychotherapy, sometimes paired with certain medicines, emerged as the most effective approach. The experts also recommended not taking certain drugs due to lack of evidence or possible harm. Which psychotherapies are recommended for PTSD? The recommended treatment for PTSD, psychotherapy, is more effective than medication. It also has fewer adverse side effects and people prefer it, according to the guidelines. Which type of psychotherapy can help? Importantly, the most effective therapies for people with PTSD differ from those for people with other mental health issues, says Dr. Matta. Both cognitive processing therapy and prolonged exposure therapy were effective. These two therapies teach people how to evaluate and reframe the upsetting thoughts stemming from the traumatic experience. The guidelines also recommend mindfulness-based stress reduction, an eight-week program that includes meditation, body scanning, and simple yoga stretches. Which medications are recommended for PTSD? Some people with severe symptoms need medication to feel well enough to participate in therapy. ""People with PTSD often don't sleep well due to insomnia and nightmares, and the resulting fatigue makes it hard to pay attention and concentrate,"" says Dr. Matta. Three medicines commonly prescribed for depression and anxiety — paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), and venlafaxine (Effexor) — are recommended. Prazosin (Minipress) may help people with nightmares, but the evidence is weak. Which medications are not recommended for PTSD? The guidelines strongly recommended not taking benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety drugs often taken for sleep). Benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax) and clonazepam (Klonopin) offer no proven benefits for people with PTSD. They have several potential harms, including negative cognitive changes and decreased effectiveness of PTSD psychotherapies. What about cannabis, psychedelics, and brain stimulation therapies? Right now, evidence doesn't support the idea that cannabis helps ease PTSD symptoms. And there are possible serious side effects from the drug, such as cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (severe vomiting related to long-term cannabis use). There isn't enough evidence to recommend for or against psychedelic-assisted therapies such as psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and MDMA (ecstasy). ""Because these potential therapies are illegal under federal law, the barriers for conducting research on them are very high,"" says Dr. Matta. However, recent legislative reforms may make such studies more feasible. Likewise, the evidence is mixed for a wide range of other nondrug therapies, such as brain stimulation therapies like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation.",7,0.03468281,-0.12625083,False

Today, they recommended that all Americans be injected with COVID shots every year. Source. The U.S. Government’s own funded study from 2011 determined that less than 1% of all vaccine adverse events are ever reported to VAERS. (Source.)

This is not a “conspiracy theory.” These are facts derived from Government statistics that should be used as evidence to not only stop injecting people with deadly COVID “vaccines,” but to start prosecuting the criminals responsible for murdering people, from the drug companies, to the FDA, to the CDC, to every single doctor, nurse, or other medical personnel who participated in these murders. And of course these criminal charges of mass murder should start with the man who takes credit for the entire “operation” and started it all, and continues to this day to take credit for this criminal operation, which is clearly a population-reduction operation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/new-urine-test-may-help-some-men-with-elevated-psa-avoid-biopsy-202405063038,New urine test may help some men with elevated PSA avoid biopsy,1,"When a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test produces an abnormal result, the next step is usually a prostate biopsy. A biopsy can confirm or rule out a cancer diagnosis, but it also has certain drawbacks. Prostate biopsies are invasive procedures with potential side effects, and they often detect low-grade, slow-growing tumors that may not need immediate treatment — or any treatment at all. Researchers are exploring various strategies for avoiding unnecessary biopsies. Specialized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, for instance, can be useful for predicting if a man's tumor is likely to spread. A blood test called the Prostate Health Index (PHI) measures various forms of PSA, and can help doctors determine if a biopsy is needed. In April, researchers at the University of Michigan published results with a test that screens for prostate cancer in urine samples. Called the MyProstateScore 2.0 (MPS2) test, it looks for 18 different genes associated with high-grade tumors. ""If you're negative on this test, it's almost certain that you don't have aggressive prostate cancer,"" said Dr. Arul Chinnaiyan, a professor of pathology and urology at the University, in a press release. Gathering data and further testing To create the test, Dr. Chinnaiyan and his colleagues first turned to publicly-available databases containing over 58,000 prostate cancer-associated genes. From that initial pool, they narrowed down to 54 genes that are uniquely overexpressed in cancers classified as Grade Group 2 (GG2) or higher. The Grade Group system ranks prostate cancers from GG1 (the least dangerous) to GG5 (the most dangerous). The team tested those 54 genes against archived urine samples from 761 men with elevated PSA who were scheduled for biopsy. This effort yielded 18 genes that consistently correlated with high-grade cancer in the biopsy specimens. These genes now make up MPS2. Then the team validated the test by performing MPS2 testing on over 800 archived urine samples collected by a national prostate cancer research consortium. Other researchers affiliated with that consortium assessed the new urine test's results against patient records. Interpreting the results Study findings showed that MPS2 correctly identified 95% of the GG2 prostate cancers and 99% of cancers that were GG3 or higher. Test accuracy was further improved by incorporating estimates of the prostate's size (or volume, as it's also called). According to the team's calculations, use of the MPS2 would have reduced unnecessary biopsies by 37%. If volume was included in the measure, then 41% of biopsies would have been avoided. By comparison, just 26% of biopsies would have been avoided with the PHI. Dr. Chinnaiyan and his co-authors emphasize that ruling out high-grade cancer with a urine test offers some advantages over MRI. The specialized multi-parametric MRI scans needed to assess high-grade cancer in men with elevated PSA aren't always available in community settings, for instance. Moreover, the interpretation of mpMRI results can vary from one radiologist to another. Importantly, the MPS2 can be updated over time as new prostate-cancer genes are identified. Commentary Dr. Boris Gershman, a urologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, and a member of the advisory and editorial board for the Harvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases, described the new study results as promising. ""It does appear that the performance of the 18-gene urine test is better than PSA alone,"" he says. But Dr. Gershman adds that it will be important to consider how such a test will fit into the current two-stage approach for PSA screening, which entails prostate MRI when the PSA is abnormal. Where MRI delivers a yes/no result (meaning lesions that look suspicious for cancer are either present or not), the MPS2 provides numerical risk estimates ranging between 0% and 100%. ""The challenge with clinical implementation of a continuous risk score is where to draw the line for biopsy,"" Dr. Gershman says. ""This research is very encouraging, since many men in rural areas may not have access to prostate MRI machines or the added sophistication that is needed in interpreting these MRI scans,"" says Dr. Marc Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""A widely available urine test may eventually help provide more precision in determining who should undergo a prostate biopsy, and may also help to assess the probability that a cancer is clinically significant and in need of treatment.""",7,0.022122575,0.01987937,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/dupuytrens-contracture-of-the-hand-202404303037,Dupuytren's contracture of the hand,1,"One of the more unusual conditions affecting the hands and fingers is Dupuytren's contracture (also called Dupuytren's disease). Here, one or more fingers become curled, which can make it difficult to pick up or hold objects or perform everyday activities. Legend says the condition originated with the Vikings of Northern Europe, although this is debated. It was later named after the 19th-century French surgeon Guillaume Dupuytren, who did the first successful operation on the condition. Fast-forward to the 21st century, and Dupuytren's contracture now affects about one in 20 Americans. What is Dupuytren's contracture? Fascia is a sheet of fibrous tissue beneath the skin of the fingers and the palm. Dupuytren's contracture is a thickening and shortening of this tissue. This thickened area begins as a hard lump called a nodule. Over years to decades, it may progress to a thick band called a cord that causes one or more fingers to curl toward the palm and become stuck in a bent position. This can make it difficult to grasp objects, button clothes, use a computer, or perform other daily tasks. The condition does not always get progressively worse. It may be stable for years or even improve in some people. Which fingers are most likely to be affected? The ring and pinky fingers are most often affected. But the condition can strike all fingers and the thumb. ""In about half of cases, the condition can affect both hands,"" says Dr. Phillip Blazar, an orthopedic surgeon and Division Chief of Hand and Upper Extremity at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Fortunately, it rarely causes pain. What causes Dupuytren's contracture? Currently, the cause is unclear. Still, several factors can increase a person's risk, such as Genetics: This condition is more common in people with Northern European, British Isles, or Scandinavian ancestry. Gender: Men are affected more often than women. Age: The condition often occurs after age 50. Family history of the disease. People with diabetes and seizure disorders are also more likely to have Dupuytren's. The condition may appear and/or worsen after trauma to the hand. How is Dupuytren's contracture treated? Although there is no cure, treatments and occupational or physical therapy can help address symptoms and improve finger mobility. ""Many people who have mild cases of Dupuytren's find it has little impact on their ability to use their hands,"" says Dr. Blazar. However, moderate or severe cases can interfere with hand function. It's possible to restore normal finger motion with nonsurgical treatments, such as: Collagenase injection. This procedure is done in the doctor's office. An enzyme called collagenase is injected into the cords of your hand, which breaks down and dissolves the thickened tissue. At a follow-up visit, your doctor will give you local anesthesia and then snap the cords by manipulating and straightening your fingers in the direction in which they are unable to move. Needle aponeurotomy. This in-office procedure involves passing a hypodermic needle back and forth through the restrictive cords to weaken and break them. ""Your hand surgeon will discuss both treatment options to determine which is best for your situation,"" says Dr. Blazar. ""There are also some variations in the anatomy of the disease which may make one treatment or the other less favorable for a particular person or finger."" Both of these treatments don't remove the cords, and the condition can return and require additional treatment. What about surgical treatment? If nonsurgical treatment does not relieve symptoms or you have a severe condition, surgery may be recommended. Surgical approaches include: Fasciotomy. An incision is made in your palm to divide the thickened tissue in the cord. Subtotal palmar fasciectomy. A zigzag incision is made along the creases in the hand to remove the abnormal tissue and cord. Occasionally, a skin graft may be needed to help the wound heal. You wear a splint on the repaired hand during recovery. People should expect some pain, stiffness, and swelling afterward. The length of recovery varies for each individual, and also with how many fingers were operated on and which ones. ""Most people largely recover by three months, but some may not feel fully recovered for quite a bit longer,"" says Dr. Blazar. Hand therapists can also help with strength and flexibility exercises to speed recovery. Most people's fingers move better after surgery. However, as with nonsurgical treatments, the contracture can come back, so some people may need additional surgery later on.",0,0.15209459,-0.18405192,False

I have a couple of brown skin patches that look like age spots. But my friend says they might be sun spots, which can develop into skin cancer. How can I tell the difference? A. It's an important question, since distinguishing sun spots from age spots — or ""liver"" spots, as our grandmothers called them — can help us determine when to seek a doctor's evaluation. Both spots tend to appear on areas that get a lot of sun exposure, such as the face, hands, arms, and shoulders. The color of age spots ranges from pink to tan to brown. They're bigger than freckles and usually oval-shaped. They're often found in clusters. Age spots can be unsightly, but they are harmless. Sun spots, known medically as actinic keratoses, come in a variety of colors. The biggest difference between harmless age spots and sun spots (actinic keratoses) is the texture. Age spots are smooth and flat, but potentially dangerous actinic keratoses usually feel rough and scaly. Actinic keratoses can develop into skin cancer, so it's vital that you show any such spots to your doctor. And if you're in doubt about any type of skin changes, it's also wise to point those out.

But which types of exercise are most effective? An analysis of 215 studies published online Feb. 14, 2024, by The BMJ compared how several different forms of exercise help with depression. The options included walking, running, yoga, tai chi, qi gong, aerobic exercise, and strength training. The researchers also looked at the effectiveness of exercise when combined with therapy and antidepressants. The study found that for people using exercise as the only treatment for depression, the most effective types were walking, running, yoga, strength training, and dancing. Among people who combined exercise with talk therapy, the standouts were yoga, tai chi, and aerobic exercise, especially for men and older adults. People who took antidepressants and did any form of exercise fared better than those who only took medication. The researchers noted that while higher-intensity exercise was most helpful for depression, any consistent exercise is better than none. It also didn't matter how long people exercised during a typical workout or if they exercised only once a week or more. Image: © Westend61/Getty Images",5,0.31416947,-0.05924587,False

International travelers are particularly at risk, the CDC said, noting that 88% of all cases in the U.S. so far this year are linked to international travel. “Based on current estimates, twice as many Americans are planning to travel internationally in 2023 compared with 2022,” according to the advisory published Wednesday. “Many countries and popular travel destinations, such as London, England, have experienced measles outbreaks in recent years.” Measles is so contagious that 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people who come in contact with someone with measles will contract the viral illness, which can remain in the air or on surfaces for 2 hours after an infected person leaves an area. One vaccine dose is 93% effective at prevention, and two doses are 97% effective. Measles symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose, and rash, but severe cases can cause pneumonia, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and death. A 4-month-long outbreak of measles in Ohio ended in February after 85 children were infected, 80 of whom were unvaccinated. The others were partially vaccinated or didn’t have documented vaccinations. Thirty-six of the children had to be hospitalized, and 61 of them were 2 years old or younger. The recommended timing and number of measles vaccine doses for international travelers vary in some cases, compared to guidelines for people who only travel domestically. The CDC said international travelers should consult their doctor several weeks beforehand to discuss vaccinations. For infants and very young children who will be traveling internationally, measles vaccines are needed earlier and closer together than the usual pediatric vaccine schedule, the CDC said. “After international travel, you should watch for signs and symptoms of measles for 3 weeks after you return to the United States,” the CDC instructed travelers in the advisory. “If you or your child gets sick with a rash and a high fever, call your doctor. Tell them you traveled abroad and whether you or your child have received MMR vaccine.” Last year, there were 121 cases of measles reported to the CDC. So far this year, there have been 16 cases. Two people from the same household in California tested positive this week, NBC News reported. ""These cases are reminders of the critical role of vaccinations in protecting the community,"" Rais Vohra, MD, the health officer for Fresno County, CA, told the news outlet. ""We urge all parents to please work with your pediatrician or contact the health department to help get your child up-to-date on vaccinations.""",4,-0.34443468,0.22829856,False

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-eggs-risky-for-heart-health,Are eggs risky for heart health?,1,"For most people, an egg a day does not increase your risk of a heart attack, a stroke, or any other type of cardiovascular disease. In the past, it seemed logical to think eggs would be bad for your heart health. We knew that the cholesterol in eggs came from the egg yolks, and we knew that high levels of cholesterol, especially LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood increased the risk of cardiovascular disease. So, it seemed logical that avoiding cholesterol in the diet made sense. Since then, however, research has shown that most of the cholesterol in our body is made by our liver — it doesn't come from cholesterol we eat. The liver is stimulated to make cholesterol primarily by saturated fat and trans fat in our diet, not dietary cholesterol. But a large egg contains little saturated fat — about 1.5 grams (g). And research has confirmed that eggs also contain many healthy nutrients: lutein and zeaxanthin, which are good for the eyes; choline, which is good for the brain and nerves; and various vitamins (A, B, and D). In fact, just one large egg contains 270 international units (IU) of vitamin A and 41 IU of vitamin D. One large egg also contains about 6 g of protein and 72 calories. The evidence that cholesterol in one egg a day is safe for most people comes from huge studies — many conducted here at Harvard Medical School — that have followed hundreds of thousands of people over decades. They regularly report what they eat and all of the medical conditions that they develop. It is those studies that do not find higher rates of heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular diseases in people who eat up to one egg per day. Of course, it matters greatly what you eat with your eggs. The saturated fat in butter, cheese, bacon, sausage, muffins, or scones, for example, raises your blood cholesterol much more than the cholesterol in your egg. And the highly refined ""bad carbs"" in white toast, pastries, home fries, and hash browns may also increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/treating-female-pattern-hair-loss,Treating female pattern hair loss,1,"About one-third of women experience hair loss (alopecia) at some time in their lives; among postmenopausal women, as many as two-thirds suffer hair thinning or bald spots. Hair loss in women often has a greater impact than hair loss does on men, because it's less socially acceptable for them. Alopecia can severely affect a woman's emotional well-being and quality of life. The main type of hair loss in women is the same as it is men. It's called androgenetic alopecia, or female (or male) pattern hair loss. In men, hair loss usually begins above the temples, and the receding hairline eventually forms a characteristic ""M"" shape; hair at the top of the head also thins, often progressing to baldness. In women, androgenetic alopecia begins with gradual thinning at the part line, followed by increasing diffuse hair loss radiating from the top of the head. A woman's hairline rarely recedes, and women rarely become bald. There are many potential causes of hair loss in women, including medical conditions, medications, and physical or emotional stress. If you notice unusual hair loss of any kind, it's important to see your primary care provider or a dermatologist, to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. You may also want to ask your clinician for a referral to a therapist or support group to address emotional difficulties. Hair loss in women can be frustrating, but recent years have seen an increase in resources for coping with the problem. Patterns of female hair loss Clinicians use the Ludwig Classification to describe female pattern hair loss. Type I is minimal thinning that can be camouflaged with hair styling techniques. Type II is characterized by decreased volume and noticeable widening of the mid-line part. Type III describes diffuse thinning, with a see-through appearance on the top of the scalp. What is androgenetic alopecia? Almost every woman eventually develops some degree of female pattern hair loss. It can start any time after the onset of puberty, but women tend to first notice it around menopause, when hair loss typically increases. The risk rises with age, and it's higher for women with a history of hair loss on either side of the family. As the name suggests, androgenetic alopecia involves the action of the hormones called androgens, which are essential for normal male sexual development and have other important functions in both sexes, including sex drive and regulation of hair growth. The condition may be inherited and involve several different genes. It can also result from an underlying endocrine condition, such as overproduction of androgen or an androgen-secreting tumor on the ovary, pituitary, or adrenal gland. In either case, the alopecia is likely related to increased androgen activity. But unlike androgenetic alopecia in men, in women the precise role of androgens is harder to determine. In either sex, hair loss from androgenetic alopecia occurs because of a genetically determined shortening of anagen, a hair's growing phase, and a lengthening of the time between the shedding of a hair and the start of a new anagen phase. (See ""Life cycle of a hair."") That means it takes longer for hair to start growing back after it is shed in the course of the normal growth cycle. The hair follicle itself also changes, shrinking and producing a shorter, thinner hair shaft — a process called ""follicular miniaturization."" As a result, thicker, pigmented, longer-lived ""terminal"" hairs are replaced by shorter, thinner, non-pigmented hairs called ""vellus."" Life cycle of a hair Each hair develops from a follicle — a narrow pocket in the skin — and goes through three phases of growth. Anagen (A), the active growth phase, lasts two to seven years. Catagen (B), the transition phase, lasts about two weeks. During this phase, the hair shaft moves upward toward the skin's surface, and the dermal papilla (the structure that nourishes cells that give rise to hair) begins to separate from the follicle. Telogen (C), the resting phase, lasts around three months and culminates in the shedding of the hair shaft. A clinician diagnoses female pattern hair loss by taking a medical history and examining the scalp. She or he will observe the pattern of hair loss, check for signs of inflammation or infection, and possibly order blood tests to investigate other possible causes of hair loss, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and iron deficiency. Unless there are signs of excess androgen activity (such as menstrual irregularities, acne, and unwanted hair growth), a hormonal evaluation is usually unnecessary. How to stop thinning hair: Hair loss treatment for women Medications are the most common treatment for hair loss in women. They include the following: Minoxidil (Rogaine, generic versions). This drug was initially introduced as a treatment for high blood pressure, but people who took it noticed that they were growing hair in places where they had lost it. Research studies confirmed that minoxidil applied directly to the scalp could stimulate hair growth. As a result of the studies, the FDA originally approved over-the-counter 2% minoxidil to treat hair loss in women. Since then a 5% solution has also become available when a stronger solution is need for a woman's hair loss. Clearly, minoxidil is not a miracle drug. While it can produce some new growth of fine hair in some — not all — women, it can't restore the full density of the lost hair. It's not a quick fix, either for hair loss in women. You won't see results until you use the drug for at least two months. The effect often peaks at around four months, but it could take longer, so plan on a trial of six to 12 months. If minoxidil works for you, you'll need to keep using it to maintain those results. If you stop, you'll start to lose hair again. How to use minoxidil: Be sure that your hair and scalp are dry. Using the dropper or spray pump that's provided with the over-the-counter solution, apply it twice daily to every area where your hair is thinning. Gently massage it into the scalp with your fingers so it can reach the hair follicles. Then air-dry your hair, wash your hands thoroughly, and wash off any solution that has dripped onto your forehead or face. Don't shampoo for at least four hours afterwards. Some women find that the minoxidil solution leaves a deposit that dries and irritates their scalp. This irritation, called contact dermatitis, is probably caused not by the minoxidil itself, but rather by the alcohol that is included to facilitate drying. Side effects and concerns: Minoxidil is safe, but it can have unpleasant side effects even apart from the alcohol-related skin irritation. Sometimes the new hair differs in color and texture from surrounding hair. Another risk is hypertrichosis — excessive hair growth in the wrong places, such as the cheeks or forehead. (This problem is more likely with the stronger 5% solution.) Because the patent on Rogaine (the brand-name version of minoxidil) has expired, many generic products are available. They all contain the same amount of minoxidil, but some include additional ingredients, such as herbal extracts, which might trigger allergic reactions. Anti-androgens. Androgens include testosterone and other ""male"" hormones, which can accelerate hair loss in women. Some women who don't respond to minoxidil may benefit from the addition of the diuretic drug spironolactone (Aldactone) for treatment of androgenic alopecia because this drug has anti-androgen properties. This medication is especially helpful for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) because they tend to make excess androgens. Doctors will usually prescribe spironolactone together with an oral contraceptive for women of reproductive age. (A woman taking one of these drugs should not become pregnant because they can cause genital abnormalities in a male fetus.) Possible side effects include dizziness, excess thirst, loss of appetite, weight gain, loss of libido, and fatigue. If spirolactone is not effective, another medication with anti-androgen properties such as finasteride may help. Iron supplements. Iron deficiency could be a cause of hair loss in some women. Your doctor may test your blood iron level, particularly if you're a vegetarian, have a history of anemia, or have heavy menstrual bleeding. If you do have iron deficiency, you will need to take a supplement and it may stop your hair loss. However, if your iron level is normal, taking extra iron will only cause side effects, such as stomach upset and constipation. Other treatments. If other treatments are not effective, laser therapy or platelet-rich plasma injections may be recommended. Hair transplantation Hair transplantation, a procedure used in the United States since the 1950s to treat androgenic alopecia, involves removing a strip of scalp from the back of the head and using it to fill in a bald patch. Today, 90% of hair-transplant surgeons use a technique called follicular unit transplantation, which was introduced in the mid-1990s. During this procedure, surgeons remove a narrow strip of scalp and divide it into hundreds of tiny grafts, each containing just a few hairs. Each graft is planted in a slit in the scalp created by a blade or needle in the area of missing hair. Hair grows naturally this way, in small clusters of one to four follicles, called follicular units. As a result, the graft looks better than the larger ""plugs"" associated with hair transplants of yesteryear. Not everyone with female pattern hair loss is a good candidate for hair transplantation, especially if hair loss is widespread and severe. In addition, hair transplantation is expensive, can be time-intensive, and is not always successful.",0,0.2200706,-0.13090906,False

Jesus Christ is the Only ""Transhuman"" the World Has Ever Seen or Will Ever See",0,"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News As the year 2022 comes to a close, there can be little doubt that the United States is a nation in decline, in many ways. More and more people are waking up to the fact that the U.S. Government is not looking out for the best interests of its citizens, and in fact is part of the Global plan to implement a New World Order. And a big part of that plan, is to reduce the world’s population, something we saw accelerate in 2022 with unprecedented “unexplained sudden deaths” among young, healthy adults, as well as unprecedented fetal deaths. It is a shame that it took a worldwide scam known as “COVID-19” and then the roll out of the COVID-19 “vaccines” to start waking people up to this fact, even though most are still asleep and trusting their government and corporate media, when there have been others that have been warning about this plan to implement a New World Order for many decades now, but written off by pop culture and the corporate media as “conspiracy theorists,” a term first used by the CIA to refer to people who did not accept the Government narrative on the assassination of President Kennedy in the 1960s. The fact is, the evidence that the U.S. is part of a New World Order that follows Satan rather than God, has been right in front of our eyes since the founding of this nation, as many of our “founding fathers” were members of Freemasonry, and their images and symbols are everywhere in our culture, including “The Great Seal” of the United States, which is printed into our currency on the $1 bill. One of the Latin phrases at the bottom of that seal is “Novus ordo seclorum,” which means “A New Order of the Ages.” The Latin phrase at the top of that symbol is “Annuit cœptis,” which means “He/She favors our undertakings.” The common interpretation of that phrase has been that “God” is the one who is referenced here, by the eye inside the triangle. However, the all-seeing eye is historically used as a symbol referring to Satan, or evil, and not to God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth. So since the beginning of the United States in 1776, which is also the same year that Adam Weishaupt founded the “Order of the Illuminati,” a secret society which later merged with Freemasonry, it has been predicted that the United States would become part of a New World Order. Here is a short clip (less than 4 minutes) from Altiyan Childs’ 5-hour expose on Freemasonry which you can learn more about here, which shows the Satanic symbols in the Great Seal of the United States. !function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src=""https://rumble.com/embedJS/u4""+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+""/?url=""+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+""&args=""+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, ""script"", ""Rumble""); 15 seconds 15 seconds Rumble(""play"", {""video"":""vf6h8r"",""div"":""rumble_vf6h8r""}); Will the ultimate fulfillment of this prediction that the U.S. would become part of a New World Order worshiping Satan come to fruition in 2023? Eustace Mullins exposed a lot of the corruption in America back in the 1980s, including exposing the corrupt medical system and vaccines. His book, Murder by Injection – The Story of Medical Conspiracy Against America, published in 1988, is still a classic, and can be downloaded online. In spite of its title, it only really has one chapter on vaccines, but does a good job exposing the advent of “Rockefeller medicine” and the monopoly over cures that allopathic medicine accomplished by forming the American Medical Association (AMA) and making all other natural cures illegal. Mullins spent much of his life exposing the Globalists who controlled business and finance and were the actual enemies of the American people, and in one of his later books he wrote this: After forty years of patient study of the crises which faces humanity, I arrived at a very simple conclusion-all conspiracies are Satanic! In retrospect, this conclusion should surprise no one. I admit that it came as something of a surprise to me. I had never anticipated that my decades of work would lead to such an all-encompassing and unchallengeable solution. This answer had eluded me through the years, not because I was on the wrong track, but because I had not yet consulted the ultimate source of knowledge-the Bible. To trace the machinations of the materialist conspiracy, I had deliberately limited myself to materialist sources-reference material on banking, politics, economics, and the biographies of those who were most deeply involved in these affairs. When at last I did decide to look up some references in the Bible, a task which was greatly simplified by a number of excellent Concordances, such and Nelson’s and Strong’s, I was overwhelmed by its immediacy, by its directness, and by the applicability of its words to present-day happenings. As the months went by and I continued this research, I was not overwhelmed by a sense of deja vu, but by an overpowering conviction that very little had changed in the last three thousand years. My first revelation was that “God has no secrets from man.” It is Satan who must confine his work to stealthy conspiracies to deception, and to promises which will never be kept. “And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world” (Rev. 12:9). It is for this reason that politicians, of necessity, must become followers of Satan in the rebellion against God. Politicians must deceive the people in order to gain power over them, just as Satan must deceive the whole world if he is to continue his rebellion against God. Satan takes you to the top of the mountain and offers you all the kingdoms of the earth (Martin Luther King proclaimed, “I have been to the top of the mountain,” but he never revealed what had taken place there); the politician offers you free food, free lodging, free medical care –everything will become “free at last!” The politician offers to defend you against your enemies, so that he can deliver you to the ultimate enemy– Satan. God does not make offers to you in competition with Satan and his politicians. What could God offer you when he has already given you the whole world? What more could He do than to send His Only Begotton Son to preserve this world for you when it was threatened by Satan? And why would God wish to veil His love for you behind arcane mysteries, occult conspiracies, and obscene practices? Once my return to the Bible had given me the answers for which I had been seeking so many years, I realized that I had arrived at the culmination of this life’s work. (From: The Curse of Canaan – A Demonology of History – free copy here.) Here is what Mullins wrote regarding the symbols used in The Great Seal of the United States which is printed on the U.S. dollar bill: The emblems of this cult are boldly emblazoned on the Great Seal of the United States and on our Federal Reserve notes (unpaid debts of the American people). The words “Annuit Coeptis” announce the birth of “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” the New Order. The Canaanites have even appropriated the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, built by Shem, as their emblem. However, to demonstrate that they have not yet put into operation the final phases of their conspiracy, they show the top of the pyramid missing, indicating that “the lost word” of Freemasonry is still absent. The “eye” represents the Great Architect of the Universe, a cabbalist concept; it is enclosed in a triangle, which is the symbol of magic. The thirteen steps refer to Satan, Belial, and rebellion, which cabbalistic gematria assign to the thirteen colonies, thirteen stripes, thirteen olive leaves, thirteen arrows on the seal, and the thirteen letters of “E Pluribus Unum,” all of which emphasize the importance of the number thirteen in any enterprise which is controlled by Freemasonry. It reminds them of their war against Christ and his Twelve Disciples. The eagle is represented as the symbol of Rome, the historic enemy of the Canaanites, whom they can never forget, the adversary who razed their capital, Carthage, and who sought to control their bestiality through the administration of laws (the fasces). Consequently, all Freemasons must be vigorously anti-Fascist, that is, they must place themselves against the rule of law. The eagle has nine tail feathers, representing the Inner Circle of Nine in the Illuminati, and also the number of degrees in the York Rite; the thirteen stars represent the Seal of Solomon. (The Curse of Canaan – A Demonology of History) Others have exposed the cryptic Satanic symbols in our “Great Seal,” including William Guy Carr, in his book Pawns In The Game. INSIGNIA OF THE ORDER OF ILLUMINATI THAT ILLUMINIST JEFFERSON MADE the REVERSE of U. S. SEAL The insignia of the Order of Illuminati was adopted by Weishaupt at the time he founded the Order, on May 1, 1776. It is that event that is memorialized by the MDCCLXXVI at the base of the pyramid, and not the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, as the uninformed have supposed. The significance of the design is as follows : the pyramid represents the conspiracy for destruction of the Catholic (Universal Christian) Church, and establishment of a “One World”, or UN dictatorship, the “secret” of the Order; the eye radiating in all directions, is the “all-spying eye” that symbolizes the terroristic, Gestapo-like, espionage agency that Weishaupt set up under the name of “Insinuating Brethren”, to guard the “secret” of the Order and to terrorize the populace into acceptance of its rule. This “Ogpu” had its first workout in the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, which it was Instrumental in organizing. It is a source of amazement that the electorate tolerates the continuance of use of this insignia as part of the Great Seal of the U.S. “ANNUIT COEPTIS” means “our enterprise (conspiracy) has been crowned with success”. Below, “NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM” explains the nature of the enterprise : and it means “a New Social Order”, or “New Deal”. Benjamin Franklin, John Adams (Roosevelt kinsman) and Thomas Jefferson, ardent Illuminist, proposed the above as the reverse of the seal, on the face of which was the eagle symbol, to Congress, which adopted it on June 20, 1782. On adoption of the Constitution, Congress decreed, by Act of September 15, 1789, its retention as seal of the United States. It is stated however, by the State Department in its latest publication on the subject (2860), that “the reverse has never been cut and used as a seal”, and that only the observe bearing the eagle symbol has been used as official seal and coat of arms. It first was published on the left of the reverse of the dollar bills at the beginning of the New Deal, 1933 by order of President F.D. Roosevelt. What is the meaning of the publication at the outset of the New Deal of this “Gestapo” symbol that had been so carefully suppressed up to that date that few Americana knew of its existence, other than as a Masonic symbol? It can only mean that with the advent of the New Deal the Illuminist-Socialist-Communist conspirators, followers of Professor Weishaupt, regarded their efforts as beginning to be crowned with success. (Source.) As much as I appreciate the work that Eustace Mullins did, he strayed in one area where he rejected the Biblical teaching, and chose to believe in mythology instead, and it is a mistake I have seen others in the Alternative Media also make in the past couple of years since COVID broke out. Mullins bought into the teaching on “transhumans” and demonic “bloodlines,” a very dangerous doctrine that was rejected by the writers of the New Testament, and later scholars who decided which writings should be included in the Bible and which ones should not. This teaching believes that demons created children with human wives, and developed “bloodlines” of demonic/human half-breeds, which today is taught with “transhumanism.” So here is the false teaching that Mullins subscribed to (emphasis mine): Indeed, the great movement of modern history has been to disguise the presence of evil on the earth, to make light of it, to convince humanity that evil is to be “tolerated,” “treated with greater understanding,” or negotiated with, but under no circumstances should it ever be forcibly opposed. This is the principal point of what has come to be known as today’s liberalism, more popularly known as secular humanism. The popular, and apparently sensible, appeal of humanism is that humanity should always place human interests first. The problem is that this very humanism can be traced in an unbroken line all the way back to the Biblical “Curse of Canaan.” Humanism is the logical result of the demonology of history. Modern day events can be understood only if we can trace their implications in a direct line from the earliest records of antiquity. These records concern pre-Adamic man, a hybrid creature whose origins are described in ancient books. The Book of Enoch (which itself is part of an earlier Book of Noah, written about 161 B.C.), says that Samjaza (Satan), the leader of a band of two hundred angels, descended on Mt. Carmel. They had lusted after the daughters of men from afar, and now they took them for wives. These fallen angels, known as the Order of the Watchers, taught their wives magic. The issue of these unions was a race of giants, known as Nephilim. The Bible does not mention the Nephilim specifically by name, and Strong’s Concordance does not list them. However, Nelson’s Concordance has several listings under Nephilim. The verses of the Bible to which it refers are Genesis 6:4, “There were giants in the earth in those days.” The Revised Standard Version does give the name of the Nephilim, the same verse reading, “The Nephilim were on the earth in those days.” These giants later became known as “the sons of Anak.” In Numbers 13:33, we read, “And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants. ” These giants constituted a powerful menace to other peoples. In Deuteronomy 9:2 is the complaint, “Who can stand before the children of Anak?” Nevertheless, they were finally killed or driven out. “There were none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel.” (Joshua 11:22) These early giants would be considered as mutations by modern scientists. Because of their peculiar parentage, they had habits and lusts which horrified their neighbors. Their leader, Satan (the adversary of God), also known as Satona, was the serpent who entered into and seduced Eve, producing the first murderer, Cain*. Footnote: * According to mythology (The Curse of Canaan – A Demonology of History) The first thing I want to note here, is that even Mullins admits that this teaching is not contained in the Bible. He is relying on “mythology.” Not only is it not contained in the Bible, in order to make this theory of human-demon half breeds work, they have to CHANGE the text of the Bible: “the serpent who entered into and seduced Eve, producing the first murderer, Cain.” What does the Bible record? Adam lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, “With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man.” Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. (Genesis 4:1-2) The earliest records of the Bible, written by Moses who received much of the text of the first 5 books of the Bible, commonly referred to as “the Torah” or “the Law,” because it contains the Ten Commandments and other laws that were literally dictated to Moses by angels, clearly state that Cain’s father was Adam, born of Eve, the first human birth, with the “help of the LORD.” I agree that the “seed of Satan” came down through Cain, the first murderer recorded in human history, but that seed was spiritual, not a physical seed from a union between Satan or a demon with a human woman, something that is not found in the Bible anywhere. Why is this important? It is important because the false belief in demon-human half breeds and “bloodlines” and “genealogies” based on that false belief, leads to racism, and a gross perversion of what the Bible actually teaches. This false belief that has infected Christianity, has led to many Christians becoming the most racist group of people in society today. When Mullins refers to the “curse of Canaan” here, he is condemning an entire genealogy of people that descended from Canaan, which includes Black people, as inferior. This is why the New Testament writers never accepted the Book of Enoch as scripture, because it contradicted so many other teachings of scripture, and the very message of the New Testament, which saw all people, regardless of race or religion or any other classifications, as equal. Here is what Paul wrote about “genealogies” and “myths”: As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather than God’s work–which is by faith. The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. Some have wandered away from these and turned to meaningless talk. (1 Timothy 1:3-6) Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth. To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted. (Titus 1:13-15) But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless. (Titus 3:9) Perhaps the most telling explanation of Mullins’ misunderstanding of this topic comes from this statement he wrote: “These early giants would be considered as mutations by modern scientists.” How sad that a man as intelligent as he was in recognizing the perversion of science and medicine, would then look to “modern science” to justify one of his own beliefs! As we have published many times over the years, the entire “scientific” teaching on “genetics” is not based on science or anything factual at all, but began as “eugenics” and is the false teaching used to label some human beings as less important that others. See: The teaching of the Bible is that all human beings are created in the image of God, and are equal, regardless of race, religion, gender, or any other way of classifying human beings. For more on this topic see: To believe in transhumanism, which is nothing more than a modern-day version of Darwinian biological evolution, and demon-human half breeds, one has to believe that Satan and demons can create life, because at the bare minimum, they would need to be able to create a physical sperm to impregnate a woman. But only God can create life, and Jesus said that angels (which would include demons which are fallen angels) do not procreate. (See: Matthew 22:29-30.) For a fuller deep dive into this topic, please see: There is only one recorded instance of a “transhuman,” and that is Jesus Christ, who was born from the virgin Mary, with no human father. God supplied the sperm to Mary, because he is the author of life, able to create something out of nothing, which Satan cannot do because he himself is a created being. The other side of this racist teaching that believes in “bloodlines” and “genealogies” and has infected Christianity is that the physical descendants of Shem, one of Noah’s sons, are more valuable human beings than those who are not. The Jews, defined here as the physical descendants of Abraham through Isaac and Jacob, come from this line, and so this false teaching is also behind what is by far the most racist belief in humanity today, that all “Jews” are superior to other races because they are “the chosen people.” I have spent quite a bit of time exposing this false belief the past couple of years, as it is the driving force behind “Zionism.” To say anything negative in any way about ANY kind of Jew in any form, is to invite the pejorative term “Anti-Semitic” and very strong political and financial forces that seek to suppress free speech. For example, in my Christmas article last week, I very clearly defined in the Christmas story the “Satanic Jews” who tried to kill Jesus, and the “Godly Jews” who protected Jesus, namely his parents. See: Unlike those who so quickly jump up and start yelling “Anti-Semitic” because they label all “Jews” together in one category, I clearly define the different types of “Jews” that actually exist. And yet I knew that the hate emails would come, no matter how much I defined how I was using the term “Jews.” This was one response which is typical every time I address this topic, and I am sure I will get similar responses from this article: “This is hateful garbage, I will block your email, do not respond. Sick, disgusting post.” This teaching about the distinction between the Godly Jews and the Satanic Jews, however, comes directly from the Bible, and the words of Jesus as recorded in the Bible would be labeled as “Anti-Semitic” today. In John chapter 8, Jesus clearly distinguishes between the Jews of his day whose father was “the Devil,” and the believing Jews who became his disciples. To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?” Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. I know you are Abraham’s descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word. I am telling you what I have seen in the Father’s presence, and you do what you have heard from your father.” “Abraham is our father,” they answered. “If you were Abraham’s children,” said Jesus, “then you would do the things Abraham did. As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things. You are doing the things your own father does.” “We are not illegitimate children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God himself.” Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me. Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me! Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me? He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.” (John 8:31-47) The New Testament writings make it very clear, that the seed of Satan and the Godly seed of woman prophesied by God in Genesis chapter 3, are spiritual seeds, and not physical seeds. Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring–not only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all. (Romans 4:16) In other words, it is not the natural children who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring. (Romans 9:8) For more on this topic, see: Earlier this week, U.S. Senator Ben Cardin announced that he sent a letter to President Joe Biden to redefine the First Amendment of the United States and to develop a “unified national strategy against anti-semitism.” During a hearing on anti-semitism today, Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.) claimed that those who “espouse hate” are not protected under the First Amendment, and called for the federal government to be “more aggressive” in its efforts to combat hateful rhetoric. Cardin, who is a practicing Jew, has also served as the Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance for the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly since 2015. In early December, Cardin, along with Senators Jackie Rosen (D-Nev.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) sent a letter to President Joe Biden calling for a “unified national strategy against anti-semitism.” (Full article.) I looked up the letter he sent to President Biden, and here are some excerpts (emphasis mine): U.S. Senator Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Chair of the U.S. Helsinki Commission and Special Representative on Antisemitism, Racism and Intolerance for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly, praised President Joe Biden today for his ongoing engagement in pushing back against hate-based violence and for answering the call from Congress and others to develop a unified, national strategy to counter antisemitism. “Antisemitism is a danger to America and our national security. It erodes public trust in democratic institutions and the rule of law. Long intertwined with bogus conspiracy theories and outright lies, antisemitic hate, intentional disinformation and related violence are on the rise once again. The numbers, a small snapshot of which were released today by the FBI as part of its annual hate crimes report, are cause for great concern. As a nation, we cannot allow antisemitism – or any other type of prejudice or intolerance – to be normalized.” (Source.) Wow! So “Antisemitism” is a “danger to America and our national security.” And he refers to the numbers “released today by the FBI as part of its annual hate crimes report,” which he says “are cause for great concern.” So I decided to look up the FBI report myself to see these horrible numbers of antisemitism that are threatening our “national security.” Here is the report from the FBI on “Hate Crime Statistics” which was published a couple of weeks ago. Today, the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program released 2021 statistics about bias-motivated incidents throughout the nation. The 2021 data, submitted by 11,834 law enforcement agencies, provide information about the offenses, victims, offenders, and locations of hate crimes. This is the first year the annual hate crimes statistics are reported entirely through the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Compared to the previous crime data collection system, NIBRS collects significantly more detailed data for each individual criminal incident. Law enforcement agencies submitted incident reports involving 7,262 criminal incidents and 8,673 related offenses as being motivated by bias toward race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender, and gender identity. Highlights of Hate Crime Statistics, 2021, follow. (Due to rounding, percentage breakdowns may not add up to 100%.) Victims of Hate Crime Incidents Offenses by Crime Category So according to the FBI, there were 5,781 hate crime offenses classified as crimes against persons in 2021. These are all “hate crimes,” and not just crimes against “Jews.” Of these, there were 13 rapes and 9 murders, and we have no idea how many of those, if any, were because the victims were “Jews.” And this is a matter of “National Security”?? Because these numbers are a “cause for great concern” we need to suspend the First Amendment?? No, the REAL threat to our National Security are the Globalist Satanic Jews who are all Freemasons and worship Satan, and are in the process of killing off the “useless” members of humanity in their view, using scamdemics like COVID-19 and bioweapons like the COVID-19 “vaccines.” As of yesterday’s update to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), there have now been 1,490,160 adverse events including 33,334 deaths reported after COVID-19 shots for the past two years (source), and that is only about 1% of the actual numbers. THAT’s a “cause for great concern” that affects national security! If you don’t understand that the person at the top of this pyramid is not human, but is Satan himself, then you will never fully understand just what they have planned for this country. These plans to implement a New World Order that worships Satan, have been laid since this country was founded, and Satan’s symbols are found everywhere in the American culture. Will 2023 be the year that America fulfills her destiny, and the Satanic Jewish Freemasons take over total control? Will most Americans even recognize this is happening and try to resist it? Or will they exchange their freedom for the illusion of “security,” only to find out that there is no “security” in tyranny, manifested as either fascist Nazism, or socialist Communism, two heads to the same coin? And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?” (Luke 18:7-8) Comment on this article at Created4Health.org. Related:",6,-0.44583616,0.13951857,False
https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20230619/cm/west-nile-virus-cases-rising-nationwide,West Nile Virus Cases Rising Nationwide Amid Mosquito Season,1,"June 19, 2023 – State and local health officials around the country are reporting the first cases of West Nile virus of the season in humans and urging people to take action to protect themselves from the mosquito-borne disease. In the past 2 weeks, new cases have been reported in Iowa and Nebraska, adding to previous 2023 reports from Arizona, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming. A mosquito at a monitoring site near Houston tested positive last week for the potentially fatal virus, prompting local health officials to begin evening spray operations in the area where the mosquito was found, according to an announcement from Harris County Public Health. According to the CDC, which compiles local reports, there have been 13 human cases of West Nile virus in 2023. In 2022, there were 1,126 cases, including 90 deaths. Among this year’s 13 cases reported to the CDC so far, eight people add severe neuroinvasive disease, which means the disease spread to the nervous system. Such severe symptoms typically occur in 1 in every 150 cases of West Nile virus, and can include encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, which is inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Three of the neuroinvasive cases occurred earlier this year amid an outbreak in Maricopa County, AZ, where the disease is considered endemic, according to an April 28 report from the CDC. The CDC says West Nile virus is the most common disease spread by mosquitoes in the continental U.S. Local health officials sample mosquitoes to guide mosquito control strategies. So far this year, the CDC has received 28 reports of mosquitoes testing positive. Those mosquito testing reports came from Arizona, California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, and Texas. West Nile virus is transmitted to people by the bite of an infected mosquito, but it can also be spread to humans if they handle a dead bird that is infected. The CDC says there are no medications to treat the virus in people. Most people who are infected do not feel sick, and 1 in 5 people infected develop a fever and other symptoms like headache, body ache, or a rash. Prevention strategies are to wear insect repellent and to wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants to avoid mosquito bites.",4,-0.2052097,0.12296893,True
https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/news/20230616/cm/fda-warns-of-contaminated-tattoo-ink,FDA Warns of Tattoo Ink Tied to Dangerous Infections,1,"June 16, 2023 – The FDA draft guidance released this week on possible contamination of tattoo ink was not concerning Whitney Donohue, 34, owner of Forget Me Not Tattoo in Billings, MT. “I get our ink directly through the manufacturer – not at a store or through Amazon or eBay,” she said. “You never know if it’s going to be repackaged.” Tattoo artists themselves, she said, regulate the quality of ink they use. Still, the threat is real, said Bruce Brod, MD, a clinical professor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. “I've seen several different infections from tattooing, and they are from organisms that tend to contaminate things in damp, liquid-type environments.” The FDA released the new draft guidance Monday aiming to reduce the use of pathogen-contaminated tattoo ink, which can cause stubborn infections that are especially hard to treat, dermatologists said. “Tattooing involves puncturing the epidermis about 100 times per second with needles and depositing ink 1.5 to 2 millimeters below the surface of the skin, deep into the dermis,” the guidance states. “Contaminated tattoo ink can cause infections and serious injuries. Because these inks are injected, pathogens or other harmful substances in these inks can travel from the injection site through the blood and lymphatic systems to other parts of the body.” The guidance comes as body art continues to get more popular. According to a 2019 poll, 30% of Americans had at least one tattoo – up from 21% in 2012. Forty percent of people 18-34 and 36% of those ages 35-54 had at least one tattoo. And though they are commonplace, tattoos come with medical risks that should be known beforehand, doctors said. Commonly reported symptoms of tattoo ink-associated infections include rashes, blisters, painful nodules, and severe abscesses. One of the most common bacteria found in contaminated tattoo ink is nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), which is related to the bacteria that causes tuberculosis and can be found in soil and water. The guidance lists several unsanitary manufacturing conditions that may lead to ink contamination, including: “Infections will often spread along the drainage channels in the skin and create squiggly, uneven lines of big red, lumpy nodules,” Brod said. Between 2003 and 2023, there were 18 recalls of tattoo inks that were contaminated with various microorganisms, according to the FDA. In May 2019, the FDA issued a safety alert advising consumers, tattoo artists, and retailers to avoid using or selling certain tattoo inks contaminated with microorganisms. Reputable ink manufacturers use a process called gamma radiation, which refers to electromagnetic radiation of high frequencies to kill microorganisms in the ink and its packaging. Most of the trustworthy, high-quality ink manufacturers are well-known among tattoo artists, Donohue said. While she has seen customers with sensitive skin have allergic reactions, she has not seen someone come back with an infection in her 9 years working in the tattoo industry. Because tattoo ink is considered a cosmetic product, there is not much regulatory oversight involved, which means the sterility and quality of ingredients vary, said Teo Soleymani, MD, an assistant clinical professor of dermatology and dermatological surgery at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. “Cosmeceuticals aren’t regulated by the FDA like prescription medication,” he said. “What we've seen many times is inadvertent contamination during the application process or contamination while the inks are being made.” In years past, unclean needles spreading hepatitis and HIV were more of a concern, but those rates have dropped significantly, Soleymani said. The infections that have increased are from rare bacteria that exist in stagnant water. And they are injected into a part of the body that allows them to evade the immune system, he said: shallow enough that there aren’t many associated blood vessels, but not still below the layer of skin that gets sloughed off every 28 days. Sometimes, antibiotics alone won’t cut it, and the tattoo will require surgical removal. “The aesthetic you were going for has to be not only removed, but you're left with a surgical scar,” Soleymani said. “Tattoos can be beautiful, but they can come with unwanted visitors that can cause months of misery.”",8,-0.23110908,-0.01633431,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/update-on-atrial-fibrillation,Update on atrial fibrillation,1,"Atrial fibrillation causes a rapid, chaotic heartbeat that usually comes and goes without warning. Commonly known as afib, it's caused by electrical misfires in the heart's upper chambers (atria). While some people don't notice any symptoms, others feel a fluttering, pounding sensation in their chest and may become lightheaded, dizzy, and breathless during a bout of afib. But the real danger is a heightened risk of serious strokes (see ""Atrial fibrillation and stroke""). An estimated one in 11 people ages 65 and older have afib, which becomes more common with age. ""There are many things you can do to both lower your risk and prevent the progression of afib,"" says Dr. Moussa Mansour, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of the Atrial Fibrillation Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. In fact, lifestyle modifications are now a prominent focus of the latest guidelines for managing afib, he says. Here's a summary of the updated recommendations, published Jan. 2, 2024, in the journal Circulation. Atrial fibrillation and stroke During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (atria) quiver rapidly instead of contracting forcefully. Blood pools along the walls of the left atrium, eventually forming clots that may break free to travel through the left ventricle (lower chamber) to the aorta (the large vessel carrying blood out of the heart). If the clot lodges in an artery to the brain, it may block blood flow and cause an ischemic stroke. Illustration: © Rujirat Boonyong/Getty Images Alcohol and caffeine advice ""The most important advice is about alcohol use, which is one of the first things my patients ask about,"" says Dr. Mansour. Strong evidence from multiple studies shows that drinking alcohol raises the risk of afib. There's no magic number of drinks considered safe or risky, although the guidelines suggest no more than one per day. But it's clear that the less alcohol you drink, the better, he says. People also wonder if they should avoid coffee. In some people, caffeine seems to trigger palpitations — the sensation of a skipped, missed, or strong heartbeat. Still, observational studies haven't shown any increased risk of afib among coffee drinkers. In fact, one found that people who drink one to three cups of coffee daily are less likely to have afib than people who drink lower or higher amounts. ""Caffeine doesn't seem to be something people need to worry about,"" says Dr. Mansour. Weight Excess weight, on the other hand, is an issue for many people. Obesity, which is defined as a body mass index or BMI of 30 or higher, promotes afib on several fronts. First, it can worsen high blood pressure, and second, it makes people more prone to obstructive sleep apnea. ""In addition, clinical studies show that obesity increases fat around the heart,"" says Dr. Mansour. This promotes inflammation of the heart muscle, which may lead to changes in the structure of the atria, spurring the onset and progression of afib, he adds. The guidelines recommend that people strive for a BMI of 27 or lower. Research suggests that even modest weight loss (about 10% of your body weight) can help keep your heart rhythm more stable and is linked to better outcomes following treatment for afib. Exercise Exercise not only supports weight loss, it can also lower afib burden, which refers to both the duration and frequency of afib. The afib guidelines suggest 210 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, which may also help reduce afib symptoms. But Dr. Mansour keeps the advice to his patients simple: ""Aim for three to four hours of exercise every week, at a level of effort that's more than a casual walk, but nothing too crazy,"" he says. However, dedicated exercise buffs who work out far more than the average person can still develop afib. ""If you trained for marathons in your 30s and keep up that level of intensity into your 60s, the recommendation is to do less exercise if you develop afib,"" says Dr. Mansour. But if exercise is a big deal for you and important for your mental health, there's no hard-and-fast rule about dialing back, he says. Sleep Dr. Mansour recommends that anyone with afib who snores should be tested for sleep apnea, a condition marked by brief pauses in breathing that often triggers loud snoring, grunts, and gasps. More than one in five people with afib have sleep apnea, and treating the problem may lessen afib recurrence. Image: © patrickheagney/Getty Images",7,0.26781484,0.114386156,False

Should you run into any trouble logging back in, try requesting a password reset email. Please note, it may take 24-48 hours for your follower and following numbers to return to normal. If you need to get in touch with us again, please file a report through your Twitter app or our forms page, as this account isn’t monitored for replies. Thanks, Twitter However, we will not be logging into this account and using it, and in addition, we have now deleted our other social media accounts and will no longer post any articles on Social Media. We will maintain our video accounts and Telegram channel, where we can turn off comments. This ends over 2 decades of social media use for myself and my companies, as I started utilizing the Internet and Internet discussion groups back in 2000 and 2001, after we saw that the Internet survived Y2K. In the early days, the Internet and social media groups were a tremendous asset to truth seekers, allowing us to bypass corporate media censorship and take our message directly to the people. We were utilizing social media before Facebook and Twitter were even around, and even before Google was selling search result advertising through “pay-per-click” (PPC). We used to use Overture, before they were bought out by Yahoo for over a billion dollars, and before Google came in and started dominating Internet searches and PPC advertising. When Facebook became popular, we established our brand and spent a lot of money promoting our Facebook Page for my online business, and then also started a Facebook Page for Health Impact News when we started back in 2011. Before Facebook banned us, we had 2 million followers we had collected over almost a decade. Facebook became the best place to advertise our products also, as we could tailor our ads to very specific people who met the profile of our consumers. They quickly became the best platform on the Internet for advertising, because people so willingly published information about themselves and their interests. But what became a great tool for businesses advertising their products, also became a great tool for intelligence agencies like the CIA, FBI, and others. These social media giants became not only resources to surveil and track people, but also to influence what they think and believe by using fake users, which we called “trolls.” At one point, it was estimated that over half the user accounts on Facebook were fake users, and Twitter also had a large percentage of these fake users which Elon Musk complained about before he bought it. In 2014 I published an article commenting on an article written by Glenn Greenwald based on Edward Snowden’s leaked documents from the National Security Agency (NSA) which showed that British and American intelligence agencies were paying “trolls” to influence opinion online and destroy people’s reputations. See: Health Impact News was a frequent target of trolls in social media that tried to discredit our reporting on the dangers of vaccines, among other things. I learned early on how to spot these trolls and how to squash them, and I always had a staff monitoring our social media accounts, especially Facebook. Today here in 2022, even the secondary social media platforms, which are predominately among the Right Wing political groups that were banned from places like Facebook and Twitter (Pinterest was actually the first one to ban us because of our articles on vaccines), also seem to be dominated by trolls, and it is impossible to tell who is behind some of these platforms, and who all they are selling their data to. In addition, we have developed a culture of entitled crybaby users who believe somehow that it is their “right” to post comments and criticize our content, or use other people’s social media accounts to promote their own agendas and websites. If you delete their comments, you end up getting emailed with attacks like this: I see you censored my comment like the left does. May the Lord repay you for hiding the truth. After seeing a few different accounts try to post comments on a recent article where we mentioned Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on one of these alternative social media platforms, where these users were saying things that were almost identical, I looked at their accounts and saw right away they were fake accounts, and probably paid trolls. In fact it is entirely possible that all the accounts belonged to one paid troll, making it look like several people agreed with them, a very common tactic. So I made the decision that it was time to stop using social media sites. Not just because of the trolls, but because all of these platforms are now used for surveillance and tracking, and the benefits of social media no longer justify allowing our enemies to track our readers when they use these platforms. We are leaving up our social media buttons on articles for people to share for now, because people are going to share them there anyway, but those will probably disappear soon also. All commenting on our articles will now only be done here on our own websites, where people can use anonymous usernames and emails when they post a comment, and not be tracked by Big Tech and the government. We stopped using Google Analytics last year, and now use a software program called “Matomo“, which exists only on our servers and is never shared with anyone else. So when you see the top articles for the week and number of views for that article, that all comes from our own internal stats, and NOT Google. I know these newer generations of young people feel they have some kind of right to come here and voice their opinions and criticize or attack the articles we post here, but that just simply isn’t true. This is a free platform. We don’t even accept donations. No product is being sold here, so there is no vendor-client relationship where we have to supply customer service. If you see something you don’t like or agree with, you just simply stop reading and move on, and even unsubscribe if you want to. That is your right. But criticizing and attacking me is not your right, and generally is not tolerated here, which is why you see so few comments on our articles. Comments that are genuine and contribute to the subject of the article are welcome, and we get most of those positive comments on our articles on the Created4Health.org website, and those comments end up being a blessing not only to me, but to others who read them. Courtesy and respect are all but gone in today’s culture, and often I have to delete a comment rather than publishing it, when otherwise I might publish it because it has some useful information, but the person either starts out the comment with something like: “You are severely ignorant on this topic….” – or, after masterfully writing a great comment, they end it with something like: “Let’s see if you actually publish this comment because you have suppressed the truth in the past…” or some other such rude statements that have no place here. I am very old school, and grew up with the Internet. I remember the days when only print media existed outside of television, and if someone wanted to voice an opinion or challenge an article in a print publication, they had to write a “letter to the editor,” and the publication would have a special section of their publication where they would publish some, but certainly not all, of these letters, and then give their response. But it was 100% up to the editor, and nobody was screaming “CENSORSHIP” back then for not publishing dissenting views, and of course they would never publish attacks and threats. People would actually feel honored if their comment was published. Social media was a great way in the past to connect with friends, family, and others, but today it has become a very dangerous place, where unfriendly eyes are watching everything you say, like, dislike, etc., and will eventually be tied into our social credit score by the tyrants. So for us, it is time to say: no thanks. We pass.

https://healthimpactnews.com/2022/why-hasnt-governor-desantis-stopped-the-covid-vaccines-in-florida-when-he-admits-they-are-killing-people/,Why Hasn't Governor DeSantis Stopped the COVID Vaccines in Florida When He Admits They are Killing People?,0,"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News On December 13, 2022, there were two political events where politicians publicly stated that the experimental COVID-19 “vaccines” were neither safe nor effective, and were in fact killing people. One of those events happened at The House of Commons in the UK where Andrew Bridgen, a Member of Parliament (MP) delivered an amazing speech about the corruption behind the Pfizer COVID “vaccines” and how they were harming and killing people. The entire speech is 21 minutes, and you can watch it here. Bridgen did an excellent job in exposing the conflicts of interest where drug companies actually fund the government regulatory agencies who approve their products, and also mentions the role that the Bill Gates Foundation plays in funding so much of this, as well as funding much of the corporate media controlling the narrative on COVID-19 “vaccines.” Photo supplied by Dr. Mike Yeadon’s Telegram channel. Dr. Mike Yeadon shared a photo on his Telegram channel showing how only a few other MPs showed up to hear Andrew Bridgen’s speech on COVID-19 vaccine corruption and harm, compared to another photo at the same location when MPs were voting on their own pay increases. After presenting the evidence and data, MP Bridgen concludes with these words: Well Madam Deputy Speaker, that first step could start this evening, with this debate. It starts here, and the vaccine minister of the government ensuring in the first instance that there needs to be an immediate and complete suspension of any more COVID vaccines and use of mRNA technology. How could there be any other conclusion and call to action after presenting the evidence that the COVID-19 “vaccines” are killing and crippling people, than to immediately STOP injecting them into people?? The other event that happened on December 13, 2022, was a round table public discussion in Florida led by Governor Ron DeSantis and his Surgeon General, Dr. Joseph Ladapo. This public discussion also included other medical doctors, and alleged victims who had suffered from taking a COVID-19 “vaccine.” Here is what Dr. Joseph Ladapo said: He starts out by stating the corporate media is not accurately reporting on the COVID shots because they are also taking money from the drug companies who produce them. He then discusses a study of people who “died suddenly” within a few weeks of being injected with a COVID shot, which showed a high rate of myocarditis that was attributed to mRNA COVID “vaccines.” Ladapo has also previously reported that statewide analysis of vaccinated Florida residents aged 18 years or older found an 84 percent increase in the relative incidence of cardiac-related deaths among males aged 18–39, within 28 days of mRNA vaccination. So what is Dr. Ladapo’s call to action as Florida’s Surgeon General now that he knows that the COVID-19 “vaccines” are killing people? We are initiating a program here in Florida where we will be studying the incidence in surveillance of myocarditis within a few weeks of COVID-19 vaccination for people who died. Governor DeSantis was interviewed on Fox News later that night to discuss the round table discussion. In this interview DeSantis admits that the “medical establishment” never warned the American people about the “drawbacks” of the COVID-19 shots, and he also acknowledges the research of his Surgeon General Dr. Ladapo who has showed people are dying from the COVID-19 shots. He also mentions that in Norway they have banned the COVID shots for everyone under 50 years old, because the drawbacks outweigh the benefits, and that there was an increase in all-cause mortalities. So what is Governor DeSantis’s call to action? He is asking the Florida State Supreme Court to convene a Grand Jury to look into the drug companies that produced the shots, and “hold them accountable.” AND EVERYONE IN THE RIGHT WING ALTERNATIVE MEDIA CHEERED, while people in Florida continue to get the COVID-19 shots, and give them to their children who continue to die and become crippled. Both DeSantis and Ladapo also bragged about their past actions “against” the COVID shots in this round table discussion. DeSantis goes out of his way to talk about how he opposed mandates, and allowed the people in Florida to “make their own decisions” about getting the shots and giving them to their children. Ladapo bragged about the fact that back in March this year he was the first Surgeon General to not recommend the COVID shots for children. We covered that story back in March, and I said then that this was a meaningless action, and that potentially even MORE children could end up getting the shots since they were politicizing it. See: What have been the results of Dr. Ladapo not recommending the shots for children since March of this year (2022)? There have been records of 192 children injured from the shots since March, 2022. (Source.) Of course most of the shots were injected into children in 2021 when the FDA authorized them for children. And how many children have been killed or injured in total, before Ladapo stopped recommending them, while DeSantis was making sure they were not mandated in 2021? The U.S. Government Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) currently shows 1,361 children in Florida injured following the shots, including 2 deaths, 8 permanent disabilities, 194 ER visits, 90 hospitalizations, and 21 life threatening events. (Source.) And remember, VAERS contains less than 1% of total vaccine adverse events (source), so the real numbers of children who have suffered in Florida are closer to 132,000 with 200 deaths, with about 19,000 children harmed since Ladapo stopped recommending them in March this year. Now some may try to argue that these numbers would be much higher if DeSantis did not stop the mandates, and Ladapo did not stop recommending them, although that is almost impossible to prove. But if Governor DeSantis had issued an executive order to STOP all COVID shots in his state, then these numbers would be ZERO! Why hasn’t he done that? And why does everyone in the Alternative Media continue to praise DeSantis and Ladapo when they are clearly allowing children and others to continue dying and being harmed by these shots? Even the CDC has said publicly that they do NOT enforce vaccine policy at the state level, but that the States do, from the Governor to the Surgeon General to the local Public Health Departments. See: So Governor DeSantis, and all other 49 governors, most certainly could STOP this carnage of the bioweapon COVID shots IMMEDIATELY, but they refuse to do so. These guys are NOT heroes! They are CRIMINALS! I challenge any of the big Right Wing Alternative media sites who continue to give these Right Wing politicians a free pass on not stopping these shots to give me just one example of a politician in Washington D.C., in either the House or the Senate, or one single State Governor, who has stood up and said: We need to STOP ALL COVID SHOTS IMMEDIATELY!, just as MP Andrew Bridgen did earlier this week in the UK. There are none, to my knowledge, because they are ALL Pro-Vaccine, with most of them accepting donations from Big Pharma, and in many cases even owning stock in Big Pharma. You can hear it from their own mouths: Tim Truth did an excellent job in highlighting the other doctors on the round table discussion in Florida that clearly LIED to the people in Florida by telling parents that they should trust all other vaccines except the COVID shot, because these other vaccines have almost no side effects and are only 1 in a million, and that therefore parents need to keep vaccinating their children. They want parents to believe that the vaccine manufacturers only lied and committed criminal actions with the COVID shots, but not all the other vaccines they have produced for the past many years. A simple search in VAERS on all the other FDA approved childhood vaccines will clearly show this is a LIE from the pro-vaccine medical doctors who are simply politicizing the danger of the COVID shots for purely political gain. ALL of these pharmaceutical vaccine companies have paid out $BILLIONS in settlements to criminal lawsuits over the years. Since 1990, when the VAERS database started recording vaccine injuries and deaths, 326,715 cases of vaccine injuries and deaths have been filed for all FDA approved vaccines for children under the age of 18 to birth, before the COVID-19 shots started.

https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/news/20230613/cm/could-weight-loss-drug-treat-addiction-as-well-as-obesity,Could Weight Loss Drug Treat Addiction as Well as Obesity?,1,"June 13, 2023 – Could the class of new weight loss drugs including semaglutide – approved as Ozempic to treat type 2 diabetes and Wegovy to treat obesity – also curb addictions and compulsive behaviors? As demand for semaglutide for weight loss grew after Wegovy was approved by the FDA in June 2021, personal accounts of unexpected added benefits also began to surface for the class of medications known as GLP-1s, which mimic a natural hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 that helps a person feel full. Some patients taking these drugs for type 2 diabetes or weight loss also lost interest in addictive and compulsive behaviors such as drinking alcohol, smoking, shopping, nail biting, and skin picking, as reported in articles in The New York Timesand The Atlantic, among others. For now, the reports are merely anecdotal, so they're subjective and not yet clinically verified. But there's also some early research to support these observations. Recent and Upcoming Studies ""I hope that GLP-1 analogs in the future can be used against [alcohol use disorder], but before that can happen, several GLP-1 trials [are needed to] prove an effect on alcohol intake,"" said Anders Fink-Jensen, MD, the senior author of a recent randomized controlled trial of 127 patients with alcohol use disorder, or AUD. His study involved patients receiving 26 weeks of the first-generation GLP-1 agonist exenatide approved for type 2 diabetes, but this did not reduce the number of heavy drinking days, compared to a placebo. But in analyses done after the study ended, heavy drinking days and total alcohol intake were significantly reduced in the subgroup of patients with AUD and obesity as determined by a body mass index, or BMI, over 30. The participants were also shown pictures of alcohol or neutral subjects while they had functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Those who had received exenatide vs. a placebo had significantly less activation in their brains' reward centers when shown the pictures of alcohol. This shows that ""something is happening in the brain and activation of the reward center is hampered by the GLP-1 compound,"" said Fink-Jensen, a clinical psychologist at the Psychiatric Centre Copenhagen in Denmark. ""If patients with AUD already fulfill the criteria for semaglutide (or other GLP-1 analogs) by having type 2 diabetes and/or a BMI over 30, they can of course use the compound right now,"" he said. His team is also beginning a study, in patients with AUD and a BMI of 30 or above, to investigate the effects of semaglutide up to 2.4 milligrams weekly on alcohol intake. This is the maximum dose of semaglutide approved for obesity in the U.S. ""Based on the potency of exenatide and semaglutide,"" Fink-Jensen said, ""we expect that semaglutide will cause a stronger reduction in alcohol intake"" than exenatide. Animal studies have also shown that GLP-1 agonists suppress alcohol-induced reward, alcohol intake, motivation to consume alcohol, alcohol seeking, and relapse drinking of alcohol, according to researcher Elisabet Jerlhag Holm, PhD. These agents also suppress the reward, intake, and motivation to consume other addictive drugs like cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, and some opioids, said Jerlhag Holm, a professor in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. Her group recently published results of a study done in rats that provides evidence to help explain the anecdotal reports from patients with obesity treated with semaglutide who claimed they also reduced their alcohol intake. In the study, semaglutide both reduced alcohol intake (and relapse-like drinking) and decreased body weight of rats of both sexes. ""Future research should explore the possibility of semaglutide decreasing alcohol intake in patients with AUD, particularly those who are overweight,"" Jerlhag Holm said. ""AUD is a … disorder [involving various components], and one medication is most likely not helpful for all AUD patients,"" she said, ""and therefore an arsenal of different medications is beneficial when treating AUD patients."" Janice J. Hwang, MD, MHS, echoed these thoughts. ""Anecdotally, there are a lot of reports from patients (and in the news) that this class of medication impacts cravings and could impact addictive behaviors,"" she said. Still, ""I think it is much too early to tell"" whether these drugs might be approved for treating patients for addictions without more solid clinical trial data, said Hwang, an associate professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Meanwhile, another research group at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, led by psychiatrist Christian Hendershot, PhD, is conducting a clinical trial in 48 people with AUD who are also smokers. They aim to determine if patients who receive semaglutide shots at increasingly higher doses over 9 weeks will drink less alcohol and smoke less than those who receive a placebo shot. Results are expected in October.",8,0.08597119,0.21350501,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/colon-cancer-risks-higher-in-people-with-diabetes,Colon cancer risks higher in people with diabetes,1,"We've long known that routine colonoscopy screenings can save lives. But it's especially important not to skip the test if you have diabetes, a new analysis suggests. The study indicated that people with diabetes have a 47% greater risk of developing colorectal cancer compared with people without diabetes. Published in the November 2023 issue of JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data for about 55,000 people from 12 southeastern states who contributed at least two years of health information between 2002 and 2009. Participants (average age 51, the majority Black) indicated whether they had diabetes. Using three follow-up surveys, researchers tracked participants until 2018. People with diabetes were also twice as likely as those without the condition to develop colorectal cancer if they hadn't undergone colonoscopy screening, and were at even greater risk if they had ever smoked. Additionally, those diagnosed with diabetes within the previous five years had the greatest colorectal cancer risk. While current guidelines recommend that people at average risk of colorectal cancer start screenings at age 45, the study's findings suggest that routine screening might begin at an earlier age in some people with diabetes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/new-thinking-about-tinnitus,New thinking about tinnitus,1,"Experts have long debated the most common cause of tinnitus — a ringing, whooshing, roaring, or hissing in the ears without an external sound source. Some have maintained that tinnitus is triggered by hearing loss: with less sound coming in, the brain compensates by becoming hyperactive and generating a phantom noise. But that theory hasn't explained the problem for people with normal hearing tests who still have tinnitus. What causes tinnitus in those cases? Mounting evidence Increasingly, Harvard Medical School scientists are finding evidence that some people have ""hidden"" hearing loss: damage to the auditory nerve — which carries sound signals from the ear to the brain — that isn't picked up by conventional tests. Researchers first discovered the phenomenon in lab mice in 2009. ""From there, it wasn't difficult to add two and two by suggesting that the loss of these nerve fibers in people with normal hearing tests could be associated with tinnitus,"" says Stéphane Maison, a tinnitus researcher and associate professor of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery at Harvard Medical School. Subsequent studies began making the connection. The latest — believed to be the largest and most nuanced to date — was published Nov. 30, 2023, in Scientific Reports. Maison and his colleagues at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear recruited almost 300 people (ages 18 to 72) with normal hearing tests who had chronic tinnitus, no tinnitus, or intermittent tinnitus. Scientists measured participants' auditory nerve responses and brainstem activity. Compared with not having tinnitus, having chronic tinnitus was associated with a loss of auditory nerve fibers as well as increased brain activity. ""That fits with the idea that as a result of hearing loss, the brain increases its activity, which is possibly why you perceive a tone or a sound that isn't there,"" Maison says. What this means for treatment For people with measurable hearing loss, getting hearing aids sometimes reduces the perception of tinnitus. But hearing aids aren't recommended for people with normal hearing test results — even if your doctor suspects hidden hearing loss — since we don't have tests outside of research labs to measure it. Still, the new evidence linking hidden hearing loss and tinnitus offers hope for people with tinnitus. ""When you have hidden hearing loss, only a portion of the auditory nerve has degenerated. Another portion remains alive for years or decades. And a number of experiments by others have found that it's possible to regenerate nerve fibers in animal models,"" Maison says. ""If we can one day regenerate those fibers in humans, perhaps it might bring back missing information to the brain, reducing its hyperactivity and the perception of tinnitus."" Until that day comes — and it's unclear when or if it will — we have only limited ways to cope with the problem. What you can do If you have tinnitus despite a normal hearing test, report it to your primary care doctor or ear, nose, and throat specialist. In rare cases, the noise can be caused by a tumor or cyst pinching the auditory nerve, a buildup of earwax, or blood vessel damage. Sometimes treating underlying conditions like these can reduce or even eliminate the noise. More often, we can only learn to how to live with or reduce tinnitus. The following strategies may help. Distract your brain. Listening to white noise or nature sounds might make tinnitus seem quieter. Use a white noise machine, sleep headphones, earbuds, or a wearable sound-masking device. Use mind-body therapies. Cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based tinnitus treatment, and biofeedback can help you redirect negative thoughts and emotions linked to tinnitus. Join an online support group. Look for tinnitus groups on Facebook or through the American Tinnitus Association (www.ata.org; click on ""Support""). You may pick up tips that work for other people, or at least feel empowered by camaraderie. Reduce stress. Stress may increase both your perception of tinnitus and your reaction to it. Try yoga or tai chi to help manage stress; since you'll be concentrating on movement and breathing, you might not focus on the tinnitus as much. Live a healthier lifestyle. Practice good sleep hygiene, exercise daily, and limit alcohol intake. Each one of those healthy habits can help reduce the frequency and intensity of tinnitus, and also reduce stress. Consider trying bimodal stimulation. These new devices for home use provide two types of stimulation — for instance, sound along with gentle taps to the wrist delivered by a bracelet. ""They aren't yet widely recommended as there's not enough evidence that they work, but preliminary results are encouraging,"" Maison says. ""Ask your physician about your options.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/what-should-you-do-when-sciatica-flares,What should you do when sciatica flares?,1,"People with diagnosed sciatica have no trouble recognizing a flare-up. It strikes as numbness, tingling, or pain in the buttock and down the leg, caused by irritation to the sciatic nerve, which begins in the spine and travels downward into the leg. While it's easy to identify a flare-up, it's trickier to tamp it down. It may take a combination of approaches to ease discomfort. What is sciatica? Sciatica is the term for discomfort caused by irritation of the sciatic nerve. This nerve starts at each side of the low back and extends down through the buttocks, back of the thigh, and lower leg. Irritation usually occurs in the spine, with one of the nerve roots that eventually form the sciatic nerve. Anything pressing against a nerve root — such as a bony growth from arthritis in the spine or a bulging disc in between the spinal bones — can inflame the nerve root and send pain, numbness, or tingling all the way down one of the sciatic nerves. ""If you've never had it before, it's common to worry that you may have damaged your sciatic nerve. It's usually more of an irritation, however, as opposed to an outright injury,"" says Dr. Max Epstein, a physiatrist at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. ""But if you also experience muscle weakness or significant changes to your bowel or bladder habits, that could be a sign of nerve damage. In either case, you should speak to a health care provider as soon as possible."" Pill-free approaches Coping with sciatica discomfort starts with pill-free strategies that you can try immediately. Stay active. One of the most important things you can do when sciatica flares is to avoid bed rest. ""Part of low back pain is muscle-related, possibly because muscles surrounding the irritated nerve roots tighten and try to protect the area. Movement keeps the muscles loose and working correctly. If you don't move, they can get tight and increase pain,"" says Dr. Max Epstein, a physiatrist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Modify activities. If activity is painful, do only what you can tolerate. ""Think of a green, yellow, or red zone of pain. The green zone is a mild amount of pain while doing an activity. That's okay. But if you get into the yellow zone, it's time to pull back and modify an activity,"" Dr. Epstein says. ""For example, if it hurts to carry a full laundry basket, take out a few things. Or if it's painful to stand at the sink and do dishes, open the cabinet below the sink and rest your foot on the bottom of the cabinet. That will take tension off the nerve."" Stretch. Keep the muscles loose and limber with gentle stretching, but only within the green zone of pain. For example, you might stand and try to touch your toes to stretch your back and leg muscles. Or try some yoga poses. Dr. Epstein recommends the cat-cow: Get down on all fours, with your hands directly beneath your shoulders and your knees beneath your hips. Inhale and lift your head and tailbone toward the ceiling, while curving your lower spine toward the floor. As you exhale, round your back, bringing your chin toward your chest and tucking your tailbone under. Repeat the exercise 10 times. Use hot or cold therapy. Hot or cold therapy for sciatica can take many forms. For example, you might soak in a warm bath or apply a hot pack or a cold pack to your leg or back. ""What works for one person might not work for another, so you may have to experiment to see what's best for you,"" Dr. Epstein says. How does it help sciatica? ""Heat may loosen muscles, and cold may tamp down inflammation, but we don't know for sure,"" Dr. Epstein explains. Relaxation. Staying relaxed is an important part of controlling both acute pain (the kind that's sudden and temporary) or chronic (ongoing) pain. ""All pain is processed in the mind. If you're able to calm the processing centers, the perception of pain may decrease,"" Dr. Epstein says. He recommends trying breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, or tai chi. Practicing mindfulness — focusing attention on the present moment — might also help ease discomfort by helping you to accept it. Drugstore remedies Several over-the-counter remedies can also play a part in relieving sciatica. Oral painkillers. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce inflammation, which reduces pain. But they may cause stomach ulcers and bleeding, liver or kidney damage, or an increased risk of heart attacks. So get your doctor's okay before using them, and find out the dose and frequency that's safe for you. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is often less effective at relieving sciatica pain than NSAIDs, but it's also less risky — unless you take it in very high doses, which can cause liver damage. The usual limit is no more than 3,000 milligrams (mg) per day, but your doctor might set a lower limit depending on your health. Topical painkillers. Applying painkillers to your skin as creams, gels, or patches can also bring sciatica relief. Topical NSAIDs such as diclofenac gel (Voltaren) may have fewer risks than NSAID pills, since topicals stay close to the site of application and aren't well absorbed by the rest of the body. But it's still wise to check with your doctor before using them. Other types of topicals with fewer risks than NSAIDs include creams, sprays, and patches that contain anesthetics such as lidocaine; pain signal interrupters such as menthol or capsaicin; or arnica gel, an herbal remedy thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. Turmeric supplements. Turmeric (a golden-yellow spice) contains curcumin, which appears to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. ""Although there have not yet been studies that prove its benefit, it's the one supplement that I would support for pain relief. There's no clear recommendation for dosage, but 1,000 mg per day might help. You can take it all at once or break it up into morning and evening doses,"" Dr. Epstein says. Call your doctor A typical flare-up lasts for a few days to a week or two. If it's not improving or responding to home remedies, it's time to make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor might order imaging tests and prescribe a prescription anti-inflammatory drug, such as oral or injected prednisone. ""That will buy you a window of time to strengthen muscles without pain, and keep them flexible,"" Dr. Epstein says. ""That will help keep your body strong and protected, so you'll be in a better place than where you started."" What if you don't reach out for help? ""At times the nerve stays irritated for years,"" Dr. Epstein says. ""So try not to delay treatment. Usually our interventions are able to put out the fire or at least calm the severity of the symptoms in a meaningful way.""

For the analysis, published online Nov. 16, 2023, by BMC Medicine, researchers evaluated results from 32 earlier studies involving tens of thousands of healthy adults on three continents. Participants answered detailed questions about the foods they typically ate, and researchers followed them for an average of 19 years to assess any links between their diets and health outcomes, adjusting for other factors such as calorie intake, physical activity, and smoking and alcohol use. Substituting a daily serving of processed meats — which include bacon, deli meats, hot dogs, and sausage — with nuts, beans, or whole grains was associated with 23% to 36% lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Replacing a serving of eggs each day with nuts was linked to 17% lower odds of cardiovascular problems. Meanwhile, participants were 10% less likely to develop diabetes if they substituted a serving of whole grains for red meat. The findings suggest that shifting from animal-based to plant-based foods can benefit cardiovascular health, the researchers said.

Even more horrifying than these statistics, are the statistics in VAERS for fetal deaths following pregnant and child-bearing women who received a COVID vaccine, which now stand at 4,571 as of the latest update to VAERS. (Source.) That means we are looking at around 450,000 fetal deaths as a result of the COVID-19 vaccines. Using the exact same search we performed on COVID-19 vaccines to find abortions, stillbirths, and ectopic pregnancies for all FDA approved vaccines for the previous 30+ years, we find 2,245 reported cases, or about 75 fetal deaths per year. Taking the total fetal deaths following COVID-19 vaccines for the year 2021, 3,791 fetal deaths (source), that is an increase of nearly 5,000% over the yearly average of fetal deaths following all FDA-approved vaccines for the previous 30 years. Many doctors today are sounding the alarm over this tragic number of fetal deaths, but their voices are silenced in the corporate media. See: And we can add one more doctor to those we previously reported, Dr. Kimberly Biss in Florida, who has now gone public to announce that not only are they seeing an increase in miscarriages following COVID-19 vaccines, but also an increase in infertility and cervical cancer. !function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src=""https://rumble.com/embedJS/ufs3s9""+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+""/?url=""+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+""&args=""+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, ""script"", ""Rumble""); 15 seconds 15 seconds Rumble(""play"", {""video"":""v1lkdfc"",""div"":""rumble_v1lkdfc""}); Some teachers are also now starting to come forward and publicly state that they are seeing an increase in “sudden deaths” among the children in their schools. !function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src=""https://rumble.com/embedJS/ufs3s9""+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+""/?url=""+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+""&args=""+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, ""script"", ""Rumble""); 15 seconds 15 seconds Rumble(""play"", {""video"":""v1vbenk"",""div"":""rumble_v1vbenk""}); “KIDS DON’T JUST GET MYOCARDITIS AND HAVE HEART ATTACKS AND DIE!!!!” by Lioness of Judah Ministry According to this teacher, young girls were perfectly healthy with no underlying health conditions.

Here are some recent stories about children who “died suddenly.” by StopCensura.online A sad Monday for the school community of the high school “ Majorana ” in the San Paolo district of Bari. A student, just 14 years old, died of a fulminating heart attack. A news that shook teachers and students who, on their return from the Sunday break, learned of the tragic event that took place outside the classrooms. The same principal of the institute, Paola Petruzzelli, reported it, who expressed his condolences on Fb for the death of the very young student. Corriere del Mezzogiorno writes it. « This morning it was very sad to get to school and to know that one of our students flew to heaven for a fulminating heart attack – wrote the institution’s manager on social networks -. A life of smiles, of goals, of challenges, of loves that will not exist. One less life, one of many at this time when heart attacks are increasing exponentially. Every week is a war bulletin. But nobody seems to notice it». Full article. by Independent.ie A 14-year-old boy died three weeks after his Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine, an inquest has heard. The death was described by Co Mayo coroner Pat O’Connor as an issue is of “significant public concern”. Family members held hands as the inquest into the death of Joseph McGinty, of Achill Island, got underway at Castlebar Courthouse. A request for safety information from Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer Pfizer is to form part of the “considerable investigation” to be conducted into the death. The teenager, a second-year school student, was vaccinated with the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on August 20, 2021. He died at home just over three weeks later on September 13, 2021. The teenager suffered significant medical deterioration following the administration of the vaccine, the inquest heard. He was hospitalised on September 1 and stayed overnight at Mayo University Hospital before he was discharged the following day. He attended hospital again on September 8 for review. “The circumstances of Joseph McGinty’s death is that Covid vaccination was administered to him; that there appears to have been either a reaction or a significant change in his medical circumstances following the administration of the vaccine and that subsequently, unfortunately, Master McGinty died,” coroner Pat O’Connor said. Patricia McGinty formally identified her son’s remains on the day of his death but “has very little recollection of the morning in question”, barrister for the family Rita Kilroy of Lavelle Bourke Solicitors told the court. The inquest requires “considerable investigation into the vaccine, the effects of the vaccine and also the effects of the vaccine on Master McGinty”, the coroner said. As a result, the case could take “months or possibly years to conclude its findings”, Mr O’Connor said. Full Article. by EuroWeekly News Heartbreak as “dearly loved” Hannah Morgan, 13, dies suddenly. Image: GoFundMe The Carrickfergus Academy, a secondary school in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Northern Ireland of which Hannah Morgan was a pupil, led tributes for the young girl who died suddenly on Wednesday, November 23. A spokesperson for the east Antrim school said late on Thursday, November 24: “The pupil’s staff and governors of Carrickfergus Academy wish to express their deepest and most sincere condolences to the family and friends of Hannah Morgan who died suddenly yesterday. “Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the family at this very sad time.” A GoFundMe page set up in memory of the young schoolgirl read: “Hi my name is Bethanie I have permission from Hannah’s Family to fundraise for her funeral, as many people know Hannah was only 13 years old who tragically passed away my thoughts are with Rodney, Lynn and Chloe xx” A post on the Funeral Times website described the teenager as the “dearly loved and loving daughter of Rodney and Lynn, much-loved sister of Chlöe and partner Phil, devoted granddaughter of Billy and the late Irene, John and the late Marie, loving niece of Lesley, husband Trev, Stephen and a cherished cousin.” Full article. by WSOC-TV UNION COUNTY, N.C. — A Union County middle school football team is honoring an 11-year-old boy who left a lasting impression before he died suddenly, just months before joining the team. From the moment the football team’s season started, their mission was clear. Perhaps even more important than how they play is who the team is playing for. “We want it to be bigger than just football,” said John Arthur, head football coach of the sixth grade team. “I encourage the kids all the time. This is a brotherhood. Eli is always with us.” Eli Svonovec had a smile that could often be seen through his eyes. His friends joked the 11-year-old was one of the funniest people you’d ever meet. “He was really funny. Really stupid,” remembered 12-year-old Connor Hix. Svonovec was also someone who made friends almost instantly. “We were in the same neighborhood. The same class. The same everything, and I just asked him if he wanted to be my friend,” Hix said. 11-year-old Vincent Buckowsky agreed. “In second grade, me and my friend Garrett used to hang out a lot and then Eli joined our school. He started playing with us at recess and we just got closer,” Buckowsky said. Arthur said coaching the Mavericks has had a huge influence on his life. “This has been a truly ground-shaking experience for me,” Arthur said. “I didn’t know where to start other than at square one.” The Mavericks started by dedicating their entire season to Eli, and they even placed a quirky reminder at the top of mind: a ketchup bottle sticker on each player’s helmet. “I remember reading his obituary and it talks about at the very end, ‘ketchup is the greatest condiment in the world’ and I got a good kick out of that,” Arthur said laughing. “It just made me laugh. Man that would be something cool to incorporate.” And so they did. Over Labor Day weekend, during the first play of the game, the Mavericks lined up with ten players instead of 11. That last spot was reserved for Eli. “They realize it’s bigger than just themselves,” Arthur said. “We had a touchdown last week scored by one of his best friends and he points to the sky, and I thought it was so touching — not heartbreaking, but touching just because he really just impacted these kids so much.” Full article. Community members are mourning the sudden passing of a young Richmond girl. Danielle Mei Cabana, 6, was admitted to the BC Children’s hospital with flu symptoms and passed away last week. According to an Instagram post by dad Denis Cabana, Danielle had caught the flu at the same time as her sisters around Remembrance Day. Danielle was taken to the hospital last Wednesday when she appeared to be still fighting the flu after her sisters had recovered. She was soon moved to the ICU where she was diagnosed with myocarditis due to the flu. She subsequently received two heart procedures and began to breathe on her own last Saturday, but ultimately passed away after suffering a “massive stroke.” “While we may not be able to see or touch her again, her spirit and memories will live forever within her parents and sisters,” wrote Denis. “We will honour her life and make sure she experiences a full life through our eyes.” Full article.

https://healthimpactnews.com/2022/alert-fda-clears-chicken-grown-in-a-laboratory-by-medical-doctor/,"ALERT! FDA Clears ""Chicken"" Grown in a Laboratory by Medical Doctor",0,"Original image source. by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News The FDA has given a green light to laboratory-grown chicken cell lines that were developed by a medical doctor. An unprecedented move by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week could change how we consume meat. “The fact that the FDA green-lit Upside Foods’ cultivated chicken to move forward to coming to market is something that’s never happened in the history of humanity,” said Uma Valeti, CEO and co-founder of Upside Foods. Upside Foods is a California-based company behind the first lab-grown meat to receive FDA clearance, bringing it a step closer to U.S. grocery stores and restaurants. Valeti, a cardiologist who worked at the Mayo Clinic, says he stopped eating meat in medical school when he saw the detriment of mass meat production, but then he saw an opportunity for a slaughter-free option. “During my work in cardiology, we were working with stem cells and injecting them into patients’ hearts to regrow the heart muscle and that’s where this idea came from – ‘can you grow meat directly from animal cells?’ And if so, what would that mean to the world?” (Full article.) Reading the headlines and press releases on this action by the FDA, one is led to believe that the FDA has approved this lab-grown “chicken.” But the FDA doesn’t approve foods. They monitor food safety and labeling, but they do not approve foods. They only approve drugs. Here is the actual press release from the FDA: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed its first pre-market consultation for a human food made from cultured animal cells. We evaluated the information UPSIDE Foods submitted to the agency and have no further questions at this time about the firm’s safety conclusion. The firm will use animal cell culture technology to take living cells from chickens and grow the cells in a controlled environment to make the cultured animal cell food. The FDA’s pre-market consultation with the firm included an evaluation of the firm’s production process and the cultured cell material made by the production process, including the establishment of cell lines and cell banks, manufacturing controls, and all components and inputs. The voluntary pre-market consultation is not an approval process. Instead, it means that after our careful evaluation of the data and information shared by the firm, we have no further questions at this time about the firm’s safety conclusion. (Source.) So what does this actually mean? In terms of how safe this product is, it means NOTHING. This was a “voluntary,” “pre-market consultation” paid for by the company planning to market this product, so that they could use the FDA logo with their product giving the illusion that the FDA has actually approved this product, when in fact they have not. Do we really need a lab-cultured product called “chicken” produced by a medical doctor who has no training in agriculture or nutrition? Has the FDA and the medical system given us any evidence that they are truly concerned about human health during the past couple years since COVID came out? The USDA will also look at this product and give it some kind of stamp of approval, but this will primarily only be for the facilities that produce it, since that is what the USDA currently does for agricultural meat products. Who will conduct the studies on how this lab-grown “chicken” will affect human health once people start consuming it? You will, along with the rest of the public who decides to start eating it. The American consumer will become the lab rats in what will basically become the Phase III trials to see how their health will be affected after consuming this lab-created product. And who are the investors that are bringing this product to market? Investors include top meat producer Tyson, Bill Gates, Richard Branson, and Elon Musks’ brother Kimbal Musk. (Source.) Now there’s a bunch of names we can certainly trust to look out for our health! I am sure they will figure out all kinds of ways to integrate their other products into this new lab-grown chicken, like maybe mRNA proteins that a certain percentage of the population does not want to take via injections. Given the U.S. consumer’s distaste for plant-based laboratory produced “meats”, it would seem that most consumers are not all that interested in lab-grown meats. See: And it is admitted that this new cell-cultured lab “chicken” is going to be very expensive until they can figure out how to scale it to bring costs down. So here is my warning and prediction about this new class of lab-grown meats. Look for them to take a page out of the vaccine marketing strategy, where the government funds the purchase of the product, and then mandates it to increase distribution. If they trial these expensive lab-grown cultured meats in grocery stores and restaurants and the consumers don’t go for it, look for the U.S. Government to step in and start purchasing it, and then distributing it as “institutional foods” that are subsidized by the government. This would include school lunch programs, hospital food, prison food, and maybe the soon-to-come FEMA food distribution programs that will arise once the supply chains collapse and people start starving because they can no longer purchase food in their local stores. REAL food is not grown by technocrats in a laboratory. It is created by God and produced by human labor. See: The sooner you can learn to start producing your own food, and working with people in your local community to produce REAL food, the better. Register Here.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-alkaline-water-better,Is alkaline water better?,1,"Question: Is alkaline water better for you than plain water? Answer: The simple answer is no. There is not any evidence to support choosing bottled or home-treated alkaline water over safe tap water or regular bottled water. To better understand what is meant by alkaline water, let's start with a review of pH. This is a measure of the acid-base balance of a fluid. The range of pH is zero to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral. A pH above 7 means the fluid is alkaline (basic) and a pH below 7 is acidic. The higher the pH number the more alkaline it is, and the lower the number the greater the acidity. For reference, the normal pH of our blood is slightly alkaline, with a range of 7.35 to 7.45. The fluid in the human stomach is very acidic, with a usual pH of 1.5 to 3.5. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that town water pH should range between 6.5 and 8.5, with most town water averaging around 7.5. Common bottled waters are usually close to neutral at a pH of 7.0. Bottled alkaline water has a higher pH between 8 and 9. Because the fluid in the stomach is so acidic, once regular or alkaline water gets down to your stomach there will be little difference in the resulting stomach fluid pH. You could potentially raise the stomach fluid pH by drinking a lot of alkaline water, but it would only be temporary. Even if you drank enough alkaline water to slightly raise the pH of your blood, your kidneys would quickly go into action to rebalance your blood pH. One potential benefit of alkaline water is to provide symptom relief of heartburn from acid reflux. But again, this would only be temporary. There are much more effective options, such as antacids and drugs that block stomach acid production. There are possible disadvantages from drinking alkaline water with pH levels above 9. The water will likely have a bitter taste. And for people who regularly take stomach acid production blockers called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to maintain a higher stomach pH, drinking strong alkaline water could be dangerous. Adding alkaline water could raise that pH even more and might result in an increased blood pH, which can alter the normal blood levels of chemicals like potassium, especially if they have kidney disease.",3,0.19747761,-0.108025216,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/alert-this-hidden-condition-increases-heart-attack-and-stroke-risks,Alert: This hidden condition increases heart attack and stroke risks,1,"It has an unfamiliar name, produces few symptoms, and involves a cluster of health problems. But metabolic syndrome is a common and dangerous condition that's steadily increasing in adults of all ages in the United States, largely a result of the obesity epidemic. The syndrome significantly increases the risks for heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and more. What is it? Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interrelated conditions. A diagnosis requires at least three of the following cardiovascular risk factors. Obesity. You have this risk factor if your waistline is greater than 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women, no matter your height, or if your body mass index is 30 or more. High blood sugar. After you eat, your body converts carbohydrates into blood glucose, a type of sugar that the body uses for energy. Sugar in the blood then enters your cells, where it's needed to produce energy. In people with diabetes or prone to it, this process is impaired, raising sugar levels in the blood and damaging the cells and blood vessels. A fasting blood sugar level of 100 milligrams per deciliter of blood (mg/dL) or more is considered high. Having diabetes (a fasting blood sugar of 126 mg/dL or higher) also counts as a metabolic syndrome risk factor. High triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood. Having a high level — 150 mg/dL or higher — increases your risk for heart disease and stroke. You can find your triglyceride levels in your cholesterol test results. Low HDL (good) cholesterol. HDL is another type of fat in the blood. It helps remove LDL (bad) cholesterol. If your HDL is below 40 mg/dL in men or 50 mg/dL in women, it's considered low. High blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if your systolic pressure (the top number in a measurement) is 130 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher, or your diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is 80 mm Hg or higher. If you're already taking medication for high blood pressure, you should still count this condition as a metabolic risk factor. What does it mean? When three or more of these risk factors occur together, metabolic syndrome is present, and numerous studies have shown that means you have higher risks for heart disease and stroke. ""Having just one of the risk factors is bad enough. But having more makes the likelihood of bad health outcomes greater. That's why clinicians developed the term metabolic syndrome many years ago: it helped identify people at risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Today we have even better risk calculators, which take other risk factors into account, such as age and activity levels. But you can still pay attention to metabolic syndrome as a way to recognize that trouble is brewing,"" says Dr. David M. Nathan, a Harvard Medical School professor and the director of the Diabetes Center and Clinical Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. Metabolic syndrome also increases the risk for developing liver disease, kidney disease, or sleep apnea (a condition marked by pauses in breathing during sleep). What to eat when you have metabolic syndrome Having metabolic syndrome means you're likely overweight or that you have another condition, such as high blood sugar, cholesterol, or blood pressure, that may be stoked by an unhealthy diet. One of the best antidotes is eating a healthy plant-based diet. Swap junk food for lots of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and whole grains; moderate amounts of fish and poultry; and limited portions of red or processed meats. And do one thing more: ""Eat less. If you expend more calories than you're taking in, you'll lose weight,"" says Harvard Medical School diabetes expert Dr. David M. Nathan. His go-to tricks: eat smaller portions and focus on foods high in fiber (such as vegetables and legumes), which will keep you fuller longer. Diagnosis and treatment You can measure your waist to see if you have at least one metabolic syndrome risk factor. But you can't see the others. So perhaps discuss it at your next doctor appointment, and double-check your annual blood work results. The good news is that you can reverse metabolic syndrome. Losing weight is central to reducing many of its features. Lowering elevated blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels also plays a major role in reducing your risk for heart disease and stroke. If you can do that and live a healthy lifestyle — exercising daily, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, not smoking, and limiting alcohol intake — you'll not only decrease your risks for heart disease and diabetes, but also increase your odds of living longer.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/will-walking-faster-reduce-your-diabetes-risk,Will walking faster reduce your diabetes risk?,1,"A study published online Nov. 28, 2023, by the British Journal of Sports Medicine suggests that picking up the pace of your daily walk — the faster, the better — is linked to a lower risk of developing diabetes. Researchers pooled the data of 10 studies from the past two decades, representing more than 508,000 adults (most of them middle-aged) from around the world. Participants were followed for three to 11 years. Compared with ""casual"" walking (at less than 2 mph), walking 2 mph to 3 mph (brisk walking) was associated with a 15% lower risk of diabetes, no matter how long people walked each day. Walking 3 mph to 4 mph was associated with a 24% lower diabetes risk. And going faster than 4 mph was tied to a 39% lower diabetes risk. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that lively stepping keeps you from getting diabetes. But we already know that brisk walking, like any aerobic activity that works your heart and lungs, helps you control blood sugar levels, weight, and cardiovascular health, which are all important for avoiding diabetes and many other chronic diseases.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/anti-obesity-drug-lowers-heart-related-problems,Anti-obesity drug lowers heart-related problems,1,"Semaglutide — the highly in-demand drug that leads to dramatic weight loss — may also prevent heart attacks, strokes, and deaths in people with heart disease. This finding, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in the fall of 2023, marks the first time an treatment for obesity has been shown to help people live longer and have fewer cardiovascular problems (see ""Diet drugs: A disheartening history""). Developed as a drug for treating type 2 diabetes, semaglutide was first marketed as Ozempic. In addition to improving blood sugar control, the drug also helped people lose substantial amounts of weight. After studies confirmed this benefit, the FDA approved a higher-dose version of semaglutide (sold as Wegovy) for people who are overweight or obese. Diet drugs: A disheartening history For decades, drug companies have struggled to develop an effective, safe drug to help people lose weight. ""But many initially promising drugs never made it through the development phase, and others had to be pulled from the market,"" says Dr. Benjamin Scirica, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The most infamous example dates from 1997. A combination of two drugs, fenfluramine and phentermine (commonly known as phen-fen) was removed from pharmacy shelves after people taking the drug developed severe heart valve disease and pulmonary hypertension. In 2010, sibutramine (Meridia) was also withdrawn from the market after studies linked its use to a heightened risk for heart attack and stroke. Evidence for heart benefits The NEJM study compared a 2.4-milli­gram dose of semaglutide (the highest dose of Wegovy) to a placebo in more than 17,000 people with cardiovascular disease. All were overweight or obese, but none had diabetes. Over a follow-up period averaging 3.3 years, those who took semaglutide were 20% less likely to have a heart attack or stroke or to die from heart-related causes compared with those who took a placebo. ""The findings highlight the fact that obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease,"" says Dr. Benjamin Scirica, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. People taking semaglutide lost an average of nearly 19 pounds, which probably explains why their blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and inflammation levels all improved. However, other factors could also be involved, he says. A hormone mimic Semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) that mimic hormones made naturally by the gut and brain. These drugs prod the pancreas to release insulin, which helps control blood sugar. They also slow stomach emptying and suppress appetite, so people eat less. But there are also GLP-1 receptors in the heart, kidneys, and blood vessels, which means some of the heart-related benefits may be unrelated to weight loss, says Dr. Scirica. A related drug, terzepatide, combines GLP-1 with GIP, a hormone believed to promote the effects of GLP-1. Sold as Mounjaro for treating diabetes and as Zepbound for weight loss, terzepatide appears to foster even greater weight loss than semaglutide. A clinical trial testing terzepatide in people with obesity and a high risk of heart disease is currently under way. Who's a candidate? Anyone with type 2 diabetes is a candidate for either Ozempic or Mounjaro. ""I have many patients doing well on these drugs, and they are usually covered by insurance,"" says Dr. Scirica. Still, only about 30% of people with cardiovascular disease have diabetes. A far greater percentage — well over 50% — of people with cardiovascular disease are overweight or obese. Wegovy and Zepbound are FDA-approved for weight loss in people who meet the definition of obesity (a body mass index, or BMI, of 30 of greater) and for those who fall into the upper end of the overweight category (a BMI of 27 to 29.9) and also have a medical problem related to excess weight, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. But the overwhelming demand for these drugs means they're in short supply, Dr. Scirica says. They're also quite expensive, ranging from $900 to $1,600 per month. Medicare does not cover any medications for weight loss, although some private insurance companies do. However, given the intense interest and enthusiasm about these drugs, experts believe that recommendations as to who should use them will change in the coming years. What can you do in the meantime? ""Call your insurance company to see what your options are based on your current medical conditions, then speak with your physician,"" advises Dr. Scirica.

https://healthimpactnews.com/2022/pfizer-and-moderna-to-investigate-their-own-vaccines-for-myocarditis-risks/,Pfizer And Moderna To Investigate Their Own Vaccines For Myocarditis Risks,0,"by ZeroHedge News Excerpts: Why is Big Pharma investigating their own covid vaccines for myocarditis side effects if the vaccines were already supposedly tested and proven safe and effective? Both Pfizer and Moderna have announced that they will be undertaking studies to determine the longer term risks of Myocarditis (an inflammatory condition of the heart which can lead to death) for people who have been injected with the mRNA based covid vaccines. The decision comes after the release of multiple medical studies which show a correlation and causation between the vaccines and an exponential increase in heart problems, specifically among men 40 years old and younger. Only a year ago the link between covid vaccinations and myocarditis was widely denied. Studies also show that myocarditis risk increases with the number of boosters a person has taken. Mainstream media “fact checkers” insist that the covid vaccines were “initially effective” in preventing transmission of the original strains of the virus. There is no concrete evidence to confirm this. In fact, covid cases of the original variants began to plunge in the US and in other countries before the vaccines were widely distributed. This is a fact, and the incredible drop in cases was likely due to an increase in natural immunity within the population. Some government and Big Pharma funded scientists also argue that mRNA technology as a whole has been tested for many years. This is a dishonest misdirection. The technology and concept might have been tested in various experiments for years, but the specific covid vaccines were not, and this matters. Any scientist that says this claim is a foundation for safety confirmation for the vaccines should be ashamed of themselves. Studies which take natural immunity and asymptomatic reactions into account when determining vaccine efficacy are highly limited. There is no way to know if a person survived covid or avoided infection because they were vaccinated, or because they already had the virus, experienced minor symptoms or no symptoms, and developed natural immunity. Government paid virologists and scientists don’t seem to care about testing the distinction. What we do know from various studies is that natural immunity is far superior in every way to mRNA vaccination. The dangers of releasing a pharmaceutical cocktail for mass consumption or even forced mass consumption without long term study cannot be overstated. The bottom line? Given the current information, no one knows for sure what will happen in terms of vaccine effects over a long timeline (several years). Pharma companies don’t know and governments don’t know (if we take their production claims for the vaccines as accurate). In all likelihood, Pfizer and Moderna are trying to get out ahead of burgeoning side effects with their own studies as a means to spin or mitigate bad press in the future. The chances of these studies providing honest data driven assessments are low.",4,-0.28417063,0.44679558,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-big-problem-of-ministrokes,The big problem of ministrokes,1,"Many people who suffer a first-time stroke had a prior warning from a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a ministroke. ""TIAs usually produce typical stroke symptoms, but because they are mild and brief they tend to be missed or ignored,"" says Dr. Erica Camargo Faye, a stroke neurologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""But a TIA is your body warning that you're at high risk for a full stroke, and you need to listen."" Why TIAs happen A TIA occurs when too little oxygen-rich blood reaches part of the brain. Often, the underlying cause is fatty plaque buildup inside an artery in the neck, such as the carotid artery, or an artery in the brain. The plaque narrows the artery and invites blood clots to form on top of the plaque, impeding healthy blood flow. Another cause is when a blood clot in the heart or carotid artery breaks away and travels to the brain, temporarily blocking a blood vessel there. Similarly, a sudden drop in blood pressure can decrease blood flow through a narrowed artery and trigger a TIA. TIAs can last anywhere from 30 seconds to 20 minutes, although most usually last at least five minutes. ""Because TIAs don't last long and don't always have an immediate, lasting effect, it's easy for people to shrug them off,"" says Dr. Camargo Faye. A TIA does not guarantee you will have a future stroke, but it does suggest you are at high risk. Nearly one in five people who have a suspected TIA will experience a full-blown stroke within three months, according to a scientific statement from the American Heart Association in the March 2023 issue of the journal Stroke. The risk of a stroke is highest during the 48 hours following the initial TIA. Early recognition of the likely cause of a TIA is the best way to prevent a stroke. Because most TIAs are related to a temporary clot forming in a narrowed brain artery, the usual treatment begins with two antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix), or an anticoagulant medication to prevent additional blood clots from forming. Less often, a major blockage in one of the two carotid arteries is the culprit and needs to be opened by surgery or a procedure called endarterectomy. Can you prevent a TIA? TIAs and regular strokes share many risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure, alcohol misuse, diabetes, high cholesterol levels, and excess body weight. ""Many of these are more common in men than women, especially smoking and excessive drinking,"" says stroke neurologist Dr. Erica Camargo Faye with Massachusetts General Hospital. Another condition linked to TIA is atrial fibrillation, a quivering or irregular heartbeat. Some research suggests that excessive amounts of testosterone therapy could increase a man's risk of TIA and stroke. ""But making smarter health choices, such as moderation in drinking, a diet high in fruits and vegetables, and daily exercise, is one of the best ways to prevent TIAs,"" says Dr. Camargo Faye. Know the warning signs TIAs can recur with the same symptoms or different ones. The acronym BE-FAST can help people recognize signs and symptoms. Most people experience one or more of these during a TIA: B: Balance. Balance problems caused by a TIA often make it difficult to stand up, or you may fall to one side. E: Eyes. The most common vision problem is being unable to see from one or both eyes. Often, people see a dark gray shade that blocks half or all of their vision. Blurred or double vision can also occur. F: Face. The face may droop on one or both sides. Usually, the corner of the mouth appears pulled down, and the person can't smile normally. A: Arm weakness. This is the most common symptom and usually occurs on only one side and may also include numbness or tingling. S: Speech difficulty. Slurred or garbled speech is the most common type of speech problem, but some people struggle to find words or understand what others say. This deficit also extends to writing and texting. T: Time. This is not a symptom, but a command: it's time to call 911 or go straight to an emergency room, even if the symptoms lasted only one or two minutes.

And now a Harvard study published online Oct. 19, 2023, by The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests that eating red meat each week — even just a little — is tied to increased diabetes risks. Researchers analyzed information from more than 216,000 men and women (average age 46 when the study began) who answered questions about their health and diet every few years, for up to 36 years. Compared with people who reported eating the least red meat each week, people who reported eating the most had a 62% higher risk of developing diabetes. For each additional daily serving of processed red meat (such as bacon or a hot dog), participants had a 46% greater risk of diabetes. The risk was 24% higher for each additional daily serving of unprocessed red meat (like pork, beef, or lamb). The good news: swapping one daily serving of red meat for another protein (such as nuts or beans) was tied to a much lower risk of getting diabetes.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/science-fact-or-fiction-separating-ra-myths-from-facts#1,Everything you need to know about rheumatoid arthritis,1,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, autoimmune disease. It causes inflammation, swelling, and pain in and around the joints and can affect other parts of the body. Various treatment options can help manage it. RA usually affects the hands and feet first, but it can occur in any joint. It usually involves the same joints on both sides of the body. Common symptoms include stiff joints, especially when getting up after sleeping or after sitting down for a while. Some people experience fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell. The Rheumatoid Arthritis Support Network estimates that RA affects up to 1% of the world’s population and over 1.3 million Americans. The incidence of RA has increased Trusted Source globally over the past decades and will continue to increase in the coming years. RA is an autoimmune disease, which means that a person’s immune system mistakes the body’s healthy tissues for foreign invaders. It is also a systemic disease that can affect the whole body. As the immune system responds, inflammation occurs in the target tissue or organ. This can include the joints, lungs, eyes, and heart in RA. Signs and symptoms of RA usually occur in the wrists, hands, or feet and include: The following images show how RA can present physically: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Trusted Source , people most often experience the onset of RA in their 60s. Symptoms may start slowly and often worsen gradually with time. People with RA usually experience periods when their symptoms get worse, known as flares. RA symptoms may flare up due to stress, overactivity, or stopping medications. Sometimes, a person with RA can go into remission if their symptoms go away or are mild. Most people continue to experience flares and remissions throughout their lives. RA usually affects the same joints on both sides of the body. Pain and stiffness tend to worsen after periods of inactivity. Severe RA can lead to other complications throughout the body and cause joint damage that may lead to disability. Treatment can help manage the severity of symptoms and may reduce the likelihood of experiencing complications. How does RA affect different parts of the body?

Your privacy is important to us Nobody knows exactly what causes the immune system to malfunction, which leads to RA. It’s thought to be a combination of genetics and environmental factors. In RA, the immune system attacks the synovium, the membrane lining of joints. When this happens, the synovial cells proliferate, which leads to Trusted Source synovial thickening. Pain and inflammation result. Eventually, if left untreated, the inflammation can invade and destroy cartilage — the connective tissue that cushions the ends of the bones. The tendons and ligaments that hold the joint together can also weaken and stretch. The joint can eventually lose its shape and configuration, and the damage can be severe. Learn more about genetic and hereditary RA here. RA is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and swelling. Osteoarthritis leads to many of the same symptoms as RA but is due to the typical wear and tear of the joints. While RA usually affects the same joints on both sides of the body, osteoarthritis may only affect one side. Although other symptoms can help a person figure out if they are experiencing RA or osteoarthritis, only a doctor can diagnose these conditions. The CDC Trusted Source notes that people with a higher risk of developing RA may include those who: Learn more about the risk factors for RA here. It may be difficult for a doctor to diagnose RA in its early stages, as it can resemble other conditions such as lupus (SLE) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The CDC Trusted Source recommends getting a diagnosis within six months of the onset of symptoms so that treatment can begin as soon as possible. A doctor will look at the person’s clinical signs of inflammation and ask how long the person has experienced them and how severe their symptoms are. They will also perform a physical examination to check for swelling, functional limitations, or other unusual presentations. They also may recommend some tests, including: Several blood tests can help diagnose RA and rule out other conditions. They include: An X-ray or MRI of a joint can help Trusted Source a doctor identify what type of arthritis is present and monitor the progress of a person’s RA over time. Learn what arthritis looks like on an MRI. Guidelines Trusted Source recommend the following criteria for diagnosing RA: If a person has a diagnosis of RA, a doctor may refer them to a specialist known as a rheumatologist, who will advise on treatment options. Treatment will aim Trusted Source to: Options include medications, physical therapy, occupational therapy, counseling, and surgery. Some drugs can help relieve symptoms and slow the disease’s progression. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are available from pharmacies over the counter (OTC). Examples include Motrin, Advil, and Aleve. Long-term use and high doses can lead to side effects, including: Corticosteroids reduce pain and inflammation and may help slow joint damage, but they cannot cure RA. If NSAIDs do not work, a doctor may inject a steroid into the joint. Relief is usually rapid, but the effect is variable. It can last a few weeks or months, depending on the severity of the symptoms. This can help with acute symptoms or short-term flare-ups. However, a doctor will limit steroid injections to no more than three times per year because of their impact on the soft tissue structures around the joints. More frequent injections can potentially damage these structures or cause them to tear off from where they attach to bone. DMARDs affect how the immune system works. They can slow the progression of RA and prevent permanent damage to joints and other tissues by interfering with an overactive immune system. A person usually takes DMARDs for life. These types of medications are most effective if a person uses them in the early stages of RA, but it can take several weeks to a couple of months to fully experience their benefits. Some people may have to try different types of DMARDs before finding the most suitable one. Side effects can include: Biologic treatments, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, also change how the immune system works. When the human body faces an infection or other threat, it produces TNF-alpha, an inflammatory substance. TNF-alpha inhibitors suppress this substance and help prevent inflammation. TNF-alpha inhibitors can reduce pain, morning stiffness, and swollen or tender joints. People usually notice an improvement two weeks after starting treatment. Examples include: Possible side effects include Trusted Source : Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are a newer subtype of DMARD medications. These include: While traditional DMARDs stop the immune system from producing immune cells that cause RA to develop, JAK inhibitors target specific signaling molecules. This helps prevent the cellular process that causes RA to progress. For the 20–30% Trusted Source of people living with rheumatoid arthritis who do not respond to traditional DMARDs or biologics, JAK inhibitors have proven to be an effective option. An occupational therapist can help a person learn new and effective ways of carrying out daily tasks. This can minimize stress on painful joints. For example, a person with painful fingers might learn to use a specially devised gripping and grabbing tool. A physical therapist can advise people about using assistive devices, such as a cane, and help individuals develop a suitable exercise plan. Which exercises can help people with RA? In some cases, a doctor may recommend surgery to: The following procedures are possible: Learn why RA affects the hand joints. Finding time to practice self-care can help a person cope with the day-to-day challenges that RA brings. Several strategies that may help a person manage their condition include. RA generally develops Trusted Source in four stages: Stage 1: An X-ray will not show any bone or joint destruction. Stage 2: An X-ray will show the impact on the bone. Stage 3: An X-ray will show a particular kind of erosion of the cartilage and bone that a doctor can recognize as resulting from RA and deformities in the affected joints. Stage 4: The person will experience ankylosis, which is when a joint becomes stiff and fuses with the bone. Learn more about the four stages of RA here. Research Trusted Source has determined that there are genes that make developing RA more likely. One theory is that bacteria or viruses trigger RA in people who have these genes. One of the genes that may be responsible is HLA-DR4, and it is common in people of European ancestry. However, this may not fully explain why some people get RA and others do not. There are likely environmental triggers also. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cannot be completely prevented, as its exact cause is not fully understood and involves a combination of genetic, environmental, and possibly hormonal factors. However, a person can reduce their risk Trusted Source and potentially delay the onset of RA by taking several steps that include but are not limited to: Learn more about smoking and RA here. According to a 2015 study, people with RA might have a 54% higher Trusted Source risk of mortality compared with people who do not have the condition. RA patients often face additional chronic medical conditions and complications, severely impacting their health outcomes. Notably, there is a strong association between RA and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, leading to Trusted Source accelerated coronary artery disease. However, it is difficult to predict a person’s life expectancy as the course of the disease differs significantly among individuals. With the right treatment, many people can live past the age of 80 or even 90 years while experiencing relatively mild symptoms and only minor limitations in day-to-day life. Rheumatoid arthritis is a painful chronic autoimmune condition that can cause joint damage and make it difficult for a person to carry out their daily tasks. It can affect joints but can also lead to inflammation throughout the body. Anyone who experiences pain and swelling in two or more joints not caused by trauma should see a doctor, as early treatment can reduce the risk of long-term problems.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tips-to-navigate-a-sleep-divorce,"Tips to navigate a ""sleep divorce""",1,"When your bed partner regularly shatters your good night's rest — by snoring, kicking, tossing and turning, or stealing the covers, for example — you might wonder if you'd be better off sleeping apart. And you're not alone if you give it a try. A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that a third of respondents reported occasionally or regularly sleeping in separate rooms to accommodate a bed partner. Just keep in mind that the arrangement comes with a risk. ""Your relationship might suffer, especially if one person doesn't want to sleep apart or doesn't like the new sleeping environment,"" says Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. Here's what you can do if you're considering a ""sleep divorce."" Why consider a sleep divorce? Sleeping apart seems counterintuitive for couples. But a good night's sleep is very important for health. ""Sleep deprivation promotes depression, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating, which can keep you from engaging well with your partner. A lack of sleep also increases the risk for chronic health problems such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cognitive decline,"" notes Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. The goal is to sleep seven to nine hours per night. Work with your partner to make sleep a priority for both of you. And make that sleep top quality. Have a heart-to-heart first Discuss your partner's disruptive sleep behaviors with compassion, and talk about the problems that result for both of you. ""The conversation can be embarrassing. It requires you to be vulnerable, and a lot of sensitive topics might come up beyond sleep behavior,"" Dr. Collier says. ""If it's hard to communicate about it, consider a couples counseling session with an objective third party to guide you."" Seek a compromise Before seeking a complete sleep divorce, consider compromises that are acceptable to both of you. ""For example, if your partner's snoring wakes you up, try wearing earplugs, use a bedside sound machine, or wear earbuds and listen to a podcast as you fall asleep,"" Dr. Collier suggests. If snoring is a problem, your partner could try sleeping on his or her side and seeing a doctor to find out what's causing the snoring. Dr. Collier recommends you go together to the doctor's appointment so you both learn about any possible underlying conditions and treatments, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for sleep apnea. ""Another solution could be sleeping separately in the same room. Perhaps you each get a bed. That's helpful when one person awakens frequently to urinate or has involuntary twitching movements in the legs during sleep. Another idea is napping in the same place during the day but sleeping apart at night."" Sleeping apart successfully If you decide to try sleeping apart, consider following these guidelines. Make both sleeping spaces cozy. ""Neither of you should have to sleep on the couch,"" Dr. Collier says. ""You both need a good mattress and a comfortable sleeping environment that's cool, dark, and inviting. Make sure both parties are happy."" Schedule intimacy. Sharing a bed promotes personal connection, sexual activity, and feelings of comfort and security. To get the same intimacy when you sleep apart, Dr. Collier says, you must make a concerted effort. For example, if nighttime is when you have sex, cuddle, or share meaningful details of your day, schedule that before bedtime, and then move to separate rooms after your time together. Or set aside time for closeness during the day and make it a priority. Create a nighttime routine. It can be tough sleeping alone after years of being together, especially if you have anxiety or stress. ""You'll have to develop your own bedtime routine, one that makes you feel relaxed and sleepy, such as reading for a little while and then turning out the light and listening to a bedside sound machine. If you miss the comfort and security of your partner, sleeping with a body pillow or a weighted blanket might help,"" Dr. Collier says. ""Or, talk to your partner on the phone or in a video call as you're going to sleep. That way you can still be together."" Assess the arrangement regularly. Check in with each other daily to see what's working and what isn't. ""It's not good enough if it's helpful only for one person,"" Dr. Collier says. ""Go back to the drawing board and come up with something better. Your relationship is at stake, and so is your health and well-being. Sleeping apart can be beneficial if both parties are happy with the setup, both parties sleep well, and you continue to nurture your relationship.""

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/expert-qa-should-you-get-a-measles-vaccine-booster,Expert Q&A: Should you get a measles vaccine booster?,1,"According to official data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of April 3, 2025, there have been a total of 607 confirmed cases Trusted Source of measles across the United States though the actual numbers may be higher. Of these, 97% of cases occurred in individuals who were either unvaccinated or whose vaccination status remains unknown. The consensus remains that vaccination is the best way to protect against measles. United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been the latest official to endorse vaccination as “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.” The vaccine currently in use, referred to as the MMR vaccine, actually confers protection against mumps and rubella as well as measles, hence the abbreviation. Kennedy Jr. has also instructed the CDC to “supply pharmacies and Texas-run clinics with needed MMR vaccines and other medicines and medical supplies.” Typically, if following recommendations, children will receive two doses Trusted Source of the MMR vaccine — one at 12–15 months old and another at 4–6 years old — which confer 97% protection against measles. Receiving a single dose of the vaccine confers 93% protection against measles. People who have had MMR vaccination are protected for life. However, the current vaccine, developed in 1971 Trusted Source , is an improved formula compared to previous vaccinations. This raises the question: Should people who have already received a measles vaccine at any point receive a booster to ensure continued immunity? Medical News Today has asked David Cutler, MD, a board certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, to help answer these and other related questions. Cutler pointed out that “there will remain some uncertainty about the risk posed by measles to any one individual due to several factors.” These include: First of all, what is a vaccine booster, exactly, and what does it do? “A booster vaccine, just like an initial vaccine, will initiate or augment a person’s immune protection against measles,” Cutler explained. It acts as a “reminder” to the body’s immune system to “watch out” for a specific pathogen that it has already become “trained” to fight against through the initial vaccination.

Your privacy is important to us The first MMR vaccine became available in the U.S. in 1963 Trusted Source but, compared to current versions of the vaccine, it had a “weaker” formulation. So, if you are an adult who was vaccinated in childhood when exactly you got the measles vaccine may determine whether or not you would benefit from a booster. Other factors are at play, too, as Cutler noted. “Adults born before 1957 are considered immune to measles because they almost certainly had the disease during childhood,” the physician explained. He told us that blood tests are available for people who want to clarify their immune status and determine whether or not they should get a measles vaccine booster. That is the Immunoglobulin G (IgG) blood test: “Adults born after 1957 were probably vaccinated as children but may have received a less effective inactivated virus vaccine between 1963 and 1967. Anyone who is unsure of their immune status can get a blood test for measles antibody to determine their immunity. Finding sufficient IgG antibodies to measles means you are immune.” To summarise, “you might need a booster if you are a child who only received one dose of vaccine, an adult who received the inactivated vaccine, a high-risk adult who may be exposed to measles, or anyone whose blood test shows a lack of immunity,” said Cutler. “An adult who is certain they never had the disease, never had the vaccine, and has no factor posing undue risk from the vaccine should get the measles vaccine,” he emphasized. “Current recommendations are that children receive two doses of measles vaccine,” Cutler reiterated. Meanwhile, “adults at average risk should have at least one dose of vaccine at some time in their lives.” However, Cutler pointed out that some social categories should get two doses of the MMR vaccine in adulthood if they have not had the vaccine already, as they may face a higher risk of infection compared to their peers. According to the physician, “adults at particularly high risk” of measles include: The only adults who have never been vaccinated against measles who may not wish to get vaccinated are those who may face health risks from receiving a live virus vaccine — and the MMR vaccine counts as such. “The only currently available form of the measles vaccine is the combination MMR vaccine containing live, attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles) virus,” Cutler explained. People who may experience serious adverse reactions to attenuated live vaccines could include: However, even in such cases, the decision whether or not to receive a vaccine is not clear-cut—it all comes down to weighing the potential risks and benefits and figuring out the safest approach. “Balancing risks and benefits can be complicated for certain individuals who have greater vulnerability,” Cutler noted. “This is why it is important to consult with your primary care physician regarding whether measles or any vaccine may be appropriate for you,” he advised.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/shingles-vaccine-could-prevent-1-in-5-dementia-cases,Shingles vaccine could prevent 1 in 5 dementia cases,1,"Globally, the number of people affected by dementia increased Trusted Source by 117% between 1990 and 2016, with more than 57 million people now affected by the condition. And numbers are projected to rise to more than 150 million by 2050. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise Trusted Source that people can help reduce their risk of developing dementia by maintaining an active lifestyle and healthy diet, and controlling conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. However, some risk factors, including age and genetics, are beyond a person’s control. Research has shown that viral infections, particularly those that affect the nervous system, are associated with an increased risk of dementia. Now, a study led by scientists from Stanford Medicine, published in Nature Trusted Source , has demonstrated that vaccination against shingles, which occurs when the varicella zoster virus Trusted Source reactivates some time after initial infection, could decrease dementia risk by as much as 20%. The researchers suggest this provides further evidence of the link between viral infection and dementia, and that the vaccine could be a cost-effective way of reducing the risk of dementia. Courtney M. Kloske, PhD, Alzheimer’s Association director of Scientific Engagement, not involved in this study, commented for Medical News Today that: “This new study adds to our current knowledge by suggesting the shingles vaccine may also reduce someone’s risk of developing dementia. These new results, while preliminary, call for further studies in large, diverse study populations to inform public health strategy regarding whether vaccinations can decrease our risk of developing dementia as we age.” The study took advantage of a health policy in Wales which, on September 1, 2013, introduced the shingles vaccine, using a live-attenuated (weakened) form of the virus. The health authority offered the vaccine to all 79-year-olds (born on or after September 1, 1933), but anyone born before September 1, 1933 was not eligible. By selecting those born one week either side of September 1, 1933, the researchers had two age-matched groups of people, one of which had received the shingles vaccine and one which had not. Senior author on the study, Pascal Geldsetzer, MD, PhD, MPH, assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University, said in a press release that “[w]hat makes the study so powerful is that it’s essentially like a randomized trial with a control group — those a little bit too old to be eligible for the vaccine — and an intervention group — those just young enough to be eligible.” The researchers compared the health outcomes of both groups for the next 7 years. About half of those eligible for the vaccine received it, compared with almost none of those not eligible. In their analysis, they allowed for the fact that not everyone who was eligible for the vaccine received it. During the 7 year follow up, of the 296,324 people in the sample, 14,465 had at least one diagnosis of shingles. Those who had received the vaccine had a 37.2% lower relative risk of getting shingles than those were unvaccinated. In this study, the researchers did not differentiate between different types of dementia. A person was recorded as having dementia if there was a new diagnosis of dementia in the electronic health record data, or if dementia was listed on their death certificate as a primary or contributory cause of death. A total of 35,307 people were newly diagnosed with dementia during the 7-year follow-up period. Of these, people who had received the shingles vaccine were 3.5% less likely to receive a dementia diagnosis, which corresponds to a relative reduction of 20%. Steven Allder, MD, consultant neurologist at Re:Cognition Health, not involved in this research, told MNT that: “The findings strengthen the case for encouraging shingles vaccination in older adults. If further research confirms the link between the vaccine and lower dementia risk, it could make vaccination an even more compelling public health strategy. Given the high economic and social costs of dementia care, a relatively inexpensive vaccine could prove to be a cost-effective preventive measure.” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox.

This was seen despite the vaccination having similar effects on diagnoses of shingles and postherpetic neuralgia Trusted Source — chronic nerve pain that can last up to several months after shingles — in both men and women. “This could be due to biological differences in immune response between men and women,” Allder suggested. “Women generally have stronger immune reactions to vaccines, which might lead to a greater protective effect. Additionally, shingles is more common in women, so reducing its occurrence in this group might have a more pronounced impact on dementia rates,” he explained. In the United States, the CDC Trusted Source recommend the shingles vaccination, Shingrix, for those aged 50 or over, and for anyone over the age of 19 with a weakened immune system. Medicare or insurance may cover all or part of it. Generally in the U.S., the vaccine costs around $400 for the 2-dose course. According to the CDC, the vaccine is not associated with any severe adverse events, and is over 90% effective in preventing shingles. In the United Kingdom, the shingles vaccine is provided free by the National Health Service (NHS) to people between the ages of 60 and 80 and those who are immunocompromised Trusted Source . Each dose of the 2-dose course costs the NHS £160. It is also available privately, costing around £460 for two doses. The researchers who conducted the current study suggest that if further research verifies their findings, the shingles vaccine could be a much more cost-effective way to prevent or delay the condition than existing pharmaceutical interventions. Nevertheless, some key questions remain in place. The current study assessed dementia risk in people who had received the older vaccine, which used a live-attenuated form of the virus. Shingrix is a recombinant zoster vaccine. David Cutler, MD, board-certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, not involved in the research, urged some caution about the findings. Cutler asked: “If the effect on dementia was real, was it due to the vaccine or was it due to the lower incidence of shingles in the study population?“ “Clearly the Zostavax vaccine was effective at preventing shingles. However,“ he cautioned, “that vaccine is no longer available in the United States. Instead, we have the much more effective Shingrix vaccine.” “Until a study is done comparing the Zostavax and Shingrix vaccines, involving thousands of people over many years (very costly, and unlikely to occur) it won’t be known if the Shingrix vaccine will yield comparable effects,” he told MNT. According to Allder: “While this study provides strong evidence of a link between shingles vaccination and lower dementia risk, a randomized controlled trial would be needed to establish a definitive causal relationship. If confirmed, this could shift public health priorities and encourage further research into how vaccines might play a role in preventing neurodegenerative diseases.” Cutler agreed. “For now, a good take home point is that shingles vaccines are effective for preventing shingles, which is adequate reason for getting this vaccine if you are eligible. An additional, benefit might be protection against dementia,” he told us. However, he added that: “This protection is far from assured.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/new-blood-test-may-help-diagnose-show-how-far-alzheimers-progressed,"New blood test may help diagnose, show how far Alzheimer’s has progressed",1,"Researchers estimate that more than 55 million people Trusted Source around the world live with Alzheimer’s disease — a type of dementia that impacts a person’s memory and thinking skills. There are currently a few tests that can be used to help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, such as blood tests looking for the proteins amyloid-beta Trusted Source and tau, that are associated with the condition, as well as cognitive tests and brain imaging. However, people are not always diagnosed at the beginning of the disease — they can be diagnosed at different stages, which can influence how they are treated. Now, researchers at WashU Medicine in St. Louis, MO, have developed a blood test that can not only help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease but also provide insight to doctors on how far the disease has progressed, helping them determine the right treatment path. A study on this new blood test was recently published in the journal Nature Medicine Trusted Source . For this new blood test, researchers focused on a protein called MTBR-tau243, which researchers of this study identified as a potential biomarker Trusted Source for tau tangles Trusted Source in Alzheimer’s disease in previous research published in August 2023. “MTBR-tau243 is a chipped (off) piece of the protein in Alzheimer’s tau tangles,” Randall J. Bateman, MD, the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine in St. Louis, MO, and co-senior author of this study explained to Medical News Today. “The blood test measures this piece of tau tangles in the blood as a measure of how many tangles are in the brain.” “New biomarkers are tools that allow us to track the disease in different ways,” Bateman continued. “Just like doctors use a stethoscope, x-ray, and CAT scan to measure different aspects of the disease, these biomarkers enable us to measure different aspects of Alzheimer’s disease. By tracking different processes of Alzheimer’s disease, we can better diagnose, predict and even develop new and better treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.” “The new biomarker — plasma eMTBR-tau243 — reflects changes in tau pathology occurring in the clinical symptomatic phase of Alzheimer’s disease and can be used to stage Alzheimer’s disease tauopathy, and to determine if cognitive symptoms are likely due to Alzheimer’s disease tau pathology,” added Kanta Horie, PhD, voluntary research associate professor of neurology at WashU Medicine in St. Louis, MO, and both co-first and co-corresponding author of this study. “Also, many therapeutic developments are ongoing including anti-amyloid and anti-tau drugs. We believe that this new biomarker becomes the key to establish the plasma biomarkers panel to stage Alzheimer’s disease, which would open the new window of precision medicine era for Alzheimer’s disease.” During the study, researchers tested study participants from three main stages of Alzheimer’s disease: presymptomatic, early-stage with mild cognitive impairments Trusted Source , and late symptomatic disease where participants have been diagnosed with dementia. The scientists found that blood MTBR-tau243 levels reflected the amount of tau tangles in the brain with 92% accuracy. Among participants showing cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, researchers discovered that MTBR-tau243 levels were significantly higher for participants at the mild cognitive stage, and up to 200 times higher for those in the late symptomatic disease stage. “The cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease is highly associated with (tau) neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) pathology in (the) brain, not amyloid plaques pathology. Since we know that NFTs are more generated in the dementia stage in Alzheimer’s disease, it is reasonable for us to see the drastic increase of MTBR-tau243 in the dementia stage compared to the preclinical Alzheimer’s disease stage, which suggests the validation to characterize the plasma MTBR-tau243 biomarker as the tau NFTs-specific biomarker.” — Kanta Horie, PhD “The significance of finding increasing amounts of MTBR-243 related to Alzheimer’s symptoms — memory loss and thinking impairment — is (that) this discovery now allows us to track the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease with a blood test,” Bateman explained.

Bateman, MD MNT spoke with Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD, director of the Division of Geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center and co-director of the Center for Memory Loss and Brain Health at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this study. Parulekar commented that this blood test represents a logical next step in Alzheimer’s diagnosis and treatment, building upon previous research and addressing significant unmet needs. “Scientists have identified key biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s, such as amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain,” she explained. “Earlier diagnostic methods, like PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, could detect these biomarkers, but they are expensive, invasive, and not readily accessible.” “A blood test offers a much simpler and less costly alternative. There’s a growing understanding that early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, which is a complex process, is crucial for effective intervention. Current treatments, while limited, may be more beneficial in the early stages of the disease. A readily available blood test could enable much earlier detection than current methods, allowing for earlier intervention and potentially slowing disease progression.” — Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD “The initial study needs to be replicated in larger and more diverse populations to confirm its accuracy and reliability across different demographics, ethnicities, and stages of the disease,” Parulekar added. “This includes testing individuals with other neurological conditions to ensure specificity.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/ultraprocessed-foods-may-raise-depression-risks,Ultraprocessed foods may raise depression risks,1,"Eating lots of ultraprocessed foods — which are high in sugar, salt, fat and additives — may raise the risk of depression, a new study suggests. The Harvard-led analysis, published in the September 2023 issue of JAMA Network Open, assessed the eating habits and mental health status of more than 21,000 women, ages 42 to 62, taking part in the long-running Nurses' Health Study II. None of the participants reported any depression symptoms at the study's start. Those who ate the most ultraprocessed food, defined as at least nine servings per day, were 50% more likely to develop depression than participants who ate the least, which was defined as no more than four servings daily. Consuming many foods and drinks containing artificial sweeteners was linked to a particularly large increase in depression risk. The study was observational, meaning it couldn't prove ultraprocessed foods — which include items such as soda, chips, cookies, white bread, and ready-to-eat meals — cause depression, just that an association exists. But ultraprocessed foods may disturb the proper balance of gut bacteria, which has been shown to affect the way the brain works, the study authors said. Meanwhile, artificial sweeteners may disrupt feel-good brain chemicals that help nerve cells communicate normally. Image: © monticelllo/Getty Images",3,0.39089182,0.05490175,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-lowdown-on-blood-thinners,The lowdown on blood thinners,1,"Blood thinners are among the most misunderstood drugs. Despite their name, they don't ""thin"" blood, Rather, they discourage blood from clotting. ""Anti-clotting drugs prevent potentially dangerous blood clots from developing in people at high risk,"" says Dr. Gregory Piazza, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Candidates for anti-clotting medications include people who have atrial fibrillation, or afib (a rapid, irregular heart rhythm that causes blood to pool in the heart's upper chambers), or who recently received a stent (a tiny metal mesh tube that is inserted into a clogged blood vessel to increase blood flow). Others who can benefit from anti-clotting drugs are people who are immobile after surgery and people who have suffered from deep-vein thrombosis, or DVT (clots in the veins of the legs or arms), or pulmonary embolism (clots in the lungs). How anti-clotting drugs work Why are blood clots so dangerous? And how do anti-clotting drugs help? A clot has two main components: fibrin and platelets. Fibrin is a protein that forms a mesh to trap red blood cells, while platelets are tiny cells that clump together. They work together to keep the clot intact and stop or slow blood flow. Blood clots are usually a good thing. When you get a cut, a clot forms to stop excessive bleeding. However, when clots form in the wrong places, they can cause harm and even death. Where a dangerous clot develops is often linked to how much of each type of material they contain. For instance, clots causing DVTs and those inside the heart are made mostly of fibrin. Clots in the arteries that feed blood to the heart and brain are more often triggered by platelet action. Typically, a clot on a cut dissolves after the injury has healed. But a blood clot that forms inside an artery or vein might not spontaneously dissolve, and it can even grow larger. As a result, it can block blood flow, which may lead to a heart attack or stroke. Many factors contribute to these types of clots, such as inflammation, infection, immobility, cancer, and surgery. ""In these cases, you need anti-clotting drugs to help the body dissolve the existing unwanted clots and stop new ones from forming, while still allowing the blood to clot when needed, like after an injury,"" says Dr. Piazza. Two categories Anti-clotting drugs fall into two categories: anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs. Which one you need depends on your clot risk. Anticoagulants interfere with fibrin. Besides treating and preventing DVT and other vein clots, they are commonly prescribed for people with afib. Antiplatelet drugs prevent platelets from sticking together. They are used to prevent heart attacks and strokes in people who have cardiovascular disease or are otherwise at high risk. The main side effect of anti-­clotting medications is excessive bleeding. Contact your doctor if you notice any of these symptoms: recurrent bleeding in your gums after you brush or floss nosebleeds or minor cuts that take longer than usual to stop bleeding frequent bruising, especially around the torso. In some cases, the fear of bleeding can prevent people who need anti-­clotting drugs from taking them. This is especially true for those with afib who already take regular aspirin (which also can affect clotting) and are concerned about a higher bleeding risk from adding an anticoagulant. ""But many times, these individuals don't need to take aspirin and can just take the anticoagulant,"" says Dr. Piazza. (Check with your doctor if you are on aspirin therapy.) People ages 75 and older also have a higher risk of bleeding from anti-clotting drugs than younger folks. Still, Dr. Piazza adds that most people can tolerate the medication, and if they are concerned about bleeding, they should discuss it with their doctor. ""You and your doctor will weigh the risk of heart attack or stroke versus the chance of major bleeding,"" he says. Dosage and needs How long you need an anti-clotting drug and how much you should take depend on your situation. For example, people typically take two antiplatelet drugs for six months to a year after getting a stent. Then they stay on just one antiplatelet drug, usually low-dose aspirin, indefinitely. ""People with afib may take anti­coagulants for the rest of their life,"" says Dr. Piazza. ""But they should review this with their doctor every year to see if they need to make changes to their dose or even whether they need to continue taking it."" Other situations require short-term drug therapy, such as for 14 days to six weeks after a knee or hip replacement to prevent DVT. ""Sometimes people need to take both an anticoagulant and an antiplatelet at the same time if they are being treated for separate issues, like afib and a stent,"" says Dr. Piazza. Also, certain underlying medical conditions influence the choice and dose of an anti-clotting drug. For instance, people with impaired kidney function may not be able to take newer anticoagulants. Those who have had intestinal bleeding need to balance the risk of a clot versus the risk of severe blood loss. Some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) also can interact with anti-clotting drugs, so check with your doctor before taking them.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/chest-pain-causes-other-than-the-heart,Chest pain: Causes other than the heart,1,"It's so clich' it's called the Holly­wood heart attack: people dramatically clutching their chests and crumbling to the ground. Unlike in the movies, however, many instances of chest pain — especially when it's fleeting — don't involve the heart at all. More than 6.5 million emergency department visits in the United States each year are due to chest pain, as are nearly four million outpatient clinic visits, according to the American Heart Association. Notably, however, most of these cases are not found to be heart-related. To be clear, chest discomfort of any kind — whether pain itself or tightness, pressure, squeezing, or burning — should never be ignored. And new chest pain should prompt a call to your doctor. But understanding its many possible causes can calm worst-case-scenario fears and help you find solutions, says Dr. Daniel Sands, a primary care doctor at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""It's been drummed into us that chest pain is a danger sign that should make you see a doctor,"" Dr. Sands says. This remains solid and safe advice. But chest discomfort more often arises for reasons other than the heart. Lengthy list of causes For women, cardiac causes account for ""only a very small proportion"" of chest pain, Dr. Sands notes. This depends, of course, on each woman's specific risk factors for heart disease. And, particularly in women, heart attacks don't always show up with chest pain at all. ""If a 25-year-old woman comes in with chest pain, and she's generally healthy with no prior heart disease, the likelihood she has cardiac disease is infinitesimal,"" he says. ""But if it's a 60-year-old woman who smokes and has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and a family history of heart disease, that person is so likely to have heart disease that I'd send her to the ER right away."" A long list of other conditions — some minor and others deadly serious — can trigger chest pain or discomfort. These include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) gallstones asthma anxiety or panic attacks ulcers COVID esophagus spasms costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs to the breastbone) pleurisy (inflammation of the tissue separating the lungs from the chest wall) pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lung) aortic dissection (a rupture of the aortic artery) pericarditis (inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart). Spot the clues How can you tell if chest pain is most likely not heart-related? Dr. Sands offers these clues: It's brief, lasting only a few moments. You can climb stairs or exercise without the pain worsening. It's triggered by eating, occurring just afterward or only when you eat certain foods. It happens only when you move in a certain way, such as bending or stretching. It occurs only when you're coughing or breathing deeply. It's localized to a small spot, or feels better or worse when you rub the area. Regardless of how it shows up, any chest pain should prompt you to follow up with your doctor, Dr. Sands says. You may need treatment for another issue. ""Don't panic,"" he says. ""Your doctor can evaluate you to see if something serious is going on and work with you to find a solution to feel better."" Conversely, a heart attack or other catastrophic problem ""usually shows up with chest pain that goes on for a long period, not something that just goes away,"" Dr. Sands says. Watch for chest pain lingering for more than a few minutes; shortness of breath; pain in the jaw, neck, or back; pain in one or both arms; and feeling nauseous, weak, faint, or dizzy. Call 911 or have someone drive you to an emergency room if you experience any of these signs. But anytime you're not certain why you're having chest pain or where it stems from, ""call your doctor immediately,"" Dr. Sands says. ""Sometimes answering a few questions, even over the phone, can determine whether you need to be evaluated or not."" Image: © Povozniuk/Getty Images",7,0.1338928,-0.06257753,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/foods-you-should-eat-to-help-fight-inflammation,Foods you should eat to help fight inflammation,1,"We typically think of inflammation as a result of an injury or disease. But diet also plays an important role in chronic inflammation. This is in part because the foods we eat influence the types of bacteria that populate our gut and their chemical byproducts. While some foods encourage the growth of bacteria that stimulate inflammation, others promote the growth of bacteria that help suppress it. That's why it's important to know which foods have anti-inflammatory properties and which can cause inflammation Foods that fight inflammation Fruits and vegetables. Most fruits and brightly colored vegetables naturally contain high levels of antioxidants and polyphenols. Polyphenols are potentially protective compounds found in plants. Studies have shown that polyphenols have multiple anti-inflammatory properties and may improve the function of cells that line blood vessels. Foods high in polyphenols include onions, turmeric, red grapes, cherries, and plums, as well as dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, and collard greens. Nuts and seeds. Studies have found that consuming nuts and seeds is associated with reduced markers of inflammation and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Some oils and fatty fish. Olive oil, flaxseed oil, and fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel offer healthy doses of omega-3 fatty acids, which have long been shown to reduce inflammation. Coffee, cocoa and green tea. The polyphenols in coffee and the flavanols in cocoa are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea is also rich in both polyphenols and antioxidants. Foods that can fuel inflammation The foods that contribute to inflammation are the same ones generally considered bad for other aspects of health. These include: Sugary sodas Refined carbohydrates (like white bread and pasta) Red meat and processed meats Processed foods. Certain components or ingredients used in processed foods such as the emulsifiers added to ice cream, may have effects on inflammation. Such foods are also likely to contribute to weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for inflammation.. The key to reducing inflammation with diet To practice anti-inflammatory eating, it's best to focus on an overall healthy diet rather than singling out individual ""good"" and ""bad"" foods. In general, a healthy diet means one that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils, and limits food loaded with simple sugars (like soda and candy), beverages that contain high-fructose corn syrup (like juice drinks and sports drinks), and refined carbohydrates.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/weekend-warriors-have-a-lower-risk-of-death-from-heart-disease-cancer,"'Weekend warriors' have a lower risk of death from heart disease, cancer",1,"Everyone knows that exercise plays an important role in helping you live a long and healthy Trusted Source life. Current United States health guidelines Trusted Source recommend adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week, and at least 2 days of strength training. However, many people face barriers Trusted Source to working out throughout the week, including time restraints, limited access to exercise equipment, and lack of motivation. Now a new study recently published in the Journal of the American Heart Association Trusted Source says people who are only able to workout on the weekends — known as the “weekend warrior” approach — are still receiving similar health benefits than if they had spread out their workouts throughout the week. These health benefits include a lowered risk of death from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all causes, compared to those who do not complete the suggested 150 minutes of physical activity every week. For this study, researchers analyzed health and physical activity data from more than 93,000 adult participants of the UK Biobank. Study participants were grouped into three different categories: At the study’s conclusion, researchers found that both the weekend warrior and active regular groups had a significantly lower risk of death from cancer, heart disease, and all causes when compared to the inactive group. Additionally, the percentage risks were lower in the weekend warrior group when compared to the active regular group: “You don’t need to exercise every day to stay healthy,” said Zhi-Hao Li, PhD, an epidemiologist in the School of Public Health at Southern Medical University in China and corresponding author in a press release. “As long as you get 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week — whether packed into one to two days or spread out — you can significantly reduce your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, cancer or other causes. This message is encouraging news for busy people who struggle to fit in daily workouts but can manage a concentrated burst of activity on weekends or over a couple of days,” Li added. Keith Diaz, PhD, Florence Irving Associate Professor of Behavioral Medicine in the Department of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center and volunteer expert for the American Heart Association, told Medical News Today that studies like this one are essential because they help us refine our understanding of healthy exercise prescriptions. “Just as healthcare providers prescribe medications at the right dose and frequency, we’re learning to do the same with physical activity,” Diaz, who was not involved in this research, explained. “This research helps us better define what a healthful dose of exercise looks like for different people and lifestyles.” “It’s important to emphasize that this study found no difference in mortality risk between those who exercised only on the weekend and those who spread their physical activity across the week. In other words, neither pattern is better than the other. They’re equally beneficial. So if you’re already fitting in regular activity during the week, there’s no need to switch to a weekend-only routine.” – Keith Diaz, PhD “The key takeaway is that exercise can be flexible, and that’s good news for people who find it hard to be active during the workweek due to time pressures,” Diaz added. “You can absolutely make up for it on the weekend.” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us MNT had the opportunity to speak with Christopher Berg, MD, a board-certified cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. “As a cardiologist, I find these results promising and exciting,” Berg, who was not involved in this research, commented. “I’ve long seen patients who struggle to fit regular exercise into their busy schedules, often resorting to the ‘weekend warrior’ approach — cramming the majority of their physical activity into one or two days each week,“ he told us. “The findings that this pattern can offer similar mortality benefits to more evenly distributed exercise, particularly for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, were encouraging.“ “It suggests that patients have more flexibility in how they can get their physical activity, which is a relief for those with time constraints,” Berg further noted. “However,“ he pointed out, “I am also somewhat cautious whether this approach suits everyone, especially those with underlying heart conditions [who were omitted from the study], where sudden intense activity could pose risks if not properly managed.” “I would not recommend an inactive person to suddenly start a ‘weekend warrior’ regimen, due to risk of injury and potential difficulties if the person is significantly de-conditioned, but rather start slow and gradually build up to the recommended amount of exercise,” Berg advised. “Overall, these results are a promising step, but I’d want to ensure we guide patients safely based on their individual health profiles,” he added. While some may be happy to know that getting all of their weekly exercise on the weekend provides health benefits, getting at least 150 minutes of physical activity in one weekend can be a lot for some people. How can a person figure out what’s the best time for them to work out during the week, whether that be throughout the week or just on the weekends? Bert Mandelbaum, MD, a sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon and co-director of the Regenerative Orthobiologic Center at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in Los Angeles, advised readers to remember that while just exercising two days a week offers a positive effect in this study, exercising for just 2 days a week may not be all a person needs. “It may be that if you’re 60 pounds overweight and your hemoglobin A1C is 10, that may not be enough for you,” Mandelbaum explained to MNT. “When we exercise and we do a study like this, it shows a positive effect — great. But is it going to be a positive enough effect on you? And I think it has to be customized and it must be specific to the population, to someone that’s 25, is someone 45, or are they 85.” “I think the conclusions are good, in the lineage of exercising, improving longevity, lifespan, play span, is great,” he continued. “But I raise the question, do not look at this [thinking] that it is the right dose for you. It’s so important that people exercise more than two days a week. It’s like saying if you brush your teeth once a day, that the cavities probably are better, but if you brush it three times a day, the cavities are much improved.” “We’re athletes — that’s the bottom line,” Mandelbaum added. “When you go back to Darwinian survival of the fittest, we exercise like we’re positively reinforced to hunt. It’s in our DNA, it’s our heritage.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/43-intermittent-fasting-better-for-weight-loss-than-cutting-calories,4:3 intermittent fasting better for weight loss than cutting calories,1,"Over the past few years, intermittent fasting has become a popular dietary pattern for helping to lose weight. Also known as time-restricted eating, there are a number of different methods of intermittent fasting, including only eating for specific hours of the day, such as the 16:8 method (eat during an 8-hour window, fast for 16 hours each day). And there are other methods that call for completely fasting or only consuming a minimal amount of calories for a number of days each week, such as the 5:2 method (eat as usual for 5 days, fast 2 days each week) and the 4:3 method Trusted Source (eat as usual for 4 days, fast 3 days each week). Now, a new study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine has found that 4:3 intermittent fasting may result in modestly greater weight loss over 12 months compared to daily calorie restriction. For this study, researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine recruited 165 adults with overweight or obesity. Study participants were randomly assigned to either follow 4:3 intermittent fasting or a daily calorie restriction diet for 12 months. Participants in the 4:3 intermittent fasting groups were asked to restrict their calorie intake by 80% of their typical daily needs for 3 nonconsecutive days each week, and eat normally on the remaining 4 days with an emphasis on healthy eating. Those in the daily calorie restriction diet were assigned a daily calorie goal that would lower their calorie consumption by 34.3%. All participants received a free gym membership, group-based behavioral support, and information on calorie counting and targeting their dietary macronutrients.

More than half (58%) of those in the intermittent fasting group lost at least 5% of their body weight over 12 months, compared to 47% in the calorie restriction group. Additionally, researchers discovered that participants in the intermittent fasting group had more encouraging changes in their cardiometabolic outcomes. These included systolic blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, triglycerides, and fasting glucose levels. Those in the calorie restriction group showed more favorable changes in diastolic blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. But they noted that many of these estimates in cardiometabolic changes lacked precision and ultimately yielded inconclusive results. “Daily calorie restriction is the most commonly used dietary weight loss strategy,” Victoria A. Catenacci, MD, associate professor in the Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and first author of this study told Medical News Today. “However, adherence to a strategy where calories are restricted every day is challenging for many people,” Catenacci noted. “Our results suggest that 4:3 intermittent fasting is an alternative dietary weight loss strategy that may be easier to adhere to over time, and thus may produce modestly superior weight loss compared with daily caloric restriction over one year, when supported by a behavioral weight loss program. Thus, 4:3 intermittent fasting should be considered within the range of evidence-based dietary weight loss approaches to be offered to people desiring weight loss.” – Victoria A. Catenacci, MD MNT had the opportunity to speak with Mir Ali, MD, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. “The 4:3 intermittent fasting benefits were modest at best,” Ali, who was not involved in the research, pointed out. “Intermittent fasting has been shown in many studies to have beneficial effects. Further studies are necessary to define the optimal fasting schedule and delineate the health benefits. Unfortunately, no one method will work for all people.” “Comparing different intermittent fasting regimens, and perhaps breaking down further by other variables such as age, gender, or ethnicity, may help define an optimal diet for a particular group of patients,” he added. MNT also spoke with Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, about this study. “The results of the study were not completely surprising as this type of intermittent fasting may act similarly to ‘metabolic confusion’ or ‘calorie shifting’ which essentially can catch the body by surprise and ‘shake things up’ by oscillating between a calorie deficit and sufficiency in addition to burning calories with exercise between intervals of rest and action,” Richard, who was likewise not involved in the study, explained. “There have been research studies that have observed the positive benefits of these patterns, as in this study, but it is limited and overall success is highly variable and based on multiple factors unique to the individual and the study design methodology,” she added. As the 4:3 intermittent fasting schedule calls for three days of fasting and four days of normal eating each week, that might be hard for some people to commit to. So how can a person figure out the best intermittent fasting schedule for them? For those interested in trying out intermittent fasting — and more specifically the 4:3 pattern — Richard advised readers to take into consideration several factors that could influence their success and sustainability, such as: And Richard said to take it one step at a time with these simple tips: You could also practice the 4:3 method by fasting or restricting calorie intake to 20% of your daily calorie needs for 24 hours on three nonconsecutive days per week, as was done in the study. Breaking up fasting days may make this regimen easier to stick to. “We have long observed that in most instances, a slow, steady, informed, and intentional approach is often most advantageous,” Richard said. “Dietary patterns and activity along with mindfulness, neuroplasticity activities, and spiritual and social wellbeing for a well-balanced [life] seem to follow that logic.” “Meeting with a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) will allow clear information related to nutrient needs and the safety, applicability, and best practices in how implementing a pattern such as this can apply to an individual,” she added. “There are also unique genetic pathways and factors that may inhibit or support the success and desired outcomes using intermittent fasting, which an RDN can help an individual navigate and understand.” Share this article In this episode, Medical News Today discusses whether intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating practices are safe for the heart, especially in… There is a lot of hype around intermittent fasting, but what are its actual benefits, and what are its limitations?

Researchers followed more than 6,500 white-collar workers for 18 years and identified two job-related conditions linked to higher cardiovascular risks. One was job strain, defined as high demands (such as having a heavy workload and tight deadlines) coupled with low control (for example, having little say in decision making). The other, called effort-reward imbalance, occurs when a person's effort is high but their salary, recognition, or job security are low. Compared with people who didn't experience work stress, men who reported either of those stressors had a 49% higher risk of heart disease. But their risk doubled if they reported both types. Among women, the results were inconclusive, which the authors say might reflect the fact that women tend to develop heart disease later in life than men. The men were also more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure, and other factors that raise heart disease risk. The study was published online Sept. 19, 2023, by Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. Image: © Stígur Már Karlsson /Heimsmyndir/Getty Images",7,0.20566234,0.12966673,False

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/medical-myths-ibs-myths-and-facts,Medical Myths: IBS myths and facts,1,"This installment of our Medical Myths series looks into misconceptions about irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Among many misunderstandings, we cover what causes IBS and what to know about exercise and diet changes. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder that affects around 11% of adults worldwide. Symptoms include: While relatively common, IBS is often misunderstood. To help us dispel some prevalent myths about this condition, we spoke with Dr. Ashkan Farhadi, a gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, and Dr. Mollie J. Jackson, a gastroenterologist at the University of Kansas Health System. Dr. Farhadi told Medical News Today that although research is uncovering more about IBS, we still do not know what causes it. While certain foods such as dairy products or spicy foods may trigger symptoms, they do not cause the condition. He noted, however, that post-infectious IBS can be caused by bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni Trusted Source . Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us In recent years, research Trusted Source has suggested that levels of mental stress influence gut bacteria composition and play a key role in IBS via the gut-brain axis. Dr. Farhadi says, however, that people with and without IBS generally face similar amounts of stress, meaning that it may be how people manage stress — rather than stress alone — that influences whether or not they may experience IBS symptoms. “In my book on IBS, [I wrote about a study showing] that when a person is stressed, numbers of mast cells in their gut increase. So stress doesn’t just increase the release of hormones and mediators in the gut; it also changes the anatomy of the gut in a way that makes it more sensitive to stress,” he explained. “This means that even if you come out of that stressful period, your gut is not the same gut you had before. IBS symptoms triggered by stress can thus linger even though the stress is gone. And this is very common in patients with IBS,” he added. Dr. Farhadi also mentioned a study Trusted Source he conducted that found that subjective perception of well-being is linked to fewer symptoms of IBS. Previous research Trusted Source has also suggested that psychological, social, and genetic factors may all play a role in the development of IBS symptoms. “IBS can be diagnosed without fancy tests,” Dr. Farhadi told us. “With the right clinical criteria, doctors can diagnose IBS with 97% accuracy in 5 years. No other test in the medical field has that kind of accuracy.” “We diagnose IBS based on the Rome IV criteria: Patients with IBS should report symptoms of abdominal pain at least once weekly — on average — in association with a change in stool frequency, a change in stool form, and/or relief or worsening of abdominal pain related to defecation,” explained Dr. Jackson. “There are subtypes of IBS, and you may have predominantly diarrhea, constipation, or a mixed pattern. Patients often also experience bloating, but his symptom is not needed in making the diagnosis,” she added. There are different ways of treating IBS, including a mixture of prescription medication and lifestyle changes tailored to each person’s individual situation. “I can assure you in the overwhelming majority of cases, management is very cheap and simple: fiber, probiotics, reassurance, and exercise,” said Dr. Farhadi. When it comes to medication, according to Dr. Farhadi, it can be a “trial and error” experience. However, it can help relieve the symptoms caused by IBS, alongside other interventions. “Ultimately, there is no cure for IBS,” Dr. Farhadi noted, and sometimes medication may “only [work] like a bandaid for symptom relief. I have to repeat prescriptions for medications like management of bacterial overgrowth with antibiotics. Ultimately, there is no cure for IBS.” “IBS is often a chronic, debilitating, and common disorder of the gut-brain interaction,” said Dr. Jackson. Its “prevalence in North America is 10-15% and is associated with increased health care costs,” she emphasized, adding that “[I]t can significantly affect patients’ quality of life.” “One study Trusted Source highlighted the negative impact of IBS with patients reporting that they would give up 10–15 years of their life expectancy for an instant cure for their condition.” While Dr. Farhadi agreed that some kinds of exercise do help IBS, he said that not all exercise is the same. “Competitive exercise doesn’t relieve stress — it produces stress. The same is true for weight-lifting in the gym if you have to pay a lot of attention to what kind of weight you’re lifting, how you’re pulling this muscle, and how you’re pushing that muscle,” he noted. He also said that many runners have what is known as “runner’s run,” or diarrhea after running for long periods. Thus, he warned, it is very likely that long periods of running can cause IBS symptoms to flare. While some studies Trusted Source suggest that meditation may help relieve symptoms of IBS, research is ongoing. “We are continuing to understand the brain-gut-microbiome axis and how it plays a role in IBS,” said Dr. Jackson. “Gut-directed psychotherapies have been shown to be beneficial in improving IBS symptoms.” “Meditation and mindfulness have shown to help stimulate changes in the brain and how we process thoughts, sensations, and emotional responses, and this may positively affect how we perceive and interpret signals from the gut, thus improving IBS symptoms,” she added. That said, different kinds of meditation may work differently for different people. While it may not work for everyone, Dr. Farhadi recommends “mindless meditation,” which includes walking for 30 minutes per day on the same route until it gets so boring that one stops paying attention to their surroundings. “That’s a meditative walk — you do meditation and walk together. It’s a stress reliever to reboot your system. But it needs a lot of practice. After 1 year, you may get into that zone for 1 minute out of the 15 you’re trying to do,” he said. Sometimes, it seems like even your usual safe foods can trigger symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. But if you don't eat, you risk weight loss and even worse symptoms. Let's meet your nutritional needs. A recent review Trusted Source found that, although many patients with IBS report milk intolerance, there is no conclusive link between IBS and lactose intolerance. As around two-thirds Trusted Source of the world’s population is lactose intolerant, it is reasonably likely for someone to be lactose intolerant and have IBS. This means that cutting out dairy products may help relieve gastrointestinal symptoms. “Many patients with IBS associate their symptoms with eating and try to ease their symptoms by avoiding certain foods,” said Dr. Jackson. “An elimination diet involves removing multiple foods out of your daily diet and then slowly reintroducing them to help identify trigger foods.” “The most studied diet for IBS is the low FODMAP diet. FODMAP foods can lead to increased gas and distension and the triggering of meal-related symptoms in patients with IBS. Dairy is a high FODMAP food, and for some/many may be a dietary trigger, but this is not universally true,” she explained. “Food choices can be overwhelming and if available, a gastrointestinal dietician can help guide you in this process,” she added. Natural remedies such as peppermint oil Trusted Source and cardamom have shown some promise in relieving symptoms of IBS and gastric ulcers. However, research into natural remedies is limited, so they may not be universally helpful. “Black cardamom seeds and spearmint are muscle relaxants for the gut, and so they could reduce symptoms,” said Dr. Farhadi. “People can try these natural remedies and others as long as they are not really strong chemicals. Many herbal remedies have been around for thousands of years, and people are using them with no problem,” he added. Nevertheless, it is always recommended to check with a doctor before taking on any new line of treatment. “Imagine you have an engine, and the engine has a problem. Now you turn it off. Or course, you may not have any problems as long as it’s off, but how long can you keep it off?” said Dr. Farhadi. “So, if you reduce the number of times you eat from perhaps three to two times per day, you may reduce the number of symptoms you experience per day. It may help, but it isn’t necessarily the way to go,” he explained. “Fasting, however, is good for other things — such as weight loss and memory,” he added. If a patient has chronic constipation, Dr. Farhadi said that fiber could help. However, if overdone, fiber can lead to bloating from excess gas in the gut. To avoid this, Dr. Farhadi recommended consuming fiber via a pinch of water-soluble fiber psyllium — a prebiotic — on a spoon of Greek yogurt, which is a probiotic. “There’s no specific diet for IBS,” said Dr. Farhadi. “Diets are not only individualized; they are dynamic. One person may be able to drink coffee when on vacation yet experiences problems with it during finals. As there is no specific diet for different individuals, there is no specific diet for individuals at all times,” he advised.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/medical-myths-all-about-stroke,Medical Myths: All about stroke,1,"This installment of our Medical Myths series delves into misconceptions about stroke. Among many misunderstandings, we cover whether stroke is a heart problem and what to know about ministrokes and paralysis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Trusted Source , over 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke every year, and around 610,000 are first strokes. In 2019, stroke was the second Trusted Source leading cause of mortality globally, accounting for 11% of deaths. There are three main types Trusted Source of stroke. The first and most common, accounting for 87% of cases, is an ischemic stroke. It occurs when blood flow through the artery that supplies oxygen to the brain becomes blocked. The second is a hemorrhagic stroke, caused by a rupture in an artery in the brain, which in turn damages surrounding tissues. The third type of stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA) Trusted Source , which is sometimes called a “ministroke.” It happens when blood flow is temporarily blocked to the brain, usually for no more than 5 minutes. While stroke is very common, it is often misunderstood. To help us dispel myths on the topic and improve our understanding, we got in touch with Dr. Rafael Alexander Ortiz, chief of Neuro-Endovascular Surgery and Interventional Neuro-Radiology at Lenox Hill Hospital. Although stroke risk is linked to cardiovascular risk factors Trusted Source , strokes happen in the brain, not the heart. “Some people think that stroke is a problem of the heart,” Dr. Ortiz told MNT. “That is incorrect. A stroke is a problem of the brain, caused by the blockage or rupture of arteries or veins in the brain, and not the heart.” Some people confuse stroke with a heart attack Trusted Source , which is caused by a blockage in blood flow to the heart, and not the brain. “The most common risk factors [for stroke] include hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, trauma to the head or neck, and cardiac arrhythmias,” said Dr. Ortiz. Many of these risk factors can be modified by lifestyle Trusted Source . Exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet can reduce risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes. Other risk factors Trusted Source include alcohol consumption and stress. Working to reduce or remove these lifestyle factors may also reduce a person’s risk of stroke. Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us Single-gene disorders such as sickle cell disease increase a person’s risk for stroke. Genetic factors Trusted Source including a higher risk for high blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors may also indirectly increase stroke risk. As families are likely to share environments and lifestyles, unhealthy lifestyle factors are likely to increase stroke risk among family members, especially when coupled with genetic risk factors. The most common symptoms for stroke form the acronym “F.A.S.T. Trusted Source “: Other symptoms Trusted Source of stroke include: “There is an incorrect belief that strokes are irreversible and can’t be treated,” explained Dr. Ortiz. “Emergency treatment of a stroke with injection of a clot busting drug, minimally invasive mechanical thrombectomy for clot removal, or surgery can reverse the symptoms of a stroke in many patients, especially if they arrive to the hospital early enough for the therapy (within minutes or hours since the onset of the symptoms),” he noted. “The longer the symptoms last, the lower the likelihood of a good outcome. Therefore, it is critical that at the onset of stroke symptoms — ie. trouble speaking, double vision, paralysis or numbness, etc — an ambulance should be called (911) for transport to the nearest hospital,” he continued. Research Trusted Source also shows that those who arrive within 3 hours of first experiencing symptoms typically have less disability 3 months afterward than those who arrived later. Age is a significant risk factor for stroke. Stroke risk doubles Trusted Source every 10 years after age 55. However, strokes can occur at any age. One study Trusted Source examining healthcare data found that 34% of stroke hospitalizations in 2009 were under age 65. A review Trusted Source in 2013 points out that “approximately 15% of all ischemic strokes occur in young adults and adolescents.” The researchers noted that stroke risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lipid disorders, and tobacco use were among the most common co-existing conditions among this age group. Not all strokes have symptoms, and some research suggests that symptom-free strokes are far more common than those with symptoms. One study Trusted Source found that out of the over 11 million strokes in 1998, 770,000 presented symptoms, whereas close to 11 million were silent. Evidence Trusted Source of these so-called silent strokes appears on MRI scans as white spots from scarred tissue following a blockage or ruptured blood vessel. Often, silent strokes are identified when patients receive MRI scans for symptoms including headaches, cognitive issues, and dizziness. Although they occur without symptoms, they should be treated similarly to strokes with symptoms. Silent strokes put people at risk of future symptomatic strokes Trusted Source , cognitive decline, and dementia. “The term ministroke has been used incorrectly as some think that it is related to small strokes that carry low risk,” said Dr. Ortiz. “That statement is incorrect, as a ministroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA).” “It is not a small stroke, but a premonition that a large stroke can occur. Any symptom of acute stroke, transient or persistent, needs emergency workup and management to prevent a devastating large stroke,” he added. Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability, but not everyone who has a stroke will experience paralysis or weakness. Research Trusted Source shows that stroke leads to reduced mobility in over half of stroke survivors aged 65 and over. However, the long-term impacts Trusted Source of stroke vary on many factors, such as the amount of brain tissue affected and the area affected. Damage to the left brain, for example, will affect the right side of the body and vice versa. If the stroke occurs in the left side Trusted Source of the brain, effects may include: If it affects the right side Trusted Source of the brain, paralysis may also occur, this time on the left side of the body. Other effects may include: Recovery from stroke can take months, if not years. However, many may not fully recover. The American Stroke Association Trusted Source says that among stroke survivors: Research Trusted Source suggests there is a critical time window between 2–3 months after stroke onset, during which intensive motor rehabilitation is more likely to lead to recovery. Some may also be able to spontaneously recover during this period. Beyond this window, and beyond the 6-month mark, improvements are still possible although are likely to be significantly slower.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/curcumin-supplements-might-ease-meal-related-discomfort,Curcumin supplements might ease meal-related discomfort,1,"You might know turmeric as the golden-yellow spice used in curry powder and yellow mustard. Turmeric contains the naturally occurring chemical curcumin, which might have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. And now a small randomized trial has found that taking curcumin supplements (derived from turmeric) helps reduce symptoms of functional dyspepsia — recurring, unexplained stomach pain, bloating, or early feelings of fullness. Scientists randomly assigned 206 people (ages 18 to 70) with functional dyspepsia to one of three treatments: taking 500 milligrams (mg) of curcumin (two 250-mg capsules) four times a day, taking 20 mg of the medication omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid) once a day, or taking both treatments each day. After about a month of treatment, people in all three groups said their dyspepsia symptoms had improved. The results were even better after two months. The findings suggest that curcumin supplements are as effective at relieving dyspepsia symptoms as omeprazole (which curbs stomach acid), and that curcumin is safe and well tolerated.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/medical-myths-all-about-ibd,Medical Myths: All about IBD,1,"In this edition of Medical Myths, we cover some of the most pervasive misunderstandings that surround inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Among other topics, we will discuss treatment, stress, personality, and symptoms beyond the gut. IBD is a condition that affects the gastrointestinal system. The symptoms often include abdominal cramps, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. The symptoms can fluctuate and may last for days, weeks, or months at a time. In 2015, an estimated 3 million Trusted Source people in the United States had IBD. Globally, the disease affected an estimated 6.8 million Trusted Source people in 2017. The most common forms of IBD are Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Both involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. Despite the relatively high prevalence of IBD, a great deal of misinformation and misunderstanding surrounds it. Here, we fight fiction with facts. To aid us on our quest, we have enlisted the help of Dr. Abhik Bhattacharya, assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY. IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) both affect the digestive system and have similar acronyms. This, perhaps, explains some of the confusion. However, the two conditions are not the same. Dr. Bhattacharya explained to Medical News Today that IBS “is a disorder of the interaction between the gut and brain, leading to diarrhea, constipation, or both, along with bloating and pain. [It] can be worsened or precipitated by stress and anxiety.” Conversely, he continued, IBD “is a disease of a dysregulated immune system, wherein the immune system starts attacking your own gastrointestinal system, leading to damage.” “The disease can lead to stress, worsening anxiety, depression, and loss of sleep because of the devastating consequences it can have on a person’s daily functioning,” he said. “Symptoms can include bleeding in stools, diarrhea, severe belly pain, unintentional weight loss, fevers, chills, rectal pain, fatigue, and more.” Receive expert advice, tips for navigating menopause, and the latest on effective remedies delivered straight to your inbox. Your privacy is important to us IBD is driven by the immune system, so stress is not the direct cause. However, as Dr. Bhattacharya explained, it “can make life very stressful.” Stress can trigger Trusted Source IBD flares and exacerbate Trusted Source the symptoms in some people, which might help explain the confusion. However, stress does not cause IBD. Some small, decades-old studies have investigated the links between personality traits and IBD. However, when MNT asked Dr. Bhattacharya whether there are any links between a person’s character and IBD, he put it succinctly: “There are none that we know about.” Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis are the most common forms of IBD. However, they are distinct conditions, and people cannot have both. “You can either have Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis,” said Dr. Bhattacharya. “However, in a very small subset of patients, it is hard to determine whether they have Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis. The disease, however, does reveal itself over the course of a patient’s lifetime.” Thankfully, this is untrue. “There are many treatments that are extremely effective for IBD. Depending on what you have and how severe the disease is, we have a plethora of options for medical treatment,” explained Dr. Bhattacharya. He then outlined some of the available interventions: “These include, but are not limited to, biologic medications, such as Remicade [infliximab], Humira [adalimumab], Cimzia [certolizumab pegol], Simponi [golimumab], Entyvio [vedolizumab], and Stelara [ustekinumab], or small molecules like Zeposia [ozanimod] and Xeljanz [tofacitinib]. These are potent immunosuppressant medications, and we are constantly developing new medications through clinical trials.” “No, everyone does not need surgery,” Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT. He explained that in the past, a majority of people with IBD would have undergone surgery. However, “with the advent of very effective and safe immunosuppressant medications,” rates of surgery have dropped significantly over the past 20 years. According to Crohn’s & Colitis UK, about 15% of people with ulcerative colitis will need surgery 10 years after diagnosis. However, in agreement with Dr. Bhattacharya, the organization notes that the improved treatments available mean that this percentage is reducing. “The goal of treatment,” Dr. Bhattacharya said, “is to prevent surgery due to complications of bowel damage.” He advocates for early treatment with potent medications soon after diagnosis. This, he explained, prevents damage, thereby removing the need for surgery. This is not true. “Most IBD medications are very safe during pregnancy,” said Dr. Bhattacharya. He explained that the goal is to keep people with IBD in remission during pregnancy “because the worst thing to happen for both baby and mother is for the disease to be active.” “We have gathered, and continue to gather, a large amount of data regarding the safety of medications during pregnancy.” – Dr. Bhattacharya There is an important exception, though: methotrexate. Dr. Bhattacharya told us that methotrexate “is stopped even when women with IBD are planning to get pregnant.” Sometimes, it seems like even your usual safe foods can trigger symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease. But if you don't eat, you risk weight loss and even worse symptoms. Let's meet your nutritional needs. Once drugs for IBD take effect and the symptoms disappear, it can be tempting to stop taking the medication. However, this is not what doctors recommend. Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT: “At this moment, we don’t have a good way of stopping medications for patients with IBD in remission. […] We don’t recommend stopping medications.” He explained that ending treatment can have serious consequences. For instance, the symptoms might come back, and if the person restarts on the same treatments, these may not work. “While we do have options when it comes to treatment,” he said, “those options are not limitless, and we don’t want to run through medications. There is good data to support that when […] one set of IBD medications [fails], your response to another type may be less likely.” As Dr. Bhattacharya told MNT, a “gluten-free diet works for [people with] celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity,” but it will not benefit those with IBD. Although, as the name suggests, IBD significantly affects the bowel, the disease can also have ramifications on many other parts of the body. “Apart from the gastrointestinal system, which includes the mouth to the anus, IBD can have extraintestinal manifestations like affecting the skin, eyes, and joints, to name a few,” said Dr. Bhattacharya. According to a review Trusted Source of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD, they “can involve nearly any organ system […] and can cause a significant challenge to physicians managing IBD patients.” For instance, IBD can affect the musculoskeletal system, as well as the eyes, kidneys, and lungs. It may also damage the hepatopancreatobiliary Trusted Source system, which includes the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and bile duct. At this time, there is no cure for IBD.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-much-protein-do-you-need-to-build-muscle,How much protein do you need to build muscle?,1,"While strength training is important for building muscle, so is consuming the right amount of protein. There has been continuous research and controversy about how much protein is needed to optimize muscle growth. In this Honest Nutrition feature, we discuss current research evaluating the role of protein in muscle growth and how much a person should consume each day. Protein is found in every cell and tissue in the body. While it has many vital roles in the body, protein is crucial for muscle growth because it helps repair and maintain muscle tissue. The current recommended dietary allowance Trusted Source (RDA) to prevent deficiency in minimally active adults is 0.8 grams (g) of protein per kilogram (kg) of body weight. However, newer research suggests individuals trying to build muscle need more than this. Consuming less protein than the body needs has been linked to decreased muscle mass. In contrast, increased protein intakes above the RDA may help increase strength and lean body mass when paired with resistance exercise. Protein is made up of amino acids that act as building blocks for cells and tissues in the body. There are 20 amino acids that combine to form proteins. While some can be synthesized by the human body, others cannot. The nine amino acids that the body cannot make are called essential amino acids. These must be obtained through diet. When a person eats protein, it is digested and broken down into amino acids, which are involved in many processes in the body, including tissue growth and repair, immune function, and energy production. Like other body tissues, muscle proteins Trusted Source are continuously broken down and rebuilt. In order to build muscle, a person must consume more protein than what is broken down. This is often referred to as a net positive nitrogen balance, as protein is high in nitrogen. If a person is not consuming adequate amounts of protein, their body tends to break down muscle Trusted Source to provide the body with the amino acids needed to support body functions and preserve more important tissues. Over time, this can lead to decreased muscle mass and strength. Lastly, the body uses amino acids for muscle protein synthesis (MPS), the primary driver of muscle repair, recovery, and growth after strenuous exercises.

Your privacy is important to us According to the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans Trusted Source , most healthy adults over 19 years old should get between 10-35% of their daily calories from protein. One gram of protein provides 4 calories. This means that a person who eats 2,000 calories per day would need to consume between 50 and 175 grams of protein per day. The current RDA of 0.8 g per kg of body weight for protein is based on the amount required to maintain nitrogen balance and prevent muscle loss. However, extending these recommendations to active individuals who are looking to build muscle may not be appropriate. When it comes to building muscle mass, the ideal amount of daily protein a person should consume varies depending on several factors, including age, gender, activity level, health, and other variables. However, several studies have given us a good idea of how to calculate the amount of protein adults need for muscle gain based on body weight. While most studies agree that higher protein intakes are associated with improvements in lean body mass and strength when combined with resistance training, the optimal amount of protein required to build muscle remains controversial. Here is what the latest research says. One 2020 meta-analysis published in the journal Nutrition Reviews found that protein intakes ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 g per kg of body weight can support increases in lean body mass. In particular, researchers noted that gradually increasing protein take, even by as little as 0.1 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, can help maintain or increase muscle mass. The rate of increase in lean body mass from higher protein intakes rapidly decreased after 1.3 g per kg of body weight was exceeded. Strength training suppressed this decline. This suggests that increased protein intake paired with strength training is best for gaining lean body mass. Another 2022 meta-analysis published in the journal Sports Medicine concluded that higher protein intakes of around 1.5 g per kg of body weight daily paired with resistance training are required for optimal effects on muscle strength. Researchers noted that the benefits of increased protein intake on strength and muscle mass appear to plateau at 1.5 to 1.6 g per kg of body weight per day. Lastly, one 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia, and Muscle Trusted Source concluded that a protein intake of 1.6 g per kg of body weight per day or higher results in small increases in lean body mass in young, resistance-trained individuals. The results on older individuals were marginal. Notably, 80% of studies examined in this review reported participants consuming a minimum of 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day, which is still higher than the current RDA. This may be a potential contributor to the decreased effects of protein intervention in combination with resistance training in older adults. While it is difficult to give exact figures due to varying study results, the optimum amount of protein for muscle-building appears to be between 1.2 and 1.6 g per kg of body weight. This means a 180-pound (81.8 kg) male, for example, would need to consume between 98 and 131 g of protein daily, combined with resistance training, to support muscle growth. A person can meet their daily protein needs by eating animal and plant-based protein sources. Animal-based protein sources include: Plant-based protein sources include: Some nutritionists consider animal protein sources Trusted Source to be better than plant-based protein sources when it comes to building muscle mass. This is because they contain all the essential amino acids the body needs in sufficient amounts. They are also easy to digest. Some plant-based proteins are less bioavailable and harder to digest. They also have varying amino acid profiles. However, individuals who opt for plant-based diets can easily supplement by eating more overall protein, and opting for a variety of foods. To obtain all the necessary amino acids in a plant-based diet, individuals can pair ingredients such as rice and beans, hummus and pita bread, or peanut butter on whole wheat bread. One notable exception is soy, which is highly bioavailable, has a good profile of amino acids, and is easy to digest. Doctors generally agree that healthy adults can safely tolerate a long-term protein intake of up to 2 g per kg of body weight per day without any side effects. However, some groups of people, such as healthy, well-trained athletes, may tolerate up to 3.5 g per kg of body weight. Most research suggests that eating more than 2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day can cause health issues over time. Symptoms of excessive protein intake include: More severe risks associated with chronic protein overconsumption include: When combined with resistance training, protein intakes above the current RDA can support muscle building. The best way to meet your daily protein needs is by consuming lean meat, fish, beans, nuts, and legumes. Since the optimal amount of protein a person needs depends on age, health status, and activity level, consider speaking with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to discuss how much protein is suitable for you.

The study, which included nearly 460,000 adults, relied on data about their stair climbing habits and other lifestyle behaviors, which researchers collected at the start of the study and five years later. Researchers later tallied up the number of heart attacks, strokes, and related cardiovascular problems participants had during the follow-up period, which lasted a median of 12.5 years. Compared with people who said they didn't climb any stairs, those who reported climbing five flights of stairs daily — about 50 steps — were about 20% less likely to experience a heart-related problem or stroke.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cpap-machines-and-masks-which-ones-are-right-for-you,CPAP machines and masks: Which ones are right for you?,1,"Your doctor says you need continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to treat your sleep apnea, and you're eager to begin treatment. You're also a little worried, since you've heard that using a CPAP system can be uncomfortable and challenging. How do you choose a system that will give you the best odds of success? Here are some tips to help. Understand the treatment CPAP is the first-line treatment for people with obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder marked by repeated pauses in breathing caused by a blocked airway. The CPAP system's job is to keep your airway open. It does that by pushing a forceful stream of air through a tube and into a mask you wear while you sleep. The air comes from a small bedside pump (an air compressor). Other forms of positive airway pressure (PAP) may be helpful for people with central sleep apnea, although pauses in breathing in this type of sleep apnea are related to garbled messages from the brain, not blockages (see ""What is sleep apnea?""). What is sleep apnea? Sleep apnea is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. The pauses last at least 10 seconds, lead to poor-quality sleep, and put a strain on your body. Untreated sleep apnea may increase your risk for high blood pressure or stroke. In obstructive sleep apnea, pauses in breathing occur when the airway briefly becomes blocked. This can be caused by too much tissue in the airway (often due to excess weight), large tonsils, or a large tongue. In central sleep apnea, pauses in breathing occur when the brain fails to deliver electrical impulses to the muscles that help you breathe. Trust your doctor Your physician will determine what kind of CPAP device you need. ""The device and its settings are by prescription, just like a medication,"" says Dr. Noah Siegel, director of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Surgery at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear. With CPAP, a single fixed air pressure is used throughout the night. Other types of PAP therapies include auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP), which provides a range of preset pressures throughout the night bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), which provides two different preset pressures — a more powerful one when you inhale and a less powerful one when you exhale adaptive servo ventilation (ASV), an advanced device that provides pressure based on breathing patterns throughout the night. ""Generally speaking, people with obstructive sleep apnea respond better to CPAP or APAP. People with central sleep apnea may respond better to BiPAP or ASV,"" Dr. Siegel says. Investigate face mask options You get to choose the face mask for your PAP system, and it's an important decision. Face masks often feel bulky, making people reluctant to wear them. Dr. Siegel recommends looking at mask options online and trying on a few before making a selection. That might happen at a medical supply store or during a home visit from your medical equipment supplier. The masks fall into two categories. Full-face masks. These cover the nose and mouth and deliver air to them both. They are ideal for someone who breathes through the mouth or has nasal or sinus problems. Nasal masks. These masks deliver air through the nose only. They are less bulky than full-face masks and come in styles that fit over, under, or in the nose. An important consideration for both mask types, Dr. Siegel says, is the site where the tube from the pump enters the mask. ""Traditional-style masks connect the tubing in the front of the mask, near the nose. That's not great for people who roll over a lot in bed or people who are claustrophobic,"" he says. ""Newer styles attach at the top of the mask. It's much less intrusive."" Give it time Adjusting to any PAP system takes time. You may need to try a few masks to find the right fit and comfort. ""And if allergies or frequent sinus congestion keep you from using a nasal mask, we have interventions — such as nasal sprays or surgery — that might make a nasal mask more tolerable,"" Dr. Siegel says. Also, your doctor may need to make adjustments to your machine, such as changes to settings for pressure and humidification. Just stick with it, and remember that using a PAP system, like taking a medication, is an ongoing therapy that needs regular evaluation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/several-factors-may-cause-testosterone-levels-to-drop,Several factors may cause testosterone levels to drop,1,"Testosterone levels tend to slowly decline in middle-aged men, and often fall faster after age 70. In an analysis of 11 studies involving about 25,000 men in total, researchers looked at the possible factors for this more rapid decline in testosterone levels later in life. They found that having a body mass index higher than 27 and engaging in less than 75 minutes of weekly vigorous activity were each linked to lower testosterone levels. Other contributing factors were having ever smoked and health issues like high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Low testosterone levels can contribute to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and reduced sex drive. While the findings only showed an association, the researchers stressed the need for older men to continue engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors and managing chronic health issues, which could help maintain their body's testosterone production. Men also should address these areas before considering hormone therapy for low testosterone. The results appeared in the September 2023 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320233,Anti-inflammatory diet: What to know,1,"Eating less processed food, alcohol, and red meat and consuming more plant-based foods may help manage inflammation in some instances. Anti-inflammatory diets are typically not specific regimens but rather eating styles. The Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet are examples of anti-inflammatory diets. Dietary changes may help manage both short- and long-term inflammation in many cases, although its efficacy as a management tool will depend on a person’s overall health and the causes of inflammation. For example, chronic inflammation can occur due to psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma. While diet changes may help manage some symptoms, it may not be effective in more severe cases. Some foods contain ingredients that can trigger or worsen inflammation. Meanwhile, other foods contain compounds – such as antioxidants – that may, in fact, reduce it. An anti-inflammatory diet focuses on fresh fruits and vegetables, which are often good sources of antioxidants. Dietary antioxidants are molecules in food that help remove free radicals from the body. Free radicals are the natural byproducts of some bodily processes, including metabolism. Free radicals can lead to cell damage. This damage increases the risk of inflammation and can contribute to various diseases. An anti-inflammatory diet favors foods that are rich in antioxidants over those that increase the production of free radicals. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are present in oily fish, may help reduce the levels of inflammatory proteins in the body. Fiber can also have this effect. Many popular diets already adhere to anti-inflammatory principles. For example, both the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet include fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, whole grains, and fats that are good for the heart. For example, research suggests Trusted Source that the Mediterranean diet, focusing on plant-based foods and healthful oils, can reduce the effects of inflammation on the cardiovascular system. Learn more about the Mediterranean diet here. Research also shows Trusted Source that the DASH diet can have a positive impact on reducing inflammation markers compared to regular diets.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-new-weight-loss-drugs,Understanding new weight-loss drugs,1,"Some people who struggle with weight loss have been able to find assistance from several FDA-approved weight-loss medications, such as bupropion plus naltrexone (Contrave), phentermine (Adipex-P), phentermine plus topiramate (Qsymia), and orlistat (Xenical, Alli). On average, such drugs can help people lose 5% to 7% of their body weight when paired with a healthy diet and exercise. Now a newer class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes has gained attention because of their impressive weight-loss results — in many cases, 10% to 20% of a person's body weight. They're called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Tale of two drugs Two of these GLP-1 receptor agonists are FDA-approved in formulations specifically designed for weight loss in people without diabetes: liraglutide (Saxenda) and semaglutide (Wegovy). Lower-dose versions of these same active ingredients, known respectively as Victoza and Ozempic, have been used for years to help people with diabetes control their blood sugar levels. ""They can lead to substantial weight loss when used in conjunction with healthy lifestyle changes in people who are overweight or have obesity with or without type 2 diabetes,"" says Dr. A. Enrique Caballero, an endocrinologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""But whether they can be safely used for all people who simply want to lose an extra 10 to 20 pounds is questionable."" New drugs on the horizon Other GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight loss may soon be available. A recent trial, funded by Eli Lilly, the company that makes tirzepatide (Mounjaro), found that around half of participants with both obesity and type 2 diabetes lost around 15% of their body weight on the medication. Also, initial research suggests that retatrutide, a triple hormone receptor agonist (acting on receptors for GLP-1, GIP, and CGCR), may lead to weight loss of up to 25% in people with diabetes. The FDA approved tirzepatide for treating type 2 diabetes in May 2022 and is now reviewing whether to approve it to treat obesity. How the new drugs work GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic the GLP-1 hormone that is naturally released in the gastrointestinal tract in response to eating. ""The drugs prompt the body to produce more insulin after eating, limiting the elevation of blood sugar levels after meals, something particularly crucial for people with type 2 diabetes,"" says Dr. Caballero. The drugs also regulate appetite by sending signals to the brain to tell the body it is full, which inhibits overeating. It is important to remember that these medications are only approved for people who meet certain criteria. Wegovy and Saxenda are for adults diagnosed with obesity — a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher — or those with a BMI of 27 plus at least one weight-related condition, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or type 2 diabetes. The other versions of these drugs—Victoza and Ozempic — are for people with type 2 diabetes. Still, that has not stopped some doctors from prescribing these medications ""off-label"" for weight loss, which means they are used for a different purpose than explicitly intended. ""But there isn't enough evidence to know whether these drugs might be beneficial or dangerous for people who fall outside of the FDA criteria,"" says Dr. Caballero. However, the larger issue is that many people see the new drugs as a quick-fix solution. ""It is paramount to remember that all weight-loss medications are recommended as an aid in the overall strategy that centers around a healthy meal plan and regular physical activity,"" says Dr. Caballero. ""In fact, people who stop taking these drugs will often regain the weight unless they have truly established a consistent and effective change in their eating and physical activity habits."" Know the downsides When discussing with your doctor whether GLP-1 receptor agonists are worth exploring, it's important to understand their potential downsides. You might develop various gastrointestinal side effects, including gas, bloating, indigestion, nausea, or irregular bowel movements. But these issues usually resolve within a few weeks, according to Dr. Caballero. ""The lowest doses of these medications are usually given at first and then gradually increased so people have less chance of developing side effects,"" he says. Another downside is the cost. The drugs are expensive — about $1,000 to $1,500 per month. Even if you qualify for their use, the drugs are not covered by Medicare for obesity, although Victoza and Ozempic are covered by Medicare and most private insurers to treat type 2 diabetes. Finally, be aware that the drugs are given via injection into the arm, stomach, or thigh using a pen-like device with a tiny needle the width of two human hairs. (Semaglutide is given weekly, while liraglutide injections are done daily.) Semaglutide prescribed for diabetes is now also available as a daily pill called Rybelsus. You have to wait 30 minutes to an hour after taking it before you can eat or drink. Image: © 3dfoto/Getty Images",8,0.18814638,0.22184448,False
https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321522,What foods are high in protein?,1,"There is a wide range of foods that are high in protein. High protein foods can include various fruits and vegetables, dairy products, meat, seeds, and more. Eating foods high in protein has many benefits, including muscle building and feeling fuller after eating. Although eating lots of protein may be beneficial, eating a balanced diet is essential to staying healthy. Protein is an essential nutrient that is important in many bodily functions. It provides the building blocks for cells and helps to maintain muscle mass. Most healthy adults need to consume at least 0.8 grams (g) Trusted Source of protein per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 g per pound of body weight). However, an individual’s protein goals may vary depending on physical activity level and medical history. Because protein promotes a sense of fullness, some people choose to adopt a high protein diet when seeking to lose weight. The following are some of the best high protein foods that a person can consume. Salmon is a fatty fish, meaning it is full of omega-3 fatty acids. Salmon is also an excellent source of protein and can help a person feel more satisfied at meals. One salmon fillet (178 g) contains 39.3 g of protein Trusted Source . Chicken breast is a lean source of protein. The majority of its calories come directly from protein when served without skin. A 100 g skinless chicken breast provides around 22.5 g Trusted Source of protein. Beef offers high amounts of protein per serving. A 3-ounce serving (85 g) of ground beef contains about 21.3 g Trusted Source of protein. There is a range of different types of beef to choose from. It is best to choose lean beef as much as possible to help limit intake of saturated fats to no more than 5–6% of daily calories Trusted Source for optimal heart health. Tuna is an excellent and widely available source of protein. It is also a great source of heart healthy unsaturated fatty acids. One can (107 g) of tuna contains around 20.3 g of protein Trusted Source . Canned tuna is a helpful pantry staple to keep on hand. It is shelf-stable and relatively affordable compared to many other animal protein sources. A person can add tuna to salads, sandwiches, and snacks. Bison meat is another excellent source of protein. Bison is lean meat, offering less fat per serving than beef. Bison is becoming more available, and some people use it as a substitute for beef. One 3 oz (85 g) of bison contains around 21.6 g of protein Trusted Source . Lean pork is a good source of protein. Pork roasts and tenderloin are good choices for meals. People should avoid processed pork products such as bacon because they are higher in saturated fat and sodium. One 4 oz (113 g) serving of pork contains around 19.1 g of protein Trusted Source . Turkey packs a powerful punch of protein. Cooked turkey breast can provide about 25.6 g Trusted Source of protein per 3 oz (85 g) serving. Halibut is a type of white fish. It is an excellent source of lean protein, with around 29.3 g Trusted Source of protein in half a fillet (159 g).

Your privacy is important to us Below are some examples of high protein foods that are suitable for people following a vegetarian diet. Eggs are an excellent source of protein, nutrients, and healthful fats, with 1 large egg containing about 6.3 g of protein Trusted Source . They are also incredibly versatile. A person can prepare eggs in multiple ways such as boiled, scrambled, or poached. A person can incorporate eggs into various dishes such as types of stir fry, soup, and sandwiches for a boost of protein. A hard boiled egg makes a convenient high protein snack. Not every vegetarian diet includes eggs. A lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs and dairy. Plain, low-fat Greek yogurt packs as much as 19.9 g of protein Trusted Source in a 7 oz (200 g) serving. Flavored Greek yogurts often contain a lot of added sugar, so be sure to read the nutrition label. For a delicious Greek yogurt breakfast or snack with no added sugars, opt for plain Greek yogurt and top with your favorite fruits, nuts, and seeds. Cottage cheese is a dairy product that has an abundance of protein. It also offers a healthful serving of calcium and other nutrients. A 4 oz (113 g) serving of cottage cheese contains around 12.5 g of protein Trusted Source . Cow’s milk is an excellent source of protein for people who can tolerate drinking milk. A 1 cup (244 g) serving of milk contains 8 g of protein Trusted Source . Nut butters, including peanut butter and almond butter, are another quick and easy way to add protein to the diet. Use 1–2 tablespoons of nut butter on whole grain toast, in a smoothie, or as a dip for apple slices and fresh veggie sticks for a protein boost. The amount of protein per serving can depend on the type of nut butter. Whey protein powder is a supplement that is popular among bodybuilders and athletes aiming to increase muscle mass and strength. This powder is made from proteins found in the liquid part of milk, which are left over during cheese production. It can add a substantial amount of protein to a person’s diet.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/large-study-finds-the-sweet-spot-for-daily-step-goals,Large study finds the sweet spot for daily step goals,1,"Are you a step counter, aiming for 10,000 steps per day to stay healthy? Many studies have suggested you don't need to hit that mark to maintain good health and live longer. And now the largest study to date backs up that theory. The research, published online Aug. 9, 2023, by the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, evaluated 17 high-quality studies from around the world, including a total of almost 227,000 people (ages 18 and older) who wore fitness trackers for a week and were then followed for about seven years. Taking at least 3,900 steps per day (not quite two miles) was linked to significantly lower risks of dying from any cause during the study period. A reduction in death specifically from cardiovascular disease appeared with an even smaller number of daily steps — about 2,300. The data also showed that each 1,000-step increment was associated with a 15% decreased risk of dying, and each 500-step increment was tied to a 7% decrease in death from cardiovascular disease. This study was observational and can't prove definitively that the number of steps people took lengthened their lives. But the findings underscore two common health messages: even a little movement makes a difference, and more is better. Image: © FatCamera/Getty Images",5,0.25823772,0.2253188,False

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-you-an-everyday-exerciser-or-a-weekend-warrior,Are you an everyday exerciser or a weekend warrior?,1,"The standard advice about exercise is to do about 30 minutes a day, most days of the week. But in terms of heart-related benefits, does it matter if you rack up most of your exercise minutes over just one or two days instead of spreading them out over an entire week? Earlier research has suggested that both patterns are equally beneficial. But those findings relied on people to self-report their exercise, which can be unreliable. Now, a study of nearly 90,000 adults who used wristband monitors to record their physical activity has reached a similar conclusion. ""The findings add to the body of literature showing that it doesn't matter when you get your exercise, as long as you get the recommended amount each week,"" says Dr. I-Min Lee, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert on the role of physical activity in preventing disease. Volume matters more than pattern The study, published July 18, 2023, in JAMA, doesn't define the term ""weekend warrior"" in quite the same way as most people do, says Dr. Lee. ""Usually, weekend warriors are seen as people who don't exercise on weekdays but then take a long hike or play two hours of tennis on Saturday or Sunday,"" she says. Instead, researchers used participants' physical activity data, which were recorded over seven consecutive days, to categorize them into different groups. About two-thirds of them met the federal physical activity guidelines (see ""How much exercise?""). About 42% were deemed ""weekend warriors,"" meaning they met the guidelines but got half or more of their total physical activity — not just exercise — on just one or two days. Another 24% were ""regularly active,"" meeting the guidelines with activity spread out over the week. The remaining 34% didn't meet the guidelines. After roughly six years, the researchers found that participants who followed either activity pattern had a similarly lower risk of heart attack, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure compared with people in the inactive group. Historically, experts have encouraged people to be regularly active, mainly because anecdotal reports suggest that weekend warriors may be more prone to injuries. But this study didn't find any difference in injury rates between the two active groups. That's likely because of the definition used in the study: the ""warrior"" group wasn't necessarily doing the types of high-intensity activities or sports often associated with muscle sprains and related injuries, Dr. Lee says. Best time of day to exercise? Whatever works for you Are there any pros or cons associated with exercising at certain times of the day? Research results are all over the map, says Harvard Medical School professor Dr. I-Min Lee. The best strategy is to exercise when it's most convenient and comfortable for you, whether that's the first thing in the morning, early evening, or anytime in between. If you exercise early in the day, you can check it off your to-do list and can take advantage of the ""feel-good"" brain chemicals, serotonin and dopamine, that are released during exercise. But afternoon workouts also have some benefits. Your joints and muscles may be more limber later in the day, which may make exercise feel less taxing. If you experience a midafternoon lull, exercise can be a good way to reinvigorate yourself. If you can, find a buddy who likes to exercise at the same time, so you can go together and hold each other accountable. Likewise, there's little evidence to suggest that coordinating your exercise with respect to mealtimes has any good or bad effects. Some people find that vigorous exercise right before a meal curbs their appetite, while others find the opposite is true. A pre-breakfast workout works well for certain people. But having a small, carbohydrate-rich snack (like a banana or a slice of whole-grain toast) at least half an hour before exercising may provide a helpful energy boost, says Dr. Lee. Short bouts of activity count Wristband devices enable researchers to capture all the short bouts of activity people do throughout the day that they may not remember. ""If you do jumping jacks occasionally while watching television, you won't necessarily recall that activity the way you remember that you play tennis three times a week,"" says Dr. Lee. Similarly, people whose daily commutes include a few 10-minute bouts of walking may not consider that as counting toward their moderate-intensity activity minutes. But these small spurts of activity — sometimes referred to as exercise ""snacks"" — seem to be beneficial. If you're sitting for a long stretch, stand up and move around for a few minutes every hour. Activating your muscles even just briefly can help improve your body's ability to keep your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol in check. It's also worth noting that if you don't meet the physical activity guidelines, you'll still benefit from doing even small amounts of exercise — and every minute counts.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-you-have-a-heart-attack-and-not-know-it,Can you have a heart attack and not know it?,1,"""Silent"" heart attacks that don't produce noteworthy symptoms put you at the same future risks as the classic ones. When you think of a heart attack, you probably picture a pretty dramatic event that includes someone experiencing intense chest pain, clutching their arm and dropping to the ground unconscious. But in real life today, heart attacks aren't usually that extreme. Some produce no symptoms, or only produce mild symptoms that are so unremarkable that people mistake them for something else — heartburn from a lunchtime burrito, fatigue, or a chest muscle strain. ""The true incidence of silent heart attacks is not known, since by definition they go unnoticed,"" says Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, a senior investigator with the TIMI Study Group, an academic research group studying cardiovascular disease at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""However, estimates have placed them anywhere from 20% to 60% of all heart attacks."" Both women and men are at risk, she says. Identifying a silent heart attack People often don't learn that they had a heart attack until they have an electrocardiogram (ECG) or a stress test and the doctor notices signs consistent with heart damage. As in traditional symptomatic heart attacks, a silent heart attack involves a blockage of blood flow to the heart. This injures and scars part of the heart muscle, leaving behind telltale signs. Unfortunately, while a heart attack may go unnoticed, the injury it causes is real and puts you at higher risk for heart failure or a future heart attack. Take action after a silent heart attack If you do find out that you've had a silent heart attack, you should take steps to prevent or control cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes, any of which can make another heart attack more likely. Doctors don't completely understand why some people experience no symptoms — or only mild or unusual ones — during a heart attack, Dr. O'Donoghue says. To better identify silent heart attacks, she says, there needs to be more education about less common symptoms, which are often very different from the ones most people picture. ""I think the greatest misconception about a heart attack is that the chest discomfort is 'painful' — in fact, most patients describe the chest discomfort as a heaviness or squeezing sensation that can be quite mild in nature,"" she says. ""Women may also experience more atypical symptoms, like shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, and tingling in the left arm or jaw."" If you do experience these symptoms, it's best to get them checked out immediately. Even if they don't turn out to be heart-related, it truly is better to be safe than sorry. Be heart smart! Take these steps to head off cardiovascular disease: Talk to your doctor about risk factors. Identify things in your health history that might put you at higher risk for a heart attack, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, a family history of heart disease, and diabetes. Don't forget to mention female-specific risk factors, such as a history of early menopause (before age 40) or a past episode of preeclampsia (a potentially life-threatening pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine). Review your risk factors with your doctor. Know that your risk for heart problems may rise after menopause or if your health changes. Get screened. Monitor your blood pressure, and consider getting tested for diabetes if you have risk factors, such as a family history of the disease, overweight or obesity, or gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Adopt a healthy lifestyle. Eat a heart-healthy diet, meaning one that is high in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, and low in processed foods, saturated fat, and sugar. It's also important to get regular exercise, as well as adequate high-quality sleep. You should also work to reduce your stress levels. Managing risk factors ""Since heart attack symptoms can be missed, it is important to continue regular follow-up with your primary care provider,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. She or he might want to order periodic ECGs, she says. ""If a silent heart attack is identified, this may lead to more testing and appropriate treatments to help ensure another one doesn't occur and that the heart muscle is protected,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. Being proactive can also help ensure that your heart is healthy and that any risk factors you have for cardiovascular disease are managed appropriately. Lifestyle changes, including diet improvements, smoking cessation, and exercise, can help protect you from additional heart problems, says Dr. O'Donoghue, even if you've already had a silent heart attack.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/pcos-insulin-resistance-diabetes-mellitus/,Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: Insulin Resistance and Diabetes Mellitus,1,"This is the third installment of a 6-part series on the lifelong journey of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and the stops along the way that a female may face. In this installment, Danielle R. Stratton, DNP, RN, PPCNP-BC, will discuss insulin resistance and diabetes and the significant impact it can have on a female with the syndrome on her health and the impact on her entire body systems, and her health’s future as we continue with this series. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder impacting women of reproductive age. The etiology of obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome is not fully understood.1 However, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus (DM) play a role in the development of extra intrabdominal adipose tissue throughout a female’s span of life.2 As an endocrine disorder, PCOS is linked with persistent insulin resistance over time leading to metabolic complications. This leads to a vicious cycle of developing further multisystem concerns, especially in a patient of reproductive age. Insulin resistance is prevalent in females with PCOS independently of obesity; in patients with obesity,1 it is amplified. Insulin resistance is an inadequate response to the hormone insulin, which means the body makes the insulin but cannot use it effectively. This puts the patient at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.3 This is a critical component involved in metabolic and reproductive health issues associated with PCOS, and one of the difficulties in management.1 Females with obesity are at risk of developing insulin resistance, however, women with PCOS are at higher risk. With the development of insulin resistance, the pancreas still secretes insulin but the body ceases to store glucose properly. Glucose will then continue to accumulate in the blood and gradually change the body’s response to glucose. This results in hyperglycemia, and with worsening insulin resistance, leads to diabetes mellitus.1-3 Insulin resistance has been found in adolescents with PCOS, however, health care providers are not always testing and monitoring for this early in a female’s life. Adolescent females with PCOS are at risk of developing glucose intolerance, leading to insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Approximately 10% of females with PCOS will be found to have type 2 diabetes by the age of 40.2 Patients with a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes are particularly at higher risk. Females with PCOS and a family history of type 2 diabetes may have a combination of insulin resistance and an impairment in insulin secretions. However, the extent of insulin resistance one may have does not predict the therapeutic response to insulin-lowering treatments.4 The relationship between PCOS and insulin resistance has been widely studied. Insulin is a pivotal hormone in females of reproductive age. The action of insulin in the central nervous system (CNS) is imperative for ovulation. Insulin resistance contributes to the production of smaller eggs and/or the delayed production of eggs.3 Other clinical manifestations of insulin resistance that a female with PCOS may develop include hyperlipidemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, hepatic disease, renal disease, acanthosis nigricans, and sleep disorders.2 A majority of women and adolescent girls with PCOS have insulin resistance and consequently hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia has a major negative effect on the physiology of the body, but also on the metabolic and reproductive health, especially in women with PCOS. The evidence in the literature supports that every effort should be taken to reduce hyperinsulinemia and its impact before and during puberty in females with hyperandrogenemia. Furthermore, health care providers need to take the lead and treat adult females with PCOS more aggressively.1-5 It is important to note that not all females with PCOS have insulin resistance and/or develop diabetes mellitus. This is one reason why PCOS is not fully understood. Despite being a common development, not every woman develops every sign or symptom of PCOS — it is not a cookie cutter syndrome, and not every sign and symptom affects each female in the same way. Because of this, routine assessment of insulin resistance is not recommended. There is no validated test currently in medicine to measure insulin resistance, as a result, it is not necessary to definitively make the diagnosis of PCOS or to select the individualized treatment(s).4-5 A patient with PCOS cannot control all the factors that increase their risk of developing insulin resistance, however, they ensure they are active and exercising regularly, they have healthy nutrition habits, and they are managing stress.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-obesity/,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Obesity,1,"This is the second installment of a 6-part series on the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In this installment, Danielle R. Stratton, DNP, RN, PPCNP-BC, discusses obesity and the significant impact it can have on patients with PCOS. This is a condition that most females with PCOS battle from adolescence through end of life. The diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) heralds significant changes in a woman’s life trajectory. Women with PCOS often express heightened concerns regarding their weight, yet they frequently lack clarity in assessing and appreciating their overall health and lifestyle choices. Therefore, health care providers must educate each woman upon diagnosis, emphasizing that this syndrome does not define their identity.1 Health providers need to empower each patient with PCOS to: Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common obesity-related endocrine syndrome in females,2 and obesity is a major concern for those with PCOS. Although the etiology of obesity is not fully known, it is estimated that half of females with PCOS are considered obese (defined as a BMI ≥30 kg/mg2). For those females that are in the nonobese category, approximately one-third have a concern about intra-abdominal adipose tissue, also known as visceral fat. Visceral fat accumulation is a major health concern for everyone, not only females with PCOS, because over time it can cause a multitude of health complications that impact different body systems.2-7 A high level of visceral fat is associated with insulin resistance.8 Women with PCOS tend to have a higher body mass index (BMI) than patients without PCOS and have difficulty losing weight as they get older. This begins a cycle of the continuous effect of insulin resistance leading to type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), sleep apnea, hypertension, heart disease, risk for cerebrovascular accidents, hypercholesterolemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, poor immune function, stress, depression, and anxiety.9 Studies have shown that androgens play a key role in the determination of body fat distribution. Anatomically and physiologically, it is known that males have a greater distribution of visceral fat in the upper portion of the body compared to females, who tend to accumulate fat in the lower body. A female with PCOS has hyperandrogenism and increased testosterone levels.10 Hyperandrogenism can induce multiple symptoms of PCOS, including obesity, androgenic alopecia, hirsutism, and acne.11 The accumulation of visceral fat from adolescence into adulthood is a defining symptom of PCOS.8 The chronic exposure to higher levels of androgens in females with PCOS modifies body fat accumulation and distribution, leading to increased visceral fat. This, in turn, adversely impacts insulin sensitivity, resulting in insulin resistance, contributing to the gain of more visceral fat, overall weight gain and ultimately obesity.10 The combination of insulin resistance and obesity exacerbates symptoms of hyperandrogenism, creating a vicious cycle for a female with PCOS and increasing the symptoms she may experience in her life.11 Early-onset treatment of PCOS is crucial in reducing the patient’s risk of developing these system-wide complications. A holistic treatment approach, addressing comorbidities, should begin as early as possible after diagnosis of PCOS, particularly in adolescents or young adults with obesity. Although progress has been made in the study of PCOS, further research is needed. Adolescents and young adults with PCOS and obesity require more attention from health care providers and researchers to improve their quality of life today and into the future.5-7 Management of obesity is the same as for those with and without PCOS, beginning with healthy lifestyle changes focused on nutrition and increasing daily activity. A recent meta-analysis of 19 randomized control trials that included 727 patients with PCOS found that the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) was the most effective in reducing insulin resistance, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin levels, and triglyceride levels in women with PCOS. For reducing BMI, the most effective intervention was a low-calorie diet, and for weight loss, the low-calorie diet with metformin was the most effective. In a comparison of a normal diet (55% carbohydrate, 15% to 20% protein, and 25% to 30% fat) vs metformin, metformin produced the greatest reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total testosterone levels and the normal diet ranked first for increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.12 Supplementation with probiotics, vitamin D, and L-carnitine has provided additional benefits to patients.13-16 The coadministration of a probiotic and vitamin D for 12 weeks has been shown to have beneficial effects on the mental health of patients with PCOS, as well as reducing hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress on the body.13 Vitamin and supplements assist in synthesizing serotonin levels, increase the function of neurons to release dopamine, release antioxidants that decrease serum total testosterone levels, and decrease oxidative stress.14 The literature suggests that supplementation, specifically with probiotics, should be considered in adolescents with PCOS. A literature review found an improvement in weight, BMI, insulin, and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), indicating the potential role of probiotics to protect fertility.15 It is well established that providing the body with sufficient nutrients contributes to energy, cell growth, lipid metabolism, reproduction, and overall health. In the body of someone with PCOS, several nutrients have been shown to play a role in overall health and regulate pathways and synthesis, and may help to counteract complications of PCOS.13-16 The next stage of weight management involves individualized pharmacotherapy. The current treatment for obesity in patients with PCOS includes glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) (Table). In conjunction with a low-calorie diet, GLP-1 receptor agonists have demonstrated substantial weight loss (6%-11%).17 These agents mimic the effects of the GLP-1 hormone that is secreted from L-cells, which are located in the distal portion of the small intestine. This hormone causes a decrease in the release of glucagon, suppressing the hypothalamic hunger center and slowing gastric emptying. This leads to early satiety, which affects the release of insulin by increasing postprandial glucose levels. As a result, GLP-1 agonists have been shown to reduce energy intake by suppressing appetite.18 Research has found that GLP-1 immunoreactivity in the neurons of the myenteric and submucosal plexuses within the duodenum and proximal colon regulates motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Further, neuronal GLP-1 was also found to be located within the brain, mimicking the anorexic effect when one is given a GLP-1 agonist(s), leading in turn to potential weight loss.18 Although these GLP-1 agonists have been shown to cause weight loss, health insurance may not cover their use without a diagnosis of DM. All of the GLP-1 agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide, tirzepatide) can all be used to treat DM and research has shown them to be effective in combination with metformin in treating PCOS, with the added benefit of weight loss.18,19 For patients with significant weight gain, recommendations for bariatric surgery to assist in weight loss should be considered.9 In a study by Machado Júnior et al of the effects of sleeve gastrectomy on the hormonal profile of patients with PCOS, the authors found that plasma estradiol levels were higher (preoperative mean of 63.4 pg/dL vs postoperative mean of 91.0 pg/dL), and mean fasting insulin levels were significantly lower (24.4 mIU/mL vs.9.0 mIU/mL; P <0.001) at 3 months after surgery. In addition, luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were lower (7.2 vs. 4.5; P =0.047) and an inverted LH/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio was seen at 3 months (1.5 vs. 0.9; P =0.008). The patients also had significant weight loss (mean BMI, 40.5 kg/m2 vs. 33.4 kg/m2; P <0.001).20 Integrating proactive screening for hyperandrogenism and obesity into the standard protocol for managing patients with PCOS is paramount for comprehensive care. Empowering women early after their diagnoses to be proactive about their health is critical. With an array of weight loss options available, ranging from lifestyle changes to medical interventions, individuals with PCOS have avenues to improve health outcomes. By prioritizing early intervention and personalized treatment strategies, health care providers can significantly enhance the quality of life for women with PCOS.

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-psychosocial-effects/,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Psychosocial Effects,1,"This is the first installment of a 6-part series on the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In this installment, Danielle R. Stratton, DNP, RN, PPCNP-BC, will discuss the basics of the syndrome and the psychosocial impact it can have from diagnosis to later life. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a diverse, chronic, complex, incurable, under-detected, female endocrine disorder that, over time, can cause a multitude of health complications impacting different body systems. The journey a person takes from prior to and after diagnosis is like Dorothy’s journey along the Yellow Brick Road.1 Because PCOS often goes undiagnosed, it is crucial that health care providers, especially pediatric health professionals, are educated on how to identify an adolescent female at risk for PCOS, diagnose and implement treatment, and introduce interventions to promote maintenance of health. Delayed diagnosis of PCOS is commonly associated with poor patient experiences, which follow them into adulthood.2-7 By improving awareness, one can improve the diagnostic experience, education, management, and health outcomes for young patients. The syndrome was initially named Stein-Leventhal Syndrome, after the late American gynecologists Irving F. Stein, Sr, and Michael Leo Leventhal, who first associated anovulation with the presence of ovarian cysts in 1935.8 There is some evidence that PCOS was first reported in the 1700s when an Italian scientist, Antonio Vallisneri, described an infertile married female with shiny ovaries, with a white surface, and the size and look of pigeon eggs.9 In 1935, Stein and Leventhal described a similar condition in a group of 7 women who also exhibited hirsutism, menstruation irregularities, and enlarged ovaries with multiple small follicles on the surface. Their original report mentioned that abnormalities in the stimulation of hormones result in bilateral cystic ovaries.8 For many years the presence of ovarian cysts with anovulation was the diagnostic criteria for what was known as Stein-Leventhal Syndrome. Research in the 1980s, however, began system wide components of the disease, including endocrinologic, adrenal, and ovarian hyperandrogenic; metabolic, and psychological components that evolved as qualifications of the syndrome.9 In the early 1990s, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began to sponsor educational medical conferences on what was now known as PCOS, which pioneered the formal diagnostic criteria leading to the recognition of the syndrome across medical diagnoses. Stein-Leventhal Syndrome and PCOS were used interchangeable until the name officially changed to PCOS by 2004.9 Researchers now know that PCOS is a complex hormonal condition with genetic and environmental causes that is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with a high prevalence of PCOS and metabolic syndrome seen in a family history.2-4 The syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation.7 It is one of the most common endocrine metabolic reproductive disorders, affecting 8% to 13% of women of reproductive age.10 Approximately 6 million women in the United States are affected by PCOS. The condition, however, remains undiagnosed in up to 70% of women worldwide.10 It often manifests during adolescence and is associated with disruptions in health-related quality of life.6 The condition results in enlarged ovaries with small cysts on the outer edges and is the primary cause of anovulatory female infertility associated with an imbalance in female sex hormones.4,9 Patients usually present with abnormally high androgen levels, which is an important component of putting the PCOS puzzle together.11 High androgen levels have a major impact on reproductive health and are the leading source of infertility in women in their childbearing years.12 The prevalence of PCOS has increased almost 65% over the last decade. It is unclear if this is in relation to the syndrome itself, or if health care providers are more aware of the signs and symptoms of PCOS, leading to further investigation and diagnosis. Therefore, a convenient but consistent diagnostic criteria algorithm is necessary to assist in accurate diagnosis worldwide.13 With the prevalence of PCOS increasing, providers need to recognize symptoms and promptly begin treatment to reduce associated comorbidities.12 Early diagnosis and intervention for adolescents with PCOS can change the clinical course and quality of life for patients living with this condition.2 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) and Diabetes. There is no single test to confirm a diagnosis of PCOS, making diagnosis challenging.7 Even before a definitive diagnosis of PCOS, females with clinical signs of androgen excess, oligomenorrhea, and amenorrhea can be regarded as being at risk for PCOS. This is a complex disorder involving multiple organ systems with onset during the early pubertal years.7 It is important to diagnose PCOS as early as possible to limit the potential comorbidities and lifelong complications such as infertility, metabolic syndrome, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, increased cancer risk, and psychosocial dysfunction.2,9 Women with PCOS are also more likely to have anxiety, depression, and mood disorders.12 Timely implementation of individualized therapeutic interventions will improve overall management of PCOS, prevent associated comorbidities, and improve quality of life.5-7,14-16 The experience of diagnosis may have lasting effects on well-being and self-management. Therefore, prompt evaluation and clinical support after diagnosis may prevent associated complications and optimize overall health.5,6 Management of both those at risk for and those with a confirmed diagnosis of PCOS includes education, healthy lifestyle interventions, and therapeutic interventions targeting their symptoms.5-7,14-16 Often the therapeutic interventions are a combination treatment, not only to target the individual symptoms, but to prevent future complications and promote a healthy future.17 A diagnosis of PCOS can have both a positive and negative impact on a patient’s life, impacting their physical and psychosocial well-being. Behavior and lifestyle choices that are made at diagnosis will have an impact on their lifelong health journey.19 Women with PCOS are reported to have more concerns about their weight but less clarity about their overall health and lifestyle choices. This leads to lower self-esteem as well as a 3 times higher incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders compared with those without the diagnosis of PCOS.20 However, it is difficult to determine if anxiety and/or depressive disorders occur before or after the diagnosis of PCOS. Many of the physical features of PCOS (obesity, hirsutism, acne, acanthosis nigricans, male-pattern baldness, and hair thinning) can increase the risk for anxiety and depression. Moreover, underlying hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation, resulting in infertility, also contribute to the impact on mental health.2,4,7,19 Many patients with PCOS experience psychosocial dysfunction, which is defined as “experiencing negative psychosocial effects related to a condition.”19-20 This may result in impaired functioning in their personal and interpersonal relationships at school, home, or work. The understanding of the person who guides the patient through early diagnosis will determine how the patient experiences her individual journey of health down the Yellow Brick Road and can contribute to her positive or negative experiences in the future. Quality-of-life issues play a role in managing physical health and mental health. Screening for psychological comorbidities is essential and impacts the physical health of a patient with PCOS. Both are crucial and can have a positive or negative impact on quality of life. PCOS is grossly underdiagnosed despite its prevalence and implications for reproductive, metabolic, and psychological health.16 Being proactive and screening for low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and eating disorders needs to be part of all health care providers’ protocol when caring for a patient with potential or diagnosed PCOS ― from the start and throughout all ages and stages of life.2,9,19 Click here to read the full series.",7,0.049445402,0.0027541965,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/ask-the-doctor-what-causes-red-wine-headaches,Ask the doctor: What causes red wine headaches?,1,"Ask the doctor Q. I get headaches after drinking red wine. Why? I'm 56 years old and in excellent health. A. Getting a headache after drinking red wine seems to be common, but no single explanation has been found. Several theories have been proposed, but none has much evidence behind it. One theory holds that the culprit is histamine, a compound found in grape skins. Red wine contains more histamine than white wine because it's made from the whole grape (including the skin), not just the juice. Some people have a shortage of an enzyme that breaks down histamine in the small intestine. Alcohol also inhibits the enzyme, so the combination may boost histamine levels in the blood, which can dilate blood vessels and cause a headache. Tannins, another grape-skin constituent, could be at fault. Tannins are plant chemicals that impart flavor to red wines and contain antioxidants. But they also spur the release of certain chemicals called neurotransmitters associated with pain. Some experts think that sulfites, a preservative in wine, are to blame. But many white wines and other foods also contain sulfites. These potential culprits vary from wine to wine, so if you don't want to give up red wine altogether, you might try different brands or grape varieties to see how they affect you. When you try a new red wine, start with less than half a drink. If it's going to give you a headache, it'll do so within 15 minutes. Any alcoholic beverage can dilate blood vessels in the brain and cause a headache. Avoid drinking wine, beer, or liquor on an empty stomach or when you're dehydrated. Try to drink a glass of water between glasses of wine. And limit your wine intake to no more than one glass per day. But if you have two at a sitting, they should be separated by at least an hour.",0,0.24817002,-0.029077277,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/migraine-a-connection-to-cardiovascular-disease,Migraine: A connection to cardiovascular disease?,1,"Some people who get these intense, throbbing headaches may face a heightened risk of stroke and heart attack. About one in six adults in the United States reports having migraines, but these debilitating headaches are three times more prevalent in women. During a migraine attack, people often feel nauseated and are sensitive to light and sound. And up to a third of migraineurs experience odd visual or physical sensations known as an aura (see ""What is a migraine aura?""). Usually, the aura occurs soon before the headache, although some people experience just the aura without a headache. Both versions are known as migraine with aura or classic migraine. And both have long been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, especially stroke. But migraine sufferers should interpret this risk in context, says Dr. Christopher Anderson, chief of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Migraines tend to be most common in younger women, and their baseline risk of stroke is quite low in the first place,"" Dr. Anderson explains. The latest evidence comes from a 2020 study in JAMA of nearly 28,000 women who were part of the Women's Health Study. All were ages 45 or older and had no evidence of cardiovascular disease when the study began in the early 1990s. Researchers tracked the women's health until 2018. Just 5% of the participants reported having migraine with aura. Their annual rate of heart attack, stroke, or death from cardiovascular disease was slightly higher (3.4 per 1,000 women) than the rate among women who had migraines without aura or no migraines (2.1 per 1,000 women). What is a migraine aura? A migraine aura refers to a visual or sensory disturbance that strikes within the hour before the headache takes hold. The vision changes often include a blind spot, known as a scotoma, that affects both eyes but just one side of the visual field. Although scotomas usually appear black in people with other conditions, in migraines they are typically white or gray (or rarely, colored). A scotoma typically appears as a shimmering or scintillating zigzag in the shape of a crescent that expands across one side of the visual field and eventually moves off into the peripheral vision. One common variant is called ""fortification spectrum,"" because the pattern of bright geometrical lines resemble the walls of a medieval fort. An aura can also cause tingling on one side of the body, especially in the face or hand. Occasionally, people experience language auras that cause transient speaking problems, which can also occur with a stroke or ministroke. Very rarely, an aura will cause one-sided weakness in a leg, arm, or the face; this is known as a hemiplegic migraine. Again, these symptoms can also occur with a stroke or ministroke. A shared mechanism? Experts aren't exactly sure what's behind this observation, but one theory points to a shared underlying mechanism. Migraines are thought to result from unusual patterns of electrical activity in the brain caused by sweeping waves of neurons firing and then turning off. A migraine aura may be a manifestation of this phenomenon, which doctors refer to as cortical spreading depression. ""It may reflect some sort of blood vessel instability that also makes people more prone to cardiovascular issues,"" says Dr. Anderson. If you get migraines with aura, there aren't any specific steps you can take to limit your cardiovascular risk. However, women who are 35 and older who have migraine with aura should be sure to tell their primary care provider or gynecologist about their headaches. Taking estrogen-containing birth control pills or hormone therapy may further raise stroke risk in these women. As a result, they might want to consider other, nonhormonal or estrogen-free treatment options. ""We don't necessarily want to dissuade women from taking hormonal medications, as the risk-and-benefit calculation is different for everyone,"" says Dr. Anderson. ""Just make sure all of your doctors are aware of all of your health conditions and current medications,"" he advises. Don't dismiss new symptoms Auras don't occur before every migraine, but once you've had one, you're considered to have classic migraine. However, in adulthood, people typically do not develop new symptoms during future migraines — most people seem to have their own particular, predictable version of these headaches. So if you experience a new symptom, don't dismiss it, says Dr. Anderson. For example, if your typical aura consists of flashes of light but you start to experience numbness or weakness in your hand, it could be something other than a migraine, he cautions. Seek emergency care as soon as possible. Image: © Ridofranz/Getty Images",7,0.17181799,0.045683026,False

But if daily activity is a challenge, maybe you can squeeze a week's worth of exercise into one or two days per week. This ""weekend warrior"" approach is linked to the same heart-healthy benefits as daily exercise, according to a Harvard study published July 18, 2023, in JAMA. Researchers analyzed the health data and physical activity of almost 90,000 people (average age 62) who fit into one of three categories: they exercised throughout the week, jammed all exercise into one or two days a week, or didn't exercise at all. Participants wore fitness trackers for a week and were then followed for about six years. Compared with people who didn't exercise, weekend warriors had a 27% lower risk for heart attacks, a 38% lower risk for heart failure, a 22% lower risk for atrial fibrillation, and a 21% lower risk for stroke. The numbers were similar for people who exercised throughout the week. The study was observational and doesn't prove that the weekend warrior pattern is as good for the heart as daily exercise. But if you're pressed for time, the concentrated approach might help you reach your weekly exercise goals until you can get back to a daily routine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/low-dose-aspirin-linked-to-anemia,Low-dose aspirin linked to anemia,1,"Although daily, low-dose aspirin can help prevent heart attacks, this widely used drug comes with a downside: an increased risk of bleeding. This ranges from minor problems (such as noticeable bruising) to more serious but rare complications, such as bleeding in the brain. New research now finds older people who take low-dose aspirin every day are more likely to develop anemia, a condition marked by a reduced amount of red blood cells. The findings are yet another reminder to be cautious about daily aspirin use. Although around half of older adults say they take low-dose aspirin, current guidelines recommend this practice only for people who have coronary artery disease or another vascular disease and for those who are under 70 and at high risk of a heart attack. (For more details, see ""Advice about daily aspirin"" in the July 2021 Heart Letter.) ""We can't talk about all the good that aspirin does without mentioning the potential harm,"" says cardiologist Dr. Gregory Piazza, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Decades ago, doctors recommended low-dose aspirin for most men over 50, but that's no longer the case. Unless you have diagnosed cardiovascular disease, the risk of bleeding likely outweighs the drug's heart-protecting benefits, as several recent large studies comparing aspirin to a placebo have shown. More harm than good One of those studies was the ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) trial, which followed more than 19,000 initially healthy adults over age 70 for nearly five years. In these people, low-dose aspirin did not protect against heart attack or stroke. But it did raise the risk of major bleeding — especially in the stomach and brain — by 30%. Aspirin may also cause subtle, undetected internal bleeding that leads to anemia, based on a new analysis of the ASPREE data that looked at participants' hemoglobin and ferritin levels, which were measured yearly. Hemoglobin carries oxygen in the blood; ferritin helps store iron in your body. Anemia is defined as having a hemoglobin level of less than 12 milligrams per liter (mg/L) for men and less than 11 mg/L for women. This new analysis, published in the July 2023 Annals of Internal Medicine, found that people who took aspirin were 20% more likely to have anemia compared with those not taking the drug. Although mild cases of anemia might not cause any symptoms, the condition can lead to fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and dizziness, all of which result from the diminished oxygen levels in the body. Aspirin's actions Aspirin discourages blood clots by preventing tiny cell fragments in the blood called platelets from clumping together. But the drug also blocks substances that help maintain and protect the delicate tissue lining the gastrointestinal tract. ""Long-term aspirin use can damage this protective layer, making bleeding more likely,"" says Dr. Piazza. Doctors refer to small amounts of bleeding as ""occult"" bleeding, since it often remains hidden and unrecognized. This minor bleeding can occur in the stomach or farther down the gastrointestinal tract. If you have any sort of breach in this pathway, such as a hemorrhoid or a tiny colon polyp, taking daily aspirin can make it more likely to bleed. In fact, this phenomenon may explain why aspirin use has been linked to lower risk of death from colon cancer. Aspirin may reveal the cancer by causing a cancerous polyp to bleed and show up as blood in a person's stool. The resulting earlier diagnosis and treatment may extend survival, Dr. Piazza explains. The bottom line If you're currently taking low-dose aspirin, check with your doctor to make sure it makes sense for you. ""With my patients, we review all their medications at every visit,"" Dr. Piazza says. People may have taken aspirin for years, but since bleeding risk rises with age, it might be time for them to stop. Or they may have started taking a different, more powerful clot-preventing medication that renders the aspirin unnecessary. A common example is clopidogrel (Plavix), which is often prescribed after a person gets an artery-opening stent. If your doctor recommends low-dose aspirin, make sure you get an annual blood test that checks your hemoglobin levels. It's commonly done as part of an annual physical. But for heart disease prevention, doctors tend to focus on cholesterol and blood sugar values and may pay less attention to hemoglobin levels, says Dr. Piazza.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/healthy-eating-for-blood-sugar-control,Healthy eating for blood sugar control,1,"If you have diabetes, your healthy eating plan should not be that different from a healthy eating plan for someone without diabetes. In fact, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) echoes the dietary guidelines recommended for the general public: A diet centered on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (peas and beans), and low-fat dairy products. How carbs fit in However, you'll want to pay special attention to your carbohydrate intake. For most people with diabetes, carbohydrates should account for about 45% to 55% of the total calories you eat each day. Make sure you choose your carbohydrates wisely — ideally, from vegetables, whole grains, and fruits. Try to avoid highly refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta, and rice, as well as candy, sugary soft drinks, and sweets. Refined carbohydrates tend to cause sharp spikes in blood sugar, and can boost blood triglyceride levels. The facts on fiber Vegetables, fruits, and whole grains not only provide more nutrition per calorie than refined carbohydrates, they also tend to be rich in fiber. Your body digests high-fiber foods more slowly — which means a more moderate rise in blood sugar. Fiber comes in two forms: insoluble fiber, the kind found in whole grains, and soluble fiber, found in beans, dried peas, oats, and fruits. Soluble fiber in particular appears to lower blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity, which may mean you need less diabetes medicine. In addition, a number of studies suggest that eating plenty of fiber reduces the chances of developing heart disease — and people with diabetes need to do all they can to lower their risk.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/when-and-how-should-you-be-screened-for-colon-cancer-202309202975,When — and how — should you be screened for colon cancer?,1,"Colon cancer is the second-deadliest form of cancer after lung cancer. If recent messages about colon cancer screening have left you a little confused, that's understandable. In August, the American College of Physicians (ACP) released updated guidance for colon cancer screening that differs from other major organizations, including recommendations from the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the US Preventive Services Task force (USPSTF). So, what do you need to know? How does the advice differ? First, please note that this advice applies only to people at average risk without a family history of colon cancer. If you have family history, or if other health issues put you at higher-than-average risk for colorectal cancer, talk to your doctor about the best course of action for you. The main point of disagreement relates to the age at which people should start getting screened. The new ACP guidance says 50, while the other two organizations recommend 45. That earlier age is endorsed by the U.S. Multisociety Task Force on Colorectal Cancer. It's also endorsed by many physicians, including Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Andrew T. Chan, a gastroenterologist and director of epidemiology at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, who helps explain key facts below. Why do experts suggest starting screening earlier? ""We're facing an unexplained and alarming increase in the incidence of colon cancer in people younger than 50,"" says Dr. Chan. Overall, deaths from colon cancer dropped by 2% per year from 2011 to 2020. But that's not the case among people younger than 50. In that age group, deaths from colon cancer rose between 0.5% and 3% during the same time period, according to statistics published in 2023. The rising rates of colon cancer in younger people are occurring in all racial and ethnic groups, with the steepest rises seen among Alaskan Natives and Native Americans. Overall, Blacks and African Americans are more likely to get and die from colon cancer than whites, and early-onset cases are higher in Black individuals than whites. Efforts to encourage colon cancer screening began in the mid-1990s. Today, about 60% of adults over 50 follow the advice to receive a colonoscopy (described below) on a regular basis. This track record, while not perfect, likely explains the decline in deaths from colon cancer in older adults. ""I think that promoting earlier screening will help stem the rise in early-onset cases, at least for those in their 40s. We've also seen that earlier colonoscopies may be associated with lowering incidence of colon cancer even later in life, ""says Dr. Chan. What are the different screening tests for colon cancer? The two most widely used screening tests are a standard colonoscopy and various stool-based tests. Colonoscopy. For this test, a gastroenterologist or surgeon snakes a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end through your rectum and beyond to inspect the entire length of your colon. Considered the gold-standard test, this procedure can detect precancerous polyps called adenomas, and allow for their removal. The test requires taking laxatives and drinking lots of fluids beforehand to clean all the fecal material (stool) out of your colon. Serious complications, which include perforation or bleeding, are rare, occurring in about three in 1,000 procedures. If no polyps are found, a repeat colonoscopy isn't recommended for another 10 years. If you have polyps, or your risk or symptoms change, this interval will be shorter. Stool tests. The more worrisome colon polyps (adenomas) often shed tiny amounts of blood and abnormal DNA into the stool. This can be detected from samples you collect yourself at home. Two tests, the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical test (FIT), check for blood. They require small stool samples that you put on a card or in a tube that's then mailed to a lab. These tests should be done every year. A third option, the FIT-DNA test, checks for both blood and abnormal DNA; it's usually repeated every three years. Additionally, the guidelines from the American College of Physicians suggest another option: flexible sigmoidoscopy, which inspects only the lower part of the colon, once every 10 years, combined with a fecal FIT testing every two years. However, doctors in the United States rarely order sigmoidoscopy today. If flexible sigmoidoscopy or any of these stool tests show evidence of a problem, a colonoscopy is needed to check for adenomas or cancer. Why might stool-based screening make sense for younger adults? Colonoscopy isn't necessarily the best initial screening test for everyone, says Dr. Chan. That's especially true for younger people, mainly because it's time-consuming and inconvenient. ""Maybe you just can't find time in your schedule or are worried about having a colonoscopy,"" he says. If that's the case, a stool-based test — which is noninvasive and takes very little time — is an appropriate option. ""The worst option is not doing anything, because early detection and treatment can prevent deaths,"" he says.",1,-0.025494892,0.15768431,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-best-ways-to-manage-heartburn,The best ways to manage heartburn,1,"On call Image: © Juanmonino/Getty Images Q. I have about three episodes of heartburn per month and it often lasts all day. What do you suggest? A. Heartburn is caused by stomach acid moving up and out of the stomach and into the lower part of the esophagus. Reducing the overall acidity in the stomach protects the esophagus from irritation when the stomach contents back up (reflux). The fastest treatment is to neutralize the acid already in the stomach and lower esophagus by taking an over-the-counter antacid. While antacids work within minutes, they often don't last, so you may have to take repeated doses until symptoms subside. For longer-lasting relief, you can try an H2 blocker, which stops stomach cells from making acid. There are several over-the-counter brands of H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and ranitidine (Zantac). Generic versions also are available. H2 blockers come as a pill, liquid, or chewable or effervescent tablet. Most people react well to all of them. H2 blockers begin to act within an hour and last for another 10 to 12 hours. (If you still need the occasional antacid, wait 30 to 60 minutes after taking one before adding an H2 blocker.) Proton-pump inhibitors are even stronger acid blockers. Over-the-counter brands include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24HR), omeprazole (Losec, Omesec, Prilosec OTC), and omeprazole with sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid). If your heartburn doesn't respond to these drugs or lasts for more than 10 days, see your doctor. — by Howard LeWine, M.D. Editor in Chief, Harvard Men's Health Watch",1,0.20554186,-0.02677168,False

https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/rsv-and-pregnancy/,"RSV in Pregnancy: Vaccinations, Prevention, and Treatment Recommendations",1,"Our easy-to-read fact sheets provide clinicians with reliable information to share with patients and their caregivers. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a seasonal lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) responsible for millions of hospitalizations globally on an annual basis. It commonly affects patients who are immunocompromised, individuals who are younger than 5 or older than 65 years of age, and patients with chronic heart and lung disease. Common symptoms of RSV include cough, fever, and shortness of breath, which peak within the first week of infection.1 The risk factors for infection in infants include premature birth. Risk factors in adults and children include existing immune disorders and pulmonary diseases.2 RSV diagnosis requires testing. In the past, diagnosis was based on cell cultures or laboratory tests. More recently, rapid and specific PCR tests have become available.3 Most people are infected by RSV by the age of 2. Frequent reinfection for RSV, even within the same season, is possible. Following the initial infection, any reinfection should be less severe.4 The incidence of RSV in pregnancy is low, with about 2% to 9% of pregnant individuals developing RSV. However, the actual number may be higher because of infrequent testing. Common symptoms of RSV in those who are pregnant include fever lasting 2 to 3 days, runny nose, and sore throat lasting 4 days. Less common but more severe symptoms include wheezing and shortness of breath.4 Those infected with RSV during pregnancy are at a greater risk for developing a severe infection; that’s because the body makes changes to the immune system, heart, and lungs to accommodate a developing baby, while still defending the body from pathogens. Studies have shown that 50% of those who are pregnant may develop severe RSV infections requiring hospitalization. Also, pregnant individuals have a higher risk for hospitalization in the third trimester, as well as for hospitalization due to pneumonia or other respiratory illnesses. Common pre-existing conditions in pregnant women who are hospitalized are obesity, another infection, and asthma.4 Although not clearly understood, RSV in pregnancy has been linked to RSV in babies at birth. It’s believed that this may be possible because the RSV infection in the mother can be passed to the baby in utero.4 Research to address RSV in infants has primarily focused on how the mother passes antibodies to the child during pregnancy. There are 33 million cases of RSV in infants and children annually in the United States, and infants under 6 months of age account for 46% of RSV-related deaths. RSV is the most common cause of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory tract infections in children and the second most common cause of infant deaths worldwide.5 Babies are especially at risk for a severe infection because they are born with small airways. When they get infections that cause inflammation, the already small airways become even smaller, leading to wheezing and difficulty breathing. RSV infections in infants are associated with severe bronchiolitis that has been associated with recurrent wheezing.2 Infants who get RSV within the first 3 years of life are 3 times more likely to develop asthma.1 Treatments for RSV are mostly interventions to reduce symptoms, like supplemental oxygen and rehydration with intravenous fluids. For patients who are immunocompromised, ribavirin (Virazole®), an aerosolized antiviral medication, is recommended.6 RSV seasonal prevention includes 2 injectables, palivizumab (Synagis®) and nirsevimab (Beyfortus®). Once-monthly palivizumab is given to infants under 2 years of age with serious comorbidities or born at less than 32 weeks gestation.5,6 Single-dose nirsevimab is approved for use in infants who are preterm and full-term with a high risk for infection.6 In 2023, the FDA approved a new RSV vaccine, Abrysvo®. The 1-dose RSVpreF vaccine is recommended for pregnant individuals between 32 to 36 weeks of gestation. The vaccine provides immunity to the mother for 2 years. After administration, it takes 14 days for the mother to develop antibodies that then pass immunity to the baby. The vaccine is intended both to lower the mother’s risk for getting RSV and to protect the infant; the vaccine prevents RSV and lowers the risk for respiratory tract infections in infants up to 6 months of age. With the advent of the new vaccine, infants will only need prophylactic medications in rare circumstances, such as when the infant is born less than 14 days after the mother received the vaccine, or when the mother has HIV.7 RSV infection during pregnancy may be associated with early delivery and low birth weight. Some studies suggest that babies born with RSV are more likely to develop acute respiratory illnesses, asthma, and wheezing, and to require supplemental oxygen.4,5 Although research is ongoing, the RSV vaccine is considered safe during pregnancy.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/heart-attacks-may-speed-cognitive-decline,Heart attacks may speed cognitive decline,1,"Just as our bodies become less nimble with age, so do our brains. Being more forgetful or taking longer to recall names or events is a normal part of growing older. But sometimes, these cognitive changes occur faster than usual. Now, new research has found that such accelerated cognitive decline may be more common after a heart attack (see ""Cognitive changes after a heart attack""). Cognition — the ability to reason and remember — can be assessed in many different ways. The new study considered global (that is, overall) cognition, which encompasses such areas as learning, processing speed, and executive function (the ability to carry out mental tasks such as planning ahead or remembering instructions). Immediately after a heart attack, survivors experienced no apparent cognitive changes. But they showed a faster, persistent drop in global cognition over the following years compared with people who didn't have heart attacks. The decline was equal to about six to 13 years of normal cognitive aging, according to the study authors. Cognitive changes after a heart attack To better understand the causes of cognitive problems — and potential prevention strategies — researchers looked at data from six large studies done in the United States over the past five decades. Their findings, in the July 2023 issue of JAMA Neurology, are summarized below. Who: 30,465 adults with no history of heart attack, stroke, or dementia. Just over half (56%) were women; 29% were Black, and 8% were Hispanic. When: The studies ran from 1971 to 2019. What: During follow-up periods that ranged from about five to 20 years,1,033 people had a heart attack. (Among that group, 137 had two heart attacks.) All participants had at least one cognitive assessment, and those who had a heart attack had at least one assessment both before and after the event. Key findings: Cognitive changes were not apparent immediately after a heart attack. But in the following years, heart attack survivors experienced a faster-than-normal decline in cognitive ability. Heart-brain links What might explain these findings? Heart attacks may lead to changes that directly affect blood flow to the brain or that trigger atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder known to increase the risk of major strokes. Such strokes, in turn, can cause severe cognitive problems that interfere with function (dementia). People who experience heart attacks also have higher rates of depression, another condition tied to dementia. However, the same factors that lead to narrowed heart arteries — the root cause of most heart attacks — can also lead to cerebral small vessel disease. Also known as microvascular ischemic disease, this condition results from high cholesterol and the relentless pounding of high blood pressure inside the brain's small arteries. Over time, the linings of these vessels thicken, choking off blood flow and causing tiny ""silent"" strokes. ""A single microscopic stroke isn't visible on a brain scan. But if dozens or hundreds accumulate, they show up as bright areas on an MRI scan,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, chief of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology at the VA Boston Healthcare System and a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. The bright spots are known as white matter lesions (white matter consists of bundles of nerve fibers that connect brain cells). In recent decades, doctors have come to realize that cerebral small vessel disease is to blame for the vast majority of cases of vascular dementia — that is, the type of dementia caused by blood vessel problems, as opposed to Alzheimer's disease. Previously, vascular dementia was thought to result mainly from strokes in large vessels, most of which occur when a clot blocks a brain artery, Dr. Budson explains. Brain aging: Normal vs. fast In fact, most older people's brain scans show some evidence of white matter lesions; they're recognized as markers of the typical cognitive changes that occur with age. But people who have heart attacks likely have more (and perhaps some as yet unrecognized) risk factors for tiny strokes. As a result, they likely have more white matter lesions and experience even greater cognitive decline. ""As a neurologist who looks at brain scans all the time, I believe this is the most likely explanation,"" says Dr. Budson. For preventing heart attacks, the evidence for following a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and maintaining a normal weight is already very strong. Consider the extra protection for your brain health as an added bonus. Image: © mgstudyo/Getty Images",7,0.15080225,0.11167841,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heart-attacks-strike-in-different-ways,Heart attacks strike in different ways,1,"Mention heart attack, and many people think of a man clutching his chest in pain. But the symptoms are often subtle, and the underlying process causing the heart attack can differ. ""Heart attacks are defined by damage to the heart muscle from a limitation of blood flow, but there are multiple ways this can occur,"" says Dr. Stephen Wiviott, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Regardless of the cause, this damage can result in permanent reduction of heart function or even death. This is why it's so important for people to recognize the different signs, so they know when to seek care."" Symptoms and causes Chest discomfort remains the most common heart attack symptom. But the discomfort can feel more like mild pressure, a pulled muscle, or heartburn rather than the pain that people may expect. Sometimes other symptoms predominate, such as pain in the jaw, shoulders, or arms; nausea with or without vomiting; sweating; or shortness of breath. People who have a heart attack often say, in retrospect, ""I just felt awful."" There are two different mechanisms by which most heart attacks happen. Both are related to insufficient blood flow to an area of the heart, most often related to fatty plaque buildup in coronary arteries. A type 1 heart attack occurs when a plaque ruptures and releases chemicals that trigger the formation of a blood clot. The clot blocks the artery, cutting off blood flow to part of the heart. A type 2 heart attack does not involve a ruptured plaque. It happens when there is a mismatch between the amount of blood a portion of heart muscle needs and the blood supply in the coronary artery feeding that area of the heart. The setting for this type of heart attack can be a condition that puts extras stress on the heart like the flu or pneumonia, an abnormal heart rhythm resulting in an accelerated heart rate, or a big spike in blood pressure. Why type matters Even though type 2 heart attacks may sound less ominous, they actually have a worse prognosis. Research has found that people with this type of heart attack are more likely to die over the next few years compared with those who experience a type 1 attack. This is not necessarily because type 2 attacks cause more heart damage, but because they typically occur in patients who are older and who have other medical problems in addition to blockages in the arteries. These features raise the risk of a second heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. In comparison, people with type 1 heart attack may be more likely to get proven therapies (such as immediate cardiac catheterization to open the blockage with angioplasty or a stent) and to start taking medications to prevent another heart attack (such as blood clot inhibitors and high-dose statin drugs). They are also less likely than people with type 2 attacks to have other illnesses. Recognize and react The takeaway here is that you should be aware of the signs of heart attacks so you can immediately call 911. ""Always be mindful about potential heart symptoms. Seek immediate attention if they are severe or persistent, and contact your physician if you are unsure,"" says Dr. Wiviott. ""Your body is sending you a warning, so don't ignore it.""

But that risk is lower if they drink healthier choices. The Harvard-led study, published online April 19, 2023, by The BMJ, involved 9,252 women and 3,519 men who were diagnosed with diabetes at the study's start or at some point during the following 18.5 years. Every two to four years, participants reported how often they drank sugary beverages, artificially sweetened drinks, fruit juice, coffee, tea, low- or full-fat cow's milk, or water. Those who regularly drank sugar-sweetened drinks were more likely than other participants to have cardiovascular disease, die from it, or die for any reason during the study period. Each daily serving of a sugary drink raised the risk of dying from any cause by 8%. But all such risks decreased among participants who drank healthier beverages.

But the evidence against meat has been inconsistent, with some studies suggesting risks only from processed red meat such as hot dogs, bacon, ham, and salami. Also, men tend to eat more meat than women. So which kind of red meat affects health, and is one sex more vulnerable to it than another? To find out, researchers reviewed dozens of observational and randomized studies that tracked red meat consumption (including 43 studies looking at heart disease and 27 looking at diabetes) among more than five million men and women. The researchers found that both unprocessed and processed red meat are linked to higher risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, with no apparent difference in risk between men and women. The authors urge all adults to reduce their red meat intake as a way to protect health. The findings were published June 2, 2023, in the European Heart Journal.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/common-celiac-disease-symptoms,Common celiac disease symptoms,1,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that mainly affects the gastrointestinal tract. In people with celiac disease, an allergic reaction is triggered when gluten (a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley) is ingested. Over time, the immune reactions triggered by gluten inflame and damage small structures on the surface of the intestine. Unmanaged celiac disease can cause uncomfortable digestive symptoms, as well as symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Some symptoms result from inflammation in the intestines, while other symptoms stem from a lack of nutrients, due to the failure of the damaged intestine to digest food properly. The symptoms of celiac disease vary so widely that there is no such thing as a typical case. Some people with celiac disease experience mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, which can delay a medical diagnosis. Digestive symptoms Digestive symptoms of celiac disease are more common in children than adults. Children generally develop symptoms only after they start eating foods that contain gluten. Digestive symptoms of celiac disease may include: bloating diarrhea constipation gas lactose intolerance loose, greasy, bulky, foul-smelling stools nausea or vomiting abdominal pain. Non-digestive symptoms Some people with celiac disease experience symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Problems associated with celiac disease or caused by poor absorption of nutrients include: bone or joint pain iron-deficiency anemia weight loss arthritis fatigue bone loss tingling or numbness in the hands or feet dermatitis herpetiformis (a skin condition characterized by extremely itchy bumps or blisters) depression, irritability, or mood changes delayed start or missed menstrual periods infertility or repeated miscarriages symptoms involving the mouth, such as canker sores liver disease. How long after eating gluten can symptoms start? The reaction and reaction time varies among individuals. Some people will have a reaction within two to three hours of gluten consumption. Others may not feel anything until the next day or a few days after, and some not at all. Common symptoms after exposure to gluten include: nausea vomiting (very severe in some cases) gas/bloating cramps abdominal pain diarrhea constipation tiredness brain fog muscle and joint pain. Diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease Celiac disease should not be self-diagnosed. If you suspect you or your child has celiac disease, see a doctor. Treatment for celiac disease is focused on eliminating gluten from the diet, which should be done in consultation with a doctor. After a person begins eating a gluten-free diet, symptoms typically improve and may go away. However, if a person consumes small amounts of gluten, symptoms may flare up.",1,0.2668167,0.0047101676,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/celiac-disease-diet-avoiding-foods-that-contain-gluten,Celiac disease diet: Avoiding foods that contain gluten,1,"Celiac disease is a chronic digestive and immune disorder in which consuming foods containing gluten triggers an immune reaction that causes gastrointestinal discomfort and, over time, damages the small intestine. If enough damage is done, the intestine may no longer be able to properly absorb nutrients, leading an individual with celiac disease to become nutrient-deficient. This could affect systems throughout the body. For this reason, it's important for people with celiac disease to follow a strict diet that excludes gluten. What is the connection between gluten and celiac disease? Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. In celiac disease, the immune system mistakenly recognizes gluten as ""foreign."" When people with celiac disease eat foods containing gluten, the immune system attacks the gluten when it gets into the small intestine. The attacks damage villi, which are small, fingerlike projections in the small intestine that help the body absorb nutrients from food. As villi become eroded and flattened, they have trouble absorbing nutrients. In the short term, this can lead to diarrhea and other digestive symptoms. Left unchecked, the inability of the small intestine to absorb nutrients can lead to malnutrition, weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, infertility, seizures, and nerve problems. Diet and treatment of celiac disease While there is no ""cure"" for celiac disease, avoiding gluten can prevent recurring symptoms. A gluten-free diet can also relieve celiac disease symptoms and even allow damage to the small intestine to heal. Because avoiding gluten is the only way to prevent symptoms and intestinal damage from celiac disease from returning, people with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet for life. Foods to avoid with celiac disease If you have celiac disease, you should seek the advice of a doctor or a registered dietitian for ways to maintain a balanced diet while avoiding gluten. Many foods can contain gluten — including many you wouldn't expect, like canned soups, sour cream, and cold cuts. That's why a person with celiac disease has to be vigilant about reading labels and asking questions about food ingredients. In general, avoid the following foods if you have celiac disease: Cereals, breads, or other grain products that include wheat, rye, barley, or oats. This includes white or whole-wheat flour (including cookies, crackers, cakes, and most other baked goods), semolina, couscous, bread crumbs, most pastas, and malt. Processed cheese, cheese mixes, low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese, or sour cream. Dairy products such as yogurt or ice cream that contain fillers or additives. Canned soups or soup mixes. Creamed vegetables. Products that contain modified food starch, food starch, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, stabilizers, or fat replacers or substitutes. (Examples of fat replacers include cellulose, gelatin, dextrins, gums, modified dietary fibers, whey protein, microparticulated egg white, and milk protein.) Check the label for these ingredients. Prepared or processed meats. Beer, gin, and whiskey. Flavored coffee, malted milk, or herbal tea with malted barley. What happens if you are celiac and keep eating gluten? Avoiding gluten is not easy. Gluten is common in foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, and cake. Consuming anything containing wheat, barley, or rye, even in small amounts, can trigger a celiac flare-up. Research has shown that the total daily gluten consumption that seems to be safe for most people with celiac ranges from just 10 to 50 milligrams (mg) of gluten; a slice of wheat bread contains 2,000 mg. Individuals with celiac disease should be aware of the risk of cross-contact in their food. Cross-contact is when a gluten-free food or food product is exposed to a gluten-containing ingredient or food — making it unsafe for people with celiac disease to eat. Cross-contact can happen at home, in restaurants, and in other food service locations. Cross-contact can occur when the same appliances or cleaning supplies are used for both gluten-containing and gluten-free foods. Cross-contact can also occur during the growing, processing, and manufacturing processes. Manufacturers can be contacted to ask if they batch-test their product for gluten, if they know how their raw materials were sourced and produced, and what procedures they go through to prevent cross-contact in the factory. What are good foods to eat if you have celiac disease? While the list of foods to avoid on a celiac diet seems long, you can follow a gluten-free diet and still enjoy many healthy foods. When you're shopping, look for products marked ""gluten-free."" If you have celiac disease, focus on foods you can enjoy that do not contain gluten. These include: fruits vegetables meat and poultry fish and seafood dairy beans legumes nuts chia corn flax millet potato quinoa rice soy tapioca wine gluten-free oats. (Oats are naturally gluten-free, but processing increases the risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing grains. Therefore, oats without a gluten-free label are not considered safe for individuals with celiac disease.) What happens if celiac disease is left untreated? It is important to adhere to a gluten-free diet if you have celiac disease. If left untreated, celiac disease can lead to severe malnutrition and can put you at risk of serious consequences, including osteoporosis (thin bones), anemia, infertility, liver disease, neuropathy (damaged nerves), and seizures.",1,0.2442534,0.03338842,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/thyroid-hormone-how-it-affects-your-heart,Thyroid hormone: How it affects your heart,1,"Image: Sciero/Getty Images The thyroid gland, which wraps around the windpipe, releases hormones that have wide-ranging effects on the body. Too little or too much of this crucial hormone can contribute to heart problems. Located at the base your throat, the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland releases hormones that affect every organ in your body—especially your heart. Thyroid hormone influences the force and speed of your heartbeat, your blood pressure, and your cholesterol level. As a result, a malfunctioning thyroid gland can cause problems that masquerade as heart disease or make existing heart disease worse. An estimated 6% of people in the United States have thyroid disease. Most of them—about 80%— have an underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism. When thyroid levels drop, all the systems in the body slow down, triggering a range of symptoms that include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and dry skin. But these symptoms are very common in people as they grow older, including those with normal thyroid levels. More than half of people with normal thyroid function have symptoms of hypothyroidism. In addition, some people over age 60 with low thyroid levels don't have the classic symptoms. That's why recognizing hypothyroidism can be particularly tricky, he adds. Certain factors make people more likely to have thyroid problems. Hypothyroidism: The cardiac connection Hypothyroidism can affect the heart and circulatory system in a number of ways. Insufficient thyroid hormone slows your heart rate. Because it also makes the arteries less elastic, blood pressure rises in order to circulate blood around the body. Elevated cholesterol levels, which contribute to narrowed, hardened arteries, are another possible consequence of low thyroid levels. Another noncardiac symptom—muscle aches—may also be relevant. Muscle aches can be a symptom of hypothyroidism as well as a side effect of cholesterol-lowering statin medications, a condition known as statin-related myalgia. In fact, research suggests that hypothyroidism is more common in people who can't tolerate statins. Sometimes treating hypothyroidism helps relieve statin-related myalgia. Hyperthyroidism: Excess thyroid hormone The opposite problem, hyperthyroidism, or too much thyroid hormone, is far less common, affecting less than 1% of the population. But it, too, can harm the heart. The classic symptoms include sleeplessness, heat intolerance, excess sweating, weight loss, extreme hunger, and loose bowels. Excess thyroid hormone also causes the heart to beat harder and faster and may trigger abnormal heart rhythms. One is atrial fibrillation, a disorganized rhythm in the heart's upper chambers. A related symptom is palpitations, a sudden awareness of your heartbeat. People with hyperthyroidism may also have high blood pressure. In a person with clogged, stiff heart arteries, the combination of a forceful heartbeat and elevated blood pressure may lead to chest pain or angina. Who's at risk for thyroid problems? The following factors affect your odds of having a thyroid problem: The following factors affect your odds of having a thyroid problem: Family history. People whose first-degree relatives (parents or siblings) have an underactive or overactive thyroid face a higher risk of a similar problem. Gender. Women are five to eight times more likely to have thyroid problems than men. Age. The prevalence of hypothyroidism rises with age, especially after age 60. Race. Whites have higher rates of hypothyroidism than Hispanic Americans and African Americans. Health history. Thyroid problems are more likely among people with a personal or family history of certain conditions, including type 1 diabetes, Addison's disease, pernicious anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, premature gray hair, radiation treatments to the head and neck, and vitiligo.",7,0.35084894,-0.021574274,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/get-moving-to-manage-osteoarthritis,Get moving to manage osteoarthritis,1,"The estimated 32 million Americans with osteoarthritis face a dilemma: exercise is often difficult and painful, but it is precisely what they should do to help manage their pain. ""Regular exercise and movement can help people with osteoarthritis in many ways,"" says Dr. Jeffrey Katz, professor of medicine and orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School. ""Besides helping with pain management, it can improve patients' level of function and may delay the need for a joint replacement."" Casing the joints Osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, is a chronic and progressive disease characterized by loss of the cartilage that covers and protects the ends of the bones where they meet at a joint. ""The condition slowly wears away joint cartilage so that forces usually absorbed by the cartilage are transferred to bone, which has pain sensitive nerve fibers,"" says Dr. Katz. ""Cartilage breakdown can also lead to pain, swelling, inflammation and activity limitation."" Osteoarthritis most often occurs in the knees, hips, and lower back. The condition becomes more common with age, but other factors can increase a person's risk, such as a family history of the disease, previous injury, and excess weight. There is no cure for osteoarthritis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), or aspirin, can temporarily soothe pain and inflammation. Steroid injections also may offer short-term relief. Another way to manage symptoms is to get moving. ""Exercise can't help replace lost cartilage or necessarily slow its natural decline,"" says Dr. Katz. ""It has a supporting role — strengthening the bones and surrounding muscles to protect the affected joints from excess stress so they can work better."" Get evaluated If you have osteoarthritis, and are having difficulty initiating an exercise program, Dr. Katz recommends seeing a physical therapist. ""An expert evaluation can help identify alignment issues, weakness, and limitations in joint motion that can make joint pain worse and make movements more difficult,"" he says. ""Physical therapists can also design an individualized exercise program and teach patients how to perform the exercises accurately and safely. Working with a physical therapist also can help people overcome any fear or hesitation about movement increasing their pain."" Preventing the pain of osteoarthritis Not only can exercise keep osteoarthritis from possibly becoming worse, but it may reduce the risk of developing the condition. One study that looked for a connection between running and osteoarthritis risk in the hip or knee found that only 3.5% of people who ran for exercise eventually got knee or hip osteoarthritis, compared with 10% of inactive people. Another study found that among people who had mild knee osteoarthritis or were at higher-than-average risk for the disease, those who walked an average of almost 7,000 steps per day (more than three miles) did not experience additional cartilage loss over two years. Exercising your options A standard exercise program typically includes aerobic exercises and resistance training to increase strength in the major muscle groups supporting the joints, like the buttocks, thighs, and the muscles in the lower back. You might use weights, exercise bands, body weight, or another means of providing resistance. ""Your program will depend on various factors, including which joints are involved, how severe the pain is, your fitness level, and whether you have other medical conditions,"" says Dr. Katz. Low-impact aerobic activities are also part of an overall exercise strategy, as they help strengthen muscles, improve endurance, and increase your joints' range of motion. Examples include power walking, swimming, using an elliptical trainer, cycling, or riding a stationary bike. ""Your physical therapist can recommend the best low-impact activities to complement your exercise program and how long and often to do them,"" says Dr. Katz.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/screening-advice-thats-not-just-skin-deep,Screening advice that's not just skin deep,1,"After decades of public service campaigns, the message has clearly sunk in: melanoma kills. Awareness about the deadliest skin cancer — which claims 8,000 lives each year — has soared over the past two decades. But now there's a new bulletin to absorb. Contrary to popular wisdom, the vast majority of people don't need to see a dermatologist each year to check for the malignancy. Skin checks every two to three years are sufficient for 80% of us, says Dr. Katherine Brag, a dermatologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Many dermatologists are flooded by calls from ""worried well"" patients who request annual skin exams they don't need, Dr. Brag says. They've paid attention to statistics indicating that melanoma is diagnosed in 200,000 Americans each year, with rates doubling between 1982 and 2011. An estimated one in 40 women will develop melanoma in her lifetime, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. ""Everyone is understandably afraid of melanoma. Even though it represents only a small fraction of diagnosed skin cancers, it accounts for more than 70% of deaths,"" Dr. Brag says. ""It's hugely concerning — and deservedly so. But most people who get a skin check get a perfectly clean bill of health."" Watch for these melanoma signs Most melanoma lesions are found by the patient or a partner, not by a doctor. Staying vigilant is as easy as remembering the alphabet. Look for these features in body moles and see your dermatologist immediately if you notice any. A = Asymmetry or irregular shape. B = Borders that are uneven. C = Colors that vary within the same mole. D = Diameter that's larger than the width of a pencil eraser. E = Evolution or change over time in size, shape, or color. The case against hypervigilance Much research reinforces Dr. Brag's approach. In April 2023, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — which offers science-based recommendations about disease prevention — said there isn't enough evidence to support annual melanoma screenings for people with no symptoms who are at average risk for the disease. The benefits don't clearly outweigh the risks, which include unnecessary — and potentially disfiguring — biopsies, along with higher health care costs, the task force said. Additionally, most cases of melanoma aren't found during skin cancer screenings. More than half are self-detected — usually because they're bleeding — and women spot these cancers more often than men, according to a 2016 study in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. And deaths from melanoma don't drop when clinicians detect the malignancy during routine skin checks, either, according to a 2021 study in JAMA Dermatology. ""Screenings don't necessarily improve outcomes from melanoma itself, and that's the point of a screening,"" Dr. Brag says. Risk-increasing scenarios So who can benefit from a yearly skin exam? About 20% of people, who have any of the following risk factors: Dozens of atypical moles. Most of us have between 10 and 40 common moles, which are small, round, and smooth. Atypical moles tend to be larger, with irregular or blurred borders. If you've got several dozen, a yearly skin check is warranted, since there's a slight chance they can develop into melanoma. Family history of melanoma and atypical moles. If a first-degree relative such as a parent, sibling, or child has had melanoma or many atypical moles, your risk rises. ""When someone tells me her grandfather had melanoma at 89, that's different from telling me her mother had it at 40,"" Dr. Brag says. ""One is a function of age and many years of sun exposure, and the other may be more familial."" Previous skin cancer of any kind. Depending on how long ago you had a skin malignancy, this risk factor may warrant getting skin checks even more frequently, such as every three or six months. Ask your doctor. Genetic mutations or predisposition. People with BRCA gene mutations, a family history of certain inherited cancers, or dysplastic nevus syndrome (an inherited skin condition marked by unusual moles and melanomas) all face higher melanoma odds. Organ transplantation or inflammatory bowel disease. Both of these scenarios can involve taking immune-suppressing drugs that can increase patients' chances of developing skin cancer. History of blistering sunburns. Three sunburns before age 15 substantially increase your melanoma risks. Tanning bed use. Multiple tanning bed sessions—especially before age 20—dramatically increase melanoma risks. Image: © LightFieldStudios/Getty Images",7,-0.145904,0.08506088,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-13-recall-meat-poultry-listeria-contamination.html,Recall issued for 9.9 million pounds of meat and poultry due to listeria contamination,0,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture has recalled nearly 10 million pounds of meat over listeria concerns. The Oklahoma-based food company BrucePac issued the recall after tests found that many of their products were positive for listeria monocytogenes. The items involved in the recall were produced between June and October of this year and shipped to distributors around the U.S. It is believed that more than 9.9 million pounds of ready-to-eat poultry and meat products have been contaminated. The USDA said in a press release: “The problem was discovered after USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) performed routine product testing of finished product containing RTE [ready-to-eat] poultry products produced by BrucePac and confirmed those products positive for Listeria monocytogenes.” Listeria infection is rare, but it can be deadly Food that is contaminated with the listeria monocytogenes bacteria can cause a listeria infection. The CDC reports that listeria is currently the third leading cause of death stemming from foodborne illness in the United States, with 1600 people being infected with the bacteria each year and 260 dying. Some of the symptoms of listeriosis include muscle aches, a stiff neck, confusion, convulsions, loss of balance, headache and fever. Diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disturbances are common, but the infection often extends beyond the GI tract and is particularly risky in the elderly, newborns and pregnant women. It can be treated with antibiotics if caught early. According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service, many shipments of meat and poultry that could have been contaminated have already been distributed to restaurants and institutions, who are being warned not to serve or use those bearing the affected batch numbers. Some of the recalled meats that were used to make ready-to-eat products could already be in some people’s refrigerators or freezers. There have not been any confirmed reports of adverse reactions among those who consumed the products, but it is important to keep in mind that some people who get sick from listeria will recover without ever being tested, and it may take several weeks to link a case to an outbreak. In addition, the symptoms of a listeria infection could take as many as 10 weeks to begin. Boar's Head deli meats also involved in listeria outbreak This outbreak comes on the heels of a similar outbreak connected to Boar's Head deli meat, which has caused 59 hospitalizations and 10 deaths since the CDC began an investigation into the matter in July. The outbreak sickened people in 19 states, and former workers have revealed highly unsanitary conditions in the plant. The Boar’s Head facility implicated in the outbreak was cited 69 times for noncompliance in the year leading up to the incident due to the presence of pools of blood on the floor, bugs, clogged drains and mold. A total of more than 7 million pounds of deli meat and cheese were recalled. The BrucePac meat isn’t the only food consumers need to watch out for; there is also an egg recall alert in effect that was issued by the CDC on September 6 before being upgraded to a Class 1 recall on September 30, designating it as a product that “will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.” The notice came after 65 individuals across 9 states became infected with salmonella linked to eggs, with 24 people requiring hospitalization as a result.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/when-to-worry-about-your-memory,When to worry about your memory,1,"Ever had those ""senior moments""? You misplace your phone (which was just in your hand). You lose your train of thought during a conversation. You forget directions five minutes after being told. You can't remember the day, but then it pops into your head. These memory slips can be embarrassing and stressful, but are they normal mental lapses — or early signs of dementia? ""The brain is like any other part of the body, and over time, it may not function as well,"" says Ana Trueba Yepez, a psychologist with the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""Brain regions involved with memory — like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex — can shrink, which makes it more difficult to multitask, stay focused, and hold on to information."" The good news is that these kinds of memory lapses are not automatic red flags for dementia. ""These episodes can be alarming, but for the most part, they are not something to worry about,"" says Trueba Yepez. Look for warning signs Senior moments may come and go. It's when they become more frequent or severe or if new cognitive issues emerge that they may signal a problem. For example, during conversations, you now have difficulty following conversations. Or you cut off people when they talk or begin discussing something unrelated to the conversation. Another warning sign is when memory lapses begin to interfere with daily life. For instance, you miss scheduled appointments, forget to pay bills, or fail to take regular medication. You may also have difficulty making decisions and forget regular grooming. ""Many times, people are not aware that memory issues have worsened,"" says Trueba Yepez. ""If you suspect any changes, no matter how innocent, it's best to ask family or friends to look for and point out changes in your memory, with examples."" Still, even these changes are not an automatic indicator of dementia. Sometimes, other factors like diet, alcohol use, medication, and mental problems (such as depression and anxiety) affect your memory. ""Many times, these issues show up in other ways besides memory problems, such as eating more unhealthy foods, showing less interest in your favorite activities, and not keeping up with hygiene and personal appearance,"" says Trueba Yepez. Manage your memory with DANCERS Enhance your memory and protect against dementia with DANCERS: D: Disease management. Control your weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. A: Activity. Cardio exercise improves oxygen and blood flow to the brain. N: Nutrition. Poor nutrition leads to poor brain health. Adopt a plant-based diet. C: Cognitive stimulation. The more you engage your brain, the more likely you can retain memory. E: Engagement. Social isolation is linked to lower cognitive function. R: Relaxation. Your brain needs downtime. Do relaxing activities like yoga, meditation, or reading. S: Sleep. Sleep is when your brain cleans out toxins. Get seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Seeking help A primary care doctor is your first point of contact if you, or someone else, suspects a problem. As scary as it may seem to confront changes in memory, there are many benefits to taking a proactive approach, including these: Ruling out other causes. A medical evaluation can help determine if symptoms are related to a condition, like depression, anxiety, or insomnia. Other factors also can affect memory, such as an infection, a new medication, or an unintended interaction between a prescription drug and an over-the-counter product. Addressing the underlying problem may lead to improved memory. Discovering a problem early. Memory issues could be related to a series of tiny strokes that produce only subtle symptoms, such as short episodes of confusion. In these episodes, small arteries in the brain become narrowed or clogged with fatty deposits, decreasing blood flow. ""The brain damage is often so small and subtle that most people don't notice it or shrug it off,"" says Trueba Yepez. It's important to spot this problem as early as possible to prevent it from progressing to a condition called vascular dementia. Certain medications, such as statins and low-dose aspirin, and lifestyle changes may help prevent further cognitive decline. Getting help sooner. If your doctor may refer you for a neuropsychological evaluation to assesses other cognitive skills, such as attention, executive function, and language. If you are diagnosed with early dementia, it's best to catch it sooner than later, so you can begin to manage the condition. Image: © LaylaBird/Getty Images",7,0.17662565,-0.15598683,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-11-remdesivir-treatment-killed-service-members.html,Whistleblower: Remdesivir treatments have killed 601 service members,0,"More than 600 service members died after being treated with the controversial COVID-19 drug remdesivir at a time when it had not been approved by the FDA for treating the virus. This is according to documents from the Department of Defense Joint Trauma System that were released by a military whistleblower , and they note that the military gave the drug “liberally” to service members who were believed to have COVID-19 months ahead of its official FDA approval. The whistleblower, who uses the pseudonym Daniel LeMay to protect his identity, handed the documents over to journalist J.M. Phelps, and they were published in the Gateway Pundit . When the men discussed the contents of the documents, LeMay explained that the “initial trial depicted data manipulation in favor of remdesivir.” After analyzing the data, he determined that a number of the clinical trials did not use a genuine placebo group that was suitable for comparing to the results of those who received remdesivir. “The primary issue is with patient data. If we can’t verify the placebo group … then we can’t determine the actual efficacy of remdesivir,” he noted. The data shows that 941 military service members passed away from March 2020 to March 2024. 63.9% of them, which amounts to 601 individuals, were given remdesivir – even though the DoD should have been aware of the drug’s potential dangers at the time. Remdesivir was originally developed to treat Ebola, but studies found that it was lethal in human patients. For example, an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2019 noted that the drug caused the highest mortality rate of four potential Ebola therapies given to patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 53.1% of those who received it died. That didn't stop Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases from awarding a $6 million grant to researchers at the University of North Carolina to “accelerate the development of a promising new drug (remdesivir) in the fight against deadly coronaviruses.” Then, in February 2020, Gilead was given FDA approval to carry out a series of Phase 3 clinical trials to determine the suitability of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. A month later, the DoD announced it was entering a “cooperative research and development agreement” that would allow them to gain access to the antiviral drug. Phelps pointed out that the FDA has the legal power “to authorize the emergency use of an otherwise unapproved medical product if the Department of Defense … determines that there is a military emergency involving an agent that may cause imminently life-threatening and specific risk to U.S. forces.” Multiple studies show drug is risky and ineffective The documents show that the studies involving the drug pointed to its many dangers. For example, one study published in the journal The Lancet in May 2020 showed that remdesivir was not very effective and that its use was stopped early in China because 12% of patients experienced adverse events. Furthermore, a study from 2021 published in the JAMA Network Open journal involving more than 2,300 veterans who were hospitalized with the virus found that treatment with the drug was “not associated with survival” and that the patients who were given the drug had longer hospital stays and more deaths than those who were not given it. Unfortunately, the documents also revealed that many service members were not told about the risks of the drug , which meant they could not provide informed consent. New Jersey state chair of FormerFedsGroup, Charlene Delfico, told The Defender : “The whistleblower highlights what we’ve been saying all along. This drug is dangerous, and in most cases, fatal. There’s been no transparency or oversight. This should enrage people and make them push for an immediate investigation by Congress.”",6,-0.3560147,0.13849898,False

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-09-genetically-modified-crops-growing-threat-health-environment.html,Genetically modified crops: A growing threat to health and the environment,0,"Bioengineered foods and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are commonly confused with each other, but they have different meanings. ""Bioengineered"" describes food and products that are enhanced with scientific techniques to add particular traits. In contrast, ""GMOs"" involve changing the genetic makeup of animals, plants or microbes in ways that do not occur naturally using methods like genetic engineering. Health risks posed by GM foods Some notable issues related to the consumption of GM foods and products include the following: Allergic reactions Genetic modifications can transfer allergens from one food to another. For instance, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) revealed that soybeans engineered with a Brazil nut gene caused allergic reactions in people who are nut-sensitive. This led to the withdrawal of some products due to this serious risk. Without proper labeling, people with allergies can unknowingly consume these harmful ingredients. New allergens GM food and products might also introduce new allergens. The genetic changes can create novel proteins not previously in the human diet, potentially triggering allergic responses . Despite warnings from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scientists about this risk, mandatory long-term testing for new allergens is not required, leaving many consumers, especially children, at risk of severe allergic reactions. Antibiotic resistance GM foods and products could potentially contribute to antibiotic resistance, making it harder to treat infections. According to the Food Standards Agency , most GM foods contain ""antibiotic resistance markers ,"" which help identify successful genetic modifications. However, introducing these markers into the food supply might render essential antibiotics, like ampicillin, ineffective against bacterial infections. This concern led several European countries, including Britain, to ban certain GM crops for fear of the spread of antibiotic resistance. Despite warnings from scientists, the FDA has continued to allow these markers in GM foods even though public health experts view them as a significant threat. Cancer risk In 1993, the FDA approved the use of genetically engineered recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH ) to boost milk production in cows, assuring consumers of its safety. However, Canada and Europe later banned the treatment due to concerns about animal and human health. Research has shown that dairy from rBGH-treated cows has higher levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone linked to breast, colon and prostate cancers . While the FDA overlooked studies showing that IGF-1 can survive digestion and enter the bloodstream – increasing cancer risk – the American Cancer Society states there is no current evidence linking GMOs to cancer and more long-term research is needed. Immunosuppression A study published in The Lancet by Dr. Arpad Pusztai and Stanley W.B. Ewen, funded by the Scottish government, investigated the effects of GM potatoes containing the biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) on rats. The research found that rats consuming these potatoes experienced negative impacts on their immune function, metabolism and organ development . Although the biotechnology industry criticized Pusztai's work, they haven't provided any studies to disprove his findings. Additionally, 22 leading scientists have supported the validity of animal tests linking GM foods to immuno-suppression. Loss of nutrition Genetic engineering can reduce the nutritional value of food. In 1992, FDA scientists warned that altering foods genetically might lead to ""undesirable changes in nutrient levels."" They highlighted the risk that these changes could go unnoticed without specific testing. Despite these concerns, the FDA chose not to require mandatory testing for nutritional content in GM foods. Toxicity GM foods are unstable by nature. The process of inserting new genes into food is unpredictable, with no way to ensure the added genetic material doesn't create harmful effects. This randomness means that each gene insertion could potentially turn safe food into something toxic . FDA scientists were aware of this risk before setting their policy of no mandatory testing. They warned that genetic engineering could increase known toxins, introduce new ones, or cause foods to absorb more environmental toxins, like heavy metals and pesticides. Despite these warnings, the FDA chose to ignore the potential dangers and didn’t require toxicological testing for GM foods, prioritizing industry interests over food safety. GMOs and their environmental impact GMOs pose several environmental risks , including: Gene transfer outcrossing. There is a risk that genes from GMO crops could spread to wild plants and other crops, potentially creating unintended hybrids that could disrupt ecosystems. Impact on wildlife. Introducing GMOs into the environment can harm insects and other species. For example, dominant GMO species may outcompete and displace native species, upsetting the natural balance. Loss of biodiversity. The use of GM seeds, like Monsanto's Roundup-resistant crops , can lead to reduced plant diversity. These GM seeds are designed to survive glyphosate, a pesticide that kills weeds but spares the crops. While this innovation saves farmers time and money by reducing the need for multiple pesticides, it also forces them to buy new seeds every year due to Monsanto's patent rather than reusing seeds from previous harvests. (Related: GMOs linked to increased pesticide use and loss of biodiversity .) Introduction of GM organisms. Releasing GM animals, organisms or plants into the wild can further threaten biodiversity by allowing new, more dominant species to take over . This could lead to the decline or extinction of native species. Tips to reduce GMO exposure Examine labels. While the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard (NBFDS) mandates labels for many GMO products, certain items, like GM animal products and refined ingredients (such as oils and sugars) are not required to be labeled. Instead of relying solely on these labels, look for the Non-GMO Project Verified seal , which ensures that the product has been certified GMO-free. Go organic. Opt for organic produce as organic farming regulations strictly ban the use of GMOs in animal feeds, crops and seeds. Choosing organic is a reliable way to avoid GMOs in your diet. Cook your meals. Preparing meals at home with organic ingredients allows you to reduce your exposure to GMOs, which are common in processed and restaurant foods. Support local farmers. Shopping at local farmers' markets can help you avoid GMOs, as many small-scale farmers use traditional, non-GMO seeds. However, it is a good idea to ask farmers directly about their farming practices to ensure you're buying GMO-free produce. Limit consumption of processed foods. Processed and ultra-processed foods often contain GMO-derived ingredients, like emulsifiers, oils and sweeteners. To minimize GMO intake, reduce your consumption of these foods which may not disclose their GMO content. Stay informed. Refer to the U.S. Department of Agriculture' s (USDA) bioengineered food list to identify foods that are likely to contain GMOs. This can help you to make informed choices at the grocery store or supermarket. Visit GMO.news for more stories like this.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-a-multivitamin-improve-your-memory-202307242957,Can a multivitamin improve your memory?,1,"We're bombarded with advertisements that tout all sorts of health benefits for vitamins and supplements, including improved memory. A May 2023 study of older adults suggests that a daily multivitamin can do just that — improve your memory enough such that it can function as if you were three years younger. So, should you take that daily multivitamin? Let's take a close look at the study. Who took part in this multivitamin study? This research is part of a larger study examining the effects of a multivitamin and/or cocoa (the main ingredient in chocolate) on cardiovascular and cancer outcomes. A prior sub-study found that a daily multivitamin improved thinking and memory — at least when evaluated with cognitive testing completed by phone. For this study, 3,562 participants were willing and able to perform some tests of thinking and memory on a home computer. Half received a multivitamin; the other half received a placebo. The participants identified as 93% white, 2.5% African American, and 1.4% Hispanic, so the results may not be generalizable. They were also well educated: more than half had completed college. In both groups, the average age was 71. How did the researchers test memory? The investigators evaluated the participants' thinking and memory at baseline and after one, two, and three years. For the memory test, participants were asked to memorize 20 words shown consecutively on a computer screen. Immediately after viewing these words, they had to type in as many words as they could remember (this was the primary measure of memory). Fifteen minutes later, they also typed in all the words they recalled (a secondary measure of memory). Other secondary measures included: a novel object discrimination test (is this object the same or different from one recently shown?) an executive control test (in an array of nine arrows, is the central arrow red or blue?). The participants repeated all of the tests one, two, and three years later. What were the results of this study? The two groups differed in immediate recall at year one: Those who took a placebo went from immediately recalling an average of 7.21 words at baseline to 7.65 words (a difference of 0.43 words) Those who took a daily multivitamin group went from 7.10 words at baseline to 7.81 words (a difference of 0.70 words). This result was statistically significant. Additionally, these small effects held up at years two and three. By year three, the placebo group immediately recalled an average of 8.17 words and the multivitamin group immediately recalled 8.28 words. No differences occurred between the two groups on secondary memory and executive function tests. How can a multivitamin improve memory? The authors note that low levels of vitamins B12 and D have been linked to cognitive decline and dementia. In a subset of participants who had their blood drawn, the levels of these vitamins did rise in the multivitamin group. It seems plausible that a few of the 3,562 participants had low levels of these or other vitamins that are important for thinking and memory. In the placebo group, the few who had vitamin deficiencies would likely show less improvement in memory after their baseline tests, or a small decline. By contrast, those few participants in the multivitamin group with deficiencies would have them corrected by the supplements and, therefore, would perform relatively better. Although this is just speculation, it would explain the small but seemingly real results — results that replicate the researchers' prior study, which used a telephone cognitive test to show thinking and memory benefit from a daily multivitamin. It's also worth noting that practice on memory tasks — the so-called practice effect — could contribute to small improvements shown from baseline to year one and year three. Should you take a multivitamin to improve your memory? The authors admitted that the effect of the multivitamin on immediate memory was small and may not be noticeable. However, they pointed out that this small effect could be important at the level of an entire population. My opinion? You shouldn't bother taking a multivitamin to try to improve your immediate recall of 20 words from 8.17 to 8.28 words. But it is worth speaking with your doctor about whether you could have a vitamin deficiency in B1, B6, B12, D, or any other important vitamins. I see several patients in my clinic every week who have startlingly low levels of vitamin D and B12. Your doctor may want to measure these levels. Or they may suggest simply taking a multivitamin daily. If, after reading this article, you've decided to take a multivitamin, please check with your doctor or pharmacist about which one would be best for you. Make sure that they review any other vitamins, supplements, and medications you take to avoid rare but serious interactions.",7,0.19171323,0.18748544,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-08-hospitals-face-decrease-iv-fluids-supply-hurricane.html,Hurricane Helene shuts down top IV fluid producer as it alerts hospitals of possible 40% decrease in supply,0,"A medical technology company responsible for making IV fluids for most U.S. hospitals, last week announced that it would temporarily close production at its North Cove, North Carolina-based facility because of the damages brought by Hurricane Helene – raising major concern about a potential nationwide shortage of IV fluids supply . Baxter International, the top producer of IV fluid, alerted hospitals to expect its supply to plummet by 40 percent from typical levels, according to Dr. Paul Biddinger, the chief preparedness and continuity officer at Boston's Mass General Brigham Hospital, which uses more than 100,000 liters of IV fluid from Baxter every month. ""The company is working around the clock in close coordination with local, state and federal officials to assess the extent of the damage and implement a plan to bring the plant back online as quickly as possible to help mitigate supply disruption to patients,"" the Deerfield, IL-based Baxter said in a statement. Critical for surgery when a person is unable to eat or drink, IV fluids deliver drugs or water with electrolytes directly into a patient's bloodstream to keep them hydrated. The company also makes specialty fluids, such as peritoneal dialysis fluid, which helps patients with kidney failure filter waste from their blood, as well as irrigation fluids, used during procedures to clean or flush wounds. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said that two other large manufacturers of IV fluids in the U.S. are also working to increase supply. ""[U.S. Food and Drug Administration] FDA's drug shortage office is in touch with Baxter about impacts to products manufactured at the facility and will continue to coordinate with [Federal Emergency Management Agency] FEMA to assist the company with cleanup of the facility,"" the spokesperson said. B. Braun Medical, which accounts for about 23 percent of the IV fluids market, is looking to increase the supply of the ""most critical products"" or ""hospital workhorses,"" such as large-volume bags — 500 milliliters to 2,000 milliliters — of sodium chloride, sterile water and lactated ringers. It is also hiring new employees and hopes to be running 24/7 at two of its facilities in the coming weeks. ICU Medical, another IV fluid supplier, said it's monitoring for potential increases in demand. It has ""already taken necessary steps to increase production to help meet market needs,"" spokesperson Harrison Richards said. Hospitals start conserving supplies, finding other ways to manage patients' needs According to reports, a breached levee was a factor in the flooding of Baxter's plant in Marion, North Carolina, which usually produces 1.5 million bags a day. However, producing as much will be more difficult because of the broken bridges nearby, limiting transport in and out. Baxter said that it would not be able to set a timeline for the resumption of operations at the facility. (Related: Hurricane Helene death toll now over 200 as disaster relief operations continue .) The company shares dipped 2.47 percent that week, edging up 0.63 percent in after-hours trading. Meanwhile, Mass General Brigham is among hospitals that are already implementing measures to make the most of their inventory . It is now urging staff to consider using Gatorade or water in situations where that can fulfill patient hydration needs comparably to an IV drip. ""Patients are still getting IV fluids when they need them,"" said Biddinger. ""We are continuing normal medical services but emphasizing conservation and we are carefully monitoring this incident to determine how long it may last, how long we may need to conserve and making sure we identified all areas of our enterprise where services are affected."" New Jersey-based WJBarnabas Health also said it is taking ""appropriate conservation measures"" across its health system as it assesses the supply affected by Baxter. ""At this time, there is no impact on patient care,"" said Carrie Cristello, a spokesperson for RWJBarnabas. ""We will continue to monitor the situation closely."" In a statement, Oregon Health & Science University Hospital, which was also affected by the Baxter closure, said it is keeping its community informed of any changes that could be needed in patient care, research or education missions. The hospital is also using oral hydration options when possible, as well as evaluating each patient for the discontinuation of continuous IV fluids. Northwestern Medicine in Illinois said its supply chain team is discussing conservation efforts, as well. ""We anticipate this will be a long-term issue,"" said Jenny Nowatzke, a spokesperson. ZeroHedge pointed out how the White House and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris are currently facing a massive backlash of anger and frustration over its response to Hurricane Helene. ""A crisis in hospitals will only exacerbate that dynamic,"" the news outlet added. The death toll from Hurricane Helene has risen to over 200 as millions in the Southeastern states are left in the dark. President Joe Biden's administration continues to assess the damage, especially in the Carolinas, though reports from unnamed sources reveal that ""the real death toll is really over 2,000 people.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-07-pomegranates-timeless-superfruit-with-surprising-health-benefits.html,Pomegranates: The timeless superfruit with surprising health benefits,0,"Pomegranates, an ancient fruit with jewel-like seeds and tangy-sweet juice, has graced not only our tables but also sacred scriptures and timeless literature – think of its role in the rich tapestry of stories from the Bible to Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet."" But beyond their historical significance and culinary delights, pomegranates are emerging as a powerhouse in the realm of health. Recent scientific research, including a groundbreaking study in Advanced Biomedical Research , reveals that these vibrant fruits pack a serious punch when it comes to promoting overall well-being. With a unique blend of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and other beneficial compounds , pomegranates are not just a delicious treat. They may also hold the key to enhancing your health in remarkable ways. Heart health Pomegranates may boost heart health by reducing inflammation and lower blood pressure. The fruit juice is rich in antioxidants and polyphenols, particularly punicalagins. These compounds help relax blood vessels and improve blood flow, which can lead to lower blood pressure and reduced strain on the heart. A review of clinical trials published in Pharmacological Research found that participants who drank pomegranate juice experienced significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure . Additionally, another study in Phytotherapy Research noted that individuals with heart disease who consumed pomegranate juice reported less chest pain and showed improved markers of heart health . Blood sugar control Pomegranates can be beneficial for people with diabetes, but moderation is key due to their natural sugar content. These superfruits are high in potassium and natural sugars. While the sugars can impact blood sugar levels, the antioxidants in pomegranates may help improve glucose control . Some studies published in Antioxidants indicate that moderate consumption of pomegranates can improve fasting blood sugar levels in people with diabetes . However, those with kidney disease should consult their doctor or healthcare provider, as the potassium content may require caution. Skin health Pomegranates may promote healthier skin and protect against premature aging, These superfruits are rich in antioxidants and vitamin C, which help combat oxidative stress and inflammation – key contributors to skin aging. Vitamin C also plays a crucial role in collagen production which is essential in maintaining skin elasticity. Some studies suggest that pomegranate extract can improve skin hydration, elasticity and overall appearance . Additionally, it may protect against ultraviolet-induced damage – helping to prevent skin cancer. Endurance Pomegranate extracts may enhance exercise performance and endurance. The polyphenols in pomegranates, especially nitrate and punicalagins, are vital compounds that can increase nitric oxide production in the body – leading to better blood flow to muscles during exercise. This helps improve endurance and reduces muscle damage. A study published in Nutrients found that trained cyclists who consumed pomegranate extract could exercise longer before feeling exhausted . The extract also appeared to aid in muscle recovery. Additionally, the unique pomegranate extract used in the study was shown to improve blood flow and exercise performance due to its rich polyphenol content. Oral health Pomegranates may contribute to better oral health. The antibacterial properties of pomegranate extracts can help fight harmful bacteria in the mouth – reducing the risk of gum disease and dental plaque formation. A study published in Ancient Science of Life found that pomegranate mouthwash effectively reduced oral bacteria and improved gum health in individuals with gingivitis. Cancer Pomegranates may have protective effects against certain types of cancer. The fruit contains several bioactive compounds, including ellagitannins and flavonoids – compounds that have been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth, reduce inflammation and influence key pathways involved in cancer progression. Preliminary research published in Molecules suggests that pomegranates could help prevent or enhance the treatment of various cancers , including breast, colon, lung, prostate and skin cancers. Studies indicate that compounds in pomegranates may down-regulate genes involved in DNA damage and disrupt pathways that allow cancer cells to thrive. Brain health Pomegranates may improve memory and cognitive function, particularly in older adults. The fruit juice is rich in ellagitannin polyphenols. These antioxidants protect nerve cells from oxidative damage – potentially improving memory and cognitive abilities. A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that middle-aged and older adults who drank eight ounces of pomegranate juice daily for a year performed better on memory tests than those who drank a placebo juice. Animal studies have also shown that pomegranate juice can protect against brain injuries caused by oxidative stress. Digestive health Pomegranates promote digestive health, thanks to their high fiber content and anti-inflammatory properties. The dietary fiber of this ancient fruit helps regulate digestion, while the antioxidants reduce inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. A study published in Anaerobe showed that mice consuming pomegranate extract developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at a significantly lower rate than those that didn't. This suggests that pomegranates could have a protective effect on gut health . Weight management Pomegranates may assist in weight management and fat reduction. The fiber content helps promote a feeling of fullness, while the antioxidants enhance metabolic processes and fat breakdown. Some studies published in Food Science & Nutrition suggest that the polyphenols in pomegranates can influence fat metabolism and reduce body fat percentage – making it a beneficial addition to weight loss diets. Urinary health Pomegranates may help support urinary health, particularly concerning kidney stones. While some studies suggest that pomegranate juice can help prevent the formation of kidney stones, experts at the National Kidney Foundation warn that evidence is mixed and the exact mechanisms remain unclear . Animal studies published in Urolithiasis indicate that pomegranate juice may contribute to urinary health, but further research is needed to fully understand its effects on kidney stone formation in humans.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-to-eat-when-you-have-chronic-heartburn,What to eat when you have chronic heartburn,1,"Avoid spicy foods, and keep some dazzle in your diet with low-fat sauces and fresh herbs. The fiery feeling of heartburn is the last way you want to remember a great meal. But when your doctor says you have chronic heartburn caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (see ""What is GERD?""), you may worry that a bland and disappointing menu is in your future. But the foods that trigger your heartburn may or may not be on the usual lists. That's why keeping a journal to determine which foods cause symptoms helps. Common culprits Some foods and ingredients may intensify heartburn, such as spicy foods, citrus, tomato sauces, and vinegar. Fatty and fried foods linger longer in the stomach, making it more likely that stomach acid leaks back up into the esophagus. Other common heartburn triggers include chocolate, caffeine, onions, peppermint, carbonated drinks, and alcohol. What's for dinner? You can still enjoy lean meats, fish, poultry, vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains. The trick is making them flavorful. If spices bother you, try using only small amounts, and be mindful of blends that contain cayenne or chili powder. Or use fresh herbs instead. Fresh herbs are less concentrated and may be less irritating. Instead use fresh parsley, oregano, and basil. Another tip: roast your food. This makes vegetables sweeter. The natural sugars come out and caramelize. Carrots, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, squash, and Brussels sprouts work well. Broiling, saut'ing, or grilling food also brings out intense flavor. Eat vegetables raw. Tomato sauce may bother you, but a fresh tomato may not. Use sauces but cut the fat. Blend low-fat yogurt with cucumber and basil, or saut' mushrooms in a little olive oil. Or make a pesto. Blend basil, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and a dash of olive oil or water. Use a tablespoon of it on food. Breakfast and lunch Avoid fatty meats like ham or bacon. Oatmeal is a great option. Throw in bananas, raisins, and maybe a hint of cinnamon. Other possibilities: low-fat yogurt with fruit or nuts, any kind of eggs, whole-grain toast, or a side of chilled whole grains like quinoa mixed with fruit or topped with a dollop of yogurt. For lunch, think salads with protein such as chicken or beans. But maybe use a yogurt-based dressing, to avoid vinegar and citrus. What is GERD? One of the most common causes of heartburn is called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, the tube connecting the mouth and stomach, usually because the ring-like muscles that prevent backflow stop working properly. In addition to heartburn, GERD may cause nausea, a sour taste in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, a sore throat, coughing, and tightness in the chest. Medications to treat GERD reduce stomach acid. Antacid pills and liquids have been around the longest. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole (Prilosec) or lansoprazole (Prevacid), and H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) or famotidine (Pepcid), are available over the counter. Don't fool yourself into thinking medication allows you to frequently eat foods that once caused heartburn. If medication controls your symptoms, then it's probably okay to have a 'trigger' food occasionally. But if you do that too often, the heartburn will return. You can limit and perhaps avoid medication to control GERD symptoms by losing weight if necessary, eating smaller meals and avoiding food triggers (see accompanying article).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heartburn-vs-heart-attack,Heartburn vs. heart attack,1,"The symptoms of these two health problems may overlap — and sometimes, so do the treatments. During your regular after-dinner walk around the neighborhood, you feel a painful sensation in the center of your chest. Could it be your heartburn flaring up again, or something more serious? Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), often called acid reflux. Acid from the stomach bubbles up into the esophagus, causing a painful burning just behind the breastbone. Not surprisingly, it's often mistaken for a heart attack. In fact, of the over eight million emergency room visits for chest pain each year, severe heartburn accounts for over half the cases in which actual heart problems are ruled out. Chest pain caused by insufficient blood flow to the heart (angina) or a heart attack is often described as a feeling of tightness, constriction, or pressure, rather than a burning sensation (see ""Heartburn or heart attack?""). But it's not always easy to tell the difference. ""Chest discomfort brought on by exercise is more likely to be a heart-related problem,"" says Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, cardiovascular specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. But you can also have angina that's not related to physical activity, she notes. If you have any symptoms you're not sure about, see a doctor. And call 911 if you feel chest tightness, have trouble breathing, break into a sweat, turn pale, or become very weak. GERD and heart disease are both common, and many people take medications to prevent or treat both conditions. Heartburn or heart attack? The symptoms of heartburn may mimic those of angina or a heart attack (or vice versa). If you're uncertain, don't hesitate to get to an emergency room for an evaluation as soon as possible. COMMON SYMPTOMS Angina or heart attack Tightness, pressure, squeezing, stabbing, or dull pain, most often in the center of the chest Pain that spreads to the shoulders, neck, or arms Irregular or rapid heartbeat Cold sweat or clammy skin Lightheadedness, weakness, or dizziness Shortness of breath Nausea, indigestion, and sometimes vomiting The appearance of symptoms with physical exertion or extreme stress Heartburn (GERD) Burning chest pain that begins at the breastbone Pain that moves up toward your throat but doesn't typically radiate to your shoulders, neck, or arms Sensation that food is coming back into your mouth Bitter or acidic taste at the back of your throat Pain that worsens when you lie down or bend over The appearance of symptoms after a large or spicy meal Avoiding clots Many people take daily, low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks, which works by discouraging the formation of blood clots. Doctors prescribe clopidogrel (a more potent clot-preventing drug) with aspirin, mainly for people who receive stents, the tiny metal mesh tubes placed in clogged blood vessels to improve blood flow. But there's a downside. ""Aspirin can increase the risk of bleeding from the stomach and the intestines, both by directly irritating the stomach lining and by making existing areas of irritation more prone to bleeding,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. Taking clopidogrel with aspirin can further increase that risk. Preventing bleeding People with heartburn often take proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). They include over-the-counter drugs such as omeprazole (Prilosec) and prescription drugs such as pantoprazole (Protonix). These drugs reduce the release of acid from the stomach lining. In addition to causing heartburn, excess stomach acid can also cause bleeding sores (ulcers) in the stomach; these, too, are treated with PPIs, among other drugs. Thanks to these stomach-protecting effects, doctors sometimes prescribe PPIs for people who take drugs that increase the risk of bleeding — even if they don't have heartburn. ""I usually recommend PPIs for people who are taking long-term aspirin or clopidogrel if they have ever had a bleeding stomach ulcer or are at high risk of developing one,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. Factors that can boost your odds include an infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria and routine use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Motrin, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox, others). Clopidogrel concern? Some research suggests a possible problem with taking both a PPI and clopidogrel. Two popular PPIs, omeprazole and esomeprazole (Nexium), inhibit a liver enzyme that helps convert clopidogrel to its active form. In theory, this could make clopidogrel less effective for heart attacks and stroke prevention. But large clinical studies have not revealed any meaningful differences. Still, anyone with lingering concerns about a possible interaction could take a different PPI, such as pantoprazole, which does not affect the liver enzyme.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-03-health-authorities-concealed-vaccine-role-measles-maine.html,DECEPTION: Health authorities in Maine hid the fact that MMR vaccines caused lone case of MEASLES in the state,0,"Health authorities in the state of Maine reportedly deceived residents by hiding the fact that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine caused last year's lone measles case there . Documents released by the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) on Sept. 24 revealed this deception. According to the trove, the Maine Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) reported a single case of measles in May of last year. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services (Maine HHS) warned on May 5, 2023 that the Maine CDC had been notified of a positive measles test — ostensibly the state's first measles case since 2019. The infected child was tested for measles, with mainstream media (MSM) quickly jumping on the development and running stories on the case. MSM outlets went to work by blaming vaccine hesitancy, with fake news network CNN blaming low vaccination rates for ""recent measles outbreaks."" Meanwhile, USA Today stressed that the best way to prevent measles is for children and babies as young as 12 months to get the MMR injection. Almost two weeks after the testing, the Maine CDC announced on May 16, 2023 that the child didn't have an infectious strain of measles. But the announcement failed to state that the child's rash was vaccine related . The Maine HHS said the child ""received a dose of measles vaccines"" and that officials at the Maine CDC were ""considering the child to be infectious out of an abundance of caution."" The child's May 3, 2023 test results, which ICAN also obtained following a Freedom of Information Act request, revealed that the measles strain was ""consistent with vaccine strain"" – meaning the vaccine caused the child's rash symptoms. According to the World Health Organization , roughly two percent of people injected with the measles vaccines develop a rash. However, the Maine CDC did not disclose this information. (Related: Measles vaccines kill more children than the measles… and it's not even close .) Government at it again with fear-mongering Children's Health Defense (CHD) General Counsel Kim Mack Rosenberg told the Defender that measles ""outbreaks"" are a well-worn tactic of state and federal government agencies to churn up fears about people who choose not to vaccinate or who do so selectively. ""We have seen measles used this way over and over. Here, the narrative backfired and Maine officials swept under the rug the fact that the child's measles strain was vaccine-related,"" she said. ""Their fear is that such information would lead to more vaccine hesitancy. However, obfuscating information in this way deprives the public of crucial information about vaccine safety and effectiveness."" According to Mack Rosenberg, MSM news outlets ""immediately"" jumped on ""the fearmongering bandwagon"" before the strain type was identified. ""Yet when the true nature of this child's exposure was revealed, ranks were closed to prevent the truth from getting out,"" she continued. ""Fearmongering is formulaic: Danger, solution and vilify those who do not conform,"" said CHD Senior Scientist Karl Jablonowski. According to him, it was ""reckless fear-mongering"" to identify one case of measles in a vaccinated child and then issue a press release saying that anyone who isn't immunized against measles, or doesn’t know their immunization status, should get vaccinated. Pediatrician Dr. Liz Mumper earlier remarked that it doesn't make sense to assume the unvaccinated are to blame. According to the Defender , media reports sometimes blame the unvaccinated for recent outbreaks. ""Measles can be deadly if a child does not have access to safe water and medical care. In developed countries, fatalities from measles are very rare,"" she said. Visit MeaslesNews.com for similar stories.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-gut-healthier-aging,"Healthy gut, healthier aging",1,"Support beneficial microbes in the gastrointestinal tract with these healthy lifestyle habits. Trillions of microbes — bacteria, viruses, fungi — call your gut home. They do more than just help you digest food. They fight harmful pathogens; make vitamin K and other important chemicals; affect the way medications work; and may influence your immune system, heart health, and cancer risk. It also appears gut microbes may play a role in healthy aging and longevity. The genes of all your gut microbes are collectively called the gut microbiome. Encouraging findings In a study published online Feb. 18, 2021, by Nature Metabolism, scientists observed that older adults whose mix of gut microbes changed the most over time lived longer than those people with less change in their gut microbiome. The study didn't prove that an eclectic microbiome directly caused people to live longer. However, such a microbiome was also associated with lower cholesterol levels, faster walking speeds, and higher levels of beneficial blood chemicals — all factors that lengthen the life span. How do you make your gut microbiome more diverse and achieve health benefits? It mainly comes down to lifestyle factors. Indeed, one of the reasons that a healthy lifestyle may protect your health is through the impact of your lifestyle on your microbiome. Eat a healthy diet Eating the right foods is one of the best ways. Your gut microbes like to eat, too, and their favorite foods are the ones that are healthiest for us: fruits, vegetables (especially dark, leafy greens), legumes (beans, peas), and whole grains (quinoa, whole wheat, brown rice). ""Those foods contain fiber. Our bodies don't break down fiber for food; fiber passes through to the gut and microbes feed on it. It gives them a good environment to grow,"" explains April Pawluk, strategic program manager at the Harvard Chan Microbiome in Public Health Center. But when you eat an unhealthy diet with lots of processed, fatty, sugary foods, it makes it harder for helpful microbes to survive. ""In the absence of diversity-promoting nutrients like fiber in our diets, the genes of our gut microbiome can produce chemicals that could increase our risk for developing different diseases,"" Pawluk says. Exercise Exercising appears to promote gut microbiome diversity, but the way it works is a matter of speculation, ­Pawluk says. Several ways are plausible. ""It could be that exercise changes the rate at which material moves through the intestines. Or perhaps exercise reduces inflammation in the gut. Or exercise might alter our appetite, and alter the way that our bodies process the food we eat. All of these could affect the microbiome environment,"" Pawluk says. Get a dog Dogs are always tracking things in from outside — like dirt, grass, and insects — exposing their human families to more microbes. That might help counteract the effect of a modern world on the microbiome. ""Over the past century, there's been a decrease in the diversity of the human microbiome, possibly because of sanitation and modern medicine,"" Pawluk says. ""Studies looking at young children growing up in a house with a pet show their microbiome becomes more diverse and they have less risk of allergies. We don't know if this helps older adults, but it wouldn't hurt."" Don't smoke Cigarettes contain lots of chemicals and toxins that are harmful to the whole body, including your gut and its residents. ""Smoking can kill some microbes and decrease microbe diversity. Smoking also puts physical stress on the body, including microbes. And when microbes are under stress, they change their function; they sense that they're in a bad situation and in some cases attack each other — or us. That can cause imbalance in the gut microbiome,"" Pawluk says. Consider probiotics One last suggestion that may affect the gut microbiome is to ingest colonies of ""good"" bacteria known as probiotics, which come in pills or powders or occur naturally in fermented foods (such as yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut). ""The intention is to boost the amount of beneficial bacteria in the gut,"" Pawluk says. ""If you've recently taken antibiotics, which kill both harmful and beneficial bacteria, probiotics may help re-establish a diverse microbiome. The thing is, if you already have a diverse gut microbiome, adding more of one species probably isn't going to promote any significant change."" But Pawluk says there's no evidence probiotics are harmful, especially when they come from food. And there are many reasons why you might want to eat healthy probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, which has lots of calcium, or try any of the lifestyle habits we've laid out here. They all benefit health in numerous ways. Image: © wmaster890/Getty Images",1,0.33747053,0.1687858,False

When registering to become an organ donor at the DMV, well-meaning people are told that they are ""giving the gift of life,"" but Dr. Klessig says this is a complete misnomer based on what she knows about how the process really works. ""When you go to sign up to be an organ donor, you go to the Department of Motor Vehicles and you see the brightly-colored signs saying 'give the gift of life,' you're not offered a consent form,"" she explains in the video below. ""You're never told that when you become a brain-dead organ donor, you are not biologically dead. These people have a beating heart. Their lungs are working. Their digestive system works.

Braindead doesn't mean dead Because of how the word sounds, braindead can make it seem like a person is pretty much already dead and ready for their organs to be harvested and given to someone else in need. The truth, though, is that being braindead does not mean that a person is actually dead. ""People who have been declared braindead have delivered healthy babies,"" Dr. Klessig says. ""These people are in no way dead."" In recent weeks, there have been two such cases of organ donors who were declared braindead before their organs were extracted for transplant. Both individuals may have been able to recover were it not for being taken advantage of, it appears, by the organ transplant industry. A 19-year-old athlete named Terrance Howard was declared braindead following a serious motor vehicle accident that left him with a terrible brain injury. Howard's parents have what Dr. Klessig describes as ""shocking and horrible"" video footage that they shared to social media begging medical professionals to help their son get better, but to no avail. The other case involves 23-year-old Jamaican business student Amber Ebanks who, following her braindead diagnosis, was neglected and left to die of starvation. Ebanks suffered some kind of injury that prompted her to drive herself to Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, only to 10 days later end up actually dead with her organs harvested by the hospital. ""She had a beating heart. She had lungs that were working. She looked like every other patient in the hospital that was getting better. And her family fought for her. They wanted care for her, but they were pressured almost every other day – doctors wanted to remove her life support."" ""The organ procurement team actually showed up the very first day after her procedure, even before she was declared braindead – you know, being interested in seeing her become an organ donor, which her family refused.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-01-american-dental-association-pledges-push-fluoridated-water.html,"American Dental Association DOUBLES DOWN, pledges to push fluoridated water despite courts revealing fluoride causes brain damage to children",0,"A landmark federal court ruling recently determined that fluoride levels in U.S. drinking water pose unnecessary risks to children's IQ and cognitive development, validating what conspiracy theorists have warned about for decades. Generations of people have been poisoned through the water supply without their consent. This toxic byproduct – hexafluorosilicic acid – has been dripped into most municipal water supplies for decades. The institutions that thought they knew what was best for everyone’s dental health have instead dumbed down entire generations of people, harming their IQ and cognitive development. This widespread dumbing down of human populations helps explain the lack of critical thinking skills in the 21st century. None of these serious matters of public health seem important to institutions like the American Dental Association , however. In fact, the ADA immediately issued a statement, doubling down and defending water fluoridation. Biased and stubborn American Dental Association defends fluoridated water Some institutions, like the American Dental Association, are pushing back against the science and dismissing this federal court ruling, demanding that fluoride be considered safe for everyone , against all available evidence. The ADA, representing some 159,000 dentists across the country, posits itself as “the premier source of oral health information.” The ADA claims that they have “promoted the art and science of dentistry since 1859” while advocating for the public’s health. But the ADA aren’t thinking about the big picture with fluoride and how it is destroying the cognitive abilities of those exposed on a daily basis. Immediately after the court’s ruling, the ADA hastily wrote: The American Dental Association (ADA) remains staunchly in support of community water fluoridation at optimal levels to help prevent tooth decay. The district court ruling against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides no scientific basis for the ADA to change its endorsement of community water fluoridation as safe and beneficial to oral health. The ADA called the ruling and the barrage of social media posts that followed “pseudo-scientific information.” The ADA claims that social media users are spreading information that “is not always based on research conducted according to impartial and evidence based scientific methodology.” The ADA contends that “conclusions drawn from research are not always scientifically justifiable or without bias.” One might point out that the ADA is drawing their own biased conclusions from research that was validated in court. By ignoring the latest evidence on fluoride’s damage to children’s brains , the ADA might be guilty of spreading “pseudo-scientific information.” Will the court’s decision reduce water fluoridation practices across the U.S.? The ADA wrote that the District Court Judge did “not conclude with certainty that fluoridated water is injurious to public health.” However, the ruling does require the EPA to take regulatory actions to protect future children and populations from this toxic byproduct. The EPA and CDC’s current recommendation of .7 parts per million fluoride in drinking water is now outdated and not consistent with the latest science. The ADA fails to acknowledge this reality and is therefore acting against the best interest of communities that want to protect future generations. The court’s recent decision should effectively undo the longstanding fluoride recommendations of the Environmental Protections Agency (EPA), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). These corrupt agencies contend that fluoridated water is “one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.” The CDC has historically recommended, and currently recommends, fluoride at a level that was found to be damaging to children’s brains. Public water systems have added fluoride to drinking water for more than 75 years. This was done in the name of “preventing tooth decay” although tooth decay still remains a serious health issue. This is because the ADA is too busy poisoning children's brains instead of working to eliminate added sugars from food. The real question is: Will municipal water systems across the nation begin to phase out fluoride use , in the face of opposition from American institutions that have misled the public for decades?

Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ), who recently introduced bill H.R. 9828, which will amend the Public Health Service Act, and finally put an end to the vaccine industry’s “get out of jail free” pass that’s allowed them to literally get away with murder by vaccine violence for decades. Vaccine manufacturers have had a liability shield since 1986, when the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was put in place, so nobody could sue these bioweapon-making scientists for injuries and deaths caused by their medical WMDs. Then, that vaccine injury non-liability luxury was even more solidified in 2005 with the PREP Act , that granted Big Pharma absolute immunity from lawsuits for products that were declared for use for “ public health emergencies ,” which could be anything the government or pharma claims fits the bill, just like with the scamdemic of Covid-19. Big Pharma & Big Gov can declare anything an “emergency” and nobody can sue the vaccine manufacturers for mass-injecting the populace with deadly mRNA prions Although vaccines don’t provide immunity to diseases like they are supposed to, vaccine manufacturers enjoy their own type of immunity to lawsuits for making deadly jabs that injure, maim, blind and kill people , including children, babies and fetuses. If everything was on the “up and up,” there would have been billions of dollars awarded to the victims of vaccine violence over the past 4 decades, and the vaccine industrial complex would most likely be bankrupt and out of business, and the manufacturers and propagators in prison for life. But that’s just not what happens in America where Western Medicine is an insidious cash cow that just keeps on steamrolling the health of Americans without any repercussions. In fact, of the 14,000 vaccine injury claims made just since the rollout of the deadly mRNA Covid-19 “emergency use” only jabs, only 16 people were compensated . That’s 0.0011 percent. The rest are still “pending review” or deemed “ineligible for compensation” due to red tape, bureaucratic semantics, or outright injustice served up by the Vaccine Czars in charge of the decision making. Mind you, nobody can take these crooks and criminals to court. No judges. No juries. Just the pharma cabal deciding if you deserve any compensation for the vaccine-induced spike-protein genocide still underway. New legislation HR 9828 would strip away the injury immunity the vaccine industrial complex and pharma cabal of crooks and criminals enjoy right now Rep. Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ) says, “ My legislation strips away current immunity provisions unfairly shielding Big Pharma from the harms caused by their products and allows those injured by vaccines to pursue a civil lawsuit in state or federal court. Big Pharma doesn’t deserve a get-out-of-jail-free card for injuries caused by their harmful vaccines.” Two programs, the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) enable the vaccine-injured , and families of the vaccine-murdered, to file for compensation, but currently, the “standard of proof” that the injury came from the jabs is so ridiculous that hardly a soul can squeeze out a dime from the trillion-dollar pharma cartel. Rep. Paul A. Gosar goes on to explain the atrocities in further detail, stating “Although federal bureaucrats and Big Pharma insist that vaccines are safe, there is an unfortunate lack of science regarding the safety of vaccines. For example, a review of 12,000 scientific papers by the Institute of Medicine published in 2012 found that 98 percent of injuries studied were either caused by, or may have been caused by, a vaccine.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-10-01-scientists-uncover-pfizer-hot-lots-injured-specific-populations.html,Scientists uncover Pfizer “Hot Lots” that injured specific population groups at higher rates,0,"A new peer-reviewed study by scientists from Children’s Health Defense , in cooperation with researchers from Denmark and the Czech Republic, has revealed significant disparities in adverse event rates associated with specific batches of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Published in Science, Public Health Policy and the Law , the research highlights serious concerns about vaccine manufacturing practices, including the lack of inspection for finished vials and the absence of quality control checks for product preservation and storage. Scientists from CHD, including Brian Hooker, Ph.D., chief scientific officer, and Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., senior research scientist, led the research. Analysis of 156 vaccine lots finds higher rate of vaccine injury among certain lots The study analyzed 156 different vaccine lots distributed from December 2020 to April 2022. The researchers tracked where the vaccine was manufactured and where it was distributed, and traced the lots to vaccine injuries reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). The data was not readily available and had to be obtained via Freedom of Information Act request, which was acquired by the Informed Consent Action Network . The analysis uncovered that early batches, particularly those sent to hospitals and government agencies, had higher rates of serious adverse events (SAEs). Of the 977,542 adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), 455,820 (46.7%) were linked to the Pfizer vaccine. While only 29% of these reports included lot numbers, researchers were able to match 290,835 serious events to specific batches. The analysis categorized the adverse events in three categories: non-serious, serious, and those that involved death. A non-serious adverse event includes mild allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching), temporary discomfort or pain at the injection site, mild fever or headache, and fatigue or malaise. A non-serious adverse event indicates that unnecessary harm has been done to the individual’s body, but the issue resolved or wasn’t life threatening. In the analysis, a total of 78% of the SAEs were non-serious. A serious adverse event includes hospitalization, life-threatening situations, or disabilities. These typically include conditions like anaphylaxis, thrombosis, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, severe respiratory distress, seizures, stroke and myocarditis, to name a few. In the analysis, 20% of all adverse events were serious, and 2% involved the death of the recipient. Researchers condemn the manufacturing process and lack of quality control for mRNA vaccines The researchers condemned the manufacturing process for the mRNA vaccines, saying it should have never been approved in the first place. The researchers warned that there was “extremely high” variability among vaccine lots, suggesting that there were inadequate manufacturing controls and oversight. The results of the study were corroborated by similar studies from Denmark and the Czech Republic , which also reported higher adverse event rates associated with certain batches, particularly early in the vaccination rollout. The study notes that the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System is not comprehensive, and typically captures less than 1% of adverse events. This means that magnitudes of vaccine injury data were never even recorded. This could be the result of propaganda dominating the medical system and the politicization surrounding the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine. Doctors were told that vaccine injuries are extremely rare and are the result of “antivaxxers” spreading “vaccine misinformation.” Individuals were often pressured not to report a vaccine injury by their doctor. Many patients were shamed into believing that the vaccine injury was caused by something else. In these cases of medical gaslighting, the data goes unreported, as people suffer. Contrary to statistical expectations, states with larger populations did not show higher rates of severe injuries. Instead, states like South Dakota, Tennessee and Kentucky reported disproportionately higher rates. Were certain states politically targeted and provided with a greater quantity of ""hot lots"" and dirty vaccine batches? What kind of contaminants were concentrated in these particular “hot lots?” Was Pfizer intentionally conducting several smaller experiments with various vaccine batches within the the grander experiment of COVID-19 vaccination ? Many questions remain unanswered.

AAP, the largest pediatric organization in the United States, published an article in December last year claiming that laws prohibiting transgender procedures for children with gender dysphoria constitute "" state-sanctioned medical neglect and emotional abuse ."" The article, written by Emily George, Emily C.B. Brown and Rachel Silliman Cohen, claimed that withholding so-called gender-affirming care, including surgeries and hormone treatments, is tantamount to child maltreatment . (Related: Puberty blockers are QUACK medicine backed by nothing… chemical child abuse is now demanded by LGBT pushers conspiring with evil doctors .) However, the coalition of attorneys general argued that the guidelines put forward by the AAP are only based on ""evidence-free standards,"" particularly about the safety and reversibility of puberty blockers. The attorneys general of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the Arizona Legislature, addressed outgoing AAP President Benjamin Hoffman and incoming president Susan Kressley. They warned the AAP of the potential risks of puberty blockers when followed by cross-sex hormone treatments. ""When used to suppress hormones below normal ranges during or before puberty, puberty blockers: (1) may interfere with neurocognitive development; (2) compromise bone density and may negatively affect metabolic health and weight; and (3) block normal pubertal experience and experimentation,"" the coalition wrote. ""And when puberty blocker use is followed directly by cross-sex hormone use, which is often the case, infertility and sterility is a known consequence, at least for those who began puberty blockers in early puberty."" ""Telling parents and children that puberty blockers are 'reversible' at the very least conveys assurance that no permanent harm or change will occur,"" continued the letter. ""But that claim cannot be made in the face of the unstudied and 'novel' use of puberty blockers."" The AAP has been given until Oct. 18 to respond to the information requests regarding its decision-making process on gender-affirming treatments. Another expert debunks AAP claims that gender-affirming care ""does not cause harm"" Kathleen McDeavitt, an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, also debunked the claims of AAP. In January, McDeavitt published an article pointing out that assertions suggesting gender-affirming care ""does not cause harm"" and ""decreases many negative health outcomes, including rates of depression,"" are not backed by ""relevant citations."" ""Although youth GAC has the support of the professional medical community in the United States, that does not mean there is no risk of harm,"" McDeavitt wrote in response to the AAP claims. ""Systematic reviews have found the quality of evidence in this field is low, meaning the literature does not actually show, with any reasonable degree of certainty, that youth GAC decreases rates of negative mental health outcomes."" McDeavitt cited research where hormonal treatments in transgender youth did not significantly improve depression outcomes, adding that depression worsened post-treatment in some cases. She also highlighted cases in which participants in gender-affirming care research tragically took their own lives before studies concluded.

(Article by Ben Bartee republished from ArmageddonProse.Substack.com ) Via Yorktown government website (emphasis added): “ Yorktown Supervisor Ed Lachterman ordered the suspension of water fluoridation in the Town today, citing a recent federal court ruling . U.S. District Judge Edward M. Chen ruled on Tuesday that the current standard for water fluoridation in the U.S., set at 0.7 mg/L, presents an “unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.” The decision emphasized the potential risks to vulnerable populations, including children, leading Supervisor Lachterman to take immediate action. “In light of this federal ruling and the long-standing concerns expressed by many Yorktown residents, I have decided to suspend water fluoridation as a precautionary measure,” said Lachterman . “Our priority is the safety and well-being of our community, and we believe it is prudent to pause fluoridation to further assess its potential impacts.” Yorktown will continue to monitor guidance from federal and state agencies and act accordingly to protect public health . Yorktown’s leadership will engage with public health experts to ensure that any future decisions on water treatment practices prioritize the safety and health of all residents, particularly those identified as potentially more vulnerable to fluoridation risks.” As late as August of this year, however — less than two months ago — this same individual, Ed Lachterman, was touting the alleged miracle that is water fluoridation because a boomer dentist who lives in the town told him the CDC thinks it’s a great idea while Councilwoman Susan Siegel smeared all the townspeople who objected as “like the anti-vaccine people.” Read more at: ArmageddonProse.Substack.com",8,-0.23457867,0.0061848015,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-warning-signs-of-early-heart-failure,5 warning signs and symptoms of early heart failure,1,"It's an unfortunate truth that your body slows down in your sixth and seventh decades. Climbing a flight of stairs that you once took two at a time can now feel as daunting as scaling Mount Everest. While some degree of vitality loss can be attributed to natural aging, fatigue and breathlessness may also be signals that your heart is not functioning as well as it should. Causes of heart failure Heart failure occurs when something damages the heart muscle or reduces the heart's ability to pump effectively. Most often, the damage stems from coronary artery disease or heart attack. But faulty heart valves, longstanding high blood pressure, or genetic disease may also be to blame. No matter what the cause, the failing heart can no longer pump well enough to keep up with the body's demand for oxygen-rich blood. Early heart failure symptoms ""There is a general tendency for people to ignore heart failure symptoms and attribute them to just getting older. Therefore, it was very important for us to create an easy way to identify those symptoms,"" says Dr. Mandeep R. Mehra, medical director of the Heart and Vascular Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. FACES of heart failure To help both doctors and patients quickly spot a possible combination of heart failure symptoms, the Heart Failure Society of America developed a handy tool that goes by the acronym FACES. F = Fatigue. When the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the body's energy needs, a general feeling of tiredness or fatigue sets in. A = Activity limitation. People with heart failure are often unable to do their normal activities because they become easily tired and short of breath. C = Congestion. Fluid buildup in the lungs can result in coughing, wheezing, and breathing difficulty. E = Edema or ankle swelling. When the heart doesn't have enough pumping power to force used blood back up from the lower extremities, fluid can collect in the ankles, legs, thighs, and abdomen. Excess fluid can also cause rapid weight gain. S = Shortness of breath. Fluid in the lungs makes it more difficult for carbon dioxide in used blood to be exchanged for fresh oxygen. It may also be harder to breathe when lying down, because gravity allows fluid from below the lungs to travel up the torso. By themselves, these five warning signs do not confirm a diagnosis of heart failure, but they do convey a sense of urgency to seek medical advice, says Dr. Mehra. Heart failure testing In addition to the physical exam, doctors have two other important tools to spot the presence of heart failure. The first is an echocardiogram (often called an echo), which is a simple, noninvasive test that uses ultrasound to create images of your heart while it beats. If the echo shows a lower-than-normal percentage of blood leaving the heart when the left ventricle contracts, there is a strong possibility of heart muscle damage. Other findings that point to heart failure include abnormal thickening and ballooning of the heart wall and malfunctioning heart valves. The next step in identifying early-onset heart failure is to look for biomarkers in the blood, such as B-type natriuretic peptide, which is released when the heart is under stress. ""I call these compounds 'tears from the heart' because they show that the heart is crying for help,"" says Dr. Mehra. Once the initial diagnosis is confirmed, further testing may be needed to figure out what's causing the heart's dysfunction and determine the best treatment approach. Heart failure treatment options Heart failure caused by damage to the heart that has developed over time can't be cured. But it can be treated, often with strategies to improve symptoms. Your doctor will work with you to develop a treatment plan which may include lifestyle changes, medications, devices and surgical procedures, as well as ongoing care. Drugs to avoid when you have heart failure People with heart failure often take multiple medications. However, several commonly used prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, and supplements can interact dangerously to intensify heart failure symptoms. To be on the safe side, make sure all of your medical providers have a complete list of all the medicines you take. Particular compounds to watch out for include these: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This class of widely used painkillers, which includes ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), can worsen heart failure symptoms by causing the body to retain sodium and fluid. Heartburn medicines and cold remedies. These over-the-counter aids often contain high amounts of sodium, which can trigger fluid overload. Herbal remedies. Many so-called natural supplements contain substances such as ephedra, St. John's wort, ginseng, hawthorn, black cohosh, and green tea. All can react badly with several common heart medications.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-30-new-zealand-court-fluoride-drinking-water-toxic.html,New Zealand court rules that even lower-level 0.7 mg/L fluoride in drinking water presents “unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment”,0,"A federal court judge in New Zealand has ruled that water fluoridation at a decreased level of 0.7 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of water is still toxic to people and the environment, creating an ""unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment."" Following a long, drawn-out legal battle, plaintiffs in a case against water fluoridation successfully argued that it simply does not make sense to continue lacing public water supplies with fluoride chemicals. ""Plaintiffs have proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that water fluoridation at the level of 0.7 mg/L – the prescribed optimal level of fluoridation in the United States – presents an 'unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment,'"" the judge ruled in the case. Across New Zealand, most fluoridated water supplies fluoridate at a level of 0.85 mg/L, with some councils fluoridating even higher at the top-end amount of one part per million (1 ppm) of fluoride. (Related: Did you know that fluoride does absolutely nothing to protect teeth from cavities, despite what public health authorities claim?) Drinking fluoridated water lowers one's IQ Drawing from a pool benchmark dose analysis carried out by renowned toxicologist Prof. Philipe Grandjean, who is famous for his work on mercury neurotoxicity, the judge highlighted the fact that drinking fluoridated water causes a child's IQ to drop. ""The pooled benchmark dose analysis concluded that a 1-point drop in IQ of a child is to be expected for each 0.28 mg/L of fluoride in a pregnant mother’s urine,"" the judge explained. ""This is highly concerning, because maternal urinary fluoride levels for pregnant mothers in the United States range from 0.8 mg/L at the median and 1.89 mg/L depending upon the degree of exposure."" ""Not only is there an insufficient margin between the hazard level and these exposure levels, for many, the exposure levels exceed the hazard level of 0.28 mg/L."" Other research confirmed that people who drink fluoridated water show noteworthy levels of fluoride in their urine. In New Zealand's Palmerston North, which is fully fluoridated, test subjects showed levels of fluoride in their urine at 0/82 mg/L. Mothers who drink fluoridated water while pregnant were shown to give birth to children with sustained central nervous system damage that likewise results in lowered IQ and symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and / or depression. Dr. Diana Sarfati, New Zealand's Director-General of Health, now has the option to completely call off all water fluoridation efforts across the country in order to protect the nation's citizens, and especially its children. The question remains: will she do it ? Fluoride Free New Zealand has created a petition that it is urging people to sign calling for an end to all water fluoridation in New Zealand. Be sure to check it out and sign! ""It's a good sign, but it needs to go to the top supreme court to be valid and implemented,"" tweeted someone on social media in response to the news. Others here in the United States shared Fluoride Free NZ's tweet about the court ruling with their own politicians – one this writer saw shared it with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for his consideration – so perhaps they, too, will take similar action. ""They're still poisoning us with the death shots, so they're not going to stop poisoning our water,"" tweeted another with a more skeptical take on the situation. ""All those of us that stood against fluoridation were called all kinds of nasty crap,"" added Counterspin Media NZ to the conversation.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-30-confirmed-vaccine-industry-deliberately-causing-measles-outbreaks.html,CONFIRMED: The vaccine industry is deliberately CAUSING measles outbreaks,0,"The state of Maine reported a measles outbreak in May 2023 that we now know was caused by measles vaccines. The Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) obtained documents showing that the strain in circulation was ""consistent with vaccine strain,"" this according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since the so-called ""outbreak"" was caused by the shots, it is no longer accurate to call what happened an ""outbreak."" Instead, it is another prominent example of vaccine damage gone wild. It all began on May 5, 2023, when the Maine CDC reported that a child had ""tested positive"" for measles. The corporate media immediately began running wild headlines like: • ""Measles can be serious for anyone ..."" – Maine CDC Facebook page • ""In severe cases, measles can cause pneumonia, brain swelling and death – Bangor Daily News • ""The CDC says roughly one to three of every 1,000 children infected with measles die"" – USA Today • ""Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 ... But vaccination rates in the U.S. have dropped in recent years, sparking new outbreaks – CNN • ""Anyone who is not immunized or does not know their measles immunization status should get vaccinated"" – Maine CDC press release As you can see, it was nothing but fearmongering for months on end as the media tried to blame the unvaccinated for the sick children. It turns out, though, that the child who developed a rash had been vaccinated for measles – and it was the shot that caused the child to get sick. (Related: Have you checked out our earlier report showing that measles vaccines are far more dangerous than measles itself?) Lying as an industry The Maine CDC did admit that the child had been vaccinated with one injection of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), but that it was ""considering the child to be infectious out of an abundance of caution."" It then sent a sample from the child to the national CDC for testing where it was determined that the vaccine strain had caused the infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that about two percent of all people who receive a measles injection develop a rash, known as VARI (vaccine-associated rash illness). Scientific research also warns that rashes are a side effect of the shots, and that ""testing should only be considered if exposure to the wild-type (not vaccine-strain) virus is strongly suspected,"" and yet the Maine CDC had testing done anyway. It seems as though the plan all along was to blame the unvaccinated for the ""outbreak"" even though it was obvious from the very beginning that the MMR vaccine triggered the child's rash. Lying about it, though, gives the media another chance to make the unvaccinated look bad in the eyes of the vaccinated. The Maine CDC was quick to send in the child's measles sample for testing, but took its sweet time reporting the results to the public. This was all intentional to obfuscate the truth as much as possible. Thanks to the diligent work if ICAN, all of this is now public information for anyone who cares, though of course there is no undoing the damage already done. It shows once again that the government and the media lie at every turn, especially when a pharmaceutical product is involved. Just prior to the Maine CDC's actions, the national CDC shared a marketing presentation suggesting that the perfect ""recipe"" for manufacturing more demand for vaccines is to create ""concern, anxiety, and worry,"" including by having medical experts and public health authorities ""state concern and alarm (and predict dire outcomes)."" Perhaps this presentation is what caused the Maine CDC to behave as it did in lying about a fake measles outbreak?

Dr. Varma admitted to an undercover reporter that the risk of monkeypox is very low unless you are a homosexual deviant who engages in rampant perversion with other homosexuals.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-a-smart-watch-detect-early-risks-for-certain-heart-problems,Can a smart watch detect early risks for certain heart problems?,1,"Smart watches can do more than just check texts and emails or track your steps and heart rate. Many of the devices measure the electrical activity of your heart, similar to an electrocardiogram (ECG) that you'd get in a doctor's office. Those tests in clinical settings measure electrical activity from different points on your chest and limbs for about 15 seconds. But smart watches measure activity from just one spot (your wrist). Is that enough to detect heart problems? Possibly, suggests an analysis published online Feb. 3, 2023, by the European Heart Journal: Digital Health. Scientists asked 83,000 healthy people (ages 50 to 70) to undergo one-lead, 15-second ECGs that mimicked a smart watch ECG, and then followed their health for up to 11 years. After analyzing the recordings, scientists found that people whose ECGs showed a type of extra heartbeats called premature ventricular contractions were more likely to later develop heart failure; people with another type, called premature atrial contractions, were more likely to develop atrial fibrillation. Smart watches are expected to become increasingly useful in spotting early signs of heart problems. Image: © SergeiKorolko/Getty Images",7,0.14548236,0.03271097,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/harvard-study-ditching-sugary-drinks-tied-to-reduced-diabetes-complications,Harvard study: Ditching sugary drinks tied to reduced diabetes complications,1,"People with diabetes are generally advised to avoid sugary drinks to help control their blood sugar. A Harvard study published online April 19, 2023, by The BMJ shows that avoiding sugary drinks also is linked to dramatically lower risks for cardiovascular disease and early death. Researchers evaluated an average of 18.5 years of health data from more than 15,000 middle-age and older adults with diabetes who reported what they drank. Compared with people who drank coffee, tea, low-fat milk, or water, people who drank sugary drinks — like sugary soda, fruit punch, or lemonade — had much higher health risks: up to 20% higher for early death, 25% higher for developing cardiovascular disease, and 29% higher for cardiovascular-related death. Fortunately, replacing just one daily sugar-sweetened drink with a non-sugary one was tied to as much as an 18% reduced risk of early death and 24% reduced risk of cardiovascular-related death. Even drinking artificially sweetened beverages (like zero-sugar sodas) in lieu of sugary drinks was associated with an 8% lower risk of death from all causes and a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular-related death. This study was observational and therefore can't prove conclusively that avoiding sugary drinks will bring these health benefits in people with diabetes. But it builds on extensive evidence linking sugary drink consumption to chronic disease and early death in people without diabetes, so it's plausible.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-27-court-rules-against-epas-longstanding-water-fluoridation-practices.html,"VICTORY: Court rules against the EPA’s longstanding water fluoridation practices, provides compelling evidence that fluoride damages children’s brains",0,"A landmark federal court ruling has found fluoride levels in U.S. drinking water to pose unnecessary risks to children’s IQ and cognition. The decision, which supports the science-backed claims of the Fluoride Action Network and other health advocacy groups, found that current fluoride levels endorsed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pose an unreasonable risk to children's cognitive development. The court found that fluoride levels of 0.7 mg/L – the level recommended by the EPA – can lead to a significant reduction in children's IQ. Fluoridated water affects approximately 75 percent of Americans . This ruling is compelling because it confirms what ""conspiracy theorists"" have been saying for many years. Populations are being intentionally poisoned without consent. Courts turn on the EPA, rule against water fluoridation The ruling, issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, is a major victory for the next generation of children and adults, who now have the evidence to end fluoridation of water supplies in their respective communities, once and for all. The Fluoride Action Network has long argued that fluoride is harmful to public health, but the chemical has been added to water supplies across the nation, without anyone’s consent. This is akin to drugging people without their knowledge. The court's decision is based on a review of scientific evidence, including a study by the U.S. Government's National Toxicology Program, which identified a clear link between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopmental harm. Specifically, for every 0.28 mg/L increase in fluoride levels in a pregnant mother's urine, the child's IQ was found to decrease by one point. The study also suggests that, even at levels lower than 1.5 mg/L, fluoride exposure can have a negative impact on cognitive development. This court decision contradicts decades of dental associations and governments promoting fluoridated water as safe and beneficial. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has even named community water fluoridation as one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. However, the new ruling suggests that these claims were always exaggerated and unfounded. Ending the chronic disease epidemic starts with water purity Health professionals, researchers and advocacy groups have been raising concerns about the safety of fluoride for years. They argue that fluoride is not only found in drinking water but also in processed foods, dental products and other daily sources. Some companies actually sell water for babies that contains added fluoride. This means that the total exposure to fluoride for many people is much higher than what is considered safe. The International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology (IAOMT) is one of several organizations pressing for widespread changes to water fluoridation practices across the country. “It’s time for the EPA, CDC and other health authorities to stop ignoring the science and start protecting the health of future generations,” said IAOMT President Yuko Torigoe, DMD. “We need transparent regulations based on the latest research, not outdated practices that put our children at risk.” The Academy urges local, state and federal officials to immediately halt fluoridation programs and implement public health policies that align with the latest scientific evidence, including a ban on water fluoridation. This court ruling could lead to increased scrutiny of municipal water supplies and a re-evaluation of the benefits and risks of fluoridated water. The court's ruling is expected to have a significant impact on the debate over water fluoridation for years to come, and sets a new precedent for the removal of fluoride from water sources entirely. Ending the chronic disease epidemic in America starts with ensuring that the water is pure and does not include additives that damage the brains of future generations.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ibd-and-lgbtq-how-it-can-affect-sexual-health-202306282949,IBD and LGBTQ+: How it can affect sexual health,1,"Everyone who lives with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) knows their illness has a major impact on daily life. Many people are diagnosed in their 20s or 30s, a time when we might hope for few health challenges. Medications, and sometimes surgery, may be used to treat IBD. If you identify as LGBTQ+, you might wonder how all of this may affect you — your physical health, of course, but also your sexual health and pleasure. Below are a few things to understand and consider. What is inflammatory bowel disease? IBD is a condition that causes inflammation along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The two main types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis: Crohn's disease: inflammation can occur anywhere along the GI tract (from the mouth to the anus) Ulcerative colitis: typically affects the large intestine (colon) only. IBD can cause diarrhea, bloody stool, weight loss, and abdominal pain, and is typically diagnosed with blood and stool tests, imaging, and colonoscopy. A diagnosis of IBD may increase the risk of developing anxiety or depression, and can also have an impact on sexual health. People with IBD may require long-term medical treatment or surgery for their condition. The starting point: Talking to your doctor Talking to your medical team about IBD and sexual health may not be easy. This may depend on how comfortable you feel disclosing your LGBTQ+ identity with your health care providers. Ideally, you should feel comfortable discussing sexuality with your medical team, including what types of sexual partners and activities you participate in and how IBD may affect this part of your life. Be aware that health care providers may not be able to address all LGBTQ+-specific concerns. Optimal care for people with IBD who identify as LGBTQ+ is not fully understood. However, this is an active area of research. How might medicines for IBD affect sexual health? Many effective IBD medications subdue the immune system to decrease inflammation. These immunosuppressive medicines may raise your risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV, chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhea. What you can do: Discuss these concerns with your doctor so you can take appropriate protective measures. This might include: ensuring that your vaccinations, such as hepatitis B and HPV, are up to date. engaging in sex using barrier protection to prevent STI transmission. taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This safe and effective medicine helps prevent the spread of HIV. Ask your primary care doctor or gastroenterologist if PrEP is appropriate for you. How might surgery for IBD affect sexual health? For some people with IBD, gut inflammation is severe enough to require surgery to remove part of the intestine. For example: Abscesses or fistulas (abnormal connections between two body parts) sometimes form when someone has Crohn's disease around the anus. This may require surgical treatment. Active inflammation in the rectum or anus may make sex painful, particularly for people who engage in anal receptive sex. We don't yet know whether anal receptive sex is safe for people who have had surgery to remove the colon and create a J-pouch, which is formed from small intestine to create an internal pouch that enables normal bowel movements. What you can do: Discuss your concerns with your gastroenterologist and colorectal surgeon. If you engage in anal sex, you may be confused about whether it is safe to do so. While you may feel uncomfortable discussing this concern and others with your doctor, try to be as honest and open as you can. That way, you'll receive the best information on how to engage in safe and enjoyable sex after an IBD diagnosis or surgery. What else to consider if you are transgender People with IBD who are transgender may have additional concerns to address. For example, there may be a risk for sexual side effects from gender-affirming surgery. These procedures may include vaginoplasty (surgical creation of a vagina) for transgender females, or phalloplasty (surgical creation of a penis) for transgender males. The safety of these procedures in people with IBD is not currently well understood. What you can do: If you identify as transgender, ask your doctor if any gender-affirming surgeries you've had or medicines you take, such as hormones, might affect your IBD, recommended treatments, or sexual health. If you're considering gender-affirming surgery, discuss your options with your medical team. Be aware that gender-affirming surgery may be more challenging, or may not be advisable, for people with complex or active IBD. It's important to discuss your specific risks with your doctor when pursuing gender-affirming care. Having access to a team of physicians, including a surgeon and a gastroenterologist, may improve outcomes. The bottom line Try to talk to your gastroenterologist about how your sexual practices and gender identity may affect — and be affected by — your IBD. A conversation like this may feel uncomfortable, but being candid about your symptoms and concerns will help you receive the best possible care. Often, a multidisciplinary approach to care is helpful. Your health care providers, including your gastroenterologist and surgeon, may suggest seeing additional specialists. Much remains unknown about sexual health and practices in LGBTQ+ people with IBD. While more research is needed, open communication on the impact of medications, surgery, and other aspects of living with IBD can do a lot to improve your quality of life.",1,0.23914522,0.06332904,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/how-to-release-a-frozen-shoulder,How to release a frozen shoulder: 5 stretches to use,1,"Frozen shoulder (also called adhesive capsulitis) is a common disorder that causes pain, stiffness, and loss of normal range of motion in the shoulder. The resulting disability can be serious, and the condition tends to get worse with time if it's not treated. It affects mainly people ages 40 to 60 with women affected more often than men. Frozen shoulder symptoms With frozen shoulder, the shoulder feels stiff, painful, and has limited motion in all directions. Symptoms of a frozen shoulder include stiffness that worsens at first, but gradually begins to improve over time dull, aching pain that increases as the disease progresses, and may worsen when you move your arm. A frozen shoulder may take two to nine months to develop. Although the pain may slowly improve, stiffness continues, and range of motion remains limited. Anatomy of a frozen shoulder The shoulder has a wider and more varied range of motion than any other part of the body. It pivots mainly on a ball-and-socket arrangement called the glenohumeral joint, which joins the top of the humerus (upper arm bone) to a scooped-out part of the scapula (shoulder blade) called the glenoid cavity (see the illustration below). The glenohumeral joint helps move the shoulder forward and backward and allows the arm to rotate and extend outward from the body. A flexible capsule filled with a lubricant called synovial fluid protects the joint and helps keep it moving smoothly. The capsule is surrounded by ligaments that connect bones to bones, tendons that fasten muscles to bones, and fluid-filled sacs called bursae that cushion tendons and bones during motion. The band of muscles and tendons that stabilizes the shoulder and controls its movements is called the rotator cuff. This elaborate architecture of soft tissues accounts for the shoulder's marvelous flexibility, but also makes it vulnerable to trauma as well as chronic wear and tear. Normally, the head of the humerus moves smoothly in the glenoid cavity, a depression in the scapula. A shoulder is ""frozen"" when the capsule protecting the glenohumeral joint contracts and stiffens. Scar tissue (adhesions) may also form between the joint capsule and the head of the humerus. Frozen shoulder causes We don't fully understand what causes a frozen shoulder, but an inflammatory process is probably involved. Sometimes freezing occurs because the shoulder has been immobilized for a long time by injury, surgery, or illness. In many cases the cause is obscure. Fortunately, the shoulder can usually be unfrozen, though full recovery takes time — and lots of self-help. The process usually begins with an injury (such as a fracture) or inflammation of the soft tissues, typically due to overuse injuries such as bursitis or tendinitis of the rotator cuff. Inflammation causes pain that is worse with movement and limits the shoulder's range of motion. When the shoulder becomes immobilized in this way, the connective tissue surrounding the glenohumeral joint — the joint capsule — thickens and contracts, losing its normal capacity to stretch. Trying to avoid the pain caused by moving the shoulder leads to further contraction of the capsule. The humerus has less space to move in, and the joint may lose its lubricating synovial fluid. In advanced cases, bands of scar tissue (adhesions) form between the joint capsule and the head of the humerus. Who gets frozen shoulder? The frozen shoulder risk is increased by the following factors: lack of exercise therapy after tendinitis or an injury wearing a sling for more than a few days without intermittent stretching rotator cuff disorders (about 10% of people with these rotator cuff disorders develop frozen shoulder) enforced immobility resulting from a stroke, heart condition, or surgery other conditions such as thyroid disorders or Parkinson's disease Frozen shoulder treatment If you think you have a frozen shoulder or are already developing one, see your clinician or a shoulder expert for a physical exam. To assess your shoulder's range of motion, the clinician will ask you to perform various movements with your arm. These movements may include reaching across your chest to touch the opposite shoulder or down your back to touch the opposite shoulder blade (the Apley scratch test). Your healthcare provider may take x-rays to make sure there's no other underlying problem, such as arthritic changes or a dislocation. An MRI may be ordered to check for a rotator cuff tear. The treatment for a frozen shoulder is focused on relieving pain and restoring the shoulder's normal range of motion. Your clinical will develop your treatment plan. Treatment for frozen shoulder may include the following: anti-inflammatory medication such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, Anaprox) an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables applied to the shoulder for 10 to 15 minutes several times a day can also help with pain corticosteroid injection into the shoulder joint or soft tissues physical therapy is the cornerstone of treatment, especially concentrating first on exercises that stretch the joint capsule, and later, on strengthening exercises. A physical therapist can show you how far to push yourself and can teach you the appropriate exercises. Once you've learned your limitations, you can practice most of your exercises on your own at home. As you work to stretch the shoulder capsule, you should avoid any activities that require overhead reaching, lifting, or anything else that aggravates your pain. If you diligently follow your regimen of frozen shoulder exercises, it's likely that you'll be able to resume your usual level of activity (more than 90% of people improve with these nonsurgical measures). But full recovery from a frozen shoulder takes time — from several months to two or three years. If you don't improve steadily or if you reach a plateau, go back to your clinician or consult a shoulder expert. Rarely, recalcitrant cases require surgery. 5 frozen shoulder exercises Always warm up your shoulder before performing your exercises. The best way to do that is to take a warm shower or bath for 10 to 15 minutes. You can also use a moist heating pad or damp towel heated in the microwave, but it may not be as effective. In performing the following exercises, stretch to the point of tension but not pain. Pendulum stretch (Perform this exercise first.) Relax your shoulders. Stand and lean over slightly, allowing your affected arm to hang down. Swing the arm in a small circle — about a foot in diameter. Perform 10 revolutions in each direction, once a day. As your symptoms improve, increase the diameter of your swing, but never force it. When you're ready for more, increase the stretch by holding a light weight (three to five pounds) in the swinging arm. Towel stretch Grasp a three-foot-long towel with both hands behind your back, and hold it in a horizontal position. Use your good arm to pull the affected arm upward to stretch it. You can also perform an advanced version of this exercise with the towel draped over your good shoulder. Grasp the bottom of the towel with the affected arm and pull it toward the lower back with the unaffected arm. Do this stretch 10 to 20 times a day. Finger walk Face a wall three-quarters of an arm's length away. Reach out and touch the wall at waist level with the fingertips of the affected arm. With your elbow slightly bent, slowly walk your fingers up the wall, spider-like, until you've raised your arm to shoulder level, or as far as you comfortably can. Your fingers should be doing the work, not your shoulder muscles. Slowly lower the arm (with the help of the good arm, if necessary) and repeat. Perform this exercise 10 to 20 times a day. Cross-body reach Sit or stand. Use your good arm to lift your affected arm at the elbow, and bring it up and across your body, exerting gentle pressure to stretch the shoulder. Hold the stretch for 15 to 20 seconds. Do this stretch 10 to 20 times per day. Armpit stretch Using your good arm, lift the affected arm onto a shelf about breast-high. Gently bend your knees, opening up the armpit. Deepen your knee bend slightly, gently stretching the armpit, and then straighten. With each knee bend, stretch a little further, but don't force it. Do this stretch 10 to 20 times each day. Strengthening the rotator cuff After your range of motion improves, you can add rotator cuff–strengthening exercises. Be sure to warm up your shoulder and do your stretching exercises before you perform strengthening Outward rotation Hold a rubber exercise band between your hands with your elbows at a 90-degree angle close to your sides. Rotate the lower part of the affected arm outward two or three inches and hold for five seconds. Repeat 10 to 15 times, once a day. Inward rotation Stand next to a closed door, and hook one end of a rubber exercise band around the doorknob. Grasp the other end with the hand of the affected arm, holding the elbow at a 90-degree angle. Pull the band toward your body two or three inches and hold for five seconds. Repeat 10 to 15 times, once a day.",0,0.11484857,-0.14579049,True

Nurse Angela from CHD joined Lorenze to provide a video update about her condition, which you can watch at CHD.tv . In case you missed it, Lorenze lost her vision and suffered horrific bruising all around her forehead and face after she received the vaccine trio. Lorenze did not want to take the shots, but she had to in order to receive a necessary blood transfusion for a rare autoimmune disorder called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, or PHD. ""The extremely rare condition affects approximately one in a million people, causing the immune system to attack and destroy red blood cells,"" reports explain about Lorenze's autoimmune condition. (Related: Did you know that vaccines have destroyed public health and society in such a way that it can never be reversed [apart from an extinction-level event, perhaps].) UCI Medical forces young lady to take life-destroying jabs in order to receive a blood transfusion Lorenze had traveled all the way across the country from Florida to California to receive the blood transfusion. Doctors at UCI Medical in Orange County where Lorenze went told her that in order to proceed, they needed to first inject her all at once for tetanus, pneumonia and meningitis, otherwise Lorenze would be sent back to Florida without her transfusion. Desperate for relief, Lorenze complied with UCI Medical's demands. Within just 10 minutes of getting injected, however, Lorenze's vision darkened in both of her eyes. Her jaw also locked up and she started vomiting as her body swelled and bruised seemingly inexplicably. Administering multiple vaccine injections at once, especially to someone with serious autoimmune disease, is a recipe for health disaster that UCI Medical should have known not to do. They did it anyway, though. ""While it's usually safe for most people to get these vaccines together, in her case, the immune response could have been too much and led to complications,"" commented Dr. Raj. Dasgupta, chief medical advisor for Fortune Recommends Health. ""To avoid overloading her system, it would be reasonable to space out the vaccines and closely monitor for any worsening symptoms."" Better yet, how about not taking the vaccines at all under any timeframe? The body has an immune system for a reason, and injecting vaccine chemicals into it only damages its ability to fight disease naturally. One silver lining is that Lorenze is said to be doing a lot better than she was. CHD uploaded a video update on Sept. 23, 2024, that shows Lorenze speaking about her improvements: Alexis Lorenze is doing better!

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/how-to-soothe-a-sore-neck,"Neck pain: Symptoms, causes, & how to relieve it",1,"Neck pain is a common condition. Problems in any of the parts of the neck, such as the muscles, nerves, bones (vertebrae), joints, and the discs between the bones, can cause it. When the pain or soreness makes it difficult to move the neck, the condition is usually called a stiff neck. Causes and types of neck pain Most people get neck pain for many of the same reasons they suffer low back pain. ""In the vast majority of people, it's routine muscle aches and pains,"" says Dr. Robert Shmerling, Senior Faculty Editor at Harvard Health Publishing and Corresponding Member of the Faculty of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""The neck has to support that heavy bowling ball on top."" Here are the most common causes and types of neck pain. Muscle pain. Aching or sore neck and shoulder muscles may occur in response to overexertion or prolonged physical or emotional stress. The neck muscles may develop hard knots that are tender to the touch, sometimes called trigger points. Muscle spasm. This is a sudden, powerful tightening of neck muscles. Your neck may hurt and feel tight or knotted, and it may be impossible to turn your head. When you wake up with a painful, stiff neck, that's likely a muscle spasm. Muscle spasm can result from a muscle injury, but it may also occur in response to a spinal disc or nerve problem, or even emotional stress. However, there is often no clear cause. Headache. Neck-related headache is most often felt in the back of the head and upper neck and is usually the result of muscle tension or spasm. Neck-related headache pain is usually dull or aching, rather than sharp; the neck might also feel stiff or tender. Moving your neck makes it worse. Facet joint pain. Often described as deep, sharp, or aching, pain in the facet joints (part of the vertebrae of the neck) typically worsens if you lean your head toward the affected side and may radiate to your shoulder or upper back. Arthritis in the facet joints, as in other locations, may feel worse in the morning or after a period of inactivity. Nerve pain. Irritation or pinching of the roots of the spinal nerves causes pain that may be sharp, fleeting, severe, or accompanied by pins and needles. Depending on the nerve involved, the pain may shoot down the arm or even into the hand. Referred pain. Referred pain is pain in one part of the body that is triggered by a problem in another part of the body. For example, neck pain that worsens with exertion may indicate a heart problem, while neck pain that occurs when you eat may stem from a problem in the esophagus. Bone pain. Pain and tenderness in the cervical vertebrae are far less common than neck pain from the soft tissues. Bone pain needs medical attention because it may signal a more serious health problem. How to relieve neck pain The remedies for neck and low back pain also have some things in common. First, ease the early intense pain with rest, ice, and heat; then move on to gentle stretching and strengthening exercises. Later, avoid bad posture and other habits that could trigger another neck pain crisis. The causes of routine strain-and-sprain neck pain vary. If you wake up with a crick in your neck, it's probably the sharp muscle contractions known as spasms, caused by a muscle strain. A sprain, in contrast, happens in ligaments — the tough tissues that connect bones together. Alternatively, a tendon — the tissue that attaches muscles to bones — may become inflamed, causing tendinitis. Basic self-help takes care of most routine neck pain flare-ups: Use cold to numb the early acute pain and reduce inflammation. Take over-the-counter pain relievers to control mild to moderate pain. These include acetaminophen (Tylenol, generic brands) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), or aspirin. Use a neck collar for short periods to rest the painful muscles and tissues and ease your discomfort. ""Collars have a bad reputation from people overusing them and getting weak muscles, but used a few hours here and there they can be very useful,"" Dr. Shmerling says. Apply heat — either with a heating pad or by using a warm whirlpool bath if one is available — after a day or two, once the acute pain calms down. Should you go to a chiropractor to get your neck ""cracked""? Dr. Shmerling counsels against sudden, strenuous manipulation of the neck. ""It may be fine for low back pain, but I have concerns about its safety for neck pain,"" he says. Stretches and exercises for neck pain Exercises to stretch and strengthen the neck, shoulder, and upper back muscles can speed recovery from a painful neck condition and possibly reduce flare-ups, although the evidence for this is not ironclad. Dr. Shmerling encourages his patients to see a physical therapist for guided therapeutic exercise. Here is what the therapist can offer: Therapy will likely combine isometric and range-of-motion exercises. In isometric exercise, you tighten the neck muscles against an opposing force — such as your own hand, which you ""push against"" with your neck muscles. Range-of-motion stretches attempt to progressively relax and lengthen the neck muscles. Physical therapists can offer other therapies that, while not proven in research trials, seem to offer some people ease and comfort. One option is ultrasound treatment of the sore tissues with high-frequency sound waves. A physical therapist can also perform traction, using the hands or special equipment to gently stretch the neck muscles. You can also get equipment by prescription to perform neck traction at home, but follow the therapist's instructions carefully. How to prevent neck pain To ward off neck pain, it is helpful to take inventory of your posture or daily habits that could trigger neck pain, like sitting for extended periods in positions that strain the neck during reading, TV watching, computer work, or sleeping. Attending to the cause may stop some flare-ups of neck pain at the source. When to see a doctor If neck pain is severe, lasts for weeks or months, drastically limits your ability to move your head, radiates into the shoulders, or feels worse in the morning, consider seeing a doctor. Fever, weakness, or numbness in the arms are other red flags that warrant immediate evaluation. In some cases, an underlying physical problem, such as arthritis, an infection, or a compressed nerve, may be the cause. Depending on the diagnosis, you may need additional treatments or even surgery to relieve the pain and get back to your normal activities. Simple neck stretch [A] Look straight ahead. [B] Tuck your chin in slightly and move your head backward, slowly and smoothly. Be sure to keep your head level; you should be gliding your head backward, not bending or tipping it. Hold for five seconds. Repeat five times.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-26-facebook-trained-cdc-employees-censor-american-public.html,Facebook provided secret online tools and trained CDC employees how to censor the American public,0,"The American First Legal team is currently litigating against Facebook and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for violating the First Amendment and censoring Americans on important topics that drastically affect their lives. The litigation has just exposed onboarding documents that Facebook (Meta) employees used to train CDC employees on how to censor the American public. Facebook employees coordinated with government employees under the Biden regime to block Americans from learning the truth about COVID-19 and the so-called vaccines . Their censorship portal was titled “Covid & Vaccine Misinformation.” The CDC was allowed to censor more than 16 million pieces of content on Facebook and Instagram, citing “vaccine misinformation” as the reason. Biden regime and Facebook’s censorship machinations are a threat to the republic In 2021, the Biden-Harris regime pressured social media companies to eliminate important dialogue and public discourse on various issues related to COVID-19. Only accepted government narratives were allowed online. Facebook caved to the pressure and gave the CDC online tools so the government could control speech online. In fact, the litigation documents reveal that Facebook, under pressure from the administration, implemented a new system of censorship, allowing government officials to efficiently request the removal of Facebook posts. This system streamlined the process, enabling officials to submit multiple links for censorship and providing a way to track compliance through ticket numbers. In the portal, CDC employees chose their “Reason for Reporting” to remove a Facebook user’s post. These reasons included “COVID Misinformation,” “Vaccine Discouragement,” and COVID Vaccine Misinformation.” Access to this portal was restricted to approved personnel, making oversight by outside organizations more difficult. Additionally, Facebook clarified the criteria for content removal in collaboration with the CDC. The documents indicate that Facebook outlined specific types of content it would remove and detailed what information it required from the CDC to justify censoring certain narratives while adhering to its community standards. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly acknowledged that Facebook caved to government pressure. American First Legal Executive Director Gene Hamilton wrote about the latest findings: These documents show–definitively–the architecture behind the systems that political appointees and governmental bureaucrats used to unconstitutionally censor the free speech of Americans online. The right to speak–to even question authority–is so fundamental to our national identity, yet in the name of a public health crisis, Biden Administration officials worked with major companies to silence dissent. The American people need to review these documents and understand just how far our leaders in Washington went to violate the First Amendment to our Constitution. CDC removed vaccine truth from Facebook, brainwashing the public and harming countless lives The CDC removed Facebook posts dissenting about social distancing, face masks and testing. All of these devices of control turned out to exacerbate disease theater that not only caused further hysteria, but also damaged the social fabric of society. When the disastrous COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out, the CDC targeted information on spike protein shedding from the vaccines and disregarded the negative effects shedding had on women’s menstrual cycles, ovulation and miscarriage risk. The CDC censored common adverse events from the vaccine and ignored the fatalities from the shot, disregarding all evidence suggesting the vaccine was a depopulation weapon. In fact, any information that “discouraged” vaccine uptake was targeted and removed. These coercive actions had a chilling effect on the informed consent principle and led to widespread violations of body autonomy rights and medical ethics throughout society. Updates to Facebook’s community standards were quick to punish repeat offenders who spread so-called misinformation. People who made repeated “false claims about masks” for example, or who discouraged “social distancing” had their account’s reach reduced or removed altogether. “Pages Groups, profiles, and Instagram accounts that repeatedly post misinformation or coordinated harm (see Coordinating Harm policies at the top of this entry) related to COVID-19, vaccines, and health may face restrictions, including (but not limited to) reduced distribution, removal from recommendations, or removal from our site.” The Biden regime made censorship easy, and Facebook caved to the pressure, providing them unlimited power to restrict free speech and stifle the truth on matters that affect the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans. The federal agents who participated in this censorship scheme harmed countless lives with their vaccine propaganda and controlling narratives.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/takotsubo-cardiomyopathy-broken-heart-syndrome,Broken-heart syndrome (takotsubo cardiomyopathy),1,"Years of gender-based research have shown that in matters of the heart, sex differences abound. One striking example is the temporary heart condition known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken-heart syndrome. What is broken heart syndrome? First described in 1990 in Japan, takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a weakening of the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber. The condition is usually the result of severe emotional or physical stress, such as a sudden illness, the loss of a loved one, a serious accident, or a natural disaster such as an earthquake. That's why the condition is also called stress-induced cardiomyopathy, or broken-heart syndrome. Broken heart syndrome symptoms Classic heart attack symptoms — severe pressure, heaviness, or pain in the chest — most often arise from a blockage in a coronary artery that prevents blood from reaching the heart muscle. But takotsubo cardiomyopathy can produce the same sudden heart symptoms even when the coronary arteries are clear. Sometimes people with broken heart syndrome experience less dramatic chest pain. Instead, they may have shortness of breath, sudden onset of marked fatigue, cold sweats, or lightheadedness. Who gets broken-heart syndrome? More than 90% of reported cases are in women ages 58 to 75. Research suggests that up to 5% of women suspected of having a heart attack actually have this disorder. Most people recover with no long-term heart damage. What causes broken heart syndrome? The precise cause of broken heart syndrome isn't known, but experts think that surging stress hormones (for example, adrenaline) essentially ""stun"" the heart, triggering changes in heart muscle cells or coronary blood vessels (or both) that prevent the left ventricle from contracting effectively. Some causes of broken heart syndrome include: sudden drop in blood pressure serious illness, surgery, or medical procedure (e.g., cardiac stress test) severe pain domestic violence asthma attack receiving bad news (such as a diagnosis of cancer) car or other accident unexpected loss, illness, or injury of a close relative, friend, or pet fierce argument financial loss intense fear public speaking a surprise party or other sudden surprise. Sources: Prasad A, et al., American Heart Journal (2008), Vol. 155, No. 3, pp. 408–17; others. Broken heart syndrome and heart attack Takotsubo symptoms are indistinguishable from those of a heart attack. And an electrocardiogram (ECG) may show abnormalities similar to those found in some heart attacks — in particular, changes known as ST-segment elevation. Consequently, imaging studies and other measures are needed to rule out a heart attack. To get a definitive diagnosis, clinicians look for the following: No evidence on an angiogram of blockages in the coronary arteries — the most common cause of heart attacks. An echocardiogram (ultrasound image) or other imaging technique that shows abnormal movements in the walls of the left ventricle. The most common abnormality in takotsubo cardiomyopathy — the one that gives the disorder its name — is ballooning of the lower part of the left ventricle (apex). During contraction (systole), this bulging ventricle resembles a tako-tsubo, a pot used by Japanese fishermen to trap octopuses. Another term for the disorder is apical ballooning syndrome. Apical ballooning and the tako-tsubo An x-ray of the left ventricle (A) shows apical ballooning, a reversible abnormality characteristic of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. During systole (cardiac contraction) the midsection and tip (apex) of the left ventricle balloon out, while the area above, called the base, contracts normally. The shape is similar to that of a tako-tsubo (B), a round-bottomed, narrow-necked vessel used to catch octopuses. Photos reprinted with permission from Bilal Saeed, M.D., University of Toledo Medical Center, Toledo, Ohio (A); and Satoshi Kurisu, M.D., Hiroshima City Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan (B). Can you die from broken-heart syndrome? Most of the abnormalities in systolic function and ventricle wall movement seen in broken-heart syndrome clear up in one to four weeks. Most individuals who experience it recover fully within two months and are at low risk for it happening again. However, some people continue to have persistent signs consistent with heart failure. In rare cases, broken heart syndrome can be fatal. Broken-heart syndrome treatment There is no specific treatment for broken-heart syndrome. It depends on the severity of symptoms, and whether the person has low blood pressure or evidence of fluid backing up into the lungs. Clinicians often recommend standard heart failure medications such as beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics (water pills). They may give aspirin to patients who also have atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in the arterial walls). Although there's little evidence on long-term therapy, beta blockers (or combined alpha and beta blockers) may be continued indefinitely to help prevent recurrence by reducing the effects of adrenaline and other stress hormones. It's also important to work on reducing any stress that may have played a role in triggering the disorder. Image: Arsgera/Getty Images",7,0.18217129,-0.073360115,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-26-grape-flavonoids-key-to-longevity-overall-wellness.html,Grape flavonoids are key to longevity and overall wellness,0,"For centuries, grapes have been a staple in human diets – from ancient civilizations to the vineyards of modern Europe. While they have long been associated with health and vitality, it is only recently that science has begun to unlock their true potential. The secret to their health benefits lies in powerful phytocompound polyphenols called flavonoids , which not only protect the brain and heart but also support overall wellness. Flavonoids are a group of natural compounds found in plants, including grapes – the most mentioned plant in the Bible scriptures. These powerful antioxidants protect the body from oxidative stress, which plays a significant role in aging and the development of chronic diseases – long-lasting health conditions. Grapes, particularly their skins and seeds, are packed with these potent phytocompounds and they offer a range of benefits for the brain, heart, skin and more. Longevity The health benefits of flavonoids largely come down to their ability to combat oxidative stress – a process that accelerates aging and damage. Over time, oxidative stress leads to chronic conditions, like cancer, diabetes, heart disease and neurodegenerative diseases – disorders that affect the brain and nervous system like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Grape flavonoids help neutralize harmful free radicals – slowing the damage caused, extending the lifespan of cells and possibly even extending life expectancy . Heart health and cardiovascular function One of the most well-known health benefits of grapes and grape-based products, such as red wine, is their ability to support heart health . This phenomenon, known as the ""French Paradox"" highlights how populations in France, despite consuming diets rich in fats, have lower rates of heart disease. Researchers believe that regular consumption of red wine, which is rich in resveratrol and other grape flavonoids, plays a significant role in this. Grapes promote heart health and cardiovascular function by the following mechanisms, among many others: Lower blood pressure . Resveratrol helps relax blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow and reducing strain on the heart. Improve cholesterol levels . Grape flavonoids help reduce bad cholesterol (LDL) and increase good cholesterol (HDL), lowering heart disease risk. Prevent blood clots . Resveratrol has been linked to a lower risk of irritation and swelling (called inflammation) and blood clotting properties, which may help reduce the risk of strokes and other cardiovascular events. By lowering inflammation in blood vessels, flavonoids reduce the risk of atherosclerosis – a condition where arteries become clogged with fatty deposits. Including grapes, grape juice or even moderate wine in diets could support long-term heart and cardiovascular health. Brain health and cognitive function In addition to protecting the heart, grape flavonoids play a role in preserving brain health. Resveratrol, in particular, has been shown to have neuroprotective properties – helping to protect neurons and prevent the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have demonstrated that flavonoids, the most abundant biologically active phytonutrients among grape polyphenols, improve blood flow to the brain – protecting against cognitive decline (more frequent confusion and worsening memory loss) as we age. A study published in the Journal of Neuroscience found that flavonoids prevented the formation of beta amyloid plaques – abnormal protein clumps that accumulate in the brains of people with Alzheimer's – and resveratrol, in particular, improved memory with reduced formation of these harmful unusual clumps and neurofibrillary tangles. This finding provides hope for future therapies aimed at preventing or slowing cognitive impairment in humans. Anticancer Grape flavonoids have also been studied for their anti-cancer properties. They may help prevent the development of certain types of cancers by inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells and inhibiting tumor growth. Research shows that flavonoids such as quercetin and resveratrol can interfere with the growth of cancer cells in the breast, colon and prostate. They may also reduce the risk of metastasis – where cancer spreads from one part of the body to another. Skin health and rejuvenation Beyond their internal benefits, grape flavonoids also have significant effects on skin health. By protecting skin cells from oxidative damage and UV radiation, these natural compounds help prevent premature aging. They also support the production of collagen – a protein that keeps skin firm and elastic. The anti-inflammatory properties of grape flavonoids help reduce skin inflammation, which can greatly contribute to conditions like acne (a skin condition that causes blocked pores and pimples), eczema ( a condition that makes skin dry, itchy and red) and rosacea ( a chronic skin condition that causes redness and visible blood vessels). Embrace grapes as part of a healthy, moderate diet to unlock their full potential for a longer, healthier life. Visit Superfoods.news for more stories like this.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-to-recognize-and-respond-to-a-warning-stroke,"How to recognize and respond to a ""warning"" stroke",1,"A temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain, known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), can cause a range of unsettling symptoms, including slurred speech or arm weakness. The symptoms appear suddenly but usually last less than five minutes, which is why TIAs are often ignored or missed. Although TIAs are often referred to as ""ministrokes,"" the term ""warning stroke"" is actually more accurate. A TIA can be a harbinger of a future stroke, which has similar symptoms (see ""Spot a stroke"") but can leave you permanently disabled. Nearly one in five people who have a suspected TIA will experience a full-blown stroke within three months, according to a scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) in the March 2023 issue of the journal Stroke. And the risk of a stroke is highest during the 48 hours following the TIA, says Dr. Erica Camargo Faye, a stroke neurologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Sometimes, what appears to be a TIA is more serious than it seems. ""Even symptoms that go away may actually be a stroke,"" says Dr. Camargo Faye. As the AHA statement points out, two of every five people with a suspected TIA who get an appropriate brain imaging test find out that they actually had a stroke. That's why it's so important to be aware of the symptoms and seek emergency care right away. Symptoms of a TIA or stroke Different areas of the brain have different tasks, so the symptoms that occur during a TIA or stroke depend on the part of the brain in which blood flow is disrupted. A decade ago, the American Stroke Association unveiled a stroke awareness campaign based on the mnemonic FAST. The first three letters (which stand for Face, Arm, and Speech) cover the most typical symptoms people experience. But growing evidence suggests that adding two more letters (B for balance and E for eyes) may help people better recognize either a TIA or an actual stroke. Here are some additional details about each symptom. Balance. This symptom can be tricky because many other things can cause dizziness or balance issues, including low blood sugar or inner ear problems. Balance problems caused by a TIA often make it difficult to stand up, and you may fall to one side, says Dr. Camargo Faye. This symptom is often accompanied by other symptoms, including slurred speech or vision problems, she adds. Eyes. Vision problems can manifest in different ways, although the most common is not being able to see from one or both eyes. Often, people describe the experience as seeing a dark gray shade that blocks half or all their vision. Blurred or double vision can also occur. ""Sometimes, people mistakenly go to an eye doctor first instead of going to the emergency room,"" says Dr. Camargo Faye. Face. The face can droop on one or both sides during a TIA or stroke. Usually, the corner of the mouth appears pulled down, and the person isn't able to smile. Drooping of the eyes and forehead is less common. Arm or leg weakness. This symptom tends to affect arms more often than legs and usually occurs on only one side. People may describe the feeling as numbness or tingling rather than weakness. Sometimes the entire side of the body is affected. Speech difficulty. Slurred or garbled speech is the most common presentation. But in some cases, people struggle to find words or aren't able to understand what other people are saying. This deficit also extends to writing and typing — including texting on a smartphone. ""The problem isn't related to physical function but rather to a deficit caused by a lack of blood flow in the language areas of the brain,"" Dr. Camargo Faye explains. Timing is crucial The final letter (T for time) underscores the importance of getting to an emergency room for an assessment as soon as possible, even if your symptoms have disappeared. The new AHA guidelines call for imaging of the blood vessels in the brain and neck, along with blood tests to rule out things that sometimes mimic a TIA, such as low blood sugar or an infection. People diagnosed with a TIA should then get additional testing that can guide treatments to prevent a future stroke. Image: © elenab/Getty Images",7,0.072618715,0.040825427,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-25-cnn-bizarre-headline-vaccinated-dying-covid.html,CNN runs bizarre headline proving the unvaccinated were right: The fully jabbed are “dying from Covid-19”,0,"Fake news giant CNN is going through a metamorphosis regarding its position on Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) ""vaccines."" In the beginning, CNN pushed the notion that Covid jabs would save people's lives, but now the network is admitting that the shots are killing people – oh, but that ""doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective,"" reads a recent CNN headline. On Feb. 26, 2021, at the height of the ""pandemic,"" CNN covered a study out of the United Kingdom claiming that a single dose of Pfizer's mRNA (modRNA) injection is enough to provide ""strong protection for those who've had Covid-19."" A few months later, CNN claimed that people who got jabbed could safely go indoors without wearing a face mask. A couple months after that, CNN ran the following headline counteracting its earlier story to the contrary: ""CDC updates guidance, recommends vaccinated people wear masks indoors in certain areas"" After that, CNN was informing its readers that if they listened to the earlier guidance about getting jabbed for protection, well, that protection does not exactly last like was initially claimed. According to CNN as of Dec. 23, 2021: ""Vaccine protection against Covid-19 wanes over time, especially for older people, CDC says"" Reminder: The unvaccinated were right! CNN's coverage of the vax started with how effective it is and ending with: ""Why vaccinated people dying from Covid-19 doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective"" pic.twitter.com/Yt22pg1wtG — Eddie (@Eddies_X) September 23, 2024 (Related: Earlier this year, CNN published a piece calling for the government to restrict how much Americans are allowed to travel abroad: ""carbon passports may be the answer."") Keep getting jabbed until you die – that's how you know it's working, says CNN Concerning the Johnson & Johnson injection, which differs from what Pfizer and Moderna offered, CNN told its readers and viewers who took it that the one-and-done format initially recommended by the manufacturer was no longer enough, as of Oct. 16, 2021: J&J jab recipients would now need a second dose as soon as possible. After that, Tony Fauci came out to recommend a third dose of whatever Covid injection you want, assuming you only got two jabs. And CNN parroted Fauci's recommendations as scientific fact. Then, not long after that, CNN was pushing people to take a fourth dose of Covid shot, this time claiming that the CDC said to do this. In other words, if Fauci and / or the CDC say to do it, then CNN wants you to do it. All of this culminated with an Oct. 19, 2021, article from CNN bearing the following bizarre headline: ""Why vaccinated people dying from Covid-19 doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective"" It is difficult to ascertain how CNN got away with pushing all this contradictory content all around the same time to its followers. Are CNN supporters schizophrenic just like the network's editorial team apparently is? Keep in mind that around the time CNN was publishing all these schizophrenic headlines, the federal government of the United States was busy changing the definition of terms like ""vaccine"" and ""immunization"" to fit the emerging narrative. ""They changed the scientific and medical definition of vaccine and immunization in late 2021,"" someone wrote on X about this. ""MSM changes any definition to fit their narrative like the definition of a woman etc.,"" wrote another. Another person joked about what CNN is actually saying with all of its contradictory content about Covid jabs: ""It went from 'safe and effective' to 'well, you'll die, but you'll go to heaven' at warp speed."" ""Four of my family members died from the vaccine,"" added another. ""Autopsy showed strange, horrible blood clots throughout their bodies. They were all previously healthy and under 40.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-25-fda-approves-monkeypox-vaccine-despite-acknowledging-dangerous.html,FDA approves monkeypox vaccine despite acknowledging that it is DANGEROUS,0,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a vaccine for people deemed to be at ""high risk"" for monkeypox, despite acknowledging that the injection itself is dangerous . The regulator approved the ACAM2000 vaccine on Aug. 29. The Defender 's Suzanne Burdick said in a report that the vaccine was made by Emergent BioSolutions, a company specializing in vaccines for biochemical warfare threats such as anthrax and smallpox. While ACAM2000 was initially approved for smallpox in 2007, the FDA's recent expanded supplemental approval allows it to be injected into those at ""high risk"" for monkeypox, such as members of the LGBT community. According to an FDA press release at the time of its approval , ""ACAM2000 is a ""live replicating vaccinia virus vaccine."" Even the regulator's medication guide for the injection admits that it may cause more harm than good. (Related: South African group challenges WHO's mpox emergency declaration, warns public about vaccine dangers. ) InfoWars reported that the first page of ACAM2000's medication guide provided by the FDA lists numerous side effects. According to the guide, the live vaccinia virus in the injection ""can be spread to individuals who have close contact with the vaccinated individual."" To make matters worse, ACAM2000 ""can cause serious complications in vaccinated individuals and in their close contacts to whom the vaccine virus has spread."" ACAM2000 does more harm than good Children's Health Defense senior research scientist Karl Jablonowski denounced the FDA's approval of ACAM2000 as a ""public hazard, not the practice of public health."" He told the Defender : ""You can call ACAM2000 a 'vaccine,' but its impact on the U.S. will be as a 'disease.'"" ""The spread of vaccinia virus is an infliction and an assault, as an unsuspecting person cannot possibly consent. For good reasons, you would not consent to this vaccine – even if you believed your benefits outweigh your risks – as you become a potential vector of a disease that is damaging to the heart and fatal to both fetus and infant."" Jablonowski continued that ACAM2000's package insert reveals that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) found roughly 520 per million vaccine recipients who contracted post-vaccination cardiac inflammation – about one in 2,000. But elsewhere in the package insert, the FDA acknowledges that the risk is 5.7 per 1,000 vaccinations – about one in every 175 people. ""If the 262 million adults in the U.S. received this vaccine, an estimated 1.493 million would contract the serious adverse reaction of myopericarditis [i.e. heart lining and/or muscle inflammation],"" he remarked. Internist and biological warfare expert Dr. Meryl Nass said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also acknowledged the risk of cardiac inflammation in 5.7 per 1,00 primary ACAM2000 vaccinations during a June 2022 meeting. ""It's a huge number. The fact that the FDA and CDC are acknowledging it means no one should get the vaccine,"" she shared. ""Myopericarditis is a life-threatening condition; it lowers your life expectancy. This risk, 1 in 175, is higher than all other licensed vaccines for which the CDC acknowledges side effects. This is the worst."" Cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough recounted that HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra declared a monkeypox public health emergency in 2022, but let the declaration expire early in 2023. ""The crisis conjured up little fear for the average American as it was learned that the infection was largely a pustular rash that occurred with intense sexual contact among gay/bisexual men with the skin blisters around the anus and buttocks or mouth,"" he wrote in an Aug. 18 post on his Substack.

Real data and statistics, that the CDC, WHO, FDA and the Vaccine Industrial Complex do not want anyone to see, have been published and reveal that all the major infectious disease mortality rates were greatly diminishing and on a consistent downward trend BEFORE those vaccines were invented and mass administered. Several whistleblowers then and now have proof, but a few billion vaccine zealots still won’t be able to wrap their jabbed heads around it. This requires careful consideration and a total rethinking of everything we know about vaccine efficacy, infectious disease rates, and the entire concept of the so-called “holy grail” of medicine. Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Smallpox death rates all on massive declines prior to the introduction and mass-administration of those vaccines Take a good look at the graphs of these documented mortality rates in England and Wales from 1838 to 1978, well into the years that these ever-popular vaccinations were invented and mass administered to the populace. We see now, in plain sight, the mass illusion that was perpetrated on the public that vaccines were the saving grace for humankind, and saved billions of injected people from dying from the world’s scariest infectious diseases. In fact, vaccines and their efficacy were so overblown, that Big Pharma and governments around the world had to make them compulsory so the majority of the populace would comply. In other words, the brainwashing propaganda and faked science wasn’t enough to convince them all. The graphs even look similar for infectious diseases where there never was a vaccine created. That’s even more “proof in the pudding” that vaccines aren’t helping decrease mortality rates much, if any at all. It was really all about improvements in hygiene, plumbing, sanitation, use of clean water, and hospitals and doctors learning how to disinfect everything, including surgical instruments. Every human being on earth should be questioning the contribution of vaccinations to the decline of mortality in the world. We already know that nearly all prescription medications only “manage” the symptoms of disease and disorder, rather than address the root cause and actually cure the illnesses. Plus, prescription medications create a host of side effects and adverse events that bring with them new health horrors, only to be addressed with MORE crooked medicine. It’s a vicious cycle and a cash cow for Big Pharma, just like with vaccines. Pro-vaccine zealots love to scream “science!” when referring to why they believe so wholeheartedly in vaccination, but they should all take a look at the statistics of mortality from that science, based on infectious diseases and the relative vaccines that are supposed to prevent infection, prevent transmission, prevent death. It’s all been a huge farce. Folks need to look at what really contributed to the decline of mortality over the past century and a half, and they will see it’s really about the rising standards of living. Vaccines may have contributed to this decline of mortality, but only in a miniscule amount compared to the propaganda and disinformation that’s been spread about them, around the globe, for decades.

This could never be more apparent than with the recent ""FDA approval"" of the Monkeypox (Mpox) vaccine that has the most insane “serious complications” warnings of any jab, ever. Yes, the ACAM2000 is a live replicating vaccinia virus vaccine that, per the adverse reactions listed on the warnings insert, can cause severe disability, inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, permanent neurological sequelae (long term infection), death of the vaccinated individual, and … wait for it… “ death of unvaccinated individuals who have contact with vaccinated individuals.” You cannot make this stuff up. Monkeypox vaccine can kill the vaccinated person, the fetus, and anyone who comes into contact with the jabbed human guinea pigs Monkeypox isn’t just for promiscuous gender fluids, prostitutes and porn stars anymore. Now, thanks to the Monkeypox vaccine, anybody who simply shakes hands or hugs someone who got the STD ACAM2000 vaccine can get Monkeypox, develop vaccine side effects and die. These are all listed as “serious complications” on the vaccine insert, compliments of the Freaky Drug Approvers (FDA) in the United States of America. Western Medicine couldn’t be more corrupt, adulterated, insidious and underrated as biological weapons of mass destruction. The creators should be put in prison for life. The propagators should be in the cell next to them. These are repeat offenders who all pushed the deadly Covid clot shots on the masses, and now the U.S. stockpile of these biological weapons exceeds one million doses. That’s one-third of the U.S. population. Do they think we’re all porno actors, prostitutes and orgy lovers? Exactly who does Big Pharma deem “at high risk?” Everyone? Kids? Babies? Certainly, Hunter Biden needs the Mpox jab right away. The ACAM2000 Mpox death jab (expanded smallpox-monkeypox combo jab) was crafted by Emergent BioSolutions, a Pharma Giant that specializes in vaccines for “biochemical warfare threats,” though it seems they’ve created a biochemical warfare threat instead of something to defend against them. Oops. So much for worrying about anthrax poisoning or smallpox infection. Americans have much more serious concerns, like getting injected with the ACAM2000, or some fully unvaccinated human coming into contact with a person that got jabbed with the ACAM2000. If you’re pregnant, it’s like an abortion pill you inject. It’s a wonder Kommie Harris’ picture isn’t right on the vaccine vial with the slogan “get vaxxed for the greater good!” This beast of a jab does not contribute to the safety of public health, but rather adds to the hazard of taking Western Medications that have ZERO proof of safety, efficacy or clinical trials with science-based evidence of the reward being greater than the risk. Plus, add myocarditis and pericarditis to the adverse events list for the Monkeypox freak jab, since it’s not enough to have those conditions already from the Covid clot shots. Talk about lowering life expectancy. That’s exactly what these dirty vaccines do. They create life-threatening conditions, some of which never go away until you’re six feet under. Of course, BioSolutions is part of the ethnic cleansing of African children, as they pledged to donate 50,000 doses to the so-called “mpox outbreak” in Africa.

Dr. Jay Varma — New York’s senior public health adviser under Mayor Bill de Blasio from April 2020 to May 2021 — was the chief architect of the city’s COVID-19 vaccine mandates , lockdowns and bans on large gatherings.

Varma confirmed to the Times that he attended three gatherings between August 2020 and June 2021. He added that although he didn’t dispute the recordings’ authenticity, they had been “spliced, diced and taken out of context.” The video footage shows Varma disclosing to an off-camera listener that he attended multiple private sex parties during the pandemic, including one he and his wife held in a hotel room in August 2020 with roughly 10 people who took MDMA , a psychoactive drug sometimes referred to as Molly or Ecstacy. Varma also discussed enjoying a dance party in June 2021 — “right when we were about to do the vaccine mandate, right before it” — attended by 200 people under a Wall Street bank. “We were all rolling, we were all taking Molly, and everybody’s high,” Varma is heard saying in the video. “And I was happy because I hadn’t done that in like a year and a half.” He admitted to being a little nervous that someone might recognize him. “If anybody sees me they’re gonna be pissed.” Joseph Borelli , the Republican minority leader of the City Council, told the Times that the video revelations undercut the COVID-19 measures Varma had pushed. He said: “I recall being treated like a pariah for pointing out the obvious at the time — that so many of our so-called leaders were just making up illogical rules as they went along. … Still, even I couldn’t have predicted how full of it they actually were.” ‘I was the one, like, making the decisions about what happened’ Crowder said in his podcast that Varma’s behavior isn’t just about the hypocrisy of leaders not following their own rules. He said: “This is a story about those in charge not fearing what it is that they demanded you fear in a way that altered your life. You were told to fear going to church. You were told fear meeting family, running your business — or even vote. Remember that?” Crowder showed a clip of Varma explaining that he largely hadn’t been afraid during the pandemic because he had had “control.” Varma said, “I was the one, like, making the decisions about what happened, so I didn’t feel like I [had] lost control. … I think that’s what really ends up freaking any of us out.” After leaving his city work in 2021, Varma became a professor and the director of the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response at Weill Cornell Medical College. Currently, he is the executive vice president and chief medical officer at the pharmaceutical company SIGA Technologies . Holland said Varma should be “rightly scorned for his policies and his behaviors ignoring them.” Varma told the Times he had been “targeted by an operative for an extremist right-wing organization determined to malign public health officials and take down the public health system in America.” “I stand by my efforts to get New Yorkers vaccinated against COVID-19,” he said, “and I reject dangerous extremist efforts to undermine the public’s confidence in the need for and effectiveness of vaccines.” Council member calls for investigation of Varma City Council Member Robert Holden called on Mayor Eric Adams to investigate Varma’s actions .

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/short-term-stroke-symptoms-still-need-emergency-care,Short-term stroke symptoms still need emergency care,1,"An episode of stroke symptoms that disappear in less than an hour is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA). After a TIA, it may seem like you're back to normal. Even so, it's still best to seek immediate care to prevent a full-blown stroke, according to a statement from the American Heart Association published online Jan. 19, 2023, by the journal Stroke. Each year, about 240,000 people experience a TIA — a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain. While the TIA itself doesn't cause permanent damage, nearly one out of five people who have a TIA will suffer a full-blown stroke within three months. Because TIA symptoms go away, people often ignore their seriousness and don't seek immediate care. The statement underscored that it's important for people to be able to identify TIA symptoms so they can take action. It recommended the FAST guideline, which stands for Face drooping or numbness, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call 911. The statement also highlighted strategies people can adopt to lower their TIA risk and, if they have had a TIA, to help prevent future strokes. These include behavioral health counseling, increased physical activity, following a plant-based diet, and limiting alcohol intake. Image: © ljubaphoto/Getty Images",7,0.16827872,0.09404908,False

Known as PDE-5 inhibitors, the drugs include sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn). They work by relaxing artery walls and improving blood flow. Earlier research suggested these drugs may also reduce heart problems in men with diabetes or heart disease. The new study included 72,000 men diagnosed with erectile dysfunction but no heart problems in the previous year. Nearly 24,000 were prescribed a PDE-5 inhibitor and followed for an average of 2.4 years; the others were followed for an average of three years. Compared with men who did not take PDE-5 inhibitors, those who did had a 13% lower rate of heart attacks, strokes, or other serious heart-related events and a 39% lower rate of rate of death related to cardiovascular disease. But these findings would need to be validated in a controlled clinical trial for the drugs to be approved to prevent heart disease.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-20-woman-injected-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-developed-psychosis.html,Woman developed PSYCHOSIS after getting injected with AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine,0,"A case study making the rounds on social media outlines how a woman injected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine from AstraZeneca developed psychosis post-vaccination . The case study published January 2022 in Schizophrenia Research touched on an 18-year-old female student who was sent to the hospital for ""irrelevant talk and bizarre behavior."" According to the paper, she had no history of physical illness or substance use. In fact, she had been perfectly healthy both physically and mentally before getting injected. ""While there have been numerous pieces of medical literature on the neurological side effects of the COVID-19 vaccinations, they often revolve around more physical ailments such as lethal headaches and seizures, paralysis, Bell's palsy, Alzheimer's [disease], Parkinson's [disease] and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS),"" the case study noted, adding that the psychotic behavior exhibited by the woman would be classified within the category of neurological side effects. ""Over the period of [the] last few weeks, some of the serious side effects with various (COVID-19) vaccines have been documented in the form of GBS. There is limited data with respect to the psychiatric side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. Few case reports have documented new onset psychosis after the use of messenger-ribonucleic acid (mRNA) based COVID-19 vaccines."" (Related: The CONNECTION between AUTISM and COVID JABS could boil down to destruction of good gut bacteria .) The researchers ultimately noted in their case study that ""considering the limited data, in this report we present a case of new onset psychosis, following the use of [the] Covishield vaccine."" Covishield is the local version of the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical firm's vaccine, manufactured and marketed by the Serum Institute of India. COVID-19 vaccines are DANGEROUS, whether they're mRNA or viral vector-based ""There was no notable difference in the gender distribution between these two groups of vaccine recipients. mRNA vaccines (all brands) were associated with almost 90.0 percent of the cardiac complications, whereas viral vector vaccines were associated with slightly over half (52.6 percent) of the neurological complications,"" the study reported. ""Nevertheless, 5.9 percent of cases with neurological complications and 2.5 percent of those with cardiac complications were fatal, underscoring the significance of the consistent surveillance and vigilant monitoring of vaccinated individuals to mitigate these occurrences."" The researchers pointed out that other non-COVID-19 vaccinations have been documented to trigger psychosis as well. According to them, there are a few cases of post-vaccination psychosis linked to vaccines for rabies, yellow fever, smallpox, typhus and influenza. For the 18-year-old woman in the case study, they attributed her post-vaccination psychosis to possible autoimmune encephalitis. Encephalitis is the swelling of the brain – in this case, being triggered by an autoimmune response to the vaccine. InfoWars recently reported that viral vector COVID-19 vaccines have a higher rate of triggering neurological conditions when compared to mRNA-based injections, albeit by a small margin. The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 injections make use of mRNA coated in lipid nanoparticles to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, while the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines make use of an adenovirus vector. But even the two adenoviral vaccines have differences. The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine received by the 18-year-old woman uses a monkey adenovirus, while the Janssen COVID-19 injection uses a human adenovirus.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/prostate-cancer-how-does-waiting-on-treatment-affect-survival-202304282929,How does waiting on prostate cancer treatment affect survival?,1,"Prostate cancer progresses slowly, but for how long is it possible to put off treatment? Most newly diagnosed men have low-risk or favorable types of intermediate-risk prostate cancer that doctors can watch and treat only if the disease is found to be at higher risk of progression. This approach, called active surveillance, allows men to delay — or in some cases, outlive — the need for aggressive treatment, which has challenging side effects. In 1999, British researchers launched a clinical trial comparing outcomes among 1,643 men who were either treated immediately for their cancer or followed on active surveillance (then called active monitoring). The men's average age at enrollment was 62, and they all had low- to intermediate risk tumors with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels ranging from 3.0 to 18.9 nanograms per milliliter. Long-term results from the study, which were published in March, show that prostate cancer death rates were low regardless of the therapeutic strategy. ""This hugely important study shows quite clearly that there is no urgency to treat men with low- and even favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer,"" says Dr. Anthony Zietman, the Jenot W. and William U. Shipley Professor of Radiation Oncology at Harvard Medical School, anda radiation oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who was involved in the research and is a member of the Harvard Medical School Annual Report on Prostate Diseases editorial board. ""They give up nothing in terms of 15-year survival."" What the results showed During the study, called the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial, researchers randomized 545 men to active monitoring, 533 men to surgical removal of the prostate, and 545 men to radiation. After a median follow-up of 15 years, 356 men had died from any cause, including 45 men who died from prostate cancer specifically: 17 from the active monitoring group, 12 from the surgery group, and 16 from the radiation group. Men in the active surveillance group did have higher rates of cancer progression than the treated men did. More of them were eventually treated with drugs that suppress testosterone, a hormone that fuels prostate cancer growth. In all, 51 men from the active surveillance group developed metastatic prostate cancer, which is roughly twice the number of those treated with surgery or radiation. But 133 men in the active surveillance group also avoided any treatment and were still alive when the follow-up concluded. Experts weigh in In a press release, the study's lead author, Dr. Freddie Hamdy of the University of Oxford, claims that while cancer progression and the need for hormonal therapy were more limited in the treatment groups, ""those reductions did not translate into differences in mortality."" The findings suggest that for some men, aggressive therapy ""results in more harm than good,"" Dr. Hamdy says. Dr. Zietman agrees, adding that active surveillance protocols today are even safer than those used when ProtecT was initiated. Unlike in the past, for instance, active surveillance protocols now make more use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that detect cancer progression in the prostate with high resolution. Dr. Boris Gershman, a surgeon who specializes in urology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and is also an Annual Report on Prostate Diseases editorial board member, cautions that the twofold higher risk of developing metastasis among men on active surveillance may eventually translate into a mortality difference at 20-plus years. ""It's important to not extend the data beyond their meaning,"" says Dr. Gershman, who was not involved in the study. ""These results should not be used to infer that all prostate cancer should not be treated, or that there is no benefit to treatment for men with more aggressive disease."" Still, ProtecT is a landmark study in urology, Dr. Gershman says, that ""serves to reinforce active surveillance as the preferred management strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer and some men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer."" Dr. Marc B. Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of the Annual Report, points out that nearly all the enrolled subjects provided follow-up data for the study's duration, which is highly unusual for large clinical trials with long follow-up. The authors had initially predicted that patients from the active monitoring group who developed metastases at 10 years would have shortened survival at 15 years, ""but this was not the case,"" Dr. Garnick says. ""As with many earlier PSA screening studies, the impact of local therapy on long-term survival for this class of prostate cancer — whether it be radiation or surgery — was again brought into question,"" he says.",8,-0.12172671,0.14519633,False

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-18-bill-gates-urging-people-avoid-vaccines-inciting-violence.html,Bill Gates says urging people to avoid vaccines is “inciting violence” and he wants “antivaxxers” censored by AI,0,"Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, and former friend to Jeffrey Epstein, was recently interviewed by CNBC to discuss how to handle “vaccine hesitancy” using real-time censorship imposed by artificial intelligence (AI). Bill Gates said those who urge people to avoid vaccines are “inciting violence” and are therefore a threat to public health. He proposes a totalitarian approach, calling for speech “boundaries” that weed out “vaccine misinformation” in real time. Bill Gates wants to control minds and rewrite history on vaccines Gates’ “philanthropic” organizations are heavily invested in vaccines, from the traditional antigen-based biologics to the experimental mRNA jabs, which are linked to excess mortality worldwide. He recently announced plans to turn all vaccines into mRNA and expand the realm of vaccination to include hundreds more diseases and potentially thousands more boosters. Gates’ resume includes the mass injury of teenage girls via HPV vaccine programs in India and the spread of vaccine-derived polio strains through polio vaccine campaigns in third world countries. During the covid-19 scandal, Gates frequently appeared on the mainstream media networks, urging every person in the world to stay home, lock down and get vaccinated. He has proposed that individuals submit to his climate change proposals, too, which include: blocking out the sun using chemtrails , controlling global farming and ridding the world of cow farts, forcibly releasing millions of genetically modified mosquitoes , and getting populations to eat bugs and switch to fake meat . Now the prominent philanthropist wants to use artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time censorship of vaccine-related “misinformation.” Gates’ comments, made in a recent CNBC interview, have sparked a heated debate about free speech rights, mind control and the rewriting of history by the elite. Gates, who is deeply and psychotically invested in vaccines through the Gates Foundation, GAVI, and the World Health Organization , has increasingly focused on combating vaccine ""misinformation"" -- which is really just the suppression of vaccine injury testimonials and the abolition of informed consent. In his latest interview, he expressed a desire to impose “boundaries” on speech, particularly when it pertains to vaccines. Gates argued that while free speech is important, there should be limitations, especially if such speech incites violence or deters individuals from getting vaccinated. “We should have free speech, but if you’re inciting violence or causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries?” Gates said. He suggested that the U.S. might need new rules to address these issues, indicating a preference for AI-driven systems that could swiftly identify and suppress harmful content before it has a chance to spread. Ironically, everyone knows that the true purveyor of “vaccine misinformation” has always been Bill Gates, as he looks for ways to exploit populations with propaganda and force vaccine programs down people's throats to advance his ""philanthropic"" mission of transhumanism and population control. Gates’ totalitarian approach to AI is a threat to humanity Gates’ totalitarian approach could lead to excessive censorship and a suppression of legitimate debate, eroding informed consent in medicine and making a mockery of healthcare systems globally. Using AI to enforce Gates’ vision for the world will set a dangerous precedent, leading to broader restrictions on free speech, the uncontested implementation of vaccine passports, and further restrictions to the scientific method and the progress of human civilization. Gates’ AI censorship will prioritize thought control over public discourse at the expense of transparency, informed consent, and free will. Dr. Emily Carter, a free speech advocate, warned that Gates' proposals could undermine democratic values and erode the principles of our Constitutional Republic. “The idea of AI-driven censorship is fraught with challenges. It risks stifling important discussions and could lead to a situation where only sanctioned viewpoints are allowed,” Carter said. “This approach could erode the principles of open dialogue and informed consent, which are essential for a functioning democracy.” Gates’ psychopathic attempt to control people and bury vaccine injuries and deaths using AI continues a pattern of malicious behavior. Over the past five years, he has repeatedly called for social media companies to remove what he believes is “vaccine misinformation.” The so-called “ vaccine misinformation” and “conspiracy theories” that Bill Gates complains about ultimately turn out to be the TRUTH. His actions have negatively affected millions of lives in the U.S. and hundreds of millions of lives globally. People have been injured and killed all to push forth Gates’ false promises of vaccine safety and efficacy. Meanwhile, Gates continues to cash in on his investments, pushing narratives that have led to mass deception, injury, and death . His collaboration with OpenAI is apparent, as the vaccine propaganda stemming from their large language model is sinister and appalling.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-heart-healthy-diet-doesnt-need-to-be-low-in-fat,A heart-healthy diet doesn't need to be low in fat,1,"But the source of the fats you choose — and the rest of what you typically eat — make a big difference. For the last half of the 20th century, most major health organizations, including the American Heart Association, recommended a low-fat diet. Yes, they did, but the message has changed dramatically. Now, the American Heart Association, the federal dietary guidelines, and other nutrition authorities have shifted away from advising people to limit the total amount of fat in their diets. ""Instead, the focus is on an overall healthy dietary pattern. That means an eating style that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans, along with only modest or small amounts of meat, dairy, eggs, and sweets,"" says Dr. Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The reality is that eating more whole or minimally processed, plant-based foods will naturally lower your intake of fat, especially saturated fat. Found mainly in meat and dairy products, saturated fat can boost levels of harmful LDL cholesterol, a key contributor to heart disease. But simply cutting back on all types of fat does not necessarily translate into a diet that lowers cardiovascular risk. Low-fat diet fails Starting in the 1980s, when food manufacturers and consumers cut the fat from their products and diets, they replaced it with refined carbohydrates. People filled up on bread, pasta, low-fat chips and cookies, and low-fat sweetened yogurt. Eating lots of these highly processed carbohydrates floods your bloodstream with sugar, triggering a release of insulin to clear the sugar from your blood. But that can push your blood sugar too low, leaving you hungry again after just a few hours, which encourages overeating and weight gain. What's more, a steady diet of these unhealthy carbs can eventually impair your body's ability to respond to insulin, which can lead to diabetes. Both obesity and diabetes are closely linked to a heightened risk of heart disease. But eating too many refined carbs wasn't the only problem. Avoiding unsaturated fats — those found in nuts, seeds, olives, avocados, and fish — isn't necessary. Not only do these foods make your meals more satisfying and tasty, unsaturated fat promotes cardiovascular health. What about ultra-low-fat diets? Some physicians advocate an ultra-low-fat diet, which includes just 10% of calories from fat. This diet excludes all animal-based products (such as meat, poultry, dairy, and fish), as well as refined carbohydrates (including white flour, white sugar, and even fruit juice). But it also shuns some healthier unsaturated fats, including added oils and high-fat, plant-based foods such as avocados and nuts. Small studies have shown that this eating pattern may actually reverse the buildup of cholesterol-clogged plaque in the arteries. At least some of that benefit may stem from the abundant fiber and other nutrients in the diet's copious amounts of vegetables, beans, and whole grains, all of which are fairly scarce in the typical American diet. The only problem with an ultra-low-fat vegan diet is that it's very challenging for most people to stick to over the long term. ""If you are among the 1% of people who can, may the Force be with you,"" says Dr. Rimm. For everyone else, a Mediterranean-style diet offers the best of both worlds — a plant-centric diet that's not overly restrictive (see ""Simple steps to a Mediterranean-style eating plan""). ""The Mediterranean diet doesn't require extreme eating habits that make it difficult to socialize with other people,"" he says. What's more, he adds, it tastes good and has the best evidence from long-term clinical studies for lowering a person's risk of heart disease. Simple steps to a Mediterranean-style eating plan To ease into this eating style, look over these suggestions from registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Choose one, try it for a week, then gradually add more changes over time, she advises. Switch from whatever fats you use now to extra‑virgin olive oil. Start by using olive oil when cooking, including in salad dressings. Try swapping olive oil for butter on crusty bread. Have salad every day. Choose crisp, dark greens and whatever vegetables are in season. Go nuts. Instead of a bag of chips or cookies, have a handful of raw nuts as a healthy snack. Add more whole grains to your meals. Experiment with bulgur, barley, farro, brown rice, and whole-grain pasta. Select dense, chewy, country-style bread without added sugar or butter. Add a variety of vegetables to your menus. Add an extra serving of vegetables to both lunch and dinner, aiming for three to four servings a day. Try a new vegetable every week. Eat at least three servings of legumes a week. Options include lentils, chickpeas, pinto beans, and black beans. Eat less meat. Choose lean poultry in moderate, 3- to 4-ounce portions. Save red meat for occasional consumption or use meat as a condiment, accompanied by lots of vegetables, as in stews, stir-fries, and soups. Eat more fish, aiming for two servings a week. Both canned and fresh fish are fine. Cut out sugary beverages. Replace soda and juices with water. Eat fewer high-fat, high-sugar desserts. Fresh fruit or poached fruit is best. Aim for three servings of fresh fruit a day. Save cakes and pastries for special occasions. Image: © vaaseenaa/Getty Images",3,0.41734743,0.14111938,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-foods-that-fight-high-cholesterol,5 foods that fight high cholesterol,1,"Your diet clearly plays a role in determining your cho­lesterol levels. In fact, changing what you eat can lower your cholesterol and improve the composition of the armada of fats floating through your bloodstream. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and ""good fats"" are all part of a heart-healthy diet. But some foods are particularly good at helping bring down cholesterol. How? Some cholesterol-lowering foods deliver a good dose of soluble fiber, which binds cholesterol and its precursors in the digestive system and drags them out of the body before they get into circulation. Others provide polyunsaturated fats, which directly lower LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol. And those with plant sterols and stanols keep the body from absorbing cholesterol. Here are five of those foods: Oats. An easy way to start lowering cholesterol is to choose oatmeal or an oat-based cold cereal like Cheerios for breakfast. It gives you one to two grams of soluble fiber. Add a banana or some strawberries for another half-gram. Beans. Beans are especially rich in soluble fiber. They also take a while for the body to digest, meaning you feel full for longer after a meal. That's one reason beans are a useful food for folks trying to lose weight. Nuts. Studies show that eating almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and other nuts is good for the heart. Eating two ounces of nuts a day can slightly lower LDL, on the order of 5%. Nuts also have additional nutrients that protect the heart in other ways. Foods fortified with sterols and stanols. Sterols and stanols extracted from plants interfere with the body's ability to absorb cholesterol from food. Companies are now adding them to a wide variety of foods. They're also available as supplements. Getting two grams of plant sterols or stanols a day can lower LDL cholesterol by about 10%. Fatty fish. Eating fish two or three times a week can lower LDL in two ways: by replacing meat, which has LDL-boosting saturated fats, and by delivering LDL-lowering omega-3 fats. Omega-3s reduce triglycerides in the bloodstream and protect the heart by helping prevent the onset of abnormal heart rhythms.

The Bible nutrition educator based his first sermon on the Letter of St. Paul to the Ephesians in the New Testament, specifically where it touches on the Armor of God (Ephesians 6:11). He called on people to don this armor and be strong in the Lord. ""You must express courage and understand that you are acting in the power of his might, that He is with you. God is with us. And with God at your side, we put on the armor of God so that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,"" Adams said. ""We avoid exposure to more toxins such as the vaccine jabs, pesticides, herbicides [and] toxic pharmaceuticals. We pursue clean food, clean supplements, superfoods that contain the miraculous molecules provided by God. Molecules of cleansing and of healing, molecules of protection."" (Related: Mike Adams announces 100 sermons in 100 days… with sermon #1 available now – the MOLECULAR Armor of God. ) The Health Ranger mentioned how certain molecules are found in certain foods, which means that eating them protects the body from within. Letting these molecules circulate through the body allows the molecular Armor of God to do its work. One such molecule is sulforaphane, which can be found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli sprouts. It protects the nerves from toxins and stressors. Another molecule is astaxanthin, a very rich red pigment that purifies the blood when ingested. This molecule also protects the cardiovascular, nervous and musculoskeletal systems. The Bible nutrition educator ultimately noted that whether it is sulforaphane or astaxanthin, these molecules are the Armor of God coursing through a person's veins. Evil forces used FEAR as a weapon against people The founder of Natural News and Brighteon.com said his sermon is about courage, the Armor of God and understanding the war being waged against humanity and God. According to Adams, ""fear"" was the weapon used by the evil forces during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to lock down businesses, churches, schools and people. These dark forces are led by Satan and his minions – the globalists. ""The fear was constant. The fear was the weapon. The fear was more dangerous than the virus,"" he said. ""The plandemic wasn't real, but the fear was something that people would make real in their own minds as they allowed themselves to take in the fear because they were not wearing the Armor of God, and they did not have faith in the Armor of God."" Adams reiterated that people must be able to withstand the time of great evil. He expressed optimism by pointing out that people are fighting against this spiritual wickedness. However, many mainstream churches have become vehicles to discourage people from wearing the molecular Armor of God. Ultimately, a person has to make a conscious decision to step forward and choose a path of courage – paying no heed to things that discourage them from doing so. Adams stressed that if people put on the armor, they can stand against this evil. Follow Awakening.news for more stories about Christian beliefs and principles.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-good-side-of-bacteria,The good side of bacteria,1,"Probiotics may help maintain a healthy and happy gut — but make sure you choose the right sources. There are many things in life that can be categorized as coming in both good and bad versions. The same applies to bacteria. Bad bacteria like salmonella and E. coli can make you sick. Good bacteria like the kind in probiotics play an important role in keeping us healthy. These good bacteria interact with the intestinal lining to protect the body from harmful invaders. They help the immune system function properly, which means better ability both to fight infections and to dampen chronic inflammation. Know your bacteria Some research suggests that certain probiotics help relieve symptoms of gut-related conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. ""Many people could probably benefit by increasing their intake of probiotics,"" says Dr. Allan Walker, a professor of nutrition at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""The problem is the unsubstantiated hype that probiotic supplements have far-reaching health potential, which can keep people from choosing the best sources."" There are hundreds of bacteria classified as probiotics, but most come from two main species: Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Within each of these are various strains. There are two ways to get probiotics: fermented foods and over-the-counter products. According to Dr. Walker, fermented foods are the better choices primarily because over-the-counter supplements and formulas aren’t subject to the necessary oversight. (See ""Take care with supplements."") Take care with supplements Probiotics are also found in over-the-counter probiotic supplements and formulas. Most use Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, or a combination. The bacteria are concentrated and then dried to use as powders or in capsules, tablets, lozenges, and even gums. The issue with these products is that they are sold as dietary supplements and therefore don’t require FDA approval. ""So you can never be sure that the label claims about health benefits or the type and number of bacteria per serving are accurate,"" says Dr. Allan Walker, a professor of nutrition at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He advises you to avoid them unless recommended by your doctor. Eat more fermented foods Foods contain probiotics after going through lactofermentation, a process in which bacteria feed on the food’s sugar and starch to create lactic acid, which helps preserve it. Another way to think of lactofermentation is that it transforms one type of food into another kind—for instance, cabbage into sauerkraut, cucumbers into pickles, soybeans into miso, and milk into yogurt. The exact amounts and specific strains of bacteria in fermented foods vary depending on how they are made. Besides probiotics, fermented foods may also contain other valuable nutrients like enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids. How much fermented food do you need to eat for optimal gut health? Unfortunately, there is no recommended daily allowance for probiotics, so it’s uncertain which fermented foods or what amount is ideal, according to Dr. Walker. ""The general recommendation is simply to add more fermented foods to your diet,"" he says. Probiotic Smoothie Smoothies are a quick and easy way to get probiotics. Here is a recipe that is ideal for a breakfast, snack, or post-workout drink. Combine all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Simple Fruit Smoothie 1 cup plain nonfat yogurt 1/4 cup orange juice 1/2 banana, cut into pieces 1/2 cup fresh or frozen blueberries 1/2 cup ice Servings: 1 Serving size: 12 ounces Nutrition: 260 calories, 0.5 g total fat, 0 g saturated fat, 0 mg cholesterol, 110 mg sodium, 42 g total carbohydrate, 3 g fiber, 26 g total sugars (includes 0 g added sugar), 24 g protein Source: The Harvard Medical School 6-Week Plan for Healthy Eating. Many choices There are many fermented foods to choose from. Here are some common ones you can try. Kefir. The tart yogurt-like drink is often made with dairy milk, but also comes in nondairy alternatives, like coconut water, coconut milk, and rice milk. Kefir also comes in fruit and vegetable flavors. Kimchi. Kimchi is a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish. You can find jars of it at most grocery stores or Asian markets. Kombucha. This tangy fermented tea drink is found in many grocery and specialty food stores. Some brands have added sugar, so make sure the label lists no more than 5 grams per serving. Miso. The paste is a staple in Japanese cuisine, especially in soup. It’s made from soybeans fermented with brown rice and has a strong, salty flavor. Pickles. Choose brands brined in water and sea salt instead of vinegar. Vinegar stops good bacteria from growing. Sauerkraut. Select raw or nonpasteurized sauerkraut, which contains more bacteria strains. You can find them in specialty grocery stores. Sourdough bread. This kind of bread is baked with fermented flour. Not all store-bought bread labeled ""sourdough"" uses it, so shop at an artisan bakery or specialty grocery store. Tempeh. Tempeh is a cake made from fermented soybeans with a firmer texture than tofu. It often comes precooked and ready to eat. Yogurt. Some brands include a Live & Active Cultures (LAC) seal from the International Dairy Foods Association. This certifies that the product has been fermented.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-16-singapore-launches-quarantine-and-vaccination-campaign-monkeypox.html,Singapore launches quarantine and vaccination campaign for monkeypox,0,"In response to the global rise in monkeypox cases, Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Sept. 4 that it will be reintroducing mandatory quarantine and vaccination measures – much like those implemented during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This decision follows the World Health Organization 's (WHO) declaration of monkeypox, or mpox, as a public health emergency of international concern in August. (Related: Here comes the fear: The WHO warns that the new mutant strain of monkeypox is an emergency ""for the entire globe."" ) The MOH has categorized mpox cases as Clade I and Clade II. Clade I is considered the more serious strain – with a higher potential for severe outcomes, while Clade II generally results in milder symptoms. The MOH has made it mandatory for all health care providers in Singapore to report mpox cases. To manage the outbreak, designated hospitals in Singapore will test suspected Clade I cases using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. The MOH acknowledged, however, that there are currently no rapid diagnostic tests for mpox that are reliable enough for widespread use. Once a case of Clade I mpox is confirmed, close contacts will be quarantined for 21 days in government-designated facilities. This lengthy quarantine period is reminiscent of Singapore's stringent COVID-19 protocols in 2020 and 2021 that were aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. The ministry emphasized that it is closely monitoring the situation and is prepared to respond swiftly if necessary – working in coordination with international health organizations. Singapore mandating monkeypox vaccinations In addition to quarantine measures, Singapore has authorized the use of the Jynneos vaccine to combat mpox. This vaccine will be administered to two specific groups: healthcare workers who are at the highest risk of exposure and individuals who have been in close contact with confirmed mpox cases. The MOH explained that the Jynneos vaccine is a live attenuated (non-replicating) vaccine. It is recommended that close contacts receive a single dose within 14 days of exposure to reduce the risk of developing the disease. Furthermore, close contacts under quarantine will be offered the vaccine during their isolation period, though details on whether individuals will have the option to refuse the vaccine were not provided. The MOH assured the public that it has an adequate supply of the Jynneos vaccine to meet the current needs of its vaccination strategy. It also pledged to adjust its approach as the situation evolves both locally and globally. As of Aug. 22, Singapore has confirmed 13 cases of mpox in 2024 – all of which were of the less severe Clade II strain. The MOH also confirmed that no cases of the more virulent Clade I strain have been detected in the country so far. However the MOH continues to advise caution and urges travelers to remain vigilant – particularly those returning from regions with high mpox activity. While the threat of mpox, particularly the deadlier Clade 1b strain, remains a global concern, health experts in Singapore have reassured the public that quarantine is unnecessary for returning travelers unless they exhibit symptoms or have been in direct contact with infected individuals.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/dash-diet-even-better-for-womens-hearts,DASH diet even better for women's hearts,1,"Following the DASH diet — long proven to lower blood pressure — may also significantly lower the risk of heart problems, especially in women and Black adults, a new study suggests. The Harvard-led study, published in the Jan. 15, 2023, issue of The American Journal of Cardiology, analyzed data from 459 adults who participated in the original DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) trial between 1994 and 1996, when they were ages 22 through 75. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three eating plans for eight weeks: a typical ""Western"" diet high in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol; a diet rich in fruits and vegetables; and the DASH diet, which emphasizes whole grains, lean protein, nuts, and low-fat dairy in addition to fruits and vegetables. Both the fruit-and-vegetable and DASH diets reduced participants' risk scores for heart problems by 10% over the eight-week period. But those benefits doubled among women and quadrupled among Black people who ate the DASH diet. Since high blood pressure is more strongly associated with heart failure and death in women, researchers said, the findings should help shape our lifestyle choices.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/prediabetes-a-window-of-opportunity,Prediabetes: A window of opportunity,1,"Diabetes gets a lot of attention these days, and for good reason: it can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack, kidney failure, amputation, blindness, and early death. But its precursor, aptly named prediabetes, doesn't get nearly as much airtime, despite affecting three times as many people. One in three American adults — an estimated 96 million people — has prediabetes, which is characterized by blood sugar levels that are higher than the normal range but don't quite reach diabetes status. But the vast majority of people don't know when they have it. And this is where the danger — and opportunity — lie, Harvard experts say. ""As with every chronic, prevalent disease, it's incredibly important to understand who's at particularly high risk of progressing from prediabetes to diabetes,"" says Dr. Giulio Romeo, associate medical director of the Adult Diabetes Section at Harvard-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center. Unlike diabetes, prediabetes is ""largely silent"" and typically doesn't produce blatant symptoms that might clue us in to its presence, Dr. Romeo says. But subtler signs often show up that shouldn't be ignored, offering a valuable window to curb blood sugar levels and halt progression. ""Anyone whose blood sugar falls into the prediabetes range is going in only one direction unless changes are made,"" says Emma Samuels Grinblatas, a registered dietitian and practice manager in the Comprehensive Weight Management Center at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""Genetic and lifestyle factors both play a role in the development of diabetes. Whether we like it or not, our bodies will behave in certain ways. We don't get to play with our genes, but we do get to make changes in our eating behaviors and lifestyle choices."" Risk factors and clues The same factors that play into diabetes development — overweight or obesity, inactivity, and family history — increase the risk of prediabetes. Paying attention to these, along with any persistent fatigue, should alert you that you may be in jeopardy, Dr. Romeo says. Also notice if you're getting more infections—especially vaginal yeast infections. This can happen in women with prediabetes whose blood sugar spikes after meals — perhaps several times a day — but whose fasting glucose levels stay within normal limits (see ""Three types of blood sugar tests""). ""Their response to meals can't be categorized as normal,"" Dr. Romeo says. After eating larger meals, some people with prediabetes also experience repeated urination or blurry vision. These signs, too, are related to temporarily surging blood sugar levels. They also happen to mirror full-blown diabetes symptoms, but on a smaller scale. ""While we like to classify things in buckets, the truth is that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are often on a continuum — it's the same process across different stages,"" Dr. Romeo says. ""Sometimes people are on the brink, so they notice certain signs even if they don't, by the book, have type 2 diabetes."" Three types of blood sugar tests Screening for prediabetes and diabetes relies on tests that measure levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Get tested every two to three years if your prior results are normal and there are no changes in your risk factors, says Dr. Giulio Romeo, associate medical director of the Adult Diabetes Section at Joslin Diabetes Center. This trio of tests can reveal blood sugar levels. Ask your doctor which one — or combination — makes sense for you. Fasting blood glucose. You stop eating eight or more hours before the test, which shows how well your body is able to process blood sugar overnight. A fasting blood sugar level of 99 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or lower is considered normal, 100 to 125 mg/dL indicates prediabetes, and 126 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes. A1c. This reflects your average blood sugar level over the past two or three months. An A1c measurement be-low 5.7% counts as normal, 5.7% to 6.4% indicates prediabetes, and 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes. Glucose tolerance test. This test, done after an overnight fast, involves taking several blood samples before and after you drink a sugary liquid. For a blood sugar measurement taken two hours after drinking the liquid, a level of 140 mg/dL or lower is considered normal, 141 to 199 mg/dL indicates prediabetes, and 200 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes. A variation of this test is used to diagnose diabetes during pregnancy. Frequent movement crucial Lifestyle changes are the cornerstone of measures to prevent prediabetes from progressing, Harvard experts say. A new study, published online Sept. 21, 2022, by BMJ, underscores this concept, suggesting that women who've had a temporary form of diabetes during pregnancy can lower their risk of later developing the disease by 90% by adhering to five key lifestyle factors: healthy weight, high-quality diet, regular physical activity, moderate alcohol consumption, and not smoking. The researchers based their conclusions on an analysis of 28 years of health and lifestyle data on 4,275 women who'd had pregnancy-related diabetes; of these, 924 later developed diabetes. Frequent movement, in particular, is pivotal in staving off the problem. A new study published online Dec. 2, 2022, by The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism suggests that women who take more steps each day may have a lower risk of developing diabetes. Researchers analyzed diabetes rates along with data from wearable fitness devices from 5,677 people (75% women). Participants whose daily step counts averaged 10,700 at the study's start were 44% less likely to develop diabetes over the following four years compared with those who averaged only 6,000 steps per day. ""Regular exercise plays a profound role on blood sugar,"" Grinblatas says. ""The recommendation of 30 minutes of exercise at least five days a week can be broken down into 10-minute increments and include things like walking, yard work, and dancing. Any form of exercise is good for our bodies and brains."" And exercise pays off well beyond a shrinking waistline for people at risk of diabetes. ""Exercise alone often won't result in weight loss,"" Dr. Romeo says, ""but it has significant benefits that can't be measured by the scale — not just in terms of preventing progression to diabetes, but on your heart, mood, and many aspects of overall health not captured by a change in your weight."" Along with lifestyle changes, the drug metformin can boost diabetes prevention efforts for some people with obesity. Metformin lowers blood sugar levels by improving the way the body shuttles sugar from the blood into the cells of muscles and other tissues, where it's used as fuel. Research shows metformin reduces the odds prediabetes will progress to diabetes by about one-third, Dr. Romeo says, though lifestyle interventions work even better — lowering the chance of progression by about 60%. ""For some, maybe the focus is not about losing weight, but how you should exercise at whatever level you can — looking at this not as a sprint but as something you can incorporate into your routine over the years,"" he says. Diet and diabetes: It's complicated Some people believe eating desserts — or foods containing processed sugar — can give them diabetes. But it's not that simple, says Emma Samuels Grinblatas, a registered dietitian at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Type 2 diabetes results from a combination of two processes. First, the body becomes resistant to the hormone insulin and can't use it properly to carry glucose (sugar) from the blood into cells. In turn, the pancreas can't keep up with producing more and more insulin. But someone without diabetes who eats a few cookies or a piece of cake shouldn't have a problem, because her pancreas is working normally and can handle the task. Grinblatas says many of her patients with diabetes have been ""made to believe sugar is something they cannot have. But that's not the case,"" she says. ""Nothing is inherently bad. It's all about balance."" Indeed, glucose is an energy source our body needs. While you should check food labels for sugar content, Grinblatas says it's just as important to monitor carbohydrate consumption — which can also cause blood glucose to rise — if you're concerned about diabetes. A new study suggests that a low-carbohydrate diet may quickly bring elevated A1c levels (a measure of blood sugar over the prior several months) back to a healthier range. Published online Oct. 26, 2022, by JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed 150 older adults (75% women) with untreated prediabetes or less-severe diabetes over six months, randomly assigning half to a low-carb diet and frequent dietary counseling and the rest to their usual diet. ""Many of my patients work hard to reduce their sugar intake but still have a very high carb load,"" she says. ""If you're having a bagel or breakfast bar in the morning, try having an egg, unsweetened yogurt, or old-fashioned oatmeal and put in some fruit or chopped nuts. A nice balance of carbs, healthy fats, and protein slows down digestion and helps people feel full."" Image: © Alistair Berg/Getty Images",7,0.17422967,0.24421723,False

In a recent interview with CNBC , Gates explained that while he is a vaccine absolutist, he feels much different about free speech and the First Amendment, which he wants to see curtailed through whatever means possible. Gates feels as though the U.S. Constitution and its free speech protections are no longer applicable, and that ""boundaries"" and ""rules"" are needed to stop the spread of ""misinformation"" online and elsewhere. The best way to rein in what people are allowed to say is to deploy an army of AI robots to immediately and in real time identify and remove everything from the internet that Gates and his friends feel constitutions ""fake news"" or ""incorrect information."" ""We should have free speech, but if you're inciting violence, if you're causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries that even the U.S. should have rules?"" Gates blathered during the interview. ""And then if you have rules, what is it?"" (Related: Did you know that Bill Gates is chomping at the bit to unleash climate ""vaccines"" on humanity?) Who does Bill Gates think he is? When pressed about who should have the authority to regulate speech, Gates was a bit more elusive, though he seems to think that he and people who think the same way as him should hold the levers of power. ""Is there some AI that encodes those rules because you have billions of activity [sic] and if you catch it a day later, the harm is done,"" Gates commented. Gates thinks so highly of himself and his own viewpoints and opinions that he is on a press tour right now promoting a new Netflix ""docuseries"" called ""What's Next? The Future with Bill Gates"" that we are told will have at least five parts. The guy apparently fails to realize that nobody likes him or cares what he thinks, but when has a billionaire ever been in touch with reality? Perhaps Americans would do well to consider ""the past with Bill Gates"" before they decide to take the plunge with him into some dystopian future ruled by AI robots with programmed censorship as their primary mission. ""We can see Windows, which he now tells CNBC he was allegedly naïve about and thought it would only be used for 'productive and responsible purposes' as most people would want to have a computer at home,"" writes Didi Rankovic for Reclaim the Net . ""What they got with Windows, however, is a problem in its own way, – while Microsoft was seen by critics as going after open-source competition like a monopolistic, anti-competitive corporate bully. But here is Gates now, to tell us what our future should look like."" Last year on his blog, Gates declared that ""The Age of AI has begun."" In a post, he wrote that AI ""will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other."" ""Entire industries will reorient around it,"" Gates added. ""Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it."" Gates feels as though AI can help children get a better education, especially ""Black, Latino, and low-income students."" ""AI can help turn that trend around,"" Gates contends. The biggest area where Gates wants AI to take control is with climate change. Gates believes that AI programmed to address ""the injustice of"" climate change will ""make the world more equitable.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/taking-charge-of-prostate-cancer,Taking charge of prostate cancer,1,"More men with low-risk prostate cancer choose active surveillance over immediate treatment with radiation, hormonal therapy, or surgery. With active surveillance, men monitor their cancer and don’t seek treatment unless it becomes worse. ""Active surveillance can help men analyze their situation before deciding to have invasive procedures and treatments, which can lead to side effects that can affect quality of life and may not improve life expectancy,"" says Dr. Frank McGovern, a urologist with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""But it is also an opportunity for men to re-evaluate their lifestyle and make changes that may improve their cancer prognosis and ensure their life is the healthiest it can be."" Going by the numbers Generally, active surveillance is an option for men with low-grade cancer (cancer confined to the prostate gland and less likely to spread), meaning those with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of less than 10 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) and a Gleason score of 6 or less. High-grade and many intermediate-grade prostate cancers don’t qualify for active surveillance, and treatment for them usually begins immediately. Another group who are not good candidates for active surveillance are men with a family history of lethal prostate cancer and those with a BRCA gene mutation, especially BRCA2, which is linked with a higher risk for prostate cancer. A blood test measures PSA, a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. The Gleason system involves ranking the two most common types of cancer cells in a man’s biopsied tissue on a 5-point scale. The two rankings are added together to get a Gleason score, with 10 being the highest. The higher the number, the greater the chance the cancer will quickly grow and spread. Men on active surveillance get a periodic PSA test and digital rectal exam in which the doctor feels for abnormal areas on the prostate. These are usually scheduled every six months. A repeat biopsy is done one year after the initial diagnosis and then three years after that. Further biopsies are done at the guidance of the patient and his doctor. Your doctor may also order a prostate MRI during the monitoring phase. ""In general, the higher a man’s PSA level, the greater likelihood he has prostate cancer,"" says Dr. McGovern. ""Also, a significant rise in PSA levels over the course of a year may be a sign of cancer."" If PSA levels rise or if a new or enlarging growth is detected during the rectal exam, your doctor will likely recommend a prostate biopsy sooner than normal protocol to check whether the cancer has become more aggressive. ""If the biopsy doesn’t show concerning changes, you and your doctor may decide to continue with active surveillance, but if it does, or you have an increase in prostate volume or a higher Gleason score, your doctor may suggest moving forward with surgery, radiation, or hormonal therapy,"" says Dr. McGovern. Steps of action Like any medical procedure, active surveillance has its risks. ""The most serious of these is underestimating the cancer’s growth until it becomes life-threatening, although this occurs in a small percentage of men,"" says Dr. McGovern. Another drawback is psychological — the constant worry, stress, and anxiety that the cancer can worsen because you are not seeking treatment. One way to alleviate these feelings is to embrace a take-charge attitude about your health. ""Instead of waiting to see if their prostate cancer worsens, men can take steps to improve their cancer situation and even protect themselves from other health issues, like heart attacks and strokes,"" says Dr. McGovern. ""This can empower men and give them a better sense of control over their condition."" He offers these suggestions: Increase exercise intensity. A study published Aug. 19, 2021, in JAMA Oncology found that men on active surveillance lowered their PSA levels and cancer cell growth after doing 30 minutes of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on a treadmill three times a week for 12 weeks. In HIIT, you alternate between periods of intense aerobic output and rest. In this study, the men repeated a pattern of two minutes of HIIT followed by two minutes of recovery. Other research has found that men with prostate cancer who engaged most frequently in vigorous activity had a 30% lower risk of developing advanced cancer and a 25% lower risk of developing lethal cancer when compared with men who exercised the least. Examples of vigorous activities include running, cycling, swimming, and racquet sports. (Make sure to check with your doctor before embarking on any kind of exercise program.) Watch your cholesterol. Studies have found that men who take cholesterol-lowering statins may have a lower risk of advanced prostate cancer. Statin use has also been associated with longer survival among men with prostate cancer. ""Get your cholesterol levels checked, and if they are high, consult your doctor about whether to take statins,"" says Dr. McGovern. Manage your weight. Weight gain is linked with more aggressive cancer. ""Even losing five to 10 extra pounds can help lower your risk,"" says Dr. McGovern. A healthier weight also keeps blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control. Eat a plant-based diet. Although it’s unclear whether specific dietary habits can influence prostate cancer growth, Dr. McGovern has found his patients do much better when they follow a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean or MIND diet. He recommends consulting a nutritionist who can offer guidance on meal planning. Consider therapy. Your anxiety about active surveillance may be associated with something else. ""A therapist can help you explore where your anxiety lies and what may be driving it,"" says Dr. McGovern. ""Addressing any issues can help relieve your uncertainty or hesitation about active surveillance."" Image: © skynesher/Getty Images",7,-0.082504004,0.052187935,False

A report published Sept. 9 in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) disclosed the extent of this corruption by Big Pharma. The said piece was written by Alice Fabbri of the University of Bath in the United Kingdom and Quinn Grundy of the University of Toronto in Canada. ""Drug and medical device industries globally continue to target clinicians early in their careers – including during periods of training – to cultivate long-term, reciprocal relationships through payments, free meals and sponsored education,"" they wrote. ""Industry influence still threatens the integrity of healthcare and harms patients."" One study cited by Fabbri and Grundy examined payments to more than 5,000 cardiology fellows in the United States. The said paper published Sept. 1 in JAMA Internal Medicine looked at these fellows before and after graduating from medical school. The study found that of the more than 5,000 cardiology fellows examined, 73 percent received ""industry marketing payments"" (IMPs) in the year before graduating. Meanwhile, 88 percent received IMPs in the first few years after they graduated. (Related: 65% of doctors are getting cash ""kickbacks"" from big pharma. ) ""IMPs to physicians may compromise the objectivity and integrity of clinical decision-making, playing a role in non-recommended care, higher health costs and reduced patient trust,"" the JAMA Internal Medicine study stated. ""Payments to trainees merit scrutiny because these payments may be formative on future practice."" Fabbri and Grundy also referenced an internal company document from the late 1990s, which outlined a plan "" to influence physicians from the bottom up ."" The said memo published by drugmaker Parke-Davis sought to solidify the company's ""role in the resident's mind as [they evolve] into a practicing physician."" According to the BMJ piece, the Parke-Davis memo reportedly became public ""through litigation around off-label drug promotion."" Drug company Warner-Lambert acquired Parke-Davis in the 1970s, and Pfizer later acquired Warner-Lambert in 2000 – with Parke-Davis included in the deal. Separate study finds 12 categories of IMPs (read: bribes) to doctors Meanwhile, a study published December 2018 in the Journal of Osteopathic Medicine (JOM) scrutinized data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Open Payments database for calendar year 2015. The study authors found that almost 82,000 payments were made to approximately 12,000 cardiologists. These IMPs for 2015 amounted to a total of $13.9 million. The authors of the December 2018 study also found that upon closer scrutiny, IMPs to cardiologists fell into one of 12 categories . The categories are as follows: Charitable contribution Compensation for services other than consulting, including serving as faculty or as a speaker at a venue other than a continuing education program Compensation for serving as faculty or as a speaker for a non-accredited and non-certified continuing education program Consulting fee Education Entertainment Food and beverage Gift Grant Honoraria Royalty or license Travel and lodging The JOM study also noted that a total of 45 companies submitted payments to a cardiologist for the year 2015. Anglo-Swedish drug company AstraZeneca made the highest overall payments, which were valued at $7.2 million. Its IMPs accounted for 51.85 percent of total payments to cardiologists for that year. Fabbri and Grundy noted, citing other papers on the matter, that IMPs influence doctors' decision making. ""Even the receipt of low value industry-sponsored meals is associated with increased prescribing of the promoted brand name medication,"" they wrote. The two ultimately warned in their BMJ report that increased drug promotion as a result of IMPs to doctors can negatively affect patients' health ""by contributing to over-, under- and mistreatment.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-15-kamala-supports-taxpayer-funded-transition-prisoners-migrants.html,CONFIRMED: Kamala Harris supports taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners and detained migrants,0,"A resurfaced 2019 American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) questionnaire with answers from Vice President Kamala Harris has revealed her support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for detained immigrants and federal prisoners . Harris completed the ACLU questionnaire while she was running to win the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2020 presidential election. The questionnaire started making the rounds in August as Harris' campaign for the 2024 election took off. In the questionnaire, Harris was asked if, as president, she would use executive authority to ensure transgender and nonbinary people under state care, including those in prisons and immigration detention centers, have access to comprehensive medical treatments associated with gender transition. (Related: Kamala Harris to reduce illegal immigration by LEGALIZING it, not stopping it .) Harris affirmed her support, stating, ""Yes."" ""It is important that transgender individuals who rely on the state for care receive the treatment they need, which includes access to treatment associated with gender transition. That’s why, as Attorney General, I pushed the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to provide gender transition surgery to state inmates,"" she explained in a detailed follow-up. ""Transition treatment is a medical necessity, and I will direct all federal agencies responsible for providing essential medical care to deliver transition treatment."" 2019 ACLU questionnaire reveals Harris' stance on other left-wing issues The 2019 ACLU questionnaire also revealed Harris' stance on several left-wing issues . Besides endorsing surgeries for transgender detainees, Harris also voiced support for decriminalizing federal drug possession for personal use and substantial cuts to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) funding, including a pledge to ""end"" immigration detention. In that same questionnaire, Harris advocated for ending immigration detention facilities and private prisons, reducing funding for ICE and halting ICE detainers. Harris described the U.S. immigrant detention system as ""out of control"" and called for an end to the ""unfair incarceration"" of thousands of individuals, families and children. Harris also cited her early opposition to increased ICE funding following the election of former President Donald Trump in 2017. In 2018, Harris introduced the Detention Oversight, Not Expansion (DONE) Act, which seeks to increase oversight of ICE detention facilities, reduce detention by at least 50 percent and prevent the construction or expansion of new facilities. She also pledged to end the use of ICE detainers at the time. ""As president, I will focus enforcement on increasing public safety, not tearing apart immigrant families. This includes requiring ICE to obtain a warrant where probable cause exists as to end the use of detainers,"" she wrote. The questionnaire also revealed Harris' progressive stance on drug policy reform. She called for the decriminalization of all drug possession for personal use and co-sponsored the Marijuana Justice Act to legalize marijuana federally. In her response to the ACLU, Harris stressed treating drug addiction as a public health issue rather than a criminal one. ""Throughout my career, I have supported treating drug addiction as a public health issue, focusing on rehabilitation over incarceration for drug-related offenses,"" she wrote.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/fighting-the-most-common-skin-cancers,Fighting the most common skin cancers,1,"Heading outside on a sunny day is a bit like going into battle. To protect your skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, you’ll need armor (sunscreen or sunblock, and sun-protective clothing), tactical strategy (avoiding peak sun hours), and a place to retreat (the shade) — especially during the summer months, when UV intensity is highest. Mind you, we need a little sunshine on our skin to trigger the production of vitamin D, keep bones strong, and possibly help regulate mood and ward off illness. But unprotected UV exposure can cause skin cancers. The most common of these are non-melanoma skin cancers. What are they? To put it simply, non-melanoma skin cancers aren’t melanomas — the aggressive skin cancers that account for just 1% of all skin cancer cases, yet cause the majority of skin cancer deaths in the United States. Extremely aggressive non-melanoma skin cancers are rare. Instead, the most common types, affecting millions of people per year, are slow-growing. They develop in basal cells (basal cell carcinomas, or BCCs) or squamous cells (squamous cell carcinomas, or SCCs). These cancers don’t usually spread to other parts of the body, and they aren’t usually life-threatening. But they can be quite dangerous. ""Small skin cancers can bleed, hurt, and eat away at your skin. If left untreated, they can erode through important structures like your nose, eyes, bones, or muscles. If they become very large, they can spread, and in rare cases cause death,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Symptoms While non-melanoma skin cancers can develop anywhere on the body, they typically show up in areas that have been exposed to the sun, such as the head, face, neck, ears, lips, arms, legs, or hands. The cancers may look like flat areas that differ only slightly from healthy skin, or they may have distinguishing features. SCCs can be scaly patches, crusty sores, or wart-like bumps. BCCs often have raised edges, a sunken center, and visible blood vessels. They also can look like a pale scar, a sore that won’t heal, a reddish patch, or a bump that might have a number of colors (red, blue, brown, or black). Melanomas usually have brown, black, or blue pigment of uneven color, jagged edges, and an asymmetrical shape. They can be flat or lumpy. Many people have small brown, black, or blue spots on their skin (lentigos), but their color is even, their edges are smooth, and their shape is symmetrical. Lentigos can turn into melanomas, so pigmented spots that start to change color or shape need to be evaluated. Diagnosis BCCs and SCCs are often found early (by you or your doctor), when they are easiest to treat. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will take a look at a new or changing skin growth under a powerful magnifier. If the area looks suspicious, your doctor might remove a sample of the tissue (a biopsy) and send it to a lab for analysis. If the sample is positive for BCC or SCC, the cancer will need to be removed. For large tumors, ask your doctor about additional testing. ""For SCCs that are bigger than a quarter, my recommendation is to ask your doctor about getting your lymph nodes checked to make sure the cancer hasn’t spread,"" Dr. Waldman says. Treatment Non-melanoma skin cancer treatment depends on a cancer’s specific type and features. ""For instance, an in situ [contained and not spreading] SCC on the cheek may be treated with a prescription cream. But an invasive SCC on the cheek would need to be removed with Mohs surgery,"" Dr. Waldman says. Mohs micrographic surgery involves removing cancer a little bit at a time, to preserve as much healthy skin as possible. Each piece is checked immediately under a microscope. Once the edges are free of cancer, the surgery is complete. ""Mohs surgery is usually reserved for invasive skin cancers in areas that are cosmetically sensitive — on the face, scalp, neck — or on functional areas like the hands, feet, and genitals, or with very aggressive or large tumors on the trunk or extremities,"" Dr. Waldman says. If Mohs surgery isn’t necessary, the skin cancer may be cut or scraped out with surgical tools, frozen, or destroyed with radiation. The encouraging news is that most SCCs and BCCs can be cured when they’re treated early. Develop your battle plan The best weapon to fight skin cancer is a strict regimen of prevention and detection. It should include the following steps. Cover up. Apply sunscreen or sunblock with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 to 50 before you go outside. Protect your lips with a sun protection product made for them. If possible, wear a long-sleeved shirt, pants, a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, shoes, and socks. Avoid direct sunlight. Stay out of the sun when it’s strongest (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), and seek the shade as much as possible. Be vigilant about detection. Schedule annual skin check-ups with your doctor, and conduct your own exams at home each month. Don’t forget your scalp and all the back surfaces of your body. A mirror (or a loved one) can help you check your back and other areas you can’t see well. Be proactive. Call your doctor if you find any new skin growth that looks suspicious. ""We need to see you before tumors grow and become a problem,"" Dr. Waldman says. Image: © Jim Bastardo/Getty Images",0,0.05303568,-0.09206138,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-i-get-a-calcium-score,Should I get a calcium score?,1,"Q. I'm wondering if I should get a test to check my calcium score. I'm 52 and in good health. My LDL cholesterol level is normal (97 mg/dL), but my father had a heart attack in his late 40s. A. The artery-clogging plaque that builds up inside the heart's arteries contains cholesterol, inflammatory cells, scar tissue, and calcium. A coronary artery calcium scan (often called a calcium score) uses a special type of CT scan to look for that calcium, which is then quantified on a scale from zero to over 1,000. A score of zero indicates no calcified plaque. The higher the score, the more plaque is present. Findings from large studies link higher calcium scores to a higher risk of a heart attack or stroke. While a calcium score can be informative, the scans don't make sense for everyone. Not all cholesterol plaques have become calcified in younger people, so the scans aren't usually recommended for people under 40. Anyone who already has known heart disease doesn't need a calcium scan. That's because the results likely wouldn't change a doctor's treatment recommendations, which would very likely include a statin. However, if you're at risk for heart disease but don't have any symptoms, knowing your calcium score can help you decide whether to start taking a statin. Statins can help lower your risk of heart disease even if your LDL cholesterol is in the normal range. Current guidelines suggest that people estimate their 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease with a calculator from the American College of Cardiology, available at /ascvd. Statins are recommended for people with a score of 7.5% or higher. However, the score doesn't capture other possible situations that may elevate your risk — which include a family history of premature heart disease (defined as coronary artery disease occurring in men younger than 55 or women younger than 65). Calcium scans are readily available, quick, and painless. For the test, you simply lie on your back. The scanner then takes multiple pictures of your heart over the course of about five minutes. It involves some radiation exposure, although not as much as a standard CT scan. The cost (around $100) is usually covered by insurance. But keep in mind that the test isn't mandatory. Another option is to skip the test and simply start taking a statin. But for someone like you, who may have inherited a higher-than-normal heart disease risk, a calcium scan can give you a better sense of your risk and inform your doctor's advice.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-12-moderna-admits-covid-vaccine-injections-cause-cancer.html,Moderna admits in patent filings that its mRNA COVID-19 injections can cause CANCER,0,"Cambridge, Massachusetts-based vaccine maker Moderna has confirmed that its mRNA Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) injections could cause cancer . The company made this admission in patent filings disclosed by Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology, during a hearing led by U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). According to Malone, Moderna's patent shows that its vaccine contains billions of DNA fragments and other contaminants linked to birth defects and cancer. The expert also mentioned that Moderna's patent acknowledges that RNA is preferable to DNA in vaccines. However, the vaccine maker also acknowledges the contamination risk involved with its COVID-19 vaccine that was injected into the arms of millions. Malone testified: ""Moderna has a patent on the use of RNA for vaccines. And in that, Moderna explicitly acknowledges that RNA is superior to DNA for vaccine purposes [despite] problems, including the possibility of insertional mutagenesis that could lead to the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. ""[The Food and Drug Administration ] FDA says they're not aware of any concerns. But Moderna, in its own patent, lays out exactly the same concerns that exist about DNA. So Moderna knows it – DNA is a contaminant . ""It is left in because of the way they make it. They use DNA to make RNA, and then they degrade the DNA. [Afterward,] they have to purify the degraded DNA away from the RNA – and the process they are using is not that good."" According to the Daily Expose , scientists from the U.S. and Canada managed to procure unopened vials of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine with a clear chain of custody. They proceeded to take samples from these and examine them, discovering large numbers of DNA fragments in the RNA preparation. The scientists then applied standard reconstruction tools to see what the circular plasmid DNAs looked like. According to Malone, the findings suggest the presence of certain DNA sequences in the vials normally not allowed in anything that is going to go into humans – ""not the least of which is an antibiotic resistance gene."" Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine also loaded with cancer-causing CONTAMINANTS ""They include these sequences from Simian Virus 40 (SV40) – not the whole virus, but highly active promoter sequences. [This] is exactly the thing that the FDA, in their older regulations, said must be avoided because it confers even more risk for insertional mutagenesis,"" the mRNA vaccine technology inventor noted. But the problem isn't just present in Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 injection. Pfizer's mRNA vaccine, produced in cooperation with German company BioNTech, also contained the same contaminants. The New York-based Pfizer provided documentation about its COVID-19 injection to regulators in the U.S., Europe and Canada. However, the regulators deleted the little notation about SV40 sequences Pfizer wrote in filings – apparently in an attempt to hide it from the public. ""The FDA didn't take the raw DNA sequences, reconstruct those plasmid maps, and look at them themselves,"" Malone clarified. ""They just took for granted what Pfizer had given them. And now this is all coming out because of what these researchers found."" (Related: Health Canada confirms that Pfizer COVID-19 injections contain SV40 DNA sequence that can cause CANCER. ) According to Malone, high-level people at both Moderna and Pfizer had to have known the dangers their COVID-19 vaccines pose to the world. The potential consequences for those injected with the poison shot include ""anything that is associated with DNA damage, i.e., birth defects and cancer being the most notable ones.""

More than 1.7 million activity logs including psychological profiles and therapy sessions for thousands of patients, including ""telehealth"" audio and video files, were included in the leak, as were patient driver's licenses. Since first getting off the ground in 2018, Confidant has been promising to build ""the next-generation of virtual care"" for mental health patients seeking treatment for addictions and behavioral problems. Instead, Confidant botched the security of its confidential patient files by storing them in a ""non-password-protected database."" Confidant currently offers clinical services to patients in Connecticut, Florida, New Hampshire, Virginia and Texas. The Confidant Health app is available on both the iOS (Apple) and Android (Google) platforms, having been downloaded some 10,000 times in the Google Play Store. (Related: Did you know that ""nearly all"" AT&T customers were hacked in a data breach earlier this summer?) People's deepest, darkest secrets shared with the world Cybersecurity expert Jeremiah Fowler is credited with discovering the leak. He commented that the patient audio and video files contain ""some heartbreaking, really painful family trauma, personal trauma."" ""It's almost like having your deepest, darkest secrets that you've told your diary revealed,"" he added. ""It's things that you never want to get out."" As a show of respect for professional ethics, Fowler chose not to download any of the private medical information. He also did not attempt to access the password-protected databases, though he did say that a dedicated hacker could easily break in if he or she was so inclined. ""Cyber criminals have a range of tools at their disposal including brute force attacks and social engineering attempts that could potentially result in unauthorized access to those protected files and documents,"" Fowler further said. What Fowler did observe as part of his investigation was a trove of publicly visible patient documents that are clearly labeled as things like psychotherapy intake notes and professional assessments on individual patient health. There are also documents outlining patient histories of mental health, substance abuse, family issues, psychiatric history and other problems. There were also many other files included in the leak such as administrative documents and verification records, i.e., state-issued identification and insurance cards. Other files include drug tests, some with Personally Identifiable Information (PII), that show positive results for substances like cannabis and alcohol. Much of the leaked data had been collected by Confidant's proprietary chatbots and artificial intelligence (AI), meaning robots rather than humans were in charge of it. Confidant has long bragged about its advanced chatbots and AI programs, which the company claims are pros rather than cons. ""A data-centric environment like the one we are constructing lends itself to leveraging AI to make predictive suggestions,"" said Confidant's co-founder Sam Arsenault Wilson in a 2022 interview. ""That's where we're headed once the data reaches proper scale."" In a report he compiled for the security website vpnMentor, Fowler noted that in a random sampling of data he reviewed, the open and publicly accessible files ""contained what could be considered a very serious potential risk to the personal privacy and PII of those individuals."" Of the approximately 1,000 files he personally reviewed to better understand how the data breach occurred in the first place, Fowler revealed that he ""was able to view using only a web browser,"" meaning anyone can access the leaked files without any understanding of hacking. Fowler made note of the fact that maintaining an exposed database of documents without password protection like Confidant has been doing is highly unusual, especially in the healthcare industry.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-11-republican-governors-will-not-comply-pandemic-treaty.html,26 Republican governors tell WHO they will not comply with Pandemic Treaty,0,"Twenty-six governors in the United States have publicly declared their opposition to the World Health Organization's (WHO) attempt at controlling the public health policies of America through its global Pandemic Treaty . ""The World Health Organization is attempting one world control over health policy with their new 'Pandemic Agreement.' Twenty-four Republican governors expressed concern over this development in a joint letter in May. Put simply, Republican governors will not comply ,"" the 26 governors, who are all Republicans, and the Republican Governors Association said in their joint statement released on August 29. (Related: Dr. Meryl Nass warns: WHO pandemic treaty is about global dominion by the few and total control of the masses .) In a May 22 letter to President Joe Biden , 24 Republican governors stated their concerns about the WHO's proposal. As stated in the letter, the WHO's proposed treaty would ""empower the WHO, particularly its uncontrollable director-general, with the authority to restrict the rights of U.S. citizens, including freedoms such as speech, privacy, travel, choice of medical care and informed consent, thus violating our Constitution's core principles."" Over the past two years, the WHO has been attempting to pass the Pandemic Treaty. In December 2021, the World Health Assembly established an intergovernmental negotiating body to create an international document under the WHO constitution to strengthen the agency's pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. The U.S. federal government has backed the initiative with the Biden administration participating in negotiations with the World Health Assembly as one of the intergovernmental negotiating bodies. The WHO issued a second draft of the Pandemic Treaty in October 2023. Even though WHO negotiators disagreed on a final draft of the agreement during the latest World Health Assembly session, they did approve a set of amendments to the WHO's International Health Regulations. American states' actions ""central"" to defeating WHO's Pandemic Treaty push Dr. Meryl Nass, in an interview with The Defender , stated that the action taken by American states was ""central"" to defeating the WHO plan to centralize control of public health during declared emergencies. ""Children's Health Defense and Door to Freedom were central in devising this strategy. The Constitution's 10th Amendment reserves for the states all powers that were not specifically granted to the central government. Healthcare was never a federal authority,"" Nass said. ""Therefore, we urged citizens to contact their attorneys general, governors, legislators – and federal officials – to demand they not turn over authority for health to the WHO."" In May, in addition to 24 governors writing their letter of opposition, 49 senators called on the Biden administration to reject the WHO agreement. Moreover, 22 attorneys general informed Biden they would ""resist any attempt to enable the WHO to directly or indirectly set public policy for our citizens."" Several American states which include Utah, Florida, Louisiana and Oklahoma wrote a bill to prevent the WHO from overriding states' authority on matters of public health policy. ""I am certain that these efforts reverberated around the world and helped lead to rejection,"" Nass stated of the WHO's proposals.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-11-vaxxed-3-exposes-widespread-injuries-deaths-covid-shots.html,"Coming Sept. 18: ‘Vaxxed 3 exposes widespread injuries, deaths following COVID shots, hospital protocols",0,"A team from Children’s Health Defense (CHD) last year spent nine months traversing the country in a bus, collecting testimonies from families, medical professionals, whistleblowers and others whose lives were devastated by injury and death following COVID-19 vaccines and hospital treatment protocols. (Article by Brenda Baletti, Ph.D. republished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org ) A new documentary, “ Vaxxed 3 : Authorized to Kill,” premiering in theaters across the country on Sept. 18, compiles clips from over a thousand interviews with the everyday people who visited the bus to share their stories. The interviews reveal a radical consistency in the experiences related by those who were injured and by the families who lost their loved ones and in the descriptions of abuse and neglect perpetrated by practitioners and hospitals. “These were fundamental violations of human rights,” said Kim Mack Rosenberg, CHD general counsel. The film opens with mainstream media clips from throughout the pandemic reporting information that was later proven untrue — that COVID-19 vaccines were safe and effective, would stop transmission and end the pandemic, and that the unvaccinated were responsible for the vaccines’ failures. The information circulating in the media “didn’t add up,” said Polly Tommey, director of CHD.TV who led the project. So, she thought, “There’s only one thing left to do. We need to get on a bus and get back out on the road and find out what is going on because only the people will tell us the truth.” In the film, the bus interviews are interwoven with commentary from top legal and medical experts, including CHD CEO Mary Holland, Mack Rosenberg, Dr. Pierre Kory, Dr. Paul Marik, Dr. Paul Thomas, Dr. Ryan Cole, CHD Chief Scientific Officer Brian Hooker, and others. Together, they offer insight into the lies told by public health officials, the profit incentives, the coercion and the “unrelenting propaganda and censorship” that led to what Tommey called “mass murder on a level that is difficult to comprehend.” Vaccine-injured people and their families share stories of paralysis, myocarditis , cancer , seizures, organ failure, Guillain Barré , postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and other adverse reactions . Many broke down in tears, some even experienced physical symptoms from their injuries during their interviews. They also shared their desperation. “This is not a quality of life,” one woman cried. “It is when you start thinking, OK, how do I end my life?” ‘There was so much death’ Families of those who lost husbands, wives and children sobbed as they shared stories of being separated from their loved ones who were left to die alone. “My father died alone in the worst possible way,” one woman told Tommy. “And it’s horrible because there’s no accountability and the guilt and regrets are left to us.” They told stories of following doctors’ recommendations and taking loved ones who were mildly ill with low oxygen into the hospital where they were put on ventilators or a cocktail of heavy drugs against their will and then died . Families reported that they weren’t informed their loved ones were being treated with heavy drugs. “I’m the healthcare power of attorney,” said one father, whose daughter died after five days on Precedex — which according to its label should not be administered for more than 24 hours. “Why wasn’t I told what they’re doing?” In an emotional testimonial, a medical coder and whistleblower — who reviewed patient records and assigned codes for diagnoses and treatments that allowed hospitals and physicians to get paid — explained how financial incentives for hospitals treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19 led to mass testing. Positive COVID-19 tests were used to justify the use of ventilators — even when hospitals realized they were killing people — and the administration of remdesivir , which is known to cause kidney damage. Even the World Health Organization recommended against the use of remdesivir after finding no evidence that it improved outcomes. Yet Dr. Anthony Fauci determined it should be the standard of care in U.S. hospitals — at more than $3,000 per patient . Interviewees reported their loved ones were put on the drug and then died. Nurses told Tommey in interviews that they saw the same thing happen over and over. “The majority of hospital deaths “were actually caused by Anthony Fauci,” Cole said, because his National Institutes of Health issued protocols that, if adhered to by hospitals, led to “big bonuses, lots of money.” “I knew they were killing people in the hospital,” the medical coder said. “I would cry myself to sleep at night … There was so much death. It was almost unbearable.” “It’s unbelievable,” Tommy said. “You may be watching this right now and say, can’t be. I wouldn’t have believed it myself if I hadn’t heard it. Not once, twice, but hundreds and hundreds of times. And still now as I’m doing this interview, I have 40, 50 a week interviews of COVID hospital protocol deaths . How many did they kill?” Doctors and nurses provided detailed insight into the complex billing process that generated large profits for pharmaceutical companies and hospitals. Many of them also shared how their care strategies changed, as they tried to help patients avoid hospitals. “We’d do anything we could to keep people out of the hospital,” one doctor said. “I was managing acutely ill people at their home, going to their home, doing whatever I needed to do to treat them,” said another. The film also covers the suppression of unprofitable treatments shown to be effective, including ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine — compiling clips from mainstream media calling it a horse drug and interviews with families detailing how their appeals for the drugs were denied and mocked. “They politicized it and demonized it,” Kory said, talking about ivermectin. “And many, many, many people died needless deaths because they didn’t know of its efficacy.” Kory called the media’s treatment of the drug a “disinformation campaign,” which he said was equally deployed around the vaccine and the demonization of the unvaccinated. Because of that demonization, he added, the unvaccinated weren’t afforded the same care as the vaccinated when they did go to hospitals. “So the patients were undertreated, mistreated, maltreated and died because of money. And it boils down to that. It really boils down to that,” Cole said. The film also honors the brave healthcare workers who did care for people, those who resisted the pressure to comply and offers hope for a growing number of people who have “woken up” to the dangers of a corrupt public health system, willing to sacrifice people to dangerous healthcare protocols for profit . “Thank God for those brave nurses that spoke about the disgustingness that went on the hospital because they really validated what the parents and the people who lost loved ones were saying,” one interviewee said. “Many lost their licenses and were told they would never work in healthcare again because of spreading misinformation. But they were just telling us simply what they saw,” she said. Another said she was scared for the future of medicine. “Now we are left with medical facilities full of people who don’t have a backbone to stand up and do the right thing.” Tommy said the people interviewed on the bus tour were just a fraction of those who have suffered and it is important to keep gathering and sharing their stories and raising awareness. “We are 8 billion people against a few thousand controligarchs ,” Holland said. “We will win this.” “We will continue, Children’s Health Defense will continue, until there is justice and this never ever happens again,” said Tommey.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/a-closer-look-at-good-cholesterol,A closer look at good cholesterol,1,"Managing blood cholesterol levels is one way to avoid cardiovascular disease and protect against heart attacks and strokes. Doctors concentrate on helping men lower their blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol. Too much LDL in the bloodstream can create plaque buildup inside arteries. If this buildup blocks blood flow to the heart or brain, the result is a heart attack or stroke. Your goal level for LDL depends on your risk factor profile. In general, the lower the number, the better. If you already have cardiovascular disease or are at high risk for it, you should aim for an LDL of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). For people at average risk, achieving a level of less than 100 mg/dL with lifestyle changes is excellent. You and your doctor can decide if you need a statin or other medication to lower your LDL further. But what about LDL's cholesterol counterpart, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the ""good"" cholesterol? ""HDL tends to get lost in the cholesterol conversation, but it plays a vital role in heart health, so it's important to also monitor HDL while you manage LDL,"" says Dr. Frank Sacks, professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. When is good HDL too good? HDL is considered ""good"" because it does the good work. It patrols blood vessels, collects excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and artery walls, and delivers it to the liver, where it's removed from the body. This ongoing action prevents dangerous plaque buildup. Guidelines recommend an HDL level of 40 mg/dL to 60 mg/dL for adult men. ""A level below 40 mg/dL could mean that there is not enough HDL to do its job properly,"" says Dr. Sacks. Since HDL is deemed ""good,"" it would make sense that higher amounts equal extra protection. But research has found that this is not necessarily true, and that HDL levels beyond 80 mg/dL don't offer additional benefits. Higher HDL might not always be effective because it needs help to do its job. Research suggests that HDL's protective role depends partly on the levels of LDL and triglycerides (a type of blood fat that helps make up your lipid profile). One study that looked at people with both low and high HDL levels and those with normal and high levels of LDL and triglycerides discovered that for optimal protection against cardiovascular disease, there needs to be healthy levels for all three. Do you need advanced lipid testing? Doctors use lipid panels to measure cholesterol levels, screen people for cardiovascular disease risk, and monitor treatments. Yet, sometimes more detailed cholesterol information is needed. This requires advanced lipid testing to measure apolipoprotein B (apoB), the main protein in LDL. Research has suggested that higher amounts of apoB can signal greater risk. But not everyone needs this test. ""For the average person with high LDL or total cholesterol, the additional details won't materially alter their diagnosis or treatment,"" says Dr. Frank Sacks, professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. However, specific individuals may benefit, he adds. These include people who've had a recent stroke or heart attack without any apparent risk factors, such as high LDL, high blood pressure, diabetes, or smoking, and men diagnosed with cardiovascular disease before age 55. On the rise A standard blood test called a lipid panel measures a person's total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. Specific individuals may benefit from advanced lipid testing (see ""Do you need advanced lipid testing?""). The results help assess cardiovascular disease risk and dictate if treatment is needed. Addressing high LDL is always the first priority, but if you have concerningly low HDL levels — less than 40 mg/dL — your doctor likely will recommend lifestyle changes, according to Dr. Sacks. ""While a person's HDL level is predominantly determined by genetics, certain habits can cause HDL levels to drop,"" he says. Here are some strategies that people with low HDL should adopt. Exercise more. Moderate-intensity exercise, like brisk walking for at least 30 minutes three times a week, can help boost HDL. High-intensity interval training also can help. Lose weight. If overweight, aim to lose 5% to 10% of your current weight. Cut back on refined carbohydrates. Switch from refined carbohydrates (white bread, white pasta) to whole grains (oats, whole-wheat pasta, brown rice) and add lean protein to your diet, like poultry, tofu, beans, and lentils. Limit alcohol. Keep your intake, if any, to one to two drinks daily. Stop smoking. If needed, seek out medical assistance to quit.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-09-billions-deficient-life-supporting-micronutrients-study.html,"Billions of people now deficient in critical life-supporting micronutrients, study finds",0,"New research published in the Lancet Global Health journal reveals that more than half of the world's population is severely lacking in micronutrients like vitamins and minerals. An astounding 99.3 percent of the entire global population, including some wealthy one-percenters, is lacking in at least one vital nutrient the body needs for wellness, the paper explains. Researchers collected data from 31 countries and used methodology to extrapolate it as an estimate for micronutrient intake across 185 countries. They looked at 15 micronutrients in particular that are recognized as critical for human health. The team identified seven common micronutrients that people are most deficient in: calcium, iodine, vitamin E, iron, riboflavin (vitamin B2), vitamin C, and folate. In the United States, vitamin E, iodine, and vitamin C are among the most common micronutrient deficiencies. Throughout the world, children younger than five years old are generally lacking in iron, zinc, and / or vitamin A. ""Our study is a big step forward,"" commented Chris Free, a research professor and the study's lead co-author. ""Not only because it is the first to estimate inadequate micronutrient intakes for 34 age-sex groups in nearly every country, but also because it makes these methods and results easily accessible to researchers and practitioners."" Ty Beal, another lead author, called the findings ""alarming,"" adding that these major ""gaps"" in micronutrient levels are compromising public health and ""limit[ing] human potential on a global scale."" (Related: Be sure to check out our earlier report about the six essential macro- and micronutrients you need every day for optimal health.) Are you micronutrient deficient? Micronutrient deficiency can cause a variety of health problems depending on which micronutrients are missing. The following is a breakdown of the most common micronutrient deficiencies and what happens to the body as a result: 1) Iodine (68 percent): Vital for cognitive development in infants – pregnant and breastfeeding women especially should make sure they are getting enough iodine. 2) Vitamin E (67 percent): Muscle weakness and impaired coordination are common symptoms of vitamin E deficiency. 3) Calcium (66 percent): Without calcium, bones become brittle and weak. 4) Iron (65 percent): Iron deficiency is linked to anemia, which can damage the brain and cause a host of other problems. 5) Riboflavin (55 percent): Lack of vitamin B2 can cause eye sensitivity and neurological problems like seizures and migraines. 6) Folate (54 percent): Pregnant women need to take special care to optimize their folate levels, otherwise they risk stillbirth or bearing a child with severe birth defects in the brain and spinal cord. 7) Vitamin C (53 percent): Lack of vitamin C can cause gum bleeding, poor wound healing, and scurvy. Vitamin A and zinc are two other micronutrients that people are often lacking, though not as severely as those above. Vitamin A deficiency is linked to blindness while zinc deficiency spells disaster for immunity to disease. Women are more likely than men to be deficient in iodine, iron, and another critical mineral called selenium. Men, conversely, are generally more lacking in magnesium, vitamin B6, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamin (vitamin B1), and niacin (vitamin B3). ""Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia, leading to impaired cognition and adverse pregnancy outcomes,"" the authors explain in their paper. ""Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable blindness globally, affecting mostly children and pregnant women."" In the comments, someone added to the conversation that a lot of this was engineered to strip the human population of the ""fuel"" we all need for our bodies to work as they should. ""The U.S. has the worst food in the world,"" another added, referring to GMOs (genetically modified organisms), chemical preservatives, petroleum-based food colorings, and other toxic food additives that are banned in a lot of other countries but rampant throughout the U.S. food supply.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/harvard-study-shingles-linked-to-a-spike-in-risks-for-heart-attack-and-stroke,Harvard study: Shingles linked to a spike in risks for heart attack and stroke,1,"If you had chickenpox as a kid — and most people in the United States over age 50 did — then you're at risk for shingles. It's a painful reactivation of the chickenpox bug (the varicella-zoster virus) that has been dormant and hiding in your nerve cells. It can move through the nerves to the surface of the skin, causing painful blisters and potentially long-lasting pain. And here's something else that shingles might leave you with, according to a Harvard study: greater risks for heart attack and stroke. The research, published Dec. 6, 2022, in the Journal of the American Heart Association, came from three large studies involving more than 200,000 men and women who answered questions about their health. Researchers combed through the information and compared it to participants' medical records over 16 years. People who'd had shingles at some point had a 30% higher long-term risk for a major cardiovascular event, compared with people who didn't have shingles. The study was observational and doesn't prove that having shingles causes heart attack or stroke. But it's a good reminder to get the shingles vaccine (Shingrix) if you haven't already. It's given in two doses, two to six months apart, and it's 90% effective. It's recommended for adults ages 50 or older. Image: © Stock Footage, Inc./Getty Images",4,0.006882865,0.20074965,False
https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-09-fda-authorizes-covid-vaccine-without-clinical-data.html,FDA authorizes yet another COVID “vaccine” – and once again WITHOUT clinical data to back it,0,"Novavax was just given the green light by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to start mass producing yet another new ""vaccine"" for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). This latest jab is protein-based and targets the so-called JN.1 variant of the Chinese virus. Like the many others before it, Novavax's JN.1 injection was granted emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA. Though there is not a single human clinical trial to back the shot, the FDA says it must be allowed to hit the market immediately based on animal testing data that supposedly supports its use. ""Today's authorization provides an additional COVID-19 vaccine option that meets the FDA's standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization,"" announced Dr. Peter Marks, the guy in charge of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. (Related: Have you seen the proof that COVID ""vaccine"" shedding does, in fact, occur? This means the unvaccinated are at risk, too.) FDA also approves new mRNA injections from Moderna, Pfizer So as to not leave out the other major COVID jab players from raking in another windfall, the FDA also granted fresh EUA licenses to the latest modRNA (mRNA) injections from Pfizer and Moderna, which were granted just days prior to Novavax. The FDA apparently no longer requires human clinical trials to be conducted on the latest and greatest COVID jabs because the ""emergency"" is just too serious to bother with all that science stuff. ""The assertion rings hollow when FDA has not required manufacturers of the mRNA biological [products] to provide scientific evidence to the public that safety and effectiveness has been demonstrated,"" commented Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC). In support of his company's new injection, Novavax CEO John C. Jacobs issued a statement claiming that the shot shows ""robust cross-reactivity against JN.1 lineage viruses."" In case you have never heard of JN.1, it is the successor of KP.3, another alleged COVID variant that was circulating the last time Big Pharma needed another easy profit fix. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is doing its part to keep the variants coming, claiming credit for ""sequencing"" them every time the vaccine industry needs another excuse to create another high-dollar shot for easy money. The CDC claims that KP.3 closely resembles another strain of COVID called KP.3.1.1 that was supposedly responsible for four out of 10 new COVID cases in the two weeks ending on August 3. The CDC insists that KP.3.1.1 was the dominant COVID strain during the month of August. By making these declarations, the CDC communicated to both Pfizer and Moderna to churn out new injections of their own that supposedly target KP.3. The FDA had initially told Big Pharma to make new ""vaccines"" for JN.1, but later changed its recommendation to KP.3. The Novavax shot for JN.1 reportedly takes a lot longer to manufacture than Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA shots because it uses different technology. The FDA has told all of these companies to just go ahead and keep manufacturing whatever shots they have for whatever strains they chose to target because why not when there is money to be made? ""They already paralyzed and killed millions of people and somehow they're still trying to give people more shots!"" one upset commenter wrote. ""The individuals behind all this need to be held accountable for global mass murder,"" wrote another. ""They won't stop until everyone has been injected. That's how AI will be able to keep track of everyone. Revelation coming soon."" The last thing America needs right now is another COVID ""vaccine.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/over-the-counter-hearing-aids-what-we-know-so-far,Over-the-counter hearing aids: What we know so far,1,"After years of anticipation, FDA-regulated over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids are finally showing up online and in stores. About a dozen of the gadgets have made it to market, and more are expected. Here's what we know about OTC hearing aids at this point, and what to keep in mind if you're interested in buying a pair. They're hassle-free Unlike the process of getting prescription hearing aids, you don't have to go to a doctor or an audiologist for OTC hearing aids. That means you don't need a formal hearing evaluation, fittings, or a prescription for the devices. You can just buy a pair at your convenience and use them as soon as you open the package. There are two types of OTC hearing aids Some OTC hearing aids are ""self-fitting,"" meaning that device settings can be programmed to suit the user's hearing needs. ""You'll know it's self-fitting if the product description talks about putting the device in your ear and completing a hearing test, either online at the manufacturer's website or on an app, so you can adjust the controls and fine-tune the devices,"" says Meaghan Reed, director of Clinical Audiology at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear. Other OTC hearing aids are not self-fitting. They come with volume control and a few predetermined settings. The FDA regulates them The new OTC hearing aid category requires manufacturers to register the devices with the FDA and follow specific regulations. For self-fitting devices, manufacturers must demonstrate to the FDA that the hearing aids have been tested and shown to be safe (with volume control and output limits, for example) and effective for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. Packaging must explain who might benefit from the devices and when it makes sense to see a doctor for hearing loss. These hearing aids can use the words ""FDA cleared"" on packaging and ads. Non-self-fitting OTC hearing aids must be registered with the FDA, but device makers are not required to demonstrate that the devices are safe. The registration is essentially a claim that the device meets FDA standards. They're still pricey ""OTC hearing aids start at about $500 to $1,000 per pair. Self-fitting devices are more expensive. Both types cost less than the bundled price of prescription hearing aids, which start at $4,000 per pair and include the services of an audiologist for a few years,"" Reed says. ""But $500 is still costly. It's our hope that we'll see more technology emerge and drive down prices."" They're not right for everyone OTC hearing aids are meant for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. ""It's someone who typically does well in a one-on-one conversation in a quiet environment, but can't hear well with background noise, at a distance, or in a lecture hall,"" Reed says. ""They need amplification, and the ability to tune out unwanted noises. If you have more challenging hearing loss issues, you should see your doctor."" Their styles and features vary OTC hearing aids have different styles and features, depending on the particular model you buy. For example, some OTC hearing aids look like wireless earbuds. Others look like prescription hearing aids, with a piece that sits behind the ear and a little wire and speaker that sits in the ear canal. Some OTC devices have directional microphones and noise canceling features. Some are Bluetooth compatible and can stream to your smartphone. Buying them requires homework Although it's easier to obtain OTC hearing aids than prescription hearing aids, it's still a sizable investment. You'll want to do research before buying them. Some organizations, such as the National Council on Aging (/ncoa-hear), compare device models for consumers. Get a model with the fit, features, and price you want. If you're not sure, you may be able to talk to the seller about it. If it's a drugstore, for example, ask the pharmacist for guidance. If it's an online dealer, there may be a customer service line you can call. You can even make an appointment with a local audiologist to get advice. One important consideration is your ability to operate the hearing aids. Are you good with technology? Would you like to make all of the adjustments? Would you prefer having preset functions that make it easier to operate? Whatever model you're considering, make sure it has two particular features. ""One is a customer service department, so you can talk to someone if you're having trouble fitting the devices or if they aren't working at some point. The other is a trial period. You need to be able to try them out and return them if they're not right,"" Reed advises. ""Remember, we're still in the early stages of OTC hearing aids. We don't know yet which devices will work best and which companies will be around the longest. But if you have the means and you'd like to give the devices a try now, they do have benefits.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heavy-metals-found-in-popular-brands-of-dark-chocolate,Heavy metals found in popular brands of dark chocolate,1,"Because dark chocolate is a rich source of beneficial plant compounds called flavanols, it's often touted as a heart-healthy treat. However, many popular brands of dark chocolate contain potentially worrisome levels of lead and cadmium, according to a study by Consumer Reports published in December 2022. Consistent, long-term exposure to even low levels of either of these heavy metals has been linked to various health problems, including cardiovascular disease. Researchers used California's maximum allowable dose levels for lead (0.5 micrograms, or mcg) and cadmium (4.1 mcg) to gauge the risk posed by dark chocolate. For 23 of the 28 chocolate bars they tested, eating just an ounce per day would put an adult over the maximum dose for at least one of the heavy metals. Five bars contained levels over the limit for both lead and cadmium. Chocolate, which is made from seeds of the cacao tree, can be contaminated with cadmium and lead by polluted soil — not only as the crop grows but also during harvesting and processing. You can limit your exposure by choosing dark chocolate brands that Consumer Reports deemed as safer options (see /darkchoc) or simply enjoy it occasionally rather than frequently.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-09-wef-finally-tells-the-truth-about-covid.html,World Economic Forum finally tells the truth about COVID: It was a ‘test’ of our obedience to rapidly forming new world order,0,"I have long said that Covid 19 was launched by design by a small number of people in the globalist predator class for one reason and one reason only — as a beta test for the coming technocratic new world order. (Article republished from LeoHohmann.Substack.com ) Now, we’ve got the World Economic Forum coming out and all but admitting that was exactly why the Covid-19 “pandemic” had to happen. The WEF gleefully posted the following snippet to the “My Carbon” page of its website where they make a pitch for so-called smart cities, which is just another term for 15-minute cities. The first of three “developments” that the WEF says must be in place before the world can evolve into its utopian vision of “smart and sustainable cities,” is compliance with restrictions on our freedom. It writes: 1. COVID-19 was the test of social responsibility – A huge number of unimaginable restrictions for public health were adopted by billions of citizens across the world. There were numerous examples globally of maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, mass vaccinations and acceptance of contact-tracing applications for public health, which demonstrated the core of individual social responsibility. They were testing us. That’s what Covid was all about. They wanted to see how many of us would give up our individual freedom and individual sovereignty by complying with a “new normal” that consisted of restrictions bordering on the absurd. Why, for instance was it “safe” to shop at Lowe’s or Home Depot but unsafe to shop at a small business or attend church? Why was it OK to go to strip clubs in Michigan but you couldn’t buy seeds for a garden? What the WEF is implying with its above statement is that in order to be “sustainable,” people and societies will need to be compliant with a new more authoritarian global order. Don’t ask questions. Don’t resort to logic. Just obey. Would we be obedient in the face of idiotic new laws and regulations, like wearing face diapers to stop what was said to be an aerosolized virus, and standing six feet apart in public, and submitting to a never-before-used, unlicensed mRNA gene-based injection? They said it was good for you, so roll up your sleeve. Don’t ask questions. If you did, you could lose your job and be treated as a societal outcast. Many people lost friends or even close family members to this monstrous “test” of our willingness to unquestioningly do what we’re told. Nearly five years later, arguably the most powerful nonprofit public-private partnership in the world, the WEF, admits it was all a test of our wills and celebrates the fact that most of us failed the test (or passed with flying colors depending how you look at it). They wanted to find out how many of us would prove our servitude to the lawless, fascistic beast system by complying with “unimaginable restrictions,” many of which were created out of thin air with absolutely no scientific evidence to back them up as contributing anything to public health.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-06-fda-grants-novavax-eua-without-clinical-trial-data.html,FDA grants emergency use authorization for updated Novavax COVID-19 vaccine even without clinical trial data,0,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the updated Novavax COVID-19 vaccine despite the lack of clinical trial data. According to the FDA, the updated and protein-based Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is specifically designed to target the omicron variant JN.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2 . The updated vaccine is produced using a similar process to earlier Novavax formulas and individuals receiving it may experience side effects similar to those reported with previous versions. This EUA applies to individuals aged 12 and older, with the updated vaccine featuring a monovalent component that aligns with the omicron JN.1 variant. Those who have never been vaccinated can receive two doses approximately three weeks apart, while previously vaccinated individuals can get a single booster dose. Meanwhile, the previous Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, Adjuvanted (2023-2024 Formula), will no longer be authorized for use. ""The COVID-19 vaccines have had a tremendous positive impact on public health, and vaccination continues to be the most effective method for COVID-19 prevention. COVID-19 remains a very real risk for many people, and we encourage individuals to consider getting an updated COVID-19 vaccine when eligible,"" claimed Peter Marks, the director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. ""Today's authorization provides an additional COVID-19 vaccine option that meets the FDA's standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization."" (Related: FDA warns of CARDIAC INFLAMMATION risk linked to the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine .) In line with this, the updated vaccine will soon be available after the Maryland-based company's product receives regulatory clearance. However, Barbara Loe Fisher, the co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center, argued that the FDA should not claim safety and effectiveness in the absence of clinical trial data. ""The assertion rings hollow when the FDA has not required manufacturers of the mRNA biological [products] to provide scientific evidence to the public that safety and effectiveness have been demonstrated,"" Fisher stated. FDA: Novavax COVID-19 vaccine linked to cardiac inflammation risk and other side effects The original version of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine was not safe either. In fact, the FDA linked the vaccine to cardiac inflammation risk . In June, 2022, the agency released documents that revealed four cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, which occurred during clinical trials of the vaccine among 30,000 participants from December 2020 to September 2021. ""These events raise the concern for a causal association with this vaccine, similar to the association documents with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Post-marketing data from individuals receiving mRNA vaccines [has] demonstrated increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within seven days following the second primary dose,"" the FDA noted. ""Data from passive surveillance during post-authorization use in other countries also indicate a higher than expected rate of myocarditis and pericarditis … associated with the vaccine. Further evaluation is needed to inform the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, and their outcomes, as additional data emerge over time."" The FDA also cited other side effects associated with the Novavax vaccine, including tenderness at the injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, hypersensitivity and swelling of the lymph nodes. One case of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder known to be associated with other COVID-19 vaccines, was also reported during the clinical trials.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-06-global-catastrophe-self-replicating-mrna-covid-vaccine.html,Dr. Daniel Nagase warns of possible GLOBAL CATASTROPHE as Japan plans to roll out world’s first self-replicating mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,0,"NHK , Japan's biggest broadcaster, aired a special report on Wednesday, Sept. 4, about the side effects of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines – featuring stories from viewers who shared their negative experiences. But according to Dr. Daniel Nagase, the issues seen so far might pale in comparison to what could happen with a new kind of vaccine known as the replicon vaccine . He warned that these vaccines could trigger a global catastrophe. Nagase said if genes from these replicon vaccines escape into the environment – through birds, insects or other animals – they could spread uncontrollably, creating a nightmare scenario. (Related: GLOBAL EMERGENCY UNFOLDING: Japan will unleash Bill Gates-approved, SELF-REPLICATING mRNA vaccines starting next month .) Replicon vaccines use a special type of RNA that can replicate itself. This means the vaccine could produce viral proteins inside the body longer. While this has excited researchers for its supposed potential in treating diseases, like cancer, it raises concerns about the vaccine's ability to spread between humans and other species. In November 2023, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved its first replicon vaccine , the ARCT-154. Developed by American biotech firm Arcturus Therapeutics in partnership with Australian vaccine manufacturer CSL Seqirus, this experimental COVID-19 vaccine is designed to be more efficient than traditional mRNA vaccines by setting up a ""biological factory"" in the body and producing more proteins with a similar dose. Japan plans to roll out these vaccines in late 2024, but protests have already erupted over the rollout due to concerns regarding the World Health Organization's proposed pandemic treaty and the risks posed by these new vaccine technologies. Nagase believes this is a global issue that everyone needs to watch closely. Global threat of replicon vaccines Replicon vaccines, also known as self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, carry a unique risk due to their viral origins . These vaccines are based on alphaviruses – a family of viruses that can infect both humans and animals . What makes them concerning is their resilience – some can survive for long periods outside of a host and remain infectious. The potential danger lies in how these man-made genes could spread – not just between people but across entire ecosystems. Nagase raised alarms about the serious consequences of introducing these artificial genes into the environment. He points out that if these genes were to escape into nature – via mosquitoes or other animals – they could spread uncontrollably, making it nearly impossible to eliminate them. The real feeling is that replicon vaccines could recombine with other viruses – leading to the creation of hybrid viruses, or ""superviruses,"" that are more dangerous and harder to control . One of the biggest concerns is interspecies transmission. Alphaviruses are known to jump between species and if a human injected with a replicon vaccine passes the artificial genes to animals or insects, the virus could survive and evolve in these new hosts. This means the virus could remain deadly to humans while thriving in other species – creating long-lasting reservoirs of infection. In the worst-case scenario, these genes could spread globally – making containment nearly impossible. The ARCT-154 trials in Vietnam , where over 9,000 people were given replicon vaccines, didn't address the potential environmental spread of the vaccine. There was no follow-up to check if the vaccine’s genetic material had entered the ecosystem. If a similar situation were to unfold on a larger scale – like in Japan – Nagase said the only solution might be a complete quarantine of the country. Without drastic measures, the artificial genes could spread across the world , becoming a permanent fixture in multiple species and posing an ongoing threat to human health.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-06-rogan-rips-mainstream-media-for-failure.html,"Rogan rips mainstream media for failure to cover ‘real numbers’ of people injured, killed by COVID shots",0,"In his latest podcast, Joe Rogan called out the mainstream media for failing to report on the injuries and deaths linked to COVID-19 vaccines. (Article by Suzanne Burdick, Ph.D. republished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org ) Rogan didn’t hold back from using strong language to make his point to viewers of Wednesday’s episode of “ The Joe Rogan Experience .” He said: “We don’t even know what the real numbers are because it’s not something the mainstream media covers — probably because they’ve all been vaccinated and they’re probably freaking the f*%# out.” Rogan’s guest, Bret Weinstein, Ph.D. , also called out the pharmaceutical industry and its governmental regulators for generating wealth for themselves at the expense of children’s health. It’s hard for “kind, intelligent” people to imagine that there are people who “are willing to profit off of injecting babies with things that may very well f*$% them up for the rest of their life,” Rogan told Weinstein. Most people think “there’s no way anyone’s that evil,” Rogan said. “Then when you start looking into the evidence.” He added, “You read ‘Turtles All The Way Down’ or ‘Dissolving Illusions’ and it’s just like wait, wait, wait.” “ Turtles All The Way Down : Vaccine Science and Myth” was edited by Children’s Health Defense CEO Mary Holland and Publishing Coordinator Zoey O’Toole. “ Dissolving Illusions : Diseases, Vaccines, and The Forgotten History” is by Dr. Suzanne Humphries . People injured by COVID shot who spoke out were attacked Weinstein, co-host of the “ The DarkHorse Podcast ,” and Rogan debunked the myth that vaccines are responsible for saving people’s lives, historically and in the present. They discussed why mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 shots, are harmful to human health and how problematic it is that Big Pharma continues to push vaccines. Rogan recalled how people like musician Eric Clapton , who was injured by the COVID-19 vaccine, were attacked when they spoke out about their experience. Clapton was called “the most hurtful of words,” Rogan recalled. Weinstein said he thinks the terrible treatment of those injured by the COVID-19 vaccines was a way to gaslight them. “The gaslighting of the [vaccine] injured is insane,” Weinstein said. “How is it that someone who suffers an adverse event is not entitled to our compassion?” Weinstein: mRNA vaccine platform is Big Pharma’s ‘cash cow’ Rogan and Weinstein explained why they think the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded as it did. In Weinstein’s view, the pharmaceutical industry needed a public health emergency that would legitimize and normalize using mRNA vaccine technology — which Weinstein considers to be very dangerous — on the general population. “Their real goal,” Weinstein told Rogan, “was to normalize the use of a gene therapy on a population that had never had that idea placed in its mind.” They called the new gene therapy a “vaccine” since most people believed vaccines were historically beneficial and thus could be trusted. Now that many people have accepted the idea of getting an mRNA injection, the industry can use the mRNA platform to “reformulate every vaccine they’ve got to create a bunch of new vaccines.” Weinstein estimated the profits from doing this would be in the trillions. Vaccines, gain-of-function research and more Rogan and Weinstein’s dialogue — which lasted over three hours — covered a wide range of complex subjects.

(Article by Clare Marie Merkowsky republished from LifeSiteNews.com ) On July 2, pro-life organization CHOICE42 released their latest animated short video titled “It’s OK,” which details the origins of five different fetal cell lines and how they were created from the victims of abortion. “That’s me,” the video opens, with an animated picture of an aborted baby. “I’m Ellie. Don’t feel bad. It’s okay. It was a long time ago, 1962.” “I just thought maybe you don’t know about me,” Ellie continued. “My parents didn’t want me, anyway. The doctor worked with scientists, and they took my organs out as soon as I was aborted.” “It had to be done right away because the organs need to be fresh,” she continued. The video is the third in a series of pro-life animated shorts which reveal the ugly truth behind the abortion industry. The previous two episodes described surgical abortions?and?IVF. The new video was premiered on The Steve Deace Show on The Blaze Network. “I first became aware that fetuses were killed and harvested for fetal cell lines during COVID,” Laura Klassen, director and founder of?CHOICE42 explained. “When I began to research and explain my findings to others, they were always telling me, ‘Well, it’s ok because…’ and went on to list their justifications,” she continued. “Some said, ‘There was only one baby used in the 60s’. Others, ‘There aren’t any more babies being aborted for this today.’ Still others, ‘The doctors just used the dead tissue post-abortion.’” “All false and none of it is ok,” she declared. “We need to stop justifying what happened to these 5 babies (and many others) and take a closer look at what is going on in the medical research world. It’s not ok that it happened in the 60s, and it’s not ok that it’s happening now.” The video follows the short lives of Ellie, David, Johanna, Jordan, and Bo; five babies whose organs were harvested to produce fetal cell lines. The cell lines have since been used in various medical experiments, especially in the production of vaccines. Cell lines from both Johanna and Jordan were used in the creation of the mRNA-based COVID vaccines. Doctors and abortion advocates argue that the babies’ organs were harvested once and using cell lines from aborted babies does not lead to more babies being experimented on. However, the video revealed that hundreds of babies are experimented on before a cell line is obtained, with 32 babies being experimented on in Ellie’s case and a total of 293 experiments being carried out to obtain Johanna’s cell line. The most recent cell line comes from Bo, a baby killed in 2015 to replace the depleting cell line supply. Horrifically, the aborted babies’ cell lines are still for sale today. Even more disturbing is the fact that the babies were experimented on while they were alive and were not given pain medications as it would “ruin the cells.” Dr. Ian Donald, the pioneer of the ultrasound scanner, who witnessed the experiments carried out on Ellie, revealed, “Experiments were being performed on near-term alive aborted babies who were not even afforded the mercy of anesthetic as they writhed and cried in agony, and when their usefulness had expired, they were executed and discarded as garbage.” Read more at: LifeSiteNews.com",9,-0.1624544,-0.20948593,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/dont-buy-into-dietary-supplements-for-heart-health,Don't buy into dietary supplements for heart health,1,"For people without heart disease, low-dose statin therapy can lower LDL (bad) cholesterol better than six dietary supplements promoted to improve heart health, according to a study published online Nov. 6, 2022, by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Researchers examined 190 adults ages 40 to 75 who did not have cardiovascular disease. Participants had LDL levels that ranged from optimal to high and a 5% to 20% risk of developing cardiovascular disease within 10 years. Everyone was randomly put into one of eight groups. One group took 5 milligrams of the statin drug rosuvastatin (Crestor), another group took a daily placebo, and the rest took one of six dietary supplements, each with a dominant ingredient: fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast rice. (These ingredients have been touted to have heart health benefits, including helping to lower cholesterol.) After 28 days, people in the statin group lowered their LDL by an average of almost 38%, while changes in most of the supplement groups were comparable to those who took a placebo. (The garlic supplement group actually saw their LDL levels increase.) The statin group also had an average 24% decrease in total cholesterol. The researchers noted that more than 28 days may be needed for these dietary supplements to affect cholesterol levels. Still, the findings support statins as the best medicine for lowering cholesterol. Image: © Tanja Ivanova/Getty Images",3,0.3195424,0.2642722,False
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-gut-healthy-heart,"Healthy gut, healthy heart",1,"The gut is known as the ""second brain,"" as it produces many of the same neurotransmitters, chemicals released by nerves needed for communication with other nerves and tissues. The gut and brain are also connected through a joint partnership called the gut-brain axis that links biochemical signals both to and from the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. But what about the gut and the heart? Do they have a similar connection? Research suggests there might be a link, but that it travels in one direction — from the gut to the heart — and that keeping your gut healthy can be another means to protect against heart disease. The gut-heart connection The gut is the primary home to trillions of microbes, collectively known as the human microbiota. These microbes help with digestion, manufacture certain nutrients, and release substances that have wide-ranging health effects. ""There's a complex interplay between the microbes in our intestines and most of the systems in our bodies, including the vascular, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, all of which are linked with cardiovascular health,"" says Dr. Stanley Shaw, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Since diet plays a significant role in the composition of gut microbiota, what you feed your gut can therefore affect heart health — for better and for worse. One way the gut does this is with metabolites, substances the gut microbiota creates when breaking down food. One particular gut metabolite, trimethylamine (TMA), forms when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a substance strongly connected with forming artery-clogging plaque. Research has shown that people with high TMAO levels in their blood are more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those with lower levels. Since red meat is a main source of TMA, cutting back can stop the gut from making too much TMAO. In fact, a study in the September 2022 issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found that among nearly 4,000 people ages 65 and older, those who ate an average of 1.1 servings of red meat per day had a 22% higher risk of heart disease compared with those who ate less. The researchers pointed out that about 10% of this added risk could be attributed to increased levels of TMAO as well as two other metabolites — gamma-butyrobetaine and crotonobetaine — which also are made by gut bacteria from components in red meat. Fiber at work Fiber also helps support the gut and thus the heart. According to some estimates, fiber-rich diets can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as 30%. Fiber in the small intestine binds fat and cholesterol, decreasing absorption and lowering blood cholesterol levels. But the gut's microbiota also helps out. Fiber gets broken down by bacteria in the colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds interact with specific receptors on cells that regulate blood pressure, better control blood sugar and body weight in people with diabetes, and dampen inflammation — all of which can improve heart health. Other supporting foods It's unclear whether eating other foods that improve gut microbiota — for example, probiotics (beneficial bacteria) found in yogurt and fermented foods (sauerkraut, miso, tempeh) — can also support heart health. The best advice for helping your gut help your heart is to follow a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean diet or similar eating patterns. These involve limiting red meat and eating plenty of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, all of which can have favorable effects on the gut,"" says Dr. Shaw. ""And if your gut is healthy, there is a greater chance your heart is healthy, too."" Image: © CareyHope/Getty Images",1,0.35523543,0.10383706,True
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/do-you-pass-the-hearing-test,Do you pass the hearing test?,1,"Approximately one in three people ages 65 to 74 has hearing loss. Nearly half of those older than 75 have difficulty hearing. While many people can function with some degree of hearing loss, especially if they have a spouse or family member who can repeat any information they may miss, ignoring hearing decline can profoundly affect one's health. Growing evidence shows that age-related hearing loss is associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline. Research suggests that hearing loss impairs new nerve cell creation in the hippocampus, the brain's memory region. Hearing loss also is linked with increased risks for depression, social isolation, and being less active. ""It is often challenging to differentiate the cause of one's hearing loss and its severity without an evaluation,"" says Dr. James Naples, assistant professor of otolaryngology–head and neck surgery at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""This is why older men need to get their hearing checked by a certified audiologist before any potential hearing loss worsens."" Hearing about problems There is no single cause of age-related hearing loss, also known as presbycusis. The most common reason is changes in the inner ear, which can alter nerve pathways from the ear to the brain. Over time, the cells in the inner ear grow old, die, and are not replaced. When these cells — called hair cells — die, the electrical messages of sound waves don't travel to the brain as well as they should. This causes many people to eventually experience some degree of presbycusis, although the severity varies. Another contributor to hearing loss is long-term noise exposure, like from power tools, loud music, gunfire, or careers in loud environments, such as construction and manufacturing. Getting tested Hearing tests measure how loud a sound needs to be before you clearly hear it. People with normal hearing can identify sounds of less than 25 decibels (dB). Mild hearing loss means you require sounds to be in the 26 to 40 dB range, and moderate hearing loss, your minimum hearing in the 41 to 55 dB range. Ranges higher than this are considered moderately severe to severe and profound. According to the CDC, a person with mild hearing loss may hear most speech sounds, but soft sounds don't get through. Someone with moderate hearing loss may hear almost no speech at normal levels. Age-related hearing loss and noise-induced hearing loss tend to affect both ears equally. If hearing loss occurs in one ear but not the other, or is accompanied by ear pain, vertigo, or ringing in the ear, it could signal any of a variety of conditions that require further medical evaluation. You may be fitted for a hearing aid based on your hearing test results. An audiologist configures hearing aids to a person's specific hearing loss, similar to the way prescription glasses are fitted. Despite their name, hearing aids don't directly improve hearing, but instead work as amplifiers. Still, hearing aids can be literal life-changers. Research has shown that people with age-related hearing loss who wear hearing aids improve their working memory, concentration, processing speed, and attention. Other studies have found that wearing hearing aids can lower the risk of being diagnosed with dementia and protect against fall-related injuries. ""On a personal level, hearing aids can also improve your relationships with your partner, friends, and family,"" says Dr. Naples. Less expensive options The main downside to hearing aids has always been cost. The average price of one hearing aid is about $2,000 (although this can vary), and most people need one for each ear. Hearing aids are not usually covered by Medicare, although some Medicare Advantage plans and other commercial health insurance plans do cover them. Why are hearing aids traditionally so expensive? Only a handful of companies produce most of the country's hearing aids, which are sold through audiology practices. This lack of competition drives up prices and keep them high. However, in October 2022 the FDA approved the over-the-counter sale of hearing aids suitable for mild to moderate hearing loss. This new category means more competition among manufacturers that, in turn, should lower average prices. Some estimates suggest that a pair of over-the-counter hearing aids could drop to less than $1,000 (although the exact savings is unknown). It's still being determined which styles will be available over the counter, according to Dr. Naples. He speculates they will range from traditional behind-the-ear devices to ones that fit into the ear canal. Be mindful that there are some limitations to the over-the-counter devices. For instance, they are only for mild to moderate hearing loss (people with severe hearing loss would likely need a prescription hearing aid). Also, whereas a prescription hearing aid can be individually fine-tuned and fitted, over-the-counter aids come in generic sizes that can't be altered. It also still needs to be clarified how repairs, warranties, and replacements will work. Also, don't confuse over-the-counter hearing aids with personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) sold at most drugstores. ""PSAPs are not specifically intended for people with hearing loss,"" says Dr. Naples. They are a great alternative for people who only experience some hearing difficulties in specific situations, like listening to the TV.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/what-should-be-my-cholesterol-goal-with-a-family-history-of-heart-disease,What should be my cholesterol goal with a family history of heart disease?,1,"Q. I'm a 70-year-old man with a family history of coronary artery disease. I currently take a low-dose statin. My recent LDL number is 105. Should I aim for a lower number? A. My situation is similar to yours. I have some family members who died young secondary to coronary heart disease, and I run a high total and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. I exercise regularly and try to follow a Mediterranean-style diet. About 15 years ago, my doctor recommended starting a statin. Even at a low dose, I experienced more aches and pains than I had previously. I stopped the statin, but in retrospect, I now doubt that the muscle aches were related to the drug. Eight years ago, I had a chest CT scan unrelated to any heart issues. My lungs were fine, but the scan showed calcium deposits in my arteries, including the coronary arteries that feed oxygen and nutrients to the heart. That was a game changer. Calcium gets deposited into fatty plaques that accumulate in the arteries. I knew this indicated that my risks of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke were significantly elevated. I immediately began taking the maximum dose of rosuvastatin (Crestor). Interestingly, I had no muscle aches, even with the high dose. In general, the lower your LDL cholesterol number, the lower your risk of developing heart disease. My high risk and need for a high-dose statin became apparent after the CT scan. But what about you and the millions of men with a similar family history or a somewhat elevated LDL level? Here's the discussion I would have with a man like you, who has a higher-than-ideal LDL level and is asking about increasing his statin dose or might not be on a statin yet. If you desire to maximally reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, aim for an LDL level of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). This means lifestyle changes, including a healthier diet and more physical activity. But you might also want to talk with your doctor about starting a low-dose statin or raising the dose if you already take one. An alternative is to have a coronary artery CT scan to get your coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. The test calculates the amount of calcium deposited in your coronary arteries. A zero score means a very low risk of trouble, and a high score means you might aim for an LDL level of 55 mg/dL or lower (the European Society of Cardiology recommendation for people at very high risk).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/a-three-pronged-approach-to-exercise,A three-pronged approach to exercise,1,"There's no question that getting regular exercise ranks as one of the leading strategies — if not the best one — for preventing heart disease. All forms of physical activity, even in small doses, can make a difference. But if you're looking to optimize your cardiovascular health, a regimen that includes three types of movement may be the way to go, according to a 2024 review article in Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine. The foundation of this exercise triad is moderate-intensity aerobic (cardio) exercise like brisk walking, one of the go-to options for meeting the federal activity guidelines (see ""Exercise recommendations and examples""). Moderate activity benefits your heart by burning calories and boosting metabolism, which helps control weight. But you can reap additional benefits by adding vigorous aerobic activity (the type that really gets your heart pumping) along with muscle-strengthening exercises. Exercise recommendations and examples Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity (or an equivalent combination of the two). Do strength training at least two days per week — even 10 to 15 minutes per session can be effective. Your age, baseline fitness level, and health conditions all affect what workout is best for you. Ask your doctor for help creating a safe three-part workout to optimize your heart health. Moderate-intensity exercise Vigorous-intensity exercise Walking, level surface, 2.5–4.5 mph Walking, level surface, 4.5 mph or faster, or walking briskly uphill Hiking, level surface Jogging or running, or hiking uphill Bicycling, level terrain, 5–10 mph Bicycling, 10 mph or faster, or up hills Stationary bike (indoor), moderate pace Spinning class (indoor cycling) Tennis, doubles Tennis, singles Swimming, recreational Swimming, steady laps Muscle-building exercise (also called strength, weight, or resistance training) Weight training using dumbbells, medicine balls, kettlebells, weighted ropes, or specialized machines at home or in gyms and fitness centers Exercises with resistance bands Body-weight exercises (such as push-ups, sit-ups, and squats) Heavy gardening or yard work (such as digging and shoveling) Certain forms of yoga (such as Ashtanga, Vinyasa, and Iyengar) How aerobic exercise helps ""People who run or do similar types of vigorous exercise may have experienced a 'runner's high' either during or after their workout,"" says Dr. Tim Churchill, a cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. That's because your body releases feel-good chemicals known as endorphins and endocannabinoids in response to intense exercise. Any kind of aerobic exercise, whether moderate or vigorous, also helps dampen the body's ""fight or flight"" response, which plays a role in chronic stress and anxiety. Aerobic exercise also spurs the release of adrenalin and related hormones that stimulate receptors in the heart to beat more frequently and forcefully. Over time, the heart becomes more efficient, requiring less effort to send blood through the body. And as more blood circulates through the body, blood vessels expand slightly and become more flexible. Why muscle-building matters Including muscle-building exercises in your weekly routine has a synergistic effect with aerobic exercise that can further enhance your heart health. Strength training can make your body more efficient at burning fat for energy. It also helps improve how your body responds to insulin, the hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels, Dr. Churchill says. That can help prevent or improve diabetes, a potent risk factor for heart disease. Strength training also promotes the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and widens blood vessels. ""Your arteries are then better able to relax, which helps to maintain normal blood pressure,"" says Dr. Churchill. As the review article notes, combining strength with moderate-intensity and some vigorous aerobic exercise leads to greater reductions in resting heart rate, blood pressure, body weight, and body fat percentage than doing single forms of exercise. ""Exercise clearly improves a lot of specific markers related to cardiovascular disease. But when you add up all those individual effects, it still only accounts for about 50% of the overall health benefit related to doing regular physical activity,"" says Dr. Churchill. The elusive remaining 50% is why the decades-long quest to create ""exercise in a pill"" will probably never materialize, he adds. Image: © Pyataeva Irina/Getty Images",5,0.4202705,0.056652904,True

Compared with active work, sedentary work was 37% likelier to lead to a variety of insomnia symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep, interrupted sleep, and frequent daytime tiredness. The findings also indicated that workers who fall into a pattern of poor sleep due to their job design can end up stuck in such unhealthy patterns for many years. Insomnia-like sleepers, for example, reported their symptoms persisted 10 years later, at the end of the study.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/will-diverticulitis-heal-on-its-own,Will diverticulitis heal on its own?,1,"Your doctor spotted diverticula in a previous colonoscopy, but you never thought the little pouches in your large intestine (colon) would turn into little devils. Now pain in your gut is telling you something is wrong. Do you have diverticulitis, and will it get better without medical care? How it happens Diverticula develop when weak spots in the colon lining bulge outward, creating little pouches or potholes. They more often form in the sigmoid colon, which runs down the left side of the pelvis and then joins the rectum. ""Most people never have a problem with them. They're extremely common: they are present in about 70% of us by age 80,"" says Dr. Alexander Goldowsky, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. But sometimes diverticula bleed, or they become inflamed or infected, a condition called diverticulitis. Recognizing diverticulitis Diverticulitis tends to cause pain in the lower left part of your abdomen. ""It's not typical tummy trouble. It's a different kind of pain that can be significant and severe,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. Although diverticula rarely cause symptoms, diverticulitis can cause bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool. If a diverticulum is infected, you might have a fever, chills, or vomiting in addition to pain. ""If it's the first time you've had this kind of pain, reach out to your doctor right away,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""If you have a history of diverticulitis and you develop mild symptoms, let your doctor know. He or she may just recommend temporary dietary changes and taking it easy. But if things aren't improving, call your doctor again."" Don't put off calling; an infected diverticulum can form an abscess (pus-filled pocket) that can extend to other tissue in the body and become life-threatening. In rare cases, that new colon pain may indicate cancer. Diagnosis After you've alerted your doctor about gut pain, you'll need to go in for a physical exam. This exam can involve checking your abdomen for tenderness and the rectum for signs of blood. You might need blood and stool tests. But the main way to diagnose diverticulitis is with a CT scan, typically after a special type of contrast dye is injected into your vein. ""If we see inflammation surrounding one or more diverticula, we can determine that you have diverticulitis,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. Treatment Can diverticulitis heal on its own? ""Yes, it can, and for that reason, we don't always prescribe antibiotics. We reserve them for diverticulitis in people with an abscess, a significant amount of inflammation, symptoms that aren't improving, a suppressed immune system, frailty, or other health problems — such as liver or kidney disease,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. Care at home, with or without an antibiotic, includes rest, a clear liquid diet (see ""A liquid diet for diverticulitis""), and acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain. You might want to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), which can add to gastrointestinal discomfort. For severe diverticulitis, you might need to be hospitalized for a few days, getting antibiotics directly into a vein. If you have an abscess, you might need surgery to clean out the infection. A liquid diet for diverticulitis When you have diverticulitis, you might need a clear liquid diet, to give your colon a break from digesting solid foods. A liquid diet can include clear drinks and foods, such as water, broth or bouillon, black coffee, plain tea, clear juice (apple, white grape), clear soft drinks or sports drinks, Jell-O, or popsicles. There's no need to stay on a liquid diet for more than 48 hours unless recommended by your doctor. Getting better Healing from diverticulitis requires commitment. If you're taking an oral antibiotic, make sure you stick to the medication schedule. If you're on a liquid diet, avoid cheating. Once symptoms begin improving, you can move to a low-fiber diet. It includes animal protein (eggs, cheese, fish, poultry); certain cooked vegetables (carrots, green beans, potatoes, pumpkin, yams, or squash); low-fiber fruits (bananas, peaches, pears); and (if your doctor says it's okay) low-fiber breads such as white, sourdough, or refined wheat breads. Stay away from spicy, fatty foods and alcohol. If you feel up to it, it's okay to exercise, but go easy on yourself. ""Avoid abdominal exercise. Go for a walk or do some arm exercises with small dumbbells,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""If you feel uncomfortable, take a break.""

https://naturalnews.com/2024-09-02-high-fluoride-levels-linked-lower-iq-children.html,Government report links high fluoride levels in drinking water to lower IQ in children,0,"A new report from the United States government titled ""Fluoride Exposure: Neurodevelopment and Cognition"" has revealed that exposure to high levels of fluoride from fluoridated drinking water is associated with lower IQ scores in children . The report has reignited the debate over fluoride in drinking water, revealing that exposure levels exceeding twice the recommended limit are linked to child's low IQ score. This is the first time a federal agency has confirmed with ""moderate confidence"" a connection between high fluoride levels and reduced cognitive function in kids. The report, released by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) and part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is based on a review of studies from several countries, including Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico. It highlights that drinking water with fluoride concentrations above 1.5 milligrams per liter is linked to a decrease in IQ. Some studies suggest a drop of two to five IQ points in children with higher fluoride exposure. (Related: COGNITIVE RETARDNATION: Fluoride exposure during pregnancy increases risk of neurodevelopmental issues in children .) Historically, fluoride has been praised for its role in preventing tooth decay. Since Grand Rapids, Michigan, first fluoridated its water in 1945 and federal endorsement in 1950, the practice has been seen as one of public health's greatest achievements. However, with the rise of fluoride toothpaste and increased scrutiny, health officials lowered the recommended fluoride levels in drinking water from 1.2 milligrams per liter to 0.7 milligrams in 2015 to address issues like dental fluorosis, which causes unsightly spots on teeth. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has long set a maximum fluoride limit of four milligrams per liter to prevent skeletal fluorosis, a condition that affects bone strength. However, emerging research has focused on potential neurological impacts, particularly concerning developing fetuses and young children exposed to formula mixed with fluoridated water. In 2006, the National Research Council (NRC) flagged the potential neurological effects of high fluoride levels – prompting calls for more research. The NTP's comprehensive review, which began in 2016, aimed to provide clarity on whether stricter fluoride limits are needed. The final report has faced delays but underscores the need for continued research and policy discussions. Millions of Americans living with excessive fluoride in water systems As the debate continues, the new report adds urgency to the discussion about fluoride's safety and impact on public health – particularly for vulnerable populations. University of Florida researcher Ashley Malin emphasized the importance of this report for understanding fluoride's risk. She said pregnant women should consider reducing fluoride intake, including from certain teas. According to government report, about 0.6 percent of Americans – nearly two million – are on water systems with naturally occurring fluoride levels of 1.5 milligrams or higher. ""The findings from this report raise the questions about how these people can be protected and what makes the most sense,"" said Malin. Malin noted that pregnant women living in these over-fluoridated areas need to immediately lower their fluoride intake not only from water but also from certain types of other food products like tea. Malin added that it is also necessary to have policy discussions about whether to require fluoride content labels on beverages.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-stress-busters-to-help-your-heart,5 stress busters to help your heart,1,"Easing stress is one key to a healthier heart Stress that persists day in and day out — whether from a traffic-choked daily commute, unhappy relationship, or heavy workload — has been linked to a wide range of health issues. Many people know first-hand that chronic stress can negatively affect mood, sleep, and appetite. But you may not know that chronic stress can harm your heart –– or understand what you can do to counter its effects. How does long-term stress harm the heart? Chronic stress leads to persistent low-grade inflammation in the body, which increases the risk of heart disease. Mood, sleep, and appetite changes brought on by the constant hum of stress can do so, too. And stress may influence your risk of heart attack and other heart conditions in more subtle ways. For example, when under stress, some of us eat unhealthy food or lack the energy or time to exercise. Stress can also trigger heart-damaging behaviors such as smoking and drinking too much alcohol. 5 great ways to destress Breaking the connection between chronic stress and heart disease requires finding tools that can help you cope with stress and aim for healthier habits. These five simple tips can help you do just that. Tap into laughter. Laughter has been found to lower levels of stress hormones and reduce inflammation in the arteries. Silly shows, corny jokes, and funny animal videos all count! Meditate. Finding time for a simple combination of inward-focused thought and deep breathing reduces heart disease risk factors such as high blood pressure. Meditative practices like yoga, tai chi, mindfulness, and prayer can also relax the mind and body. Try activity. Every time you are physically active, whether you take a walk or play tennis, your brain releases mood-boosting chemicals called endorphins. Short bursts of exercise can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. And exercising regularly not only helps you ease stress, it also protects against heart disease by lowering your blood pressure, strengthening your heart muscle, and helping you maintain a healthy weight. Unplug. It's impossible to escape stress when it follows you everywhere. Cut the cord. Avoid emails and TV news. Take time each day — even if it's for just 10 or 15 minutes — to escape from the world. Find ways to destress. Simple things, like a relaxing bath, listening to music, spending time in nature or on a favorite hobby, can give you a much-needed break from the stressors in your life.

Understanding neuroplasticity and incorporating brain-boosting habits into daily life can support mental agility and overall brain health. What is neuroplasticity and what's the connection to cognitive fitness? Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt throughout life by modifying its structure, functions, or neural pathways. Dr. Andrew E. Budson, Chief of Cognitive & Behavioral Neurology at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System and chair of the Science of Learning Innovation Group at Harvard Medical School, explains, ""Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to learn, remember, and change when it is appropriate for the circumstances."" This adaptability allows the brain to reorganize itself in response to learning, experiences, and environmental influences. Cognitive fitness — the ability to think, learn, and remember effectively — depends on a healthy and adaptable brain. By actively engaging in behaviors that support neuroplasticity, you can strengthen cognitive function and potentially reduce the risk of age-related decline. Keys to cognitive fitness Maintaining cognitive fitness involves a combination of mental, physical, and social activities. Each of these factors plays a role in supporting neuroplasticity and promoting lifelong brain health. A healthy body supports a healthy brain. This means it is important to manage your health conditions. Lifestyle choices are also crucial. Maintaining cognitive fitness as you age is best achieved by combining these key approaches: Eat a brain-healthy diet. Engage in regular physical activity. Prioritize quality sleep. Challenge your brain. Nurture social connections. Manage stress. How physical activity supports cognitive health Exercise is not just beneficial for the body — it also has a powerful impact on the brain. Neuroplasticity is closely linked to the production of neurotrophins, a group of proteins that play a vital role in brain cell growth and function. Among the key neurotrophins involved in neuroplasticity is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Research suggests that lower levels of BDNF may contribute to cognitive decline, affecting memory, concentration, and learning ability. Dr. Budson highlights that aerobic exercise plays a critical role in promoting neuroplasticity, as it triggers the release of brain growth factors. He states, ""From the perspective of the body, we know that brain growth factors are released when we engage in aerobic exercise, so that is critically important."" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. Greater cognitive health benefits are seen at higher levels. Physical activity — both aerobic exercise and strength training — also increases blood flow to the brain and reduces stress and inflammation. Together, these changes improve mood, memory, focus, and processing speed, helping to preserve cognitive function and potentially reduce the risk of dementia, particularly in older adults. Nutrition and brain health A nutritious diet plays a significant role in maintaining cognitive function. Although the brain makes up only 2% of body weight, it utilizes 20% of the body's energy. The Mediterranean diet has been associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline. This diet emphasizes fruits, green leafy vegetables, whole grains, fish, legumes, nuts, and healthy fats like extra virgin olive oil. Another diet — the MIND diet — incorporates elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets. According to a study published in the journal Neurology, it may slow cognitive decline compared to other eating patterns. The MIND diet emphasizes plant-based foods and limits consumption of animal products and saturated fats. It highlights green leafy vegetables, nuts, berries, poultry, and fish. On the flip side, high-fat, high-refined-sugar diets have been linked to decreased BDNF and neuroplasticity. Avoiding excessive sugar and processed foods can also help maintain mental clarity and prevent inflammation that may contribute to poor brain health. Challenge your brain to boost neuroplasticity Just as physical exercise strengthens muscles, mental challenges help keep the brain sharp. Research shows that engaging in diverse, stimulating activities supports brain health by promoting neuroplasticity. Lifelong learning plays a key role in cognitive fitness by strengthening neural connections and enhancing cognitive reserve — the brain's ability to maintain function despite aging or disease. This reserve builds over time through education, career experiences, and mentally engaging activities, acting as a defense against cognitive decline. Dr. Budson suggests engaging in learning-based activities such as taking an adult education course, picking up a new hobby, or even reading books that introduce new concepts. ""Meeting new people and learning about them is a great way to enhance neuroplasticity, as is traveling to a new place,"" he adds. By regularly challenging your mind, you can strengthen neural pathways and support long-term brain health. Here are some additional ways to keep your brain active: Try something new. Learning a new language, instrument, or skill (like painting or cooking) forms fresh neural connections. Challenge yourself. Increase the difficulty of puzzles, games, or reading material to continuously build cognitive reserve. Mix up mental workouts. Avoid routine by incorporating different activities like strategy games, creative hobbies, and problem-solving exercises. Engage in cultural and social activities. Attending concerts, museums, or plays stimulates the brain and encourages deeper learning. Travel and explore. Visiting new places, even locally, enhances brain plasticity by exposing you to novel experiences. Enjoy music and movement. Playing an instrument, dancing, or even listening to music supports cognitive and emotional well-being. Prioritize sleep for brain health Quality sleep is essential for cognitive function and memory consolidation. During sleep, the brain processes and stores information, clears out toxins, and repairs neural pathways. Dr. Budson explains, ""There is now a tremendous body of evidence that memories are consolidated during sleep. Memory consolidation is the process of short-term memories turning into long-term memories."" He highlights that sleep not only strengthens important memories, but also helps regulate emotions and integrate new knowledge with prior experiences, making it crucial for neuroplasticity. Despite common belief, your sleep needs don't decrease as you age. Adults in their 70s and beyond still require seven to nine hours per night. However, changes in sleep patterns can make it more challenging. As you get older, you may fall asleep and wake up earlier, struggle to drift off, or experience more frequent awakenings during the night. It's fine to take a short nap during the day, which counts toward your total sleep. Try these sleep-improving strategies: Stick to a schedule. Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, even on weekends. Get morning sunlight. Exposure to natural light early in the day helps regulate sleep cycles. Exercise regularly. Physical activity improves sleep quality, but avoid intense workouts close to bedtime. Watch your diet. Eat a light dinner and avoid caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, and nicotine before bed. Limit screen time. Turn off electronics at least an hour before bed to reduce blue light exposure. Create a sleep-friendly environment. Keep your bedroom cool, dark, quiet, and comfortable. Establish a bedtime routine. Engage in calming activities like reading, stretching, meditation, or deep breathing. Chronic sleep deprivation can impair concentration, decision-making, and long-term brain health. If you regularly struggle to fall or stay asleep, talk to your doctor to identify the cause and explore the best treatment options. Reduce stress for a brain boost Chronic stress can take a toll on brain function by increasing levels of cortisol, a hormone that can damage neurons and inhibit neuroplasticity. However, practicing effective stress management techniques can help protect cognitive health and support long-term brain function. One particularly effective approach is mindfulness meditation. Research suggests that regular meditation promotes structural and functional changes in brain regions responsible for attention, emotional regulation, and memory. While research is ongoing, meditation is believed to support neuroplasticity by fostering the growth of new brain cells and connections, potentially mitigating the harmful effects of stress. In addition to meditation, other stress-reducing strategies include deep breathing exercises, listening to music, and spending time in nature. By incorporating these techniques into daily life, you can help reduce stress while supporting overall brain health and cognitive function. Social engagement and mental sharpness Staying socially connected is essential for preserving memory and cognitive function as you age. Research shows that those with active social lives are less likely to experience cognitive decline compared to individuals who are more isolated. Engaging in conversations and interactive activities stimulates key mental processes like attention and memory. Regular social interaction helps reinforce neural connections, slowing age-related decline and potentially delaying dementia by strengthening cognitive reserve. To support brain health, consider these engaging ways to stay socially active: traveling to new places attending cultural events such as theater, concerts, or art exhibitions joining social or retirement groups spending quality time with family and friends. By making social engagement a priority, you can help protect cognitive function while enjoying meaningful connections and experiences.",5,0.28468436,-0.093336344,True

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/short-term-cognitive-boost-from-exercise-may-last-for-many-hours,Short-term cognitive boost from exercise may last for many hours,1,"People often feel an immediate mental boost after exercise. The effect was thought to be short-lived, but a study published online Dec. 10, 2024, by the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity suggests it may last a full day. Scientists gathered data from 76 men and women, ages 50 to 83, who wore activity trackers for eight days and took cognitive tests each day. On average, people did about an hour of moderate-to-vigorous exercise, five hours of light activity, and nine hours of sedentary time each day. Moderate-to-vigorous exercise included activities that raised the heart rate, such as brisk walking, dancing, or walking up and down stairs. When comparing activity levels with memory test results, the researchers found that any amount of moder-ate-to-vigorous physical activity was associated with higher scores on memory tests on the following day regardless of time spent in sedentary behavior or light activity. In particular, participants showed better working memory and episodic memory (memory of events). Exercise increases blood flow to the brain and stimulates the release of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and dopamine, which help a range of cognitive functions, according to the researchers. These neurochemical changes have been understood to last up to a few hours after exercise, but the new findings suggest they may last longer.

https://naturalnews.com/2024-08-30-continuous-aerobic-training-most-effective-managing-diabetes.html,Study: Continuous aerobic training confirmed to be the MOST EFFECTIVE exercise for diabetes management,0,"A new study emphasizes the importance of selecting the right type of exercise to help people with Type 1 diabetes maintain both blood sugar levels and cardiovascular health, which is essential for managing the condition effectively. The research, published in the American Journal of Cardiology , indicates that consistently participating in continuous aerobic training might be the most effective approach for enhancing blood sugar control in those with Type 1 diabetes, particularly female patients. ""This study is important because diabetic patients often lack motivation to exercise as a means of managing their condition,"" noted study co-author Dr. Pooya Soltani, a senior lecturer at Staffordshire University in Stroke-on-Trent, England. ""One reason for this is that physical activity can lead to blood sugar drops, causing discomfort and demotivation. We investigated whether the type of physical activity could mitigate these blood sugar drops ."" The study focused on 19 adults with Type 1 diabetes who were not in the habit of exercising regularly. Participants took part in two different 30-minute exercise sessions on separate days. One session involved continuous, steady exercise, while the other consisted of interval training with alternating high and low intensity. Using a crossover design, each participant experienced both types of exercise – allowing for a direct comparison of individual responses to each type. The researchers measured blood sugar levels with a finger-prick test and recorded blood pressure, heart rate, perceived exertion and enjoyment at three different points during each session – before starting, right after finishing, and 20 minutes afterward. They then applied statistical methods to analyze differences in responses between men and women, different exercise types, and various time points. The study demonstrated that continuous exercise, such as maintaining a steady, moderate pace like jogging for 30 minutes, led to greater reductions in blood sugar levels compared to interval training. Interval training, which involves alternating between higher and lower intensity activities like switching between jogging and walking, also showed some positive effects although these were less pronounced. Interestingly, the study also highlighted gender-specific differences in how exercise impacted blood sugar levels. Women experienced more stable blood sugar control overall, with significant reductions, primarily after continuous exercise. In contrast, men had larger drops in blood sugar following both types of exercise but the most notable decreases occurred after continuous sessions. These findings suggest that continuous exercise is advantageous for managing blood sugar in both men and women, but men may need to be particularly cautious about monitoring their levels to avoid excessive drops. Despite the differences in blood sugar responses, both men and women reported similar levels of effort and enjoyment for both exercise types. This suggests that both continuous aerobic training and interval training could be enjoyable and effective options for people with Type 1 diabetes – allowing them to choose based on personal preference and blood sugar management goals. Exercise should be personalized based on needs and abilities Overall, these findings offer valuable guidance for health care professionals and those living with Type 1 diabetes. ""Our study showed that for male patients, interval exercise like short bursts of walking is preferable when starting with low blood sugar levels. Conversely, continuous exercise like running is more suitable for those with higher initial blood sugar levels. These approaches can help prevent sudden blood sugar drops,"" said Dr. Jorge Luiz de Brito-Gomes of the Federal University of Vale do Sao Francisco in Brazil. ""For female patients, both interval and continuous aerobic training appear to be effective starting points,"" added De Brito-Gomes. ""We hope these findings show that gender-specific recommendations should be considered for aerobic exercise prescription, especially for men with irregular physical activity levels."" Although continuous aerobic training seems to be more effective at controlling or regulating blood sugar, particularly for women, researchers note that the ideal type of exercise should still be personalized to match each individual's preference, blood sugar control needs and ability to manage their blood sugar levels during and after physical activity.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/exercises-that-go-easy-on-the-bladder,Exercises that go easy on the bladder,1,"The high-impact exercise you once loved no longer seems to be a good fit, now that stress incontinence has crept into your life. Maybe you leak urine if you swing your tennis racket with force or do any high-spirited jumping in an aerobics class. The discomfort, hassle, and embarrassment might make you want to give up on your routine. But simple solutions can keep you in action. Exercise and incontinence Stress incontinence is characterized by the leakage of small amounts of urine when you do anything that puts pressure on the bladder, whether that's coughing, laughing, or exercising. The leaks are the result of weakened pelvic floor muscles. These muscles normally help you hold in urine, bowel movements, and gas. ""Ideally, the muscles would respond to increased pressure by contracting to prevent leakage. But with stress incontinence, the muscles don't respond properly,"" says Emily Walsh, a pelvic floor physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Weak pelvic floor muscles can result from aging, pregnancy, childbirth, certain surgeries, medication side effects, garbled messages between the muscles and the brain, weak abdominal or hip muscles (which work with the pelvic floor muscles), or conditions that cause you to strain the pelvic floor muscles (such as constipation). Try these exercises You need aerobic exercise (the kind that works your heart and lungs) for good cardiovascular health. Since high-impact aerobic exercise is demanding on pelvic floor muscles, consider low-impact aerobics with gentler moves. For example, instead of playing tennis, play pickleball (avoid lunging for the ball or running across the court); instead of going for a run, go for a brisk walk; instead of taking Zumba classes, take ballroom dance lessons. Other types of low-impact exercise that won't overload pelvic muscles include swimming; cycling; and seated aerobics, boxing, or dance. Physical therapy ""If your goal is returning to high-impact activity, consider working with a pelvic floor physical therapist. We can tailor treatment to the symptoms you're having and the activities you want to do,"" Walsh says. Treatment might include any of the following. Kegel exercises. Your therapist can help you identify your pelvic floor muscles and strengthen them. One way to do this is called a Kegel exercise. All it involves is squeezing like you're trying to stop the flow of urine or hold back gas, holding the contraction for about 10 seconds, relaxing, and repeating. Abdominal and hip exercises. ""By strengthening abdominal and hip muscles, you're also strengthening the pelvic floor, since there's overlap among the muscles,"" Walsh says. Examples include bridges, planks (see ""Move of the month""), and clamshells (lying on your side with your knees bent and raising and lowering only your top knee while keeping your feet together). Breathing exercises. ""A lot of people hold their breath while exercising, but that puts increased pressure on pelvic floor muscles and weakens them,"" Walsh says. ""A helpful cue is exhaling with exertion. Breathe out at the hardest part of the exercise, which will give you more intense contractions of the abdominal and pelvic floor muscles."" Move of the month: Modified plank Doing a modified plank can strengthen abdominal and pelvic floor muscles. Place your forearms on a table or counter with your hands clasped and your shoulders aligned over your elbows. Step back so your body is straight, like a plank. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Hold for 15 to 60 seconds, take a break, then repeat. Exercise photo by Thomas MacDonald Other tips to help Practicing the following strategies can also help you cope with stress incontinence during exercise. Prepare for leaks. Wear absorbent ""bladder leak"" underwear or an absorbent pad. You'll stay comfortable and will be able to keep exercising. Empty your bladder just before exercising. This is easy to do at home. If you're exercising elsewhere, it helps to locate bathrooms in advance. Squeeze during exertion. Walsh suggests doing a Kegel-style contraction as you exert yourself with force — as you swing a racket, for example. Stay hydrated throughout the day. You might be inclined to avoid drinking a lot of fluids, hoping to reduce urine leaks. But that can lead to dehydration, which can cause confusion, fatigue, and falls — problems you always want to avoid, especially during exercise. Talk to your doctor. If you continue to leak during exercise, consult your doctor about other incontinence treatments, such as medication or surgery. Image: © kali9/Getty Images",5,0.30087975,-0.23323034,True
