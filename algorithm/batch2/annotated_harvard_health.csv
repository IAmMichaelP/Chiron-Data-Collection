          I'm a 70-year-old man with a family history of coronary artery disease. I currently take a low-dose statin. My recent LDL number is 105. Should I aim for a lower number?
        
        A. My situation is similar to yours. I have some family members who died young secondary to coronary heart disease, and I run a high total and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. I exercise regularly and try to follow a Mediterranean-style diet.
        About 15 years ago, my doctor recommended starting a statin. Even at a low dose, I experienced more aches and pains than I had previously. I stopped the statin, but in retrospect, I now doubt that the muscle aches were related to the drug.
        Eight years ago, I had a chest CT scan unrelated to any heart issues. My lungs were fine, but the scan showed calcium deposits in my arteries, including the coronary arteries that feed oxygen and nutrients to the heart. That was a game changer. Calcium gets deposited into fatty plaques that accumulate in the arteries. I knew this indicated that my risks of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke were significantly elevated. I immediately began taking the maximum dose of rosuvastatin (Crestor). Interestingly, I had no muscle aches, even with the high dose.
        In general, the lower your LDL cholesterol number, the lower your risk of developing heart disease. My high risk and need for a high-dose statin became apparent after the CT scan. But what about you and the millions of men with a similar family history or a somewhat elevated LDL level?
        Here's the discussion I would have with a man like you, who has a higher-than-ideal LDL level and is asking about increasing his statin dose or might not be on a statin yet.
        If you desire to maximally reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, aim for an LDL level of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). This means lifestyle changes, including a healthier diet and more physical activity. But you might also want to talk with your doctor about starting a low-dose statin or raising the dose if you already take one.
        An alternative is to have a coronary artery CT scan to get your coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. The test calculates the amount of calcium deposited in your coronary arteries. A zero score means a very low risk of trouble, and a high score means you might aim for an LDL level of 55 mg/dL or lower (the European Society of Cardiology recommendation for people at very high risk).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/a-three-pronged-approach-to-exercise,A three-pronged approach to exercise,"There's no question that getting regular exercise ranks as one of the leading strategies — if not the best one — for preventing heart disease. All forms of physical activity, even in small doses, can make a difference. But if you're looking to optimize your cardiovascular health, a regimen that includes three types of movement may be the way to go, according to a 2024 review article in Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine.
        The foundation of this exercise triad is moderate-intensity aerobic (cardio) exercise like brisk walking, one of the go-to options for meeting the federal activity guidelines (see ""Exercise recommendations and examples""). Moderate activity benefits your heart by burning calories and boosting metabolism, which helps control weight. But you can reap additional benefits by adding vigorous aerobic activity (the type that really gets your heart pumping) along with muscle-strengthening exercises.
        
          
            
              
                Exercise recommendations and examples
                Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity (or an equivalent combination of the two). Do strength training at least two days per week — even 10 to 15 minutes per session can be effective.
                Your age, baseline fitness level, and health conditions all affect what workout is best for you. Ask your doctor for help creating a safe three-part workout to optimize your heart health.

        How aerobic exercise helps
        ""People who run or do similar types of vigorous exercise may have experienced a 'runner's high' either during or after their workout,"" says Dr. Tim Churchill, a cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. That's because your body releases feel-good chemicals known as endorphins and endocannabinoids in response to intense exercise.
        Any kind of aerobic exercise, whether moderate or vigorous, also helps dampen the body's ""fight or flight"" response, which plays a role in chronic stress and anxiety. Aerobic exercise also spurs the release of adrenalin and related hormones that stimulate receptors in the heart to beat more frequently and forcefully. Over time, the heart becomes more efficient, requiring less effort to send blood through the body. And as more blood circulates through the body, blood vessels expand slightly and become more flexible.
        Why muscle-building matters
        Including muscle-building exercises in your weekly routine has a synergistic effect with aerobic exercise that can further enhance your heart health. Strength training can make your body more efficient at burning fat for energy. It also helps improve how your body responds to insulin, the hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels, Dr. Churchill says. That can help prevent or improve diabetes, a potent risk factor for heart disease. Strength training also promotes the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and widens blood vessels. ""Your arteries are then better able to relax, which helps to maintain normal blood pressure,"" says Dr. Churchill.
        As the review article notes, combining strength with moderate-intensity and some vigorous aerobic exercise leads to greater reductions in resting heart rate, blood pressure, body weight, and body fat percentage than doing single forms of exercise. ""Exercise clearly improves a lot of specific markers related to cardiovascular disease. But when you add up all those individual effects, it still only accounts for about 50% of the overall health benefit related to doing regular physical activity,"" says Dr. Churchill. The elusive remaining 50% is why the decades-long quest to create ""exercise in a pill"" will probably never materialize, he adds.

Use acetone-free products. Also, each time you take off polish, examine your nails for changes that can suggest various health conditions. These signs include thickened, yellow nails; redness or swelling around the nails; or dark streaks, splitting, or misshapen nail beds. See your doctor if you notice any such issues.","Toni Golen, MD","May 1, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/is-your-walking-up-to-speed,Is your walking up to speed?,"Walking is one of the best ways for older adults to get their recommended 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week. It requires only a good pair of shoes and can accommodate almost any fitness level. But to ensure you get the most benefits from your walking workouts, you must put in the necessary effort.
        ""It's easy for fitness walking to turn into casual strolls,"" says Antonina Stevens, a physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. ""In order to maintain the minimum level of effort, you must constantly challenge yourself, which means focusing on intensity.""
        Insight into intensity
        One way to measure your walking intensity is to use a target heart rate range. It works like this. First, estimate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age in years from 220. A typical target heart rate for moderate-intensity exercise is between 65% and 75% of your estimated maximum heart rate. For example, a 60-year-old man would have an estimated maximum heart rate of 160 (220 minus 60). His target heart rate for moderate-intensity exercise would be between 104 and 120 heartbeats per minute.
        ""When you're walking, you want your heart rate to stay within this range during most of the workout,"" says Stevens.
        You can track your target heart rate with a smart watch, such as an Apple Watch or Fitbit, which measures heart rate from your pulse at the wrist. Or just check your pulse for 15 seconds and multiply by 4. Another option is to use the perceived exertion scale to rate your exertion from 1 to 10, with 1 being complete rest and 10 meaning you're working so hard that breathing is difficult. Moderate-intensity activity is 5 or 6. (See ""Walk and talk."") Perceived exertion is often a better measurement for people taking a beta blocker, which blunts the normal exercise-induced rise in heart rate.
        
          
            
              
                Walk and talk
                The perceived exertion scale helps you gauge your exercise intensity. For moderate-intensity workouts, aim for 5 to 6 on the scale.

        The need for speed
        There are many ways to increase and maintain intensity. The obvious one is to walk faster. But that doesn't mean taking longer strides, which actually can slow you down. Instead, focus on improving your walking form using the following strategies. Begin with the first one, ""Stand tall."" After about a week, add the next tip, continue for another week, and so on.
        Pay attention at the beginning of your walks to ensure you follow each tip, and then periodically check to see if you need to correct anything. Some changes may happen quickly, while others may take time to become a habit.
        Stand tall. Extend your spine as if you're being lifted from the crown of your head. Keep your shoulders back and down, not scrunched up toward your ears. Your stride is more powerful when your posture is aligned and your core muscles are activated. Standing tall will also help alleviate aches and pains in your upper and lower back and allow you to take deeper breaths for more energy.
        Bend your arms. You wouldn't run with your arms straight — it would slow you down. The same goes for walking. When you bend your arms, it's easier to swing them. And since your body likes to be in sync, your legs will speed up to stay in step with your arms. Bend your elbows 85° to 90° and swing your arms forward and back — not side to side or diagonally across your body.
        Land on your heel. A heel-to-toe walking motion makes it easier to walk faster than if your foot lands flat with each step. As your leg swings forward, your heel should be the first part of your foot that contacts the ground. Focus on keeping your toes up as you land. Roll through your foot from your heel to your toes as smoothly as possible. Finally, push off with your toes.
        Push off strong. Focus on really pushing off the ground to propel yourself forward. For maximum power, bend at the ball of your foot, raising your heel as if trying to show the person behind you the sole of your shoe.
        Take shorter, quicker steps. This is the remedy for the common mistake of overstriding (taking longer steps than usual). Instead, focus on shorter, quicker steps — placing your front leg directly under you as you fall into your next step. This allows for a smoother, rolling stride that makes it easier to shift your body weight to your front leg and swing your back leg forward. The result: a faster walking speed.
        Keep your front leg straight. Keep your leg straight (but not locked at the knee) from when your foot lands on the ground until it's under your body. This will prevent bouncing. You'll have a smoother stride and propel yourself forward more easily.
        
          
            
              
                Intensity workouts
                Here are two workouts that can help you walk at higher intensity.
                
                  Intervals. Walk at an easy-to-moderate pace for three to four minutes, then walk at a vigorous pace (target heart rate of 75% to 85%, or 7 to 9 on the perceived exertion scale) for 30 seconds to a minute, and then repeat the cycle for your allocated time. You can adjust the sequence as needed: When you start, walk slower for longer periods and walk briskly for a shorter time. Eventually, you can work up to longer brisk walking and shorter recovery periods.
                  Inclines. Walking up and down hills or stairs at a slower speed can make you work harder than walking faster on a flat surface. If you use a treadmill, gradually adjust the machine's incline grade to mimic slower uphill walking.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sedentary-work-may-contribute-to-insomnia,Sedentary work may contribute to insomnia,"People with sedentary jobs — an estimated 80% of the workforce — have a much higher risk of experiencing insomnia compared with people who are active at work, according to a study published online Jan. 7, 2025, by the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology.
        Researchers surveyed nearly 1,300 people twice over a 10-year span, inquiring about their job schedules and physical activity levels while at work. They also asked about participants' sleep habits, identifying three sleep health categories: good sleepers, catch-up sleepers, and insomnia-like sleepers. Compared with active work, sedentary work was 37% likelier to lead to a variety of insomnia symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep, interrupted sleep, and frequent daytime tiredness. The findings also indicated that workers who fall into a pattern of poor sleep due to their job design can end up stuck in such unhealthy patterns for many years. Insomnia-like sleepers, for example, reported their symptoms persisted 10 years later, at the end of the study.
        People with sedentary jobs who move their bodies during the workday can help protect themselves against developing longstanding sleep problems, study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/will-diverticulitis-heal-on-its-own,Will diverticulitis heal on its own?,"Your doctor spotted diverticula in a previous colonoscopy, but you never thought the little pouches in your large intestine (colon) would turn into little devils. Now pain in your gut is telling you something is wrong. Do you have diverticulitis, and will it get better without medical care?
        How it happens
        Diverticula develop when weak spots in the colon lining bulge outward, creating little pouches or potholes. They more often form in the sigmoid colon, which runs down the left side of the pelvis and then joins the rectum.
        ""Most people never have a problem with them. They're extremely common: they are present in about 70% of us by age 80,"" says Dr. Alexander Goldowsky, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        But sometimes diverticula bleed, or they become inflamed or infected, a condition called diverticulitis.
        Recognizing diverticulitis
        Diverticulitis tends to cause pain in the lower left part of your abdomen. ""It's not typical tummy trouble. It's a different kind of pain that can be significant and severe,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        Although diverticula rarely cause symptoms, diverticulitis can cause bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool. If a diverticulum is infected, you might have a fever, chills, or vomiting in addition to pain.
        ""If it's the first time you've had this kind of pain, reach out to your doctor right away,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""If you have a history of diverticulitis and you develop mild symptoms, let your doctor know. He or she may just recommend temporary dietary changes and taking it easy. But if things aren't improving, call your doctor again.""
        Don't put off calling; an infected diverticulum can form an abscess (pus-filled pocket) that can extend to other tissue in the body and become life-threatening. In rare cases, that new colon pain may indicate cancer.
        Diagnosis
        After you've alerted your doctor about gut pain, you'll need to go in for a physical exam. This exam can involve checking your abdomen for tenderness and the rectum for signs of blood. You  might need blood and stool tests.
        But the main way to diagnose diverticulitis is with a CT scan, typically after a special type of contrast dye is injected into your vein. ""If we see inflammation surrounding one or more diverticula, we can determine that you have diverticulitis,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        Treatment
        Can diverticulitis heal on its own? ""Yes, it can, and for that reason, we don't always prescribe antibiotics. We reserve them for diverticulitis in people with an abscess, a significant amount of inflammation, symptoms that aren't improving, a suppressed immune system, frailty, or other health problems — such as liver or kidney disease,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        Care at home, with or without an antibiotic, includes rest, a clear liquid diet (see ""A liquid diet for diverticulitis""), and acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain. You might want to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), which can add to gastrointestinal discomfort.
        For severe diverticulitis, you might need to be hospitalized for a few days, getting antibiotics directly into a vein. If you have an abscess, you might need surgery to clean out the infection.
        
          
            
              
                A liquid diet for diverticulitis
                When you have diverticulitis, you might need a clear liquid diet, to give your colon a break from digesting solid foods.
                A liquid diet can include clear drinks and foods, such as water, broth or bouillon, black coffee, plain tea, clear juice (apple, white grape), clear soft drinks or sports drinks, Jell-O, or popsicles.
                There's no need to stay on a liquid diet for more than 48 hours unless recommended by your doctor.
              
            
          
        
        Getting better
        Healing from diverticulitis requires commitment. If you're taking an oral antibiotic, make sure you stick to the medication schedule. If you're on a liquid diet, avoid cheating.
        Once symptoms begin improving, you can move to a low-fiber diet. It includes animal protein (eggs, cheese, fish, poultry); certain cooked vegetables (carrots, green beans, potatoes, pumpkin, yams, or squash); low-fiber fruits (bananas, peaches, pears); and (if your doctor says it's okay) low-fiber breads such as white, sourdough, or refined wheat breads. Stay away from spicy, fatty foods and alcohol.
        If you feel up to it, it's okay to exercise, but go easy on yourself. ""Avoid abdominal exercise. Go for a walk or do some arm exercises with small dumbbells,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""If you feel uncomfortable, take a break."" And buckle in: it could be 10 days before your symptoms go away completely.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/counting-steps-is-good-is-combining-steps-and-heart-rate-better-202504173095,Counting steps is good — is combining steps and heart rate better?,"Have you met your step goals today? If so, well done! Monitoring your step count can inspire you to bump up activity over time.
        But when it comes to assessing fitness or cardiovascular disease risk, counting steps might not be enough. Combining steps and average heart rate (as measured by a smart device) could be a better way for you to assess fitness and gain insights into your risk for major illnesses like heart attack or diabetes. Read on to learn how many steps you need for better health, and why tagging on heart rate matters.
        Steps alone versus steps plus heart rate
        First, how many steps should you aim for daily? There's nothing special about the 10,000-steps number often touted: sure, it sounds impressive, and it's a nice round number that has been linked to certain health benefits. But fewer daily steps — 4,000 to 7,000 — might be enough to help you become healthier. And taking more than 10,000 steps a day might be even better.
        Second, people walking briskly up and down hills are getting a lot more exercise than those walking slowly on flat terrain, even if they take the same number of steps.
        So, at a time when millions of people are carrying around smartphones or wearing watches that monitor physical activity and body functions, might there be a better way than just a step count to assess our fitness and risk of developing major disease?
        According to a new study, the answer is yes.
        Get out your calculator: A new measure of health risks and fitness
        Researchers publishing in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that a simple ratio that includes both heart rate and step count is better than just counting steps. It's called the DHRPS, which stands for daily heart rate per step. To calculate it, take your average daily heart rate and divide it by your average daily step count. Yes, to determine your DHRPS you'll need a way to continuously monitor your heart rate, such as a smartwatch or Fitbit. And you'll need to do some simple math to arrive at your DHRPS ratio, as explained below.
        The study enrolled nearly 7,000 people (average age: 55). Each wore a Fitbit, a device that straps onto the wrist and is programmed to monitor steps taken and average heart rate each day. (Fitbits also have other features such as reminders to be active, a tracker of how far you've walked, and sleep quality, but these weren't part of this study.)
        Over the five years of the study, volunteers took more than 50 billion steps. When each individual's DHRPS was calculated and compared with their other health information, researchers found that higher scores were linked to an increased risk of
        
          type 2 diabetes
          high blood pressure (hypertension)
          coronary atherosclerosis, heart attack, and heart failure
          stroke.
        
        The DHRPS had stronger associations with these diseases than either heart rate or step count alone. In addition, people with higher DHRPS scores were less likely to report good health than those who had the lowest scores. And among the 21 study subjects who had exercise stress testing, those with the highest DHRPS scores had the lowest capacity for exercise.
        What counts as a higher score in this study?
        In this study, DHRPS scores were divided into three groups:
        
          Low: 0.0081 or lower
          Medium: higher than 0.0081 but lower than 0.0147
          High: 0.0147 or higher.
        
        How to make daily heart rate per step calculations
        Here's how it works. Let's say that over a one-month period your average daily heart rate is 80 and your average step count is 4,000. That means your DHRPS equals 80/4,000, or 0.0200. If the next month your average heart rate is still 80 but you take about 6,000 steps a day, your DHRPS is 80/6,000, or 0.0133. Since lower scores are better, this is a positive trend.
        Should you start calculating your DHRPS?
        Do the results described in this study tempt you to begin monitoring your DHRPS? You may decide to hold off until further research confirms actual health benefits from knowing that ratio.
        This study merely explored the relationship between DHRPS and risk of diabetes or cardiovascular disease like heart attack or stroke. This type of study can only establish a link between the DHRPS and disease. It can't determine whether a higher score actually causes them.
        Here are four other limitations of this research to keep in mind:
        
          Participants in this study were likely more willing to monitor their activity and health than the average person. And more than 70% of the study subjects were female and more than 80% were white. The results could have been quite different outside of a research setting and if a more diverse group had been included.
          The findings were not compared to standard risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as having a strong family history of cardiovascular disease or smoking cigarettes. Nor were DHRPS scores compared with standard risk calculators for cardiovascular disease. So the value of DHRPS compared with other readily available (and free) risk assessments isn't clear.
          The exercise stress testing findings were based on only 21 people. That's far too few to make definitive conclusions.
          The cost of a device to continuously monitor heart rate and steps can run in the hundreds of dollars; for many this may be prohibitive, especially since the benefits of calculating the DHRPS are unproven.
        
        The bottom line
        Tracking DHRPS or daily activity and other health measures might be a way to improve your health if the results prompt you to make positive changes in behavior, such as becoming more active. Or perhaps DHRPS could one day help your health care provider monitor your fitness, better assess your health risks, and recommend preventive approaches. But we don't yet know if this new measure will actually lead to improved health because the study didn't explore that.
        If you already have a device that continuously monitors your daily heart rate and step count, feel free to do the math! Maybe knowing your DHRPS will motivate you to do more to lower your risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Or maybe it won't. We need more research and experience with this measure to know whether it can deliver on its potential to improve health.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","April 17, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-stress-busters-to-help-your-heart,5 stress busters to help your heart,"Easing stress is one key to a healthier heart
        Stress that persists day in and day out — whether from a traffic-choked daily commute, unhappy relationship, or heavy workload — has been linked to a wide range of health issues. Many people know first-hand that chronic stress can negatively affect mood, sleep, and appetite. But you may not know that chronic stress can harm your heart –– or understand what you can do to counter its effects. 
        How does long-term stress harm the heart?
        Chronic stress leads to persistent low-grade inflammation in the body, which increases the risk of heart disease. Mood, sleep, and appetite changes brought on by the constant hum of stress can do so, too.    
        And stress may influence your risk of heart attack and other heart conditions in more subtle ways. For example, when under stress, some of us eat unhealthy food or lack the energy or time to exercise. Stress can also trigger heart-damaging behaviors such as smoking and drinking too much alcohol.
        5 great ways to destress
        Breaking the connection between chronic stress and heart disease requires finding tools that can help you cope with stress and aim for healthier habits. These five simple tips can help you do just that.
        
          Tap into laughter. Laughter has been found to lower levels of stress hormones and reduce inflammation in the arteries. Silly shows, corny jokes, and funny animal videos all count!
          Meditate. Finding time for a simple combination of inward-focused thought and deep breathing reduces heart disease risk factors such as high blood pressure. Meditative practices like yoga, tai chi, mindfulness, and prayer can also relax the mind and body.
          Try activity. Every time you are physically active, whether you take a walk or play tennis, your brain releases mood-boosting chemicals called endorphins. Short bursts of exercise can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. And exercising regularly not only helps you ease stress, it also protects against heart disease by lowering your blood pressure, strengthening your heart muscle, and helping you maintain a healthy weight.
          Unplug. It's impossible to escape stress when it follows you everywhere. Cut the cord. Avoid emails and TV news. Take time each day — even if it's for just 10 or 15 minutes — to escape from the world.
          Find ways to destress. Simple things, like a relaxing bath, listening to music, spending time in nature or on a favorite hobby, can give you a much-needed break from the stressors in your life.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-does-ozempic-work-understanding-glp-1s-for-diabetes-weight-loss-and-beyond,"How does Ozempic work? Understanding GLP-1s for diabetes, weight loss, and beyond","Ozempic and other GLP-1 receptor agonists have gained attention for their role in treating type 2 diabetes and promoting weight loss. These medications mimic a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar and appetite. While their benefits are clear, they also come with potential risks and side effects.

How do GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic work?

GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists are a class of medications that work by mimicking the natural GLP-1 hormone. This hormone is released by the gut in response to eating and has several effects that help regulate blood sugar levels, hunger, and slow digestion. Tirzepatide is a related drug that mimics GLP-1 as well as a hormone called a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).

Most GLP-1 drugs are administered by injection into the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.

How do GLP-1s help manage diabetes?

For people with type 2 diabetes, controlling blood sugar levels is essential to preventing complications like nerve damage, kidney disease, and heart problems. GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide (Ozempic), liraglutide (Victoza), and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) help by increasing insulin secretion in response to meals, thereby lowering blood sugar levels. They also lower levels of glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar.

GLP-1 drugs lower blood sugar only when it's high, unlike insulin, which works regardless of glucose levels. This glucose-dependent action reduces the risk of dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), making them a safer option compared to some other diabetes treatments

GLP-1 receptor agonists also reduce the likelihood of developing heart-related problems such as heart attacks or strokes. This is an important consideration because diabetes increases heart disease risk.

How do GLP-1s support weight loss?

One of the reasons GLP-1 receptor agonists have gained so much attention is their ability to help with weight loss. These medications slow down stomach emptying, keeping you feeling full longer. They also send signals to the brain that increase feelings of fullness, leading to reduced food intake.

GLP-1s are typically prescribed at a higher dose for obesity than for diabetes. Liraglutide (Saxenda), semaglutide (Wegovy), and tirzepatide (Zepbound) are all FDA-approved for weight loss.

In some studies, participants using GLP-1s have lost an average of 10% to 15% of their body weight over a year. The most effective GLP-1 medications can lead to weight loss of over 20% of body weight. This level of weight loss is significant because even a 5% to 10% reduction in body weight can improve metabolic health, lower blood pressure, and decrease the risk of conditions like fatty liver disease and obstructive sleep apnea.

Side effects you may experience with GLP-1s

Like any medication, GLP-1 receptor agonists may cause side effects in some people. These side effects often improve as the body adjusts to the medication. To minimize them, doctors typically start with a low dose and gradually increase it over time. Some of the most common GLP-1 side effects include:


	nausea
	vomiting
	diarrhea
	constipation
	abdominal discomfort.


Other less common but possible side effects include headaches, increased heart rate, dizziness, and fatigue. Some individuals may also experience mild injection site reactions such as redness or itching.

Dr. Chika Anekwe, Obesity Medicine Clinical Director at Massachusetts General Hospital Weight Center and instructor at Harvard Medical School, points out that a common misconception is that everyone experiences major side effects. ""While gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and constipation are common, they are usually temporary and manageable,"" she notes.

Possible risks of GLP-1s

While GLP-1 drugs are generally considered safe, they do come with potential risks. Persistent nausea or vomiting can lead to dehydration, kidney problems, or malnutrition in some cases. People with serious gastrointestinal conditions, like gastroparesis or uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease, should not take GLP-1 medications. And these medications are not considered safe for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

Other health risks include:


	Pancreatitis: Some studies suggest a possible link between GLP-1s and inflammation of the pancreas, though the risk appears to be low.
	Gallbladder problems: Some people develop gallstones or gallbladder inflammation while taking GLP-1s. (Gallstones can also result from rapid weight loss in the absence of GLP-1 medication.)
	Thyroid tumors: Animal studies have raised concerns about a potential link between GLP-1s and thyroid tumors, but ongoing surveillance has not shown that this applies to humans.
	Muscle loss: Some reports suggest that rapid weight loss from GLP-1s may lead to a decrease in muscle mass. (Weight loss even without GLP-1 medication results in some loss of muscle.) This is of particular concern for older adults, who may be at a higher risk for frailty and falls.


If you are taking or considering a GLP-1, discuss these risks with your doctor. There may be things you can do to mitigate some of these risks. For example, your doctor may advise you to increase your protein intake to reduce the risk of muscle loss.

Finally, beware of compounded GLP-1 drugs, which became popular during a GLP-1 drug shortage starting in 2022. The FDA has issued warnings about compounded GLP-1 drugs because of reports of harmful side effects. The FDA does not check compounded drugs for safety, effectiveness, or quality.

Potential benefits of GLP-1s under investigation

Beyond diabetes and weight loss, researchers are exploring other potential benefits of GLP-1 drugs. Major areas of exploration include:


	Heart health. Heart health remains a major area of interest. Research has suggested GLP-1s may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with diabetes or obesity.
	Brain health. Research is ongoing to determine whether these drugs could help protect against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Dr. Anekwe highlights that ""some research shows GLP-1s may slow cognitive decline and have a role in neuroprotection.""
	Addiction treatment. Some early studies suggest GLP-1 drugs may help reduce cravings for substances like alcohol and nicotine.
	Liver disease. Metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are conditions linked to obesity and insulin resistance. GLP-1 drugs may help reduce liver fat and inflammation, potentially slowing disease progression.
	Sleep apnea. In December 2024, the FDA approved tirzepatide (Zepbound) to treat moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity.


""The most notable benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists for patients with diabetes or obesity are their ability to promote significant weight loss, reduction in appetite, and improvement in blood sugar control,"" says Dr. Anekwe. She continues, ""The cardiovascular protection and other emerging benefits, such as improvements in outcomes related to metabolic-associated liver disease and obstructive sleep apnea, are additional benefits of these medications.""","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","April 14, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/zinc-what-it-does-for-the-body-and-the-best-food-sources,"Zinc: What it does for the body, and the best food sources","The word zinc may conjure images of cold remedies and sunblock. But dietary zinc, found in a variety of foods including seafood, meat, and fortified breakfast cereal, is an important nutrient that plays a vital role in many of the body's functions.
        What is zinc?
        Zinc is a trace mineral that's essential for the proper functioning of the human body. ""Since we cannot produce zinc as an element, we have to eat it,"" says Teresa Fung, a registered dietitian and adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. Foods including beef, shrimp, and pumpkin seeds contain high levels of the nutrient.
        Benefits of zinc: What does zinc do for the body?
        Zinc is vital for normal immune system function and wound healing. In addition, the body needs zinc for bone growth, the production of hormones such as insulin and testosterone, sperm production, and fetal development. Your body also needs zinc in order to smell and taste.
        How much zinc do you need each day?
        The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for zinc is 11 milligrams (mg) per day for adult men and 8 mg per day for adult women. For pregnant or lactating women, the RDA is 11 mg per day and 12 mg per day, respectively.
        What happens if you don't get enough zinc?
        Symptoms of zinc deficiency include slow wound healing, poor oral health, loss of taste and smell, skin lesions, hair loss, poor immune response, and diarrhea. Children with zinc deficiency may suffer delayed growth, as well as diarrhea and frequent infections. All of these symptoms, however, could also be the result of other disorders or deficiencies. The only way to confirm deficiency is with a blood test to measure zinc levels in the blood.
        The risk of zinc deficiency is higher in older adults, as well as in people who eat a plant-based diet, women who are pregnant or nursing, people with gastrointestinal disorders like Crohn's disease and celiac disease, and those who have had bariatric surgery. Overall, zinc deficiency is rare in the U.S.
        Foods high in zinc
        Nonvegetarian foods tend to be higher in zinc, with oysters and beef topping the list. Compared to other vegetarian foods, lentils, pumpkin seeds, cheese, and cashews are good sources of zinc. Fortified cereals contain higher levels of zinc as well.

        Should you take a zinc supplement?
        Most people, including vegetarians, can consume enough zinc through a balanced and varied diet. Your doctor may recommend a supplement if a blood test indicates your levels are low. If you are zinc deficient, you may also need further evaluation to identify and then address the underlying cause of your deficiency.
        Some people swear by Cold-EEZE, a lozenge containing zinc gluconate, to reduce common cold duration and symptoms. But studies haven't consistently shown it to help that much, or at all. In addition, in one study, the majority of people who used zinc lozenges suffered adverse effects like nausea and bad taste. Zinc nasal sprays may also cause loss of smell. Zinc supplements may interfere with the effectiveness of quinolone and tetracycline antibiotics, so tell your doctor if you are taking a supplement.
        Risks of too much zinc
        It's hard to consume too much zinc from food. If you are taking a supplement, avoid exceeding the upper safety limit of 40 mg per day. Risks of too much zinc include stomach pain, headaches, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.",Rachael Moeller Gorman,"April 7, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/tips-to-leverage-neuroplasticity-to-maintain-cognitive-fitness-as-you-age,Tips to leverage neuroplasticity to maintain cognitive fitness as you age,"As we age, maintaining cognitive fitness becomes increasingly important. The brain's ability to adapt and rewire itself — known as neuroplasticity — plays a crucial role in keeping our minds sharp.
        While aging can bring natural changes to the brain, engaging in specific activities and lifestyle choices can help preserve and even enhance cognitive function. Understanding neuroplasticity and incorporating brain-boosting habits into daily life can support mental agility and overall brain health.
        What is neuroplasticity and what's the connection to cognitive fitness?
        Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt throughout life by modifying its structure, functions, or neural pathways.
        Dr. Andrew E. Budson, Chief of Cognitive & Behavioral Neurology at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System and chair of the Science of Learning Innovation Group at Harvard Medical School, explains, ""Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to learn, remember, and change when it is appropriate for the circumstances."" This adaptability allows the brain to reorganize itself in response to learning, experiences, and environmental influences.
        Cognitive fitness — the ability to think, learn, and remember effectively — depends on a healthy and adaptable brain. By actively engaging in behaviors that support neuroplasticity, you can strengthen cognitive function and potentially reduce the risk of age-related decline.
        Keys to cognitive fitness
        Maintaining cognitive fitness involves a combination of mental, physical, and social activities. Each of these factors plays a role in supporting neuroplasticity and promoting lifelong brain health.
        A healthy body supports a healthy brain. This means it is important to manage your health conditions.
        Lifestyle choices are also crucial. Maintaining cognitive fitness as you age is best achieved by combining these key approaches:
        
          Eat a brain-healthy diet.
          Engage in regular physical activity.
          Prioritize quality sleep.
          Challenge your brain.
          Nurture social connections.
          Manage stress.
        
        How physical activity supports cognitive health
        Exercise is not just beneficial for the body — it also has a powerful impact on the brain. Neuroplasticity is closely linked to the production of neurotrophins, a group of proteins that play a vital role in brain cell growth and function. Among the key neurotrophins involved in neuroplasticity is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Research suggests that lower levels of BDNF may contribute to cognitive decline, affecting memory, concentration, and learning ability.
        Dr. Budson highlights that aerobic exercise plays a critical role in promoting neuroplasticity, as it triggers the release of brain growth factors. He states, ""From the perspective of the body, we know that brain growth factors are released when we engage in aerobic exercise, so that is critically important.""
        The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. Greater cognitive health benefits are seen at higher levels.
        Physical activity — both aerobic exercise and strength training — also increases blood flow to the brain and reduces stress and inflammation. Together, these changes improve mood, memory, focus, and processing speed, helping to preserve cognitive function and potentially reduce the risk of dementia, particularly in older adults.
        Nutrition and brain health
        A nutritious diet plays a significant role in maintaining cognitive function. Although the brain makes up only 2% of body weight, it utilizes 20% of the body's energy.
        The Mediterranean diet has been associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline. This diet  emphasizes fruits, green leafy vegetables, whole grains, fish, legumes, nuts, and healthy fats like extra virgin olive oil.
        Another diet — the MIND diet —  incorporates elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets. According to a study published in the journal Neurology, it may slow cognitive decline compared to other eating patterns. The MIND diet emphasizes plant-based foods and limits consumption of animal products and saturated fats. It highlights green leafy vegetables, nuts, berries, poultry, and fish.
        On the flip side, high-fat, high-refined-sugar diets have been linked to decreased BDNF and neuroplasticity. Avoiding excessive sugar and processed foods can also help maintain mental clarity and prevent inflammation that may contribute to poor brain health.
        Challenge your brain to boost neuroplasticity
        Just as physical exercise strengthens muscles, mental challenges help keep the brain sharp. Research shows that engaging in diverse, stimulating activities supports brain health by promoting neuroplasticity.
        Lifelong learning plays a key role in cognitive fitness by strengthening neural connections and enhancing cognitive reserve — the brain's ability to maintain function despite aging or disease. This reserve builds over time through education, career experiences, and mentally engaging activities, acting as a defense against cognitive decline.
        Dr. Budson suggests engaging in learning-based activities such as taking an adult education course, picking up a new hobby, or even reading books that introduce new concepts. ""Meeting new people and learning about them is a great way to enhance neuroplasticity, as is traveling to a new place,"" he adds.
        By regularly challenging your mind, you can strengthen neural pathways and support long-term brain health. Here are some additional ways to keep your brain active:
        
          Try something new. Learning a new language, instrument, or skill (like painting or cooking) forms fresh neural connections.
          Challenge yourself. Increase the difficulty of puzzles, games, or reading material to continuously build cognitive reserve.
          Mix up mental workouts. Avoid routine by incorporating different activities like strategy games, creative hobbies, and problem-solving exercises.
          Engage in cultural and social activities. Attending concerts, museums, or plays stimulates the brain and encourages deeper learning.
          Travel and explore. Visiting new places, even locally, enhances brain plasticity by exposing you to novel experiences.
          Enjoy music and movement. Playing an instrument, dancing, or even listening to music supports cognitive and emotional well-being.
        
        Prioritize sleep for brain health
        Quality sleep is essential for cognitive function and memory consolidation. During sleep, the brain processes and stores information, clears out toxins, and repairs neural pathways.
        Dr. Budson explains, ""There is now a tremendous body of evidence that memories are consolidated during sleep. Memory consolidation is the process of short-term memories turning into long-term memories."" He highlights that sleep not only strengthens important memories, but also helps regulate emotions and integrate new knowledge with prior experiences, making it crucial for neuroplasticity.
        Despite common belief, your sleep needs don't decrease as you age. Adults in their 70s and beyond still require seven to nine hours per night. However, changes in sleep patterns can make it more challenging. As you get older, you may fall asleep and wake up earlier, struggle to drift off, or experience more frequent awakenings during the night. It's fine to take a short nap during the day, which counts toward your total sleep.
        Try these sleep-improving strategies:
        
          Stick to a schedule. Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, even on weekends.
          Get morning sunlight. Exposure to natural light early in the day helps regulate sleep cycles.
          Exercise regularly. Physical activity improves sleep quality, but avoid intense workouts close to bedtime.
          Watch your diet. Eat a light dinner and avoid caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, and nicotine before bed.
          Limit screen time. Turn off electronics at least an hour before bed to reduce blue light exposure.
          Create a sleep-friendly environment. Keep your bedroom cool, dark, quiet, and comfortable.
          Establish a bedtime routine. Engage in calming activities like reading, stretching, meditation, or deep breathing.
        
        Chronic sleep deprivation can impair concentration, decision-making, and long-term brain health. If you regularly struggle to fall or stay asleep, talk to your doctor to identify the cause and explore the best treatment options.
        Reduce stress for a brain boost
        Chronic stress can take a toll on brain function by increasing levels of cortisol, a hormone that can damage neurons and inhibit neuroplasticity. However, practicing effective stress management techniques can help protect cognitive health and support long-term brain function.
        One particularly effective approach is mindfulness meditation. Research suggests that regular meditation promotes structural and functional changes in brain regions responsible for attention, emotional regulation, and memory. While research is ongoing, meditation is believed to support neuroplasticity by fostering the growth of new brain cells and connections, potentially mitigating the harmful effects of stress.
        In addition to meditation, other stress-reducing strategies include deep breathing exercises, listening to music, and spending time in nature. By incorporating these techniques into daily life, you can help reduce stress while supporting overall brain health and cognitive function.
        Social engagement and mental sharpness
        Staying socially connected is essential for preserving memory and cognitive function as you age. Research shows that those with active social lives are less likely to experience cognitive decline compared to individuals who are more isolated.
        Engaging in conversations and interactive activities stimulates key mental processes like attention and memory. Regular social interaction helps reinforce neural connections, slowing age-related decline and potentially delaying dementia by strengthening cognitive reserve.
        To support brain health, consider these engaging ways to stay socially active:
        
          traveling to new places
          attending cultural events such as theater, concerts, or art exhibitions
          joining social or retirement groups
          spending quality time with family and friends.
        
        By making social engagement a priority, you can help protect cognitive function while enjoying meaningful connections and experiences.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","April 2, 2025",1

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/short-term-cognitive-boost-from-exercise-may-last-for-many-hours,Short-term cognitive boost from exercise may last for many hours,"People often feel an immediate mental boost after exercise. The effect was thought to be short-lived, but a study published online Dec. 10, 2024, by the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity suggests it may last a full day.
        Scientists gathered data from 76 men and women, ages 50 to 83, who wore activity trackers for eight days and took cognitive tests each day. On average, people did about an hour of moderate-to-vigorous exercise, five hours of light activity, and nine hours of sedentary time each day. Moderate-to-vigorous exercise included activities that raised the heart rate, such as brisk walking, dancing, or walking up and down stairs.
        When comparing activity levels with memory test results, the researchers found that any amount of moder-ate-to-vigorous physical activity was associated with higher scores on memory tests on the following day regardless of time spent in sedentary behavior or light activity. In particular, participants showed better working memory and episodic memory (memory of events).
        Exercise increases blood flow to the brain and stimulates the release of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and dopamine, which help a range of cognitive functions, according to the researchers. These neurochemical changes have been understood to last up to a few hours after exercise, but the new findings suggest they may last longer.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/pay-attention-to-concentration,Pay attention to concentration,"Over time, you may find it harder to concentrate, and you struggle to complete routine tasks like paying bills and doing household chores. Or you have trouble retaining information from a recent conversation or a book passage you just read. While frustrating, such episodes of poor concentration are also potentially dangerous, as they may lead to mistakes like car accidents or medication overdoses.
        Decreased concentration is often a normal part of aging as the brain's ability to function efficiently gradually declines. Mental concentration is part of executive function — a set of skills processed throughout the brain, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (part of the frontal lobe, located behind the forehead). ""Executive function helps you plan, make decisions, and perhaps most important, pay attention,"" says Lydia Cho, a clinical psychologist and neuropsychologist with Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        Tackling tasks
        If you struggle with concentration when performing tasks, there are ways to help improve your focus. For example:
        Avoid multitasking. Concentration can suffer when you take on too much at once. Do one task at a time until it's completed, then move on to the next. When faced with multiple to-do items, choose two and leave the others for another time.
        Take scheduled mental breaks. Research has found that attention can begin to wane as soon as 10 minutes after beginning a task. Note the time you begin a task, and then look again when your mind has wandered. Find your optimal range of when your attention is at its peak, schedule a break after this time, and then return to the task. Repeat the cycle until the task is complete.
        Another variation on this approach is the Pomodoro Technique, in which you set a 25-minute timer and work straight through, followed by a five-minute break, and then repeat. (You can adjust the work time as needed.) ""This approach is also helpful for people who have difficulty initiating tasks due to concerns about poor concentration,"" says Cho. ""Committing oneself to a firm number like 25 minutes or so can make beginning the task seem less daunting as you know it has an end point.""
        Remove distractions. When working on a task, switch off the TV, set up message blockers on your computer, and silence your smartphone. (If you're worried about missing an important call, you can create a list of contacts who will be allowed to reach you.) If you find that some background noise helps with concentration, turn on some soothing sounds, like bird songs or white noise. Or if you need complete silence, wear ear defenders (headphones that block surrounding sounds).
        Move for 10 minutes. Regular aerobic exercise can help with brain health, but when you need a quick concentration boost, take a 10-minute walk. One study found that this brief period of exercise increases blood flow to the prefrontal cortex.
        
          
            
              
                When to think about medical help
                You should see your doctor if you notice sudden changes in your ability to concentrate. It could be related to stress, mood (anxiety or depression), medical conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnea), or reflect mild cognitive impairment. Poor concentration also is a symptom of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a chronic condition characterized by difficulty focusing or staying on task, restlessness, and/or impulsive behavior. While ADHD is often identified in childhood, more adults are being diagnosed with ADHD, according to a 2024 CDC study.
              
            
          
        
        Brain training
        It's also possible to improve concentration with focus-training activities. ""The goal is to maintain concentration for brief periods,"" says Cho. ""Over time, you can learn to keep that focus for a longer duration."" For instance, do a daily five-minute meditation — silently count your breaths in repeated sets of 10. (Breathe in slowly and deeply, followed by exhaling all the air out, and repeat.) When your mind wanders, return to the pattern of counting breaths.
        Another approach is to read in silence for 10 minutes or until your attention drifts, take a break, and return to reading. Eventually, try to meditate or read for longer times. Doing simple repetitive tasks that require little time and a low effort of concentration like washing dishes or gardening can have a similar effect.
        Also, engage your brain with activities that use executive function skills, says Cho. ""You want something that stimulates and requires mental effort, but not so much that it overwhelms and dissuades you."" Cho suggests learning a new skill with instructions and lessons, which encourages you to pay attention, such as painting, cooking, or learning an instrument or language. ""These require focus, but are set up to show progress and offer encouragement.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-well-does-body-mass-index-correlate-with-excess-fat,How well does body mass index correlate with excess fat?,"Q.
          I recently read that a person's body mass index (BMI) might not be the best way to determine if your weight is healthy. Why is BMI being questioned? Are other measurements better?
        
        A. Your BMI is a number that is calculated based on your height and weight. (Many online calculators are available to determine your BMI.) According to the CDC, a normal BMI is 18.5 to 25. BMI helps determine if someone is underweight, as a BMI below 18.5 might indicate a medical problem or nutrient deficiency.
        However, the more common use of BMI is to determine whether a person is overweight or obese and as a proxy for excess body fat. A very high BMI of 40 or higher (severe obesity) almost always indicates excess fat. However, many people with a BMI greater than 25 but less than 30 (overweight), and even people with a BMI of 30 or higher (obesity), might carry extra fat without it affecting their daily life or health. Also, some people with normal BMI still have excess fat in places that put them at increased risk of chronic conditions.
        That's why, on Jan. 14, 2025, a group of 58 world experts convened by The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology published a new definition of obesity that is not based solely on BMI. Does that mean we should ignore BMI between the extremes of underweight and severe obesity? Not necessarily. But BMI needs to be combined with at least one additional measurement, because the location of fat is just as important as the amount of fat.
        Visceral fat lies deep inside the belly and surrounds organs. Unlike subcutaneous fat, which is directly under the skin, visceral fat can infiltrate the liver and increase the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney problems, and liver failure.
        BMI is not a good way to measure visceral fat. A better approach is to measure your waist size just above your navel at the end of a natural breath while standing tall. In men, a waist size of 40 inches or more almost always indicates excess visceral fat. Ideally, men between 5 feet, 6 inches and 6 feet, 6 inches tall should aim for a waist size of no more than one-half their height.
        An alternative way to assess visceral fat is waist-to-hip ratio. For men, waist size divided by the circumference measured around the hips should be less than 1.0. (Some references suggest an ideal ratio for men is no more than 0.9). In simple terms: your waist should be smaller than your hips.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/varicose-veins-more-than-a-cosmetic-concern,Varicose veins: More than a cosmetic concern,"Your leg veins face a constant uphill battle, working against gravity to transport blood from your feet back up to your heart. But sometimes, the one-way valves inside them weaken, allowing blood to trickle backward and pool inside the veins. Over time, the veins just under the surface of the skin (called superficial veins) can become engorged and twisted, bulging visibly.
        Known as varicose veins, this common problem is unsightly and often uncomfortable, causing symptoms such as pain, aching, and a feeling of heaviness in the legs. And for some people, varicose veins are a harbinger of more serious problems.
        One complication is a blood clot inside a varicose vein, called superficial vein thrombosis. Causes include dehydration (which makes the blood thicker and more prone to clot) and injury. ""A small section of the vein turns hard, red, and painful,"" says Dr. Sherry Scovell, a vascular surgeon who specializes in venous disease at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. If that happens, go to the emergency room for an ultrasound, she advises.
        Clots and other complications
        The superficial veins connect to large veins deeper inside the leg, which means a small clot can move to a deep vein and grow. ""About 25% of people with superficial vein thrombosis also have deep-vein thrombosis,"" says Dr. Scovell. Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) poses a serious threat if the clot breaks off and travels to a blood vessel serving the lung, causing a potentially life-threatening blockage called a pulmonary embolism.
        ""We used to treat superficial vein clots with a small dose of ibuprofen and a warm compress,"" says Dr. Scovell. Now, doctors prescribe an anti-clotting drug such as apixaban (Eliquis) or rivaroxaban (Xarelto) for 45 days to help prevent DVT. Treating varicose veins can help reduce this risk.
        Left untreated, varicose veins can also cause other complications. Blood can leak from the damaged valves and pool in the ankles, causing swelling and skin changes characterized by a brown discoloration. As the problem advances, the damaged layer of the skin breaks down to the point where even a tiny nick or scratch can result in an oozing, open wound (a venous ulcer) that's prone to infection.
        What you can do
        Varicose veins run in families and become more common with age. They're also more prevalent among women, in part because of the increase in blood volume that occurs during pregnancy. Being overweight also raises your risk, as does prolonged standing or sitting.
        Three simple strategies can help prevent and improve varicose veins.
        Get moving. Exercise that works your calf muscles — like walking — helps; so do calf raises. Point and flex your feet if you have to sit for long periods of time (for example, during air travel or long car rides).
        Put your feet up. Give your legs a break by elevating your feet at the end of the day, and even during the middle of the day, if possible. This can relieve pressure on the veins to help keep them healthy.
        Pull on compression stockings. These snug elastic socks are tighter at the ankle than at the calf, squeezing your legs slightly to help keep blood moving.
        People also need to wear compression stockings for at least two weeks after a vein ablation treatment (see ""Vanquishing varicose veins""), says Dr. Scovell. Many people are initially reluctant but then end up wearing them even longer because the stockings make their legs feel so great, she says. ""These aren't the thick, beige stockings your grandmother wore. They come in different colors, patterns, lengths, and compression levels,"" says Dr. Scovell, who wears thigh-high black compression stockings that resemble tights every day at work. You can find them online or in drugstores. But if you have a serious vein-related complication, a medical supply store may be your best option for finding the most appropriate product.
        
          
            
              
                Vanquishing varicose veins
                Several therapies can eliminate varicose veins. Doing so redirects blood flow to healthy veins. The oldest and best studied is thermal ablation. A doctor threads a narrow tube called a catheter into the faulty vein, then applies heat in the form of laser or radiofrequency energy to collapse the vein and seal it shut. Newer options include

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/exercises-that-go-easy-on-the-bladder,Exercises that go easy on the bladder,"The high-impact exercise you once loved no longer seems to be a good fit, now that stress incontinence has crept into your life. Maybe you leak urine if you swing your tennis racket with force or do any high-spirited jumping in an aerobics class. The discomfort, hassle, and embarrassment might make you want to give up on your routine. But simple solutions can keep you in action.
        Exercise and incontinence
        Stress incontinence is characterized by the leakage of small amounts of urine when you do anything that puts pressure on the bladder, whether that's coughing, laughing, or exercising.
        The leaks are the result of weakened pelvic floor muscles. These muscles normally help you hold in urine, bowel movements, and gas. ""Ideally, the muscles would respond to increased pressure by contracting to prevent leakage. But with stress incontinence, the muscles don't respond properly,"" says Emily Walsh, a pelvic floor physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Weak pelvic floor muscles can result from aging, pregnancy, childbirth, certain surgeries, medication side effects, garbled messages between the muscles and the brain, weak abdominal or hip muscles (which work with the pelvic floor muscles), or conditions that cause you to strain the pelvic floor muscles (such as constipation).
        Try these exercises
        You need aerobic exercise (the kind that works your heart and lungs) for good cardiovascular health. Since high-impact aerobic exercise is demanding on pelvic floor muscles, consider low-impact aerobics with gentler moves.
        For example, instead of playing tennis, play pickleball (avoid lunging for the ball or running across the court); instead of going for a run, go for a brisk walk; instead of taking Zumba classes, take ballroom dance lessons.
        Other types of low-impact exercise that won't overload pelvic muscles include swimming; cycling; and seated aerobics, boxing, or dance.
        Physical therapy
        ""If your goal is returning to high-impact activity, consider working with a pelvic floor physical therapist. We can tailor treatment to the symptoms you're having and the activities you want to do,"" Walsh says. Treatment might include any of the following.
        Kegel exercises. Your therapist can help you identify your pelvic floor muscles and strengthen them. One way to do this is called a Kegel exercise. All it involves is squeezing like you're trying to stop the flow of urine or hold back gas, holding the contraction for about 10 seconds, relaxing, and repeating.
        Abdominal and hip exercises. ""By strengthening abdominal and hip muscles, you're also strengthening the pelvic floor, since there's overlap among the muscles,"" Walsh says. Examples include bridges, planks (see ""Move of the month""), and clamshells (lying on your side with your knees bent and raising and lowering only your top knee while keeping your feet together).
        Breathing exercises. ""A lot of people hold their breath while exercising, but that puts increased pressure on pelvic floor muscles and weakens them,"" Walsh says. ""A helpful cue is exhaling with exertion. Breathe out at the hardest part of the exercise, which will give you more intense contractions of the abdominal and pelvic floor muscles.""
        
          
            
              
                Move of the month: Modified plank
                
                  
                
                Doing a modified plank can strengthen abdominal and pelvic floor muscles. Place your forearms on a table or counter with your hands clasped and your shoulders aligned over your elbows. Step back so your body is straight, like a plank. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Hold for 15 to 60 seconds, take a break, then repeat.

        Other tips to help
        Practicing the following strategies can also help you cope with stress incontinence during exercise.
        Prepare for leaks. Wear absorbent ""bladder leak"" underwear or an absorbent pad. You'll stay comfortable and will be able to keep exercising.
        Empty your bladder just before exercising. This is easy to do at home. If you're exercising elsewhere, it helps to locate bathrooms in advance.
        Squeeze during exertion. Walsh suggests doing a Kegel-style contraction as you exert yourself with force — as you swing a racket, for example.
        Stay hydrated throughout the day. You might be inclined to avoid drinking a lot of fluids, hoping to reduce urine leaks. But that can lead to dehydration, which can cause confusion, fatigue, and falls — problems you always want to avoid, especially during exercise.
        Talk to your doctor. If you continue to leak during exercise, consult your doctor about other incontinence treatments, such as medication or surgery.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/4-ways-your-teeth-and-gums-are-changing,4 ways your teeth and gums are changing,"What's happening inside your mouth? Maybe it seems like your gums are receding a bit or your teeth are shifting. In some cases, these kinds of developments can be age-related and nothing to worry about. In others, they might signal an underlying condition that needs attention. Consider the following changes and how to take action to address them.
        1. Receding gums
        Does it look like your teeth are getting longer? They're not growing; your gums are moving away from your teeth (receding). That can happen if you brush your teeth aggressively. ""If you brush too hard, it irritates the gums, and they move away from the source of irritation,"" says Dr. Lisa Thompson, a geriatric dentistry specialist at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
        Receding gums can also signal gum disease. That's caused by plaque buildup on teeth that leads to gum irritation, swelling, and bleeding. This early stage of disease, called gingivitis, can progress below the gum line, becoming periodontal disease, and destroy the ligament and bone holding the tooth in place. At that point, you can experience gum pain, abscesses (infected pockets of pus), and tooth loss.
        Take action: Go easy when you brush. Toothbrushing should be a gentle massage, not a vigorous scrub. Also: make sure you brush and floss at least twice a day, and seek dental care on a regular basis. ""Gingivitis can be reversed. And once we get periodontal disease under control, we can stop it from worsening, as long as you maintain good dental hygiene and also go to your dentist's office regularly for deep cleanings,"" Dr. Thompson says. ""If you've lost teeth from gum disease, you may need surgery, bone grafts, tooth implants, or a fixed or removable bridge.""
        2. Shifting teeth
         It's hard to tell by simply looking at your smile, but your teeth shift slightly throughout life. After all, we put teeth through a great deal of stress as they smash and grind up food when we eat. ""The pressure of your tongue pushing against your teeth also contributes to subtle shifting,"" Dr. Thompson says. In some cases, this migration can make a difference in your bite or speech.
        More significant tooth shifting — the kind that changes your appearance — is caused by gum disease or bone loss.
        Take action: Talk to your dentist. For minor shifting, you might be a candidate for braces, which place pressure on the teeth to change their position. (Don't worry — braces are more advanced and don't hurt as much as they did years ago. You might not need the kind that are glued to teeth; plastic aligners might do the job.)
        For significant shifting, you'll need to get underlying problems, such as gum disease, treated first, before considering braces.
        3. Changing tooth color
        The gleaming white outer layer (enamel) of your teeth changes over time. It can turn gray or yellow from smoking or consuming foods or drinks that stain teeth (such as coffee or tea). Enamel can also become slightly translucent from a change in its water content or from tooth grinding (which wears down enamel).
        Take action: To whiten teeth, consider using bleaching trays. The kind you get at the dentist's office — fitted plastic retainers with whitening chemicals — are most effective. You might also consider getting veneers, which are porcelain covers for the surfaces of individual teeth.
        If you suspect that you grind your teeth at night, see your dentist, who'll be able to detect telltale signs. If you do: ""Wear a mouth guard at night to protect your teeth from future damage while you sleep,"" Dr. Thompson says. ""A custom-fit device from the dentist's office will be stronger and more comfortable than over-the-counter versions.""
        4. Reduced tooth pain
        Are your teeth less sensitive than they used to be? That's a nice development if you're drinking something cold or you need a dental procedure. But less sensitivity also has risks.
        Reduced dental pain is caused by the thickening of dentin, the porous yellow material beneath tooth enamel. Dentin buildup occurs with age. ""As dentin thickens, nerves inside teeth shrink. You feel less pain, but you might also miss the warning signs of a cavity or another problem that's brewing, and it might go on so long that it gets to an advanced stage,"" Dr. Thompson says.
        Take action: Keep up daily brushing and flossing, and get teeth cleanings at least twice a year. Like all health conditions, dental problems are easier to treat when they're caught early.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-to-stop-stressing-over-minor-memory-lapses,How to stop stressing over minor memory lapses,"Everybody knows about ""senior moments"" — episodes of momentary forgetfulness about things like someone's name or where you parked the car. You might not fret about these cognitive hiccups if they're infrequent. But what if you're constantly forgetting little details? The stress of worrying about memory loss can be taxing and make your thinking skills even fuzzier.
        ""When you're stressed, your focus is pulled off of the tasks you're working on and you may begin thinking or worrying about the stressor. This can decrease mental clarity and make it harder to focus, making mild memory lapses more prominent,"" says Dr. Stephanie Buss, a cognitive neurologist and director of the Memory Disorders A2Z Clinic at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Is it warranted?
        It's natural to be concerned about memory loss. ""This can stem from seeing family members or friends who've received a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, or it might come from noticing cognitive changes over time,"" Dr. Buss says.
        That doesn't mean your thinking skills are faltering. Small memory lapses can be normal with aging. This includes things like forgetting someone's name briefly (feeling that it's on the tip of your tongue) or walking into a room and momentarily forgetting why you walked in.

""We worry more about large memory lapses, such as forgetting parts of conversations or recent or upcoming events, changes in the ability to speak or understand, or changes in focus or organization that affect your day-to-day life. Any decline in your ability to do complex tasks such as managing medications, working, driving, cooking, or managing finances would also be cause for concern and evaluation,"" Dr. Buss says.
        Crucial steps to cope
        A healthy lifestyle is essential for handling stress of any kind and for maintaining brain health as we age. What does a healthy lifestyle involve?
        ""Physical activity is one of the most important factors. It promotes healthy cognitive aging, reduces stress, and helps with sleep and mood,"" Dr. Buss says. ""We also strongly recommend that you stay socially engaged, connecting with friends and family regularly. Cognitive activities such as reading, puzzles, games, or listening to music are also vital for maintaining brain health, and are especially powerful when paired with social activities.""
        Sleep is also key to brain health. You need a full night's sleep (at least seven to nine hours a night) to help the brain cement information into memories and flush away waste associated with Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Buss advises prioritizing sleep hygiene and maintaining a consistent bedtime.
        You should also eat a healthy diet, stop smoking, and get underlying conditions (especially high blood pressure) under control.

Managing stress will also help your brain. Meditation, yoga, tai chi, deep breathing exercises, and mindfulness (being present and engaged in each moment) can trigger the relaxation response — the opposite of the stress response. ""Treating any associated anxiety and depression can help, too. It can improve focus, sleep, and your motivation to engage in healthy lifestyle activities,"" Dr. Buss says.
        Try these memory strategies
        You might also feel less concerned about memory lapses by using practical strategies to retain information.
        ""For example, when you meet a new person, use their name in conversation right away to help you remember it,"" Dr. Buss suggests. ""Also, keep a single, central calendar and refer to it regularly; that's easier than keeping information in multiple places.""
        She also recommends always placing your keys or glasses in a designated spot; taking your medication at the same time each day; and using notebooks, address books, and other tools to organize and store information for fast retrieval, rather than relying entirely on your memory.
        When to seek help
        ""Feel free to bring up concerns to your doctor, who can help you figure out what's normal and what requires more investigation,"" Dr. Buss says. ""Consider involving loved ones in these discussions; perhaps they've noticed memory lapses you're unaware of. But don't wait if you're worried. It's possible that you just need a quick memory screening and a talk with your doctor about lifestyle factors to improve your memory.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/fasting-before-lipid-test-usually-unnecessary,Fasting before lipid test usually unnecessary,"Q.
          Do I need to fast before my cholesterol test?
        
        A. For most people, the answer is no. Here's the backstory: For decades, we've told people not to eat or drink (except for water and medications) for eight to 12 hours before a cholesterol test. This was based on the thought that a measurement done after fasting would provide a more accurate assessment of all the lipids (fats) in the blood, including LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. However, studies show that the differences between fasting and non-fasting values for cholesterol are usually negligible.
        An analysis using data from a clinical trial of 4,100 people compared the results from lipid tests done with and without fasting. The LDL (bad) cholesterol values were only about 4 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) higher when people weren't fasting. Because the cholesterol guidelines focus on LDL, whether you are fasting won't matter for determining whether your LDL is at goal. So if people come to my clinic and they've had breakfast or lunch, we go ahead and take a blood sample.
        But triglycerides are another story. After you eat, your body immediately converts any excess calories from food into triglycerides, which are then stored in fat cells. In addition, any saturated fat you eat is broken down into smaller fatty particles called chylomicrons, which enter the bloodstream and further contribute to a temporary rise in triglycerides. Some people have high triglyceride levels, which is more common among those who are overweight or have diabetes or prediabetes (and some people have inherited a tendency for this problem). For these people, not fasting can often lead to very high triglyceride levels. So anyone who has ever had a high triglyceride level should always fast before a lipid test. This will provide a more accurate assessment of their triglyceride value, which is then used to inform treatment recommendations.
        If a person's triglycerides are higher than 150 mg/dl on a fasting lipid test, that is linked to a higher risk of heart attack or related cardiovascular issues. Treatment starts with diet and exercise but may include medications, although the latter are usually reserved for people who have heart disease or are at high risk for it, including those with diabetes.
        When I see a new patient, I look back at their earlier lipid test results. If most of their triglycerides are within the normal range (below 150 mg/dL), I tell them they don't need to fast before their blood test. But if some of their values are high, I ask them to fast. Because fasting can be challenging if you can't schedule a morning blood test, ask your doctor if not fasting is an option for you.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-white-noise-really-help-you-sleep-better,Can white noise really help you sleep better?,"Some people find that the neutral sound of white noise helps them sleep better. But is there evidence to support this? And what about other noise colors?
        What is white noise?
        White noise has been compared to the static from a radio that isn't tuned to a specific station. Technically, the term ""white noise"" refers to noise that contains all frequencies of the sounds that people can hear, in equal parts. (Frequency is the rate at which sound waves vibrate.)
        Can white noise help you sleep better?
        Studies on the benefits of white noise for sleep have yielded mixed results. Some studies have found it helped people sleep better, possibly by masking outside noises and serving as a cue to fall asleep.
        ""A study in infants and children showed that white noise may reduce heart rate and respiratory rate, effectively lulling an individual to sleep,"" says Dr. Sogol Javaheri, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and physician in the division of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
        However, a systematic review published in Sleep Medicine Reviews found white noise had little beneficial effect on sleep.
        What's more, according to Dr. Javaheri, white noise may interrupt important stages of sleep, such as REM sleep or deep sleep, and affect hearing if it is too loud.
        If you use a white noise machine for sleep, try moving it to a corner of your bedroom and keep the noise level no louder than that of a background conversation. Turn on your white noise machine just before getting into bed. If your machine has a timer, experiment with having it play only as you fall asleep rather than all night long.
        Other noise colors for better sleep: Pink noise and brown noise
        While white noise is the best known, it's not the only ""color"" noise that's been used to enhance sleep. Pink noise has more intense, lower frequencies that make it sound deeper than white noise. Examples of pink noise are the sounds of rain or a waterfall.
        Some studies have found that pink noise can enhance deep sleep in older adults and improve cognitive performance. In addition, research suggests that pink noise may decrease time to fall asleep and improve sleep quality. However, these results were achieved under experimental conditions in which researchers adjusted pink noise timing during the night.
        Another color noise — brown noise — reduces higher sound frequencies even more than pink noise and is described as grainier or rougher. For example, brown noise can be compared to ocean waves crashing, while pink noise is more like a gentle rain.
        ""More data is needed to determine what role pink and brown noise may play in sleep, such as what volume and duration would be of most benefit,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""For now, I would not recommend pink or brown noise continuously, but rather use it for a set time if it helps you fall asleep more quickly.""","Lisa Catanese, ELS","March 31, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/exercises-to-relieve-joint-pain,Exercises to relieve joint pain,"As many as one in four American adults has arthritis, a leading cause of joint pain. And those aching ankles, knees, hips, wrists, elbows, and shoulders can get in the way of everyday activities, family responsibilities, and work.
        But joint pain isn't something you have to resign yourself to living with. There are steps you can take today — like exercising more — that can help ease your discomfort.
        Causes of joint pain
        There are a number of different reasons your joints might hurt. Some of the most common causes include:
        
          injuries, accidents, and fractures
          
            osteoarthritis
          
          tendinitis
          overuse
          autoimmune conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis
          
            gout
          
          infections.
        
        Benefits of exercise to relieve joint pain
        In many of those cases, exercise can help your joints to move with more ease and less pain —even though moving may be the last thing you feel like doing if your joints are sore.
        A mix of moderate-intensity, low-impact cardiovascular exercise and resistance training can improve your strength and flexibility. This article will focus on joint-specific strengthening and stretching exercises. But you should also be doing some form of aerobic (cardio) exercise. Not only is it good for your heart and overall health, but it also helps ease stiffness and lubricate joints, while boosting production of your body's natural painkilling compounds.
        Exercise also delivers relief from stiffness that can set in if you don't stay active enough. ""For example, if you have shoulder arthritis and stop moving your shoulder, it will get stiff — to the point where you could develop a condition called frozen shoulder,"" says Dr. Robert H. Shmerling, senior faculty editor at Harvard Health Publishing and former clinical chief of the division of rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        ""Over time,"" continues Dr. Shmerling, ""a regular exercise routine can also tamp down systemic inflammation that might be contributing to your joint pain.""
        Lastly, staying consistent with exercise can help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight, which can decrease pressure on painful joints.
        Stretching and strengthening for joint pain relief
        There are several important components of an exercise plan for joint pain relief, including muscle strengthening and stretching.
        Resistance training is essential for building strength in the muscles that surround your sore joints. While it won't reverse damage from a chronic condition like osteoarthritis, Dr. Shmerling says, it may ease some of the pain.
        Stretching improves the flexibility of your muscles, helping you to move your joints through their full range of motion and ward off pain and stiffness.
        Joint-specific exercises
        How you exercise to ease joint pain will depend on the joint that's bothering you. Consider working with a physical therapist or an experienced certified personal trainer to help you design an individualized exercise program.
        The exercises below are generally safe to try, but if you are recovering from a recent injury or have an underlying health condition that causes your pain, it's worth checking with your doctor before you begin.
        A note on terminology. Each time you complete the full movement, that's a ""repetition,"" or ""rep."" A ""set"" is a specific number of repetitions.

        Tips for exercising with joint pain
        When your goal is to alleviate joint pain, it helps to keep a few important safety tips in mind during exercise:
        
          Warm up before exercising. Spend at least five to 10 minutes preparing your muscles and joints with gentle cardio or dynamic stretches that target the joints you'll be exercising.
          Start low and slow. Start at a low intensity, slow pace, and light weights, and gradually ramp up over time. You don't want to make your symptoms worse or experience an injury or other setback that sidelines you longer.
          Listen to your body. If you experience pain during a particular exercise, reduce the intensity or pick a different activity. You may notice some muscle soreness from exercise; this is usually temporary. If the pain worsens or doesn't go away, talk to your doctor.
          Pick activities you enjoy. You're more likely to stick with exercise you find fun and engaging.
          Opt for low-impact activities. Swimming, cycling, walking, yoga, Pilates, and tai chi strain your joints less than higher-impact activities like running or tennis.
          Focus on form. When strength training, pay close attention to your form. Performing exercises with proper form is crucial for getting the most out of the exercise and limiting your risk of injury or pain.
          Work up to 150 minutes per week. Aim for a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and two sessions each week that include balance and strength training. Start with short sessions of just a few minutes at a time until you feel more comfortable exercising.
          Don't forget to rest. Training too often can lead to injury and fatigue. Three or four workouts per week is a good benchmark.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/foam-roller-could-you-benefit-from-this-massage-tool,Foam roller: Could you benefit from this massage tool?,"You've probably noticed people at the gym rolling their calves, glutes, and other body parts on small cylinders. These popular tools are called foam rollers. They can help you stay flexible and limber and reduce muscle tension and soreness.

What is a foam roller?

A foam roller is a cylinder made of foam. They're often about six inches in diameter and a foot or two long. Foam rollers are available in varying degrees of firmness. Used properly, a foam roller can help you reduce tension in muscles and other soft tissue so you can move with ease and less pain.

Most foam rollers have a smooth surface, and you press different areas of your body against them, ""almost like you're ironing or smoothing out those tissues,"" says Dr. Marwa A. Ahmed, instructor in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School and medical director of the Spaulding Outpatient Center in Boston.

How do foam rollers work?

When you press muscles and fascia (fibrous connective tissue) against a foam roller, you're loosening those tissues, releasing tension and easing pain, Dr. Ahmed explains. Think of it like giving yourself a massage — without the trip to the spa.

Benefits of foam rolling

Foam rollers are known to help reduce muscle and tissue soreness and tension. They also help increase flexibility, especially when used as a warm-up before exercise. In addition, foam rollers improve circulation to targeted areas.

Some evidence suggests foam rolling may also:


	help joints move more easily through their full range of motion
	support moving excess fluid out of tissues and into the lymphatic system
	enhance the ability to move while conserving as much energy as possible (an important benefit for anyone concerned with sports performance).


How to use a foam roller

Using a foam roller is simple: slowly roll the body part you're targeting back and forth along the foam roller. For example, you might lie down with your thighs, glutes, or calves on the roller, then roll back and forth. Or you might try standing up with your back on the roller against a wall — this exercise is especially helpful if you have trouble getting up and down from the floor, Dr. Ahmed says.

Like any fitness practice, you're more likely to see the desired results if you stay consistent. For each muscle group you want to roll, start with about 30 to 60 seconds and repeat three to five times at least twice a week. To really see the benefits of foam rolling, try foam rolling every day.

What to consider when choosing a foam roller

If you're new to foam rolling, start simple and soft. Some foam rollers have bumps that provide deeper pressure, but if you're new to the practice, start with a relatively soft, smooth roller.

""The softer it is, the less painful it's going to be,"" Dr. Ahmed says. ""Then, as you roll out these tissues, it's going to become harder to get much benefit from a softer foam roller, and so you can 'graduate' to a harder foam.""

You can also use items you may already have on hand, like a tennis ball, to roll out smaller areas of tight muscle or tissue, such as a specific tender spot in your shoulder.

Common foam rolling mistakes to avoid

The biggest concern is rolling over bone, Dr. Ahmed says. Avoid any bony areas like your knees, pelvis, or shoulder blades. You can't ""iron out"" bones like you can tissue, and it will likely just hurt (and could lead to injury or worsen existing symptoms). Keep the roller on soft, fleshy tissue to safely give this tension-reducing practice a try.",Sarah Klein,"March 21, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/dragon-fruit-how-to-enjoy-this-antioxidant-rich-fruit,Dragon fruit: How to enjoy this antioxidant-rich fruit,"Beloved by smoothie shops and influencers alike, pitaya — a.k.a. dragon fruit — is increasingly popular. And there's no denying this dramatic-looking fruit has an alluring Game-of-Thrones-esque name and appearance. But is it also the nutritional powerhouse some are claiming?

What is dragon fruit?

A cactus plant native to Central and South America, dragon fruit looks something like a large cactus pear with distinctive, green-tipped ""scales"" studding its skin. Red dragon fruit is usually bright pink, while yellow dragon fruit is bright yellow, with smaller scales. But the real drama happens when the fruit is cut open, revealing juicy white, pink, or purple flesh studded with tiny, edible seeds. Dragon fruit tastes like a cross between a pear and kiwi, and has a kiwi-like soft texture when ripe.

Is dragon fruit good for you? A nutritional overview

Like most fruits, dragon fruit provides a healthy package of nutrients for relatively few calories (just 82 for a 3.5-ounce serving). It delivers a fair amount of magnesium (14 milligrams (mg), or as much as a half-cup of cooked kale) and potassium (206 mg, equivalent to half a medium banana), and two grams of fiber, similar to one kiwi fruit.

Antioxidants in dragon fruit

But dragon fruit is most often touted for the inflammation-fighting antioxidant nutrients it supplies — such as vitamin C and selenium, and flavonoid compounds like anthocyanins and carotenoids. While the amounts in dragon fruit aren't dramatically high, there's a good variety, and studies show that diets containing plenty of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables are linked with lower risk of inflammatory conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.

So, do all these dragon fruit benefits qualify it for superfood status? While no single food provides every nutrient, ""dragon fruit is a healthy food to eat,"" says Teresa Fung, a registered dietitian and adjunct professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""But it's not magic.""

Perhaps the most important dragon fruit benefit is that it provides variety and color to your daily fruit routine, she adds. ""If that gets people to eat more fruit, I say go for it!"" At last count, just 12% of Americans were meeting the U.S. Dietary Guidelines' recommendation to get 1-1/2 to 2 cups of fruit daily.

How to select and eat dragon fruit

Fresh dragon fruit is available June through September. Look for fruit that feels heavy for its size, with no shriveling or bruising, and let it ripen on the counter if needed. Ripe fruit will feel firm but slightly soft to the touch.

Dr. Fung advises that frozen dragon fruit, like other frozen fruits, is a great option. ""Frozen dragon fruit is harvested right at its peak and frozen immediately. Not to mention that it's all cleaned and peeled, so that work has been done for us,"" she adds. When buying frozen dragon fruit (cubed or pureed), look for brands with no added sugars.

How to cut a dragon fruit. The easiest way to dig into a dragon fruit is to cut it in half, then scoop out the flesh with a spoon — then eat it as is, or cut into cubes. Or trim off the thick rind all around with a paring knife and slice the flesh into rounds.

Incorporating dragon fruit into your diet

With its speckled flesh and go-with-anything mild flavor, cubed or sliced dragon fruit is an eye-catching fruit salad ingredient, but also works nicely in a savory green salad.

Here are some other ideas:


	Make dragon fruit salsa with chopped onions, cilantro, and lime juice (and perhaps other fruits like mango or papaya).
	Add fresh or frozen cubed dragon fruit to a smoothie.
	Puree and freeze into popsicles.
	Use thin slices of dragon fruit for a beautiful garnish.",Joyce Hendley,"March 17, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/scalp-psoriasis-what-to-know-about-this-uncomfortable-inflammatory-skin-condition,Scalp psoriasis: What to know about this uncomfortable inflammatory skin condition,"Scalp psoriasis is a common but often frustrating skin condition that can cause itching, flaking, and discomfort. It results from an overactive immune response that leads to rapid skin cell turnover. While scalp psoriasis can be persistent, various treatments — including prescription medications and over-the-counter options — can help manage symptoms and reduce flare-ups.
        What is scalp psoriasis?
        Scalp psoriasis is a type of psoriasis that affects the skin on the scalp. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition that causes skin cells to multiply too quickly, leading to the buildup of thick, scaly patches. It is characterized by periods of flare-ups and remission.
        When psoriasis affects the scalp, it can be particularly troublesome due to the presence of hair, which can make it challenging to apply treatment.
        Scalp psoriasis can occur in mild to severe forms. In mild cases, it may appear as fine scaling that looks similar to dandruff. In more severe cases, thick, red, inflamed plaques covered with silvery-white scales can develop, sometimes extending beyond the hairline onto the forehead, neck, or ears.
        Signs and symptoms of scalp psoriasis
        While the symptoms of psoriasis can vary from person to person, there are some common features:
        
          red patches of skin covered with silvery-white scales
          flaking, which can resemble dandruff but is often more extensive
          dryness that may lead to cracking and bleeding
          itching, which can range from mild to severe
          burning or soreness on the scalp
          hair loss, often temporary, due to excessive scratching or inflammation.
        
        Scalp psoriasis or eczema?
        Scalp psoriasis and eczema (also called atopic dermatitis) can look similar, but they are different conditions. Eczema, like psoriasis, is a long-term skin condition that causes inflammation and is linked to an overactive immune system.
        Eczema causes an intensely itchy, dry, red rash with fine scales that blends into the surrounding skin. In contrast, scalp psoriasis appears as dry, silvery-white scales and well-defined red plaques.
        Although eczema can occur later in life, it most commonly starts during childhood. Psoriasis often first appears between the ages of 20 and 30 or between 50 and 60 years old.
        Scalp psoriasis or dandruff?
        Dandruff (also called seborrheic dermatitis) is another common scalp condition that may be confused with psoriasis. However, dandruff is caused by an overgrowth of yeast and tends to cause greasy, yellowish scaling. It does not typically cause thick scaling like scalp psoriasis does.
        Medical treatments for scalp psoriasis
        While there is no known cure for psoriasis, many treatments are available to help control symptoms and prevent flare-ups.
        ""The scalp is a very sensitive area with many nerve endings, so inflammation and itch can be particularly bothersome,"" notes Dr. Rebecca Gaffney, board-certified dermatologist, director of the Bullous Disease and Connective Tissue Disease clinics at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Instructor in dermatology at Harvard Medical School.
        Applying treatments to the scalp presents unique challenges due to the presence of hair. Dr. Gaffney advises that while ""it may be hard to directly apply medicine to this area and can leave the hair feeling messy, you can select whichever formulation works best based on your hair texture and preference. Options include foams, solutions, and oils.""
        Topical corticosteroids (such as betamethasone, clobetasol, and fluocinolone) areconsidered the first-line or standard treatment option for scalp psoriasis. These anti-inflammatory medications are applied directly to the scalp to help reduce redness and scaling. However, potential side effects such as skin thinning, acne-like breakouts, and stretch marks can occur with long-term use.
        Other medical treatment options include:
        
          Non-steroidal topical treatments. These treatments, which are applied directly to the scalp, contain vitamin D analogs (calcipotriene, calcitriol) and vitamin A derivatives (tazarotene). Newer options include roflumilast (Daliresp), which works by blocking the release of immune system proteins called cytokines to reduce itch and inflammation, and tapinarof (Vtama), which regulates the skin's immune responses and supports building and maintaining the skin barrier.
          Light therapy. Many people with psoriasis notice a benefit from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. The most common and effective method uses ultraviolet B (UVB) light, which penetrates only the outermost layer of skin. UVB light can repress inflammation and slow down the cell division that causes the growth of scaly patches on the skin. Dermatologists recommend the use of controlled ""narrow-band"" UVB treatments over direct sun exposure. Some dermatologists also use UV lasers, sometimes called excimer lasers, to target patches of psoriasis while sparing surrounding skin.
          Biologic medications. Biologic medications alter the immune system response. Most are given by injection or intravenous infusion. Examples include risankizumab (Skyrizi), secukinumab (Cosentyx), and adalimumab (Humira), which target immune pathways involved in psoriasis.
          Immunomodulating medications. These systemic medications have a variety of effects on the immune system to control skin disease. They suppress the immune system at earlier or less targeted stages than biologic drugs. Examples include methotrexate and cyclosporine, along with newer options such as apremilast (Otezla) and deucravacitinib (Sotyktu).
        
        You and your doctor can select the best treatment options for your psoriasis based on the severity of your symptoms, your personal preferences, and other individual factors. Make sure to discuss the potential risks and benefits of each option.
        Over-the-counter treatments for scalp psoriasis
        Several over-the-counter (OTC) treatments can help manage symptoms of mild scalp psoriasis. When choosing products, look for active ingredients known to help with itching, scaling, and dryness:
        
          Coal tar. A long-used ingredient in psoriasis treatments, coal tar can slow rapid skin cell growth and reduce redness and scaling. You can find shampoos, gels, and scalp oils containing coal tar in many retail pharmacies.
          Hydrocortisone. Another option is to apply hydrocortisone, a mild corticosteroid that helps relieve itching and inflammation, particularly for small patches of psoriasis.
          Scale softeners. You can also find cleansers and shampoos containing scale softeners like salicylic acid, lactic acid, and urea. They help remove thick scaling and improve the absorption of other treatments, but overuse can worsen irritation.
          Anti-itch products. Ingredients like calamine or menthol may provide temporary relief, though they can sometimes cause dryness.
        
        Best shampoos for scalp psoriasis: Ingredients to look for
        Scalp psoriasis can be particularly stubborn due to the difficulty of treating the skin under the hair. You may have to experiment to find a treatment that's comfortable so you can use it consistently. Shampoos offer a simple, mess-free option, either on their own or alongside other treatments. When choosing a shampoo for scalp psoriasis, look for ingredients such as:
        
          coal tar
          salicylic acid
          pyrithione zinc
          selenium sulfide
          aloe vera.
        
        Managing and preventing flare-ups of scalp psoriasis
        Ongoing treatment is necessary to keep the condition from getting worse. This means committing to long-term treatments, whether medical or over-the-counter.
        Dr. Gaffney also emphasizes the importance of overall health in managing psoriasis: ""Other medical conditions may be more common in people with psoriasis, so it is important to have regular checkups with a primary care physician. Additionally, smoking and obesity appear to increase the risk of developing psoriasis and tend to make it more severe and difficult to treat. So I encourage a healthy lifestyle.""
        Finally, while scalp psoriasis is a lifelong condition, certain lifestyle strategies can help prevent flare-ups. Steps you can take to help prevent worsening symptoms include:
        
          Manage stress. Stress is a known trigger for psoriasis. Techniques like stress management, cognitive behavioral therapy, and guided imagery can help improve psoriasis symptoms.
          Avoid harsh hair products. Hair dyes, alcohol-based sprays, and harsh shampoos can worsen symptoms, or may even cause allergic rashes in some people.
          Eat a balanced diet. Some people find that anti-inflammatory diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish, nuts, and seeds) help reduce symptoms. Adding antioxidants like vitamins A, C, and E, as well as carotenoids, flavonoids, and selenium (found in fruits and vegetables), may also play an important role in controlling flare-ups.
          Avoid scratching. Scratching causes further irritation, which can lead to more flare-ups and potential hair loss.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","March 10, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/should-you-be-sleepmaxxing-to-boost-health-and-happiness-202503063090,Should you be sleepmaxxing to boost health and happiness?,"If you've been on TikTok lately, you know it's hard to avoid countless influencers touting a concept called sleepmaxxing. Their posts provide tips and tricks to get longer, better, and more restorative sleep. And why not? Sleep is considered a pillar of good health and is related to everything from brain health to cardiovascular health, and even diabetes.
        But what exactly is sleepmaxxing? And how likely is it to deliver on claims of amped-up energy, a boost to the immune system, reducing stress levels, and improving your mood?
        What is sleepmaxxing?
        Depending on which social media platform you happen to be looking at, the recommended strategies for maximizing sleep differ. Tips include:
        
          taping your mouth shut while sleeping
          not drinking anything during the two hours before bedtime
          a cold room temperature
          a dark bedroom
          using a white noise machine
          not setting a morning alarm
          showering one hour before bedtime
          eliminating caffeine
          eating kiwis before going to bed
          taking magnesium and melatonin
          using weighted blankets
          getting 30 minutes of sunlight every day
          meditating daily for 30 minutes.
        
        Does any research support sleepmaxxing?
        A thorough search through PubMed, PsycNet, and Google Scholar reveals zero results for the terms ""sleepmaxx"" and ""sleepmaxxing."" But wait — this certainly doesn't mean that some influencer-recommended strategies are not evidence-based, just that the concept of sleepmaxxing, as a defined package, has not been scientifically studied. But yes, some of the strategies — including one uncomfortable, though popular, choice — lack evidence.
        Can mouth-taping improve your sleep?
        TikTok users have claimed that taping your mouth while you sleep has benefits, such as reducing snoring and improving bad breath. A team from the department of otolaryngology at George Washington University was prompted by all of the social media buzz on the topic to review research on the impact of nocturnal mouth taping. Spoiler alert: the authors note that most TikTok mouth-taping claims aren't supported by research.
        If you do snore, it's important to discuss this with your medical team. Even if taping your mouth reduces your snoring, it can't effectively treat a potential underlying cause of the snoring, such as allergies, asthma, or sleep apnea.
        Sleepmaxxing or basic sleep hygiene?
        Many strategies recommended by sleepmaxxers are essentially what sleep experts prescribe as good sleep hygiene, which has plenty of research backing its value. Common components of sleep hygiene are decreasing caffeine and alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, sleep timing, reducing evening light exposure, limiting daytime naps, and having a cool bedroom.
        While tips like these help many people enjoy restful sleep, those who have an insomnia disorder will need more help, as described below.
        Melatonin, early bedtime, weighted blankets, and — kiwi fruit?
        Other strategies suggested by sleepmaxxers are based on limited scientific data. For example:
        
          Taking melatonin is recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to treat circadian rhythm disorders such as jet lag. But it's not recommended for insufficient sleep, poor sleep quality, or difficulty with falling asleep or staying asleep.
          Is it healthier to be asleep by 10 p.m.? One video that garnered more than a million views claims it is. While it is important to maximize morning sunlight exposure and minimize evening light exposure to regulate circadian rhythms, there is such variability in how much sleep someone requires and individual chronotypes (not to mention varying personal and professional responsibilities!) that it is difficult to state there is an ideal bedtime for everyone.
          While intriguing research has been done on weighted blankets, there is no convincing evidence that they are truly effective for the general adult population.
          Overall, it's important to be cautious about the impact of the placebo effect on how someone sleeps. An analysis of more than 30 studies showed that roughly 64% of the drug response for a sleep medication in insomnia patients could be due to the placebo effect. A key takeaway is that studies that are not randomized controlled trials — such as this small study on 24 people suggesting that kiwi fruit may improve sleep — should be interpreted with a grain of salt.
        
        Could you have orthosomnia?
        The expectation of flawless sleep, night in and night out, is an unrealistic goal. Orthosomnia is a term that describes an unhealthy pursuit of perfect sleep. The pressure to get perfect sleep is embedded in the sleepmaxxing culture.
        With more and more people able to access daily data about their sleep and other health metrics through consumer wearables, even a person who is objectively sleeping well can become unnecessarily concerned with optimizing their sleep. While prioritizing restful sleep is commendable, setting perfection as your goal is problematic. Even good sleepers vary from night to night, experiencing less than desirable sleep a couple of times per week.
        It is also noteworthy that some of the most widely viewed recommendations on TikTok are not supported by scientific evidence.
        Do you really need to fix your sleep?
        A good first step is to understand whether or not there is anything that you need to fix! Consider tracking your sleep for a few weeks using a sleep diary, and pair this data with a consumer wearable (such as a Fitbit or Apple Watch). Both imperfectly capture sleep data when compared to the gold-standard tool sleep experts use (polysomnography, or a sleep study). However, combining the information can give you a reasonable assessment of your sleep status.
        Regularly getting restful sleep can indeed boost health and mood. And all of us can benefit from following basic sleep hygiene tips. But if it takes you 30 minutes or more to fall asleep, or if you are up for 30 minutes or more in the middle of the night, and this happens three or more times per week, then consider reaching out to your health care team to seek further evaluation.
        There are effective, nonmedication treatments that are proven to help you sleep better. One example is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which can dramatically improve insomnia symptoms in a matter of weeks.

        A root canal treatment — commonly referred to as a ""root canal"" — is a procedure to clear the tissue from the root canals of your tooth. The procedure is performed by a general dentist or an endodontist.
        A spongy material called pulp, which contains the tooth's nerve, blood vessels, and connective tissue, resides inside the roots of your teeth. Pulp can become infected and inflamed for various reasons. If left untreated, your tooth may become extremely painful and the infection may spread into the bones that support your teeth, which is a serious problem.
        ""The most common reason for a root canal treatment is to clear an infection in the pulp. It's important to remove the infection because if this doesn't happen, the only place for an infection to go is into the bone,"" Dr. Tien Jiang, assistant professor in oral health policy and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, points out. ""This causes pressure on the bone and ligaments holding your tooth, which is why it's painful.""
        A common worry is that a root canal is painful. But today's anesthetics and improved techniques have made the procedure much easier to tolerate.
        ""A root canal treatment shouldn't be any more painful than having a cavity filled or tooth extracted,"" says Dr. Jiang. ""Some dentists will prescribe antibiotics before the procedure to calm the infection, since a very infected tooth is a little harder to numb.""
        Who needs a root canal treatment, and why?
        You may need a root canal if you have an infected tooth. A tooth infection may occur if bacteria enter the tooth's pulp from a deep cavity, an old filling that has failed, or a crack or injury to the tooth. Signs of a problem include:
        
          pain when you chew or bite down
          gums that are tender, swollen, or dark in color
          small pimples on your gums
          lingering sensitivity to hot or cold foods and drinks, even when the stimulation has been removed.
        
        Sometimes you may not have any symptoms, but an x-ray will show deep decay or an infection at your root or roots.
        What happens during a root canal procedure?
        Your dentist will give you an anesthetic injection to numb the area. A rubber covering, called a dental dam, will be placed over the area to prevent bacteria from your saliva from entering the space.
        The dentist will then make an opening in the tooth and will use small instruments to remove the damaged pulp and clear out the root canals. The now-empty spaces are then filled with a latex material called gutta-percha. Your dentist may recommend a filling or crown to rebuild the tooth.
        Contrary to popular belief, the roots of the tooth are kept intact and are not removed during a root canal treatment. This means that even after root canal therapy, your tooth may still be susceptible to decay, periodontal disease, or tooth sensitivity.
        Recovering from a root canal
        Your mouth probably will feel numb for a couple of hours after a root canal, but most people can return to their regular activities right after a root canal procedure. Dr. Jiang advises not eating until the numbness in your mouth wears off, to avoid biting your cheek or tongue.
        After a root canal treatment, Dr. Jiang recommends avoiding hard or sticky foods. To ease any discomfort, she suggests trying soft food like yogurt, eggs, and fish that requires little chewing. After a root canal, you will likely have a temporary filling, so maintaining a soft diet helps preserve your tooth and filling until it can be repaired permanently.
        After a root canal, you can brush and floss your teeth as you normally would, unless your dentist tells you otherwise.
        Managing pain after a root canal treatment
        Because the infection is cleared, you will likely experience pain relief soon after your treatment. However, during recovery you can manage pain by taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen (Advil). If you need more pain relief, Dr. Jiang advises these medications can be more effective if taken together because they work in different ways. Just don't exceed the recommended dosages for each.
        If pain persists beyond a few days or gets worse, let your dentist or endodontist know.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","March 6, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/savoring-the-benefits-of-bone-broth-worth-a-taste,Savoring the benefits of bone broth: Worth a taste?,"If you've been to the soup section of the supermarket lately, you've probably noticed that bone broths are crowding the shelves. These savory broths are having a moment, especially among those following paleo, keto, or other trendy low-carb diets.

What is bone broth?

At its simplest, bone broth is made by simmering animal bones (usually chicken or beef) in water for a long period of time, extracting their nutrients and flavors to produce a savory broth. Meat, skin, and connective tissue may also be simmered with the bones, along with aromatic vegetables, herbs, and seasonings for flavor. Most bone broth recipes include an acidic ingredient like vinegar to help break down the collagen and minerals in the bones.

What's the difference between bone broth, regular broth, and stock?

Because it's made mostly from bones, bone broth is different from regular broth, which is traditionally made from meat (along with vegetables and flavorings) and simmered for a much shorter time. Bone broth also has a slightly thicker texture and a richer mouth feel than regular broth, because the cooking process converts some of the collagen in the bones to gelatin.

Bone broth and stock, however, are essentially the same thing: they're both based on bones rather than meat, and include similar vegetables and seasonings. The difference is mostly in timing: Stocks generally simmer for a few hours, while bone broth recipes usually call for much longer cooking — from four to six hours to as much as a day or more — until the bones are almost falling apart.

Nutritional benefits of bone broth

Bone broth provides a fair amount of protein — about 8 to 10 grams per cup, versus just 2 to 6 grams in a cup of most broths or stocks. Getting enough protein is important to maintain or gain muscle mass as you get older, as well as for overall health and well-being.

Bone broth also contains small amounts of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus — minerals that support bone health.

What to look for in store-bought bone broth

Choosing the best bone broth is mostly a matter of taste. But whether you're choosing chicken bone broth or beef bone broth, look for reduced-sodium or low-sodium varieties, as some can weigh in at over 450 milligrams of sodium per cup. That's about 20% of the recommended daily sodium limit.

A simple homemade bone broth recipe

Making your own bone broth is easy; even though the cooking time is long, it's mostly hands-off. What's more, making your own bone broth lets you adjust the ingredients and salt to your taste.

To make about 6 to 8 cups of bone broth, place 2 to 3 pounds of chicken or beef bones in a large, deep pot (you can roast them first, for extra flavor and deeper color). If you like, add some roughly chopped vegetables like carrot, celery, and onion, and seasonings like thyme and bay leaf. Pour in about 12 cups of water, or enough to cover by several inches, and 1 or 2 tablespoons of vinegar.

Cover and bring just to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, for 12 hours. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, discarding the bones and solids (you can compost them). Season to taste with salt and pepper.",Joyce Hendley,"March 4, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/investigating-memory-loss,Investigating memory loss,"It can be scary not knowing if sudden memory lapses or other cognitive changes are just a natural aspect of aging or an early sign of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI falls between the cognitive decline associated with aging and the more serious signs of dementia. With MCI, some changes are noticeable but usually do not impede the ability to carry out daily functions.
        ""It's not unusual to be forgetful at times as you age, but if memory issues are more noticeable, it's always best to get checked out and undergo a cognitive test,"" says Sara Weisenbach, a neuropsychologist with Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""There are ways to slow the progression of cognitive decline or treat issues that could be causing memory lapses, but the sooner you can identify a problem, the better the outcome.""
        See your doctor
        Your first step is to see your primary care physician to discuss your symptoms, review your overall health and concerns, and assess any family history of dementia. An ideal time for this may be at an annual wellness visit. (Don't rely on results of online cognitive tests, as many are unreliable and may not offer an accurate evaluation, says Weisenbach.)
        Before your visit, make a list of your specific cognitive concerns to share with your doctor. Also, bring a family member or friend to your appointment. Their support can help ease your nerves, and they can provide their own observations. An in-office cognitive screening test lasts from five to 15 minutes. The test might include
        
          repeating a list of words immediately and then again after a short delay
          recalling personal information like addresses or birthdays
          naming objects in a picture
          answering questions about recent events
          drawing a clock to assess spatial orientation.
        
        ""The results might indicate a potential problem, but they usually are not sufficient for a formal MCI diagnosis,"" says Weisenbach.
        
          
            
              
                Senior moments or red flags?
                It can be difficult to gauge when memory issues need medical attention. But you probably should consult your doctor if you experience any of the following:
                
                  frequent episodes of forgetfulness, like not recalling a recent conversation or missing appointments
                  frequent trouble retaining new information, like a phone number or address
                  errors in paying bills or taking medications
                  difficulty finding your parked car, trouble finding your way in familiar areas, or minor car accidents.
                
              
            
          
        
        Additional testing
        Based on your test results and your doctor's assessment, you may be advised to undergo further testing and evaluation. If the results hint at memory loss or another cognitive issue, or if your doctor needs more information, the next step might be blood tests, which can help to rule out reversible causes of cognitive impairment, such as low vitamin B12, iron deficiency, or an underactive thyroid.
        The doctor may also recommend one or more brain imaging studies. An MRI scan can look for structural changes in the brain, like loss of volume and changes in blood flow. A PET scan can look for amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, one of the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's disease.
        Your doctor also may recommend a neuropsychological evaluation with a specialist like a neurologist or neuro-psychologist. This sit-down visit can last a few hours and explores your cognitive issues in more detail, such as when they began and the circumstances around them. For example, are you having trouble finding the right words when speaking? Do you regularly misplace your keys and phone? Can you not recall a conversation from the previous day?
        ""All this information can help determine if the issues are a sudden phenomenon or have worsened over time,"" says Weisenbach. ""A neuropsychologist can also help determine which cognitive skills are strong and which ones are more challenging."" Other factors are also considered when evaluating the test results. For instance, lower-than-expected scores can be influenced by medication side effects or mental health issues like depression, anxiety, or grief.
        Even if the neuropsychological examination does not suggest MCI, your doctor or neuropsychologist can help address any issues that may be related to your mental lapses. ""This initial screening also provides a baseline for future reference in case other memory issues arise or your situation worsens over time,"" says Weisenbach. ""If the results from the tests are inconclusive, you might be monitored for 12 to 18 months and then re-evaluated.""

        Chair push-up (arms, shoulders, chest, back)
        Place the back of the chair against a wall. Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the chair's seat. Walk your feet back so your body is at a 45° angle to the floor and forms a straight line from head to heels. Your heels should be off the floor. Bend your elbows out to the sides and slowly lower your upper body toward the chair until your elbows are bent about 90°. Hold for one to two seconds. Press against the chair seat and straighten your arms to return to the starting position. Do eight to 12 times. Rest and repeat the sequence two times.
        
          Make it easier: Do the push-up on your knees, with hands on the front of the seat.
          Make it harder: Take three to five seconds to lower and raise your body.
        
        Chair stand (abdomen, hips, front thighs, and buttocks)
        Sit upright at the front of the chair, knees bent, feet flat on the floor and slightly apart. Cross your arms and place your hands on your shoulders. Keeping your back and shoulders straight, stand slowly, pause, and then slowly sit. Do eight to 12 times. Rest and repeat the sequence one or two times.
        
          Make it easier: Use your hands to help you stand.
          Make it harder: Rise from the chair quickly and take five seconds to sit.
        
        Hip extension (buttocks and back thighs)
        Place the front of the chair against a wall. Stand 12 inches behind it. Holding on to the back of the chair for balance, bend your trunk forward 45°. Slowly raise your right leg straight out behind you. Lift it as high as possible without bending your knee. Pause at the top and then slowly lower the leg. Do this eight to 12 times. Repeat with your left leg. Do the sequence twice.
        
          Make it easier: Slightly bend the knee of the raised leg.
          Make it harder: Lift your leg quickly, hold briefly, and lower at a slower pace. Or wear ankle weights.
        
        Body stretches (core, back)
        This routine involves three stretches: side bend, twists, and forward lean. Repeat the sequence two to three times.
        Side bend: Sit straight with your arms extended upward, and clasp your hands, palms in. Bend from the hip to the right as far as possible without pain or discomfort. Hold for five to 10 seconds. Bend to the left and hold for five to 10 seconds.
        
          Make it easier: Raise only one arm at a time (right arm for bending to the left and vice versa).
          Make it harder: Hold the stretch longer on each side.
        
        Twist: Sit up straight, arms crossed over your chest or placed down alongside your body. Rotate your shoulders as far in one direction as possible without discomfort. Hold for five to 10 seconds, then return to the starting position. Repeat to the other side.
        
          Make it easier: Use the chair arms or back of the chair to help you twist.
          Make it harder: Hold the stretch longer or twist farther.
        
        Forward lean: Sit with one leg extended forward and the other knee bent 90°. Lean toward the extended leg, resting one hand on each thigh for support. Continue hinging forward at the waist until you feel a stretch in the back of the straight leg. Hold for five to 10 seconds; then return to the starting position. Switch leg positions and repeat.
        
          Make it easier: Wrap a towel or strap around the foot of the extended leg and pull the ends to help you fold into the stretch.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/is-it-time-for-a-cpap-checkup,Is it time for a CPAP checkup?,"Ever since your obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis, you've tried to use your continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine faithfully each night. Hopefully, it has restored your ability to sleep without snoring, coughing, choking, or suffering dozens of pauses in breathing per hour. And perhaps it helps you feel more alert, awake, and productive, and has begun to lower the risk of dangerous consequences related to sleep apnea, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and depression.
        But the gentle hum of the CPAP device doesn't guarantee that the therapy is working effectively; like a sensitive medication regimen, it needs to be assessed and monitored regularly.
        What is CPAP therapy?
        CPAP therapy prevents your upper airways from being blocked by throat muscles that relax too much during sleep. The therapy involves a small bedside compressor that pumps a forceful stream of air through a tube and into your nose via a mask you wear all night. A standard CPAP machine delivers a fixed air pressure, while an auto-CPAP machine automatically adjusts pressure based on your varying needs throughout the night, such as when you change position or shift into a new sleep stage.
        Your health care provider must prescribe the therapy. You then obtain the system through a medical equipment supplier. A technician from the supplier will work with you to find the right mask, set the specified air pressure settings to keep your airways open without disturbing your sleep, and answer ongoing questions about using the system.
        You can control the temperature and humidity of the air entering the mask. Additionally, you can choose how fast the air pressure increases: ""You can set it to ramp up over five minutes or 45 minutes, or select the 'auto-ramp' setting and have the machine adjust the pace automatically based on your breathing,"" explains Dr. Karen Lee, a neurologist and sleep medicine specialist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        Initial check-ups
        For CPAP therapy to be covered by insurance, you're required to see your health care provider 30 to 90 days after you start using the system. ""The clinician always needs to ensure that the CPAP has improved and hopefully resolved your sleep issues,"" Dr. Lee says, ""and what can be complicated is that you may not be aware of some of your sleep issues. For example, sleep apnea often increases the frequency of nighttime urinations, grinding or clenching your teeth, and night sweats. The clinician needs to ask appropriate questions to understand if your sleep is optimized while using CPAP.""
        At your first check-up, your provider will review data that the machine has been collecting. ""The machine tells us when you're using the device and estimates how many apnea episodes you're having per hour, when you're struggling to breathe, and whether air is leaking out your mouth or around the mask unintentionally,"" Dr. Lee says.
        Based on that information and your own observations, your clinician might prescribe a higher or lower air pressure. You might need to go back for additional visits and adjustments until the kinks are ironed out, which can take a few months. You may even require an overnight study in the sleep lab while using CPAP to help clarify any issues.
        
          
            
              
                All PAP therapies need regular evaluation
                Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is just one type of positive airway pressure (PAP). Other types include
                
                  auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP), which provides a range of preset pressures throughout the night
                  bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), which provides two different preset pressures — a more powerful one when you inhale and a less powerful one when you exhale
                  adaptive servo ventilation (ASV), an advanced device that provides pressure based on breathing patterns throughout the night.
                
                All these therapies need periodic assessment to determine how well they're working and whether the settings need adjustment.
              
            
          
        
        Additional check-ups
        Once the CPAP system is working for you, you'll need to have it re-evaluated at least once a year to see if the air pressure needs to be adjusted. These continuing follow-up appointments are important for many reasons.
        Data updates. Dr. Lee says that CPAP machines provide only estimated information, which sometimes is inaccurate. She needs to compare it with insights from a patient visit to determine if the CPAP really is helping.
        Worsening sleep apnea. Everything sags as we get older, even the airway, which causes the disease to advance over time.
        Weight loss or gain. Gaining weight can make sleep apnea worse; losing weight can make it better or even make it disappear. Either could potentially affect the pressure settings.
        Treatment side effects. Dr. Lee says that the brain sometimes reacts to CPAP in a way that creates another type of apnea. In that case, the settings or the actual device would need to be changed.
        Other sleep issues. ""We need to make sure all of your sleep needs are being addressed,"" Dr. Lee says, ""especially if you have other sleep disorders such as insomnia, restless legs syndrome, or sleepiness, despite effective CPAP treatment.""
        Missed check-ups
        Unfortunately, many people don't get regular CPAP check-ups. If you're among them, it could be that your clinician never told you that you need periodic assessments. ""While any health care provider can prescribe the therapy, they don't all know how to adjust it optimally or that they should evaluate it regularly,"" Dr. Lee says.
        Or you might not be getting CPAP check-ups because
        
          you feel better and don't think you need additional assessments
          you don't think the therapy is effective and have given up on it
          your schedule is too hectic
          you assume (mistakenly) that the medical equipment supplier is monitoring your health.
        
        When to call the expert
        If you've never had your CPAP use evaluated or haven't done so in a long time, Dr. Lee advises making an appointment with a sleep specialist or with the expert who prescribed the therapy.
        Dr. Lee also recommends calling your clinician any time new health problems or symptoms affect sleep. ""Come see me if you start snoring again or you're tired despite using the machine,"" she says. ""If you have questions, they need to be asked.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/answers-to-why-you-itch-all-over,Answers to why you itch all over,"It's hard to get through daily activities when you itch all over. The widespread discomfort, known as generalized itching, is distracting and frustrating. When its cause is unclear, it's difficult to know how to find relief.
        To help navigate this challenge, we turned to Dr. Martina Porter, a dermatologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Q. How concerning is generalized itching?
        A. Dr. Porter: It's something that we take seriously. It can have an extremely negative impact on someone's quality of life, particularly if it disturbs sleep.
        Q. How common is the condition?
        A. Dr. Porter: It's much more common than you'd expect. An estimated 8% to 16% of the total population can report having generalized itching in the past 12 months. And about 20% of the population will experience generalized itching in their lifetime.
        Q. What causes generalized itching?
        A. Dr. Porter: Generalized itching can be caused by dry skin, severe cases of certain skin conditions, or skin changes that occur with age. Widespread itching might also be due to conditions that don't have obvious signs on the skin. Examples include diabetes, thyroid disease, kidney disease, liver disease, cancer, blood disorders, nerve-related causes, and some psychiatric conditions. HIV infection and medications can also cause itch, as can pregnancy.
        Q. How do you pinpoint the cause when it isn't obvious?
        A. Dr. Porter: That requires a bit of detective work. We take a thorough health history, ask about all signs and symptoms, and examine all of the skin. We check the lymph nodes to see if they're swollen: if so, that could be a sign of cancer or an infection. We consider the distribution of itching to figure out if this is really generalized all-over itching, which points to an internal cause, or just localized itching, which is usually due to an exposure the body is reacting to or a nerve-related cause. When it is generalized itching, we usually order blood tests to help identify suspected internal causes. Some people may also need imaging tests to look for signs of cancer, although that's rare.
        It can take time to identify the cause, but we still try to treat the itch while we investigate.
        Q. What are treatments for generalized itching?
        A. Dr. Porter: Treatment must be tailored to the underlying condition causing generalized itching. So if you have diabetes or thyroid disease, we need to treat that. We might also prescribe topical, oral, or injectable medications to help with the itch, or phototherapy that uses properties of ultraviolet light to decrease inflammation and itch.
        Sometimes people are tempted to try and treat itching at home by taking antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine [Benadryl], loratadine [Claritin], fexo­fenadine [Allegra], or cetirizine [Zyrtec]. These medications can be helpful for hives or allergic causes of itching, but we try to limit their use for generalized itching in older people because of a potential increased risk of dementia.
        Q. Are any home remedies helpful?
        A. Dr. Porter: Dry skin can be very itchy, which makes generalized itching worse. So it is important to moisturize, particularly in the colder, less humid winter months.
        For those who suffer from very dry skin or eczema, we recommend specific showering and bathing techniques, such as using lukewarm rather than hot water; using soap only on the armpits, genitals, feet, and face; and moisturizing everywhere immediately after bathing before your skin has a chance to fully dry.
        There are many over-the-counter options for moisturizers, and some contain menthol, pramoxine, camphor, or capsaicin. Those ingredients can help alter nerve signaling and may decrease itch signals — although some ingredients may instead cause a burning, numbing, or cooling sensation. Applying over-the-counter 1% hydro-cortisone cream or ointment can help calm mild inflammation if itching is worse in a particular spot.
        Q. Is it possible to stop the itch?
        A. Dr. Porter: Yes. You don't have to suffer with constant itching. Make an appointment with a dermatologist. Be sure to tell the doctor where the itching is occurring. And try some home remedies until your visit.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/lipoproteina-an-update-on-testing-and-treatment,Lipoprotein(a): An update on testing and treatment,"A fatty particle that circulates in the bloodstream, lipoprotein(a) is similar to LDL cholesterol but more dangerous. High levels of Lp(a), as it is commonly called, can double or even triple a person's risk of a heart attack. It's considered a common culprit in heart disease that occurs at a young age. So why do so few people know about it?
        Until recently, most guidelines didn't recommend testing for Lp(a) — but with good reason. Your genes determine your Lp(a) value. Eating and exercise habits have virtually no effect on the levels in your bloodstream. Plus, there were no effective treatments to lower Lp(a), which also elevates the risk of stroke and aortic stenosis (a thickened, stiff aortic valve).
        Now, with five promising therapies to lower Lp(a) in development, the landscape is changing. Here's the latest advice and information about Lp(a).
        Lp(a) testing trends
        International consensus groups recommend one-time Lp(a) testing for everyone. In Europe, such testing is routine. But in the United States, the first official endorsement for Lp(a) testing didn't appear until 2024, from the National Lipid Association.
        ""Recent data show that only 0.3% of people received Lp(a) screening between 2012 and 2019,"" says Harvard Medical School associate professor Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Also, about half of those tests were ordered by a very small number of health care providers, she adds.
        But Lp(a) testing should soon become more widespread, for several reasons. First, the tests are now covered by most insurers in most states. Second, even though targeted therapies to lower Lp(a) are not yet on the market, people with high levels (see ""Lp(a) readings: Check the units"") may benefit from more intensive treatment to manage their overall risk of heart disease, says Dr. O'Donoghue. ""This may include taking cholesterol-lowering drugs like statins, even if your LDL cholesterol is normal,"" she says. Low-dose aspirin is also being investigated as a possible therapy for preventing heart attacks in people with high Lp(a).
        
          
            
              
                Lp(a) readings: Check the units
                Labs report lipoprotein(a) values in two different units. The preferred method is nanomoles per liter (nmol/L), but many labs still use milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Currently, there's no universal consensus on what constitutes an abnormal Lp(a) level, but the thresholds shown below are commonly used.

        A one-time test?
        Unlike LDL, which rises with age and is influenced by diet and exercise, Lp(a) remains largely constant over a person's lifetime, so a one-time test suffices for screening. However, researchers are working to better understand changes that may occur in Lp(a) in women around the time of menopause and for men and women with certain medical conditions. The following groups of people are specifically recommended for testing:
        
          people with premature cardiovascular disease, defined as those who've had a heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or aortic stenosis before age 55 (for men) or 65 (for women)
          people who have a father, mother, sister, or brother with premature cardiovascular disease
          people with very high LDL cholesterol (190 mg/dL or higher)
          close relatives (siblings, children, and parents) of anyone with an elevated Lp(a) level.
        
        Therapies to lower Lp(a)
        Most of the drugs in development for lowering Lp(a) work by interfering with RNA, the molecule that copies and transfers genetic instructions from DNA, the cell's genetic blueprint. Currently, there are four RNA-based drugs that effectively silence the gene that makes Lp(a) in liver cells: lepodisiran, olpasiran, pelacarsen, and zerlasiran. All are administered by injection every one to six months and have been shown to lower Lp(a) levels 80% and 100%. The side effects appear to be limited to mild, short-lived pain at the injection site. Larger, longer trials looking at whether these drugs will help prevent heart-related problems are currently under way, with results expected within the next one to two years, says Dr. O'Donoghue, who is a lead investigator on the clinical trials of olpasiran.
        Preliminary results also look promising for another experimental drug called muvalapin, which works by preventing the assembly of the Lp(a) particle. Like the RNA-based drugs, muvalapin also leads to dramatic drops in Lp(a), but it is taken as a daily pill. Side effects include headache, back pain, and fatigue. While some people prefer pills over shots, injectable drugs have the advantage of much less frequent dosing, Dr. O'Donoghue notes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/gingivitis-reversing-and-preventing-early-gum-disease,Gingivitis: Reversing and preventing early gum disease,"Gingivitis is a common form of periodontal disease, also called gum disease. Left untreated, it can lead to periodontitis, a more serious condition. Fortunately, there are simple ways to reverse and prevent gingivitis.
        What is gingivitis?
        Gingivitis is a type of gum disease in which the tissue at the base of your teeth, called gingival tissue, becomes inflamed, or swollen. The most common form of gingivitis happens when food particles and other substances build up around your teeth, causing sticky plaque and hard tartar to form at and below your gums.
        In the early stage, this buildup isn't harmful if home care and regular dental cleanings can keep the inflammation in check, explains Dr. Tien Jiang, assistant professor in oral health policy and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. However, ongoing inflammation from gingivitis can lead to an irreversible form of gum disease called periodontitis, she says, which can damage the tissues and bones that support your teeth. (Dental x-rays may be needed to see if the inflammation from gum disease has become periodontitis.)
        In addition, studies have shown that having gum disease can put you at higher risk for heart attack, stroke, and dementia.
        Symptoms of gingivitis
        In the early stages, gingivitis usually doesn't cause discomfort. As gum disease progresses, gingivitis symptoms can include:
        
          red, sensitive, or swollen gums
          gums that bleed when you brush or floss your teeth
          bad breath (halitosis)
          mouth sores.
        
        What causes gingivitis?
        Most gingivitis begins with plaque (which is also a major cause of tooth decay) that hardens into tartar. A buildup of plaque and tartar at the gumline, along with bacteria that are normally present in your mouth, can irritate and inflame your gums, causing gingivitis.
        Certain things can put you at higher risk for gingivitis, including:
        
          poor dental hygiene
          smoking
          pregnancy, when hormonal changes make your gums more sensitive
          diabetes that isn't well controlled
          certain infections elsewhere in your body
          misaligned teeth
          unclean mouth appliances such as braces or dentures
          certain medicines.
        
        Treating gingivitis at the dentist
        Regular cleanings from a dentist or dental hygienist can remove plaque deposits before gingivitis causes more serious problems. The dental team has special tools that can be used to scrape under the gumline.
        If your gums are sensitive after cleanings, Dr. Jiang suggests rinsing your mouth with warm water mixed with table salt twice a day, taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen (as long as your medical conditions permit taking these pain relievers), or both. ""If the gingivitis was extensive, you may need to allow up to two weeks for the tissues in your mouth to recover,"" she adds.
        You can ask your dentist to go over toothbrushing techniques with you, as well as whether you could benefit from an electric toothbrush, a special toothpick, or a water flosser.
        Reversing and preventing gingivitis at home
        Brushing teeth at least twice a day, and flossing at least once a day, can help reverse and prevent gingivitis. Dr. Jiang recommends brushing in front of mirror in a bathroom with good lighting. She suggests pulling back your lips to look in a mirror for plaque at the gumline, or feeling with your tongue after brushing to search for rough areas of plaque. If you spot remaining plaque, angle your toothbrush to better reach those areas. If you repeatedly miss certain areas, try replacing your toothbrush head. Often, a smaller toothbrush head can do a better job getting to hard-to-reach areas.
        Your dentist also may recommend anti-plaque or anti-tartar toothpastes or mouth rinses.
        As people age, they may lose some dexterity that can affect how well they brush their teeth, so seniors in particular (and their caregivers) should pay attention to good toothbrushing techniques.
        Dr. Jiang says that plaque rinses or tablets, available over the counter, stick to plaque and turn it a bright color, to help you identify areas where plaque is building up and where toothbrushing is especially needed.
        ""Most people do a good job removing plaque from the smooth or chewing surfaces of their teeth,"" Dr. Jiang says, ""but you need to pay attention to other places where plaque sticks, such as the gumline or between teeth, in order to avoid gingivitis.""","Lisa Catanese, ELS","February 27, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/low-carb-snacks-easy-and-healthy-options-for-any-time-of-day,Low-carb snacks: Easy and healthy options for any time of day,"When you're hungry or tired and it's not mealtime, it can be tempting to reach for a sweet treat or sugary soda to give you a quick energy boost. But a snack that's high in added sugar can lead to a blood sugar spike, followed by an energy crash that will leave you feeling tired and hungry again.

A better option is to choose healthy, low-carb snacks. They can give your energy levels a boost, while also helping your body get important nutrients throughout the day and preventing you from overeating at your next meal.

What to look for in low-carb snacks

Experts define a low-carb snack as one with 5 grams of carbohydrates or less per serving. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends snacks that are fresh, balanced, and packed with nutrients like protein and fiber that can help you feel full longer. Focus on whole, minimally processed foods.

What to avoid

Choosing low-carb snacks means steering clear of highly processed and sugary options. Packaged snacks like chips, cookies, and granola bars are often loaded with refined carbohydrates and added sugars.

Carbs also hide in plain sight in many popular beverages. High-calorie sports drinks, and sweetened beverages such as sodas and even fruit juices, are best limited or avoided. They provide little nutritional value and can quickly add carbs and calories. Instead, pair your snacks with a glass of water.

Healthy low-carb snack ideas

These simple, healthy, low-carb snacks can give you a burst of nutrients while tiding you over until your next meal.

Berries. Berries a great lower-carb choice. One-third cup of blueberries contains just 5 grams of carbs. One-third cup of strawberries delivers under 3 grams of carbs, with fiber that helps you stay satiated longer.

Avocado. Pair this nutritious food with red pepper or enjoy it on its own. One-quarter of an avocado contains about 4 grams of carbs.

Kale chips. Kale chips are tasty and packed with antioxidants and other nutrients. One cup of kale contains less than 1 gram of carbohydrates.

Cucumber. Reach for cucumber on a hot day. One-half cup of this refreshing food contains just 3 grams of carbs.

Plain popcorn is not just for snacking on during movies. This low carb snack (3/4 cup contains 4.5 grams of carbs) can be your go-to anytime.

High-protein, low-carb snacks

Adding protein to a low-carb snack can help you stay energized, support muscle recovery, and manage hunger between meals. Here are some simple and satisfying high-protein, low-carb snack options.

Greek yogurt. Greek yogurt packs the protein without a lot of carbohydrates. One-half cup of nonfat plain Greek yogurt provides 15 grams of protein and 6 grams of carbs.

Hard-boiled egg. One-half cup of chopped hard-boiled egg offers an impressive 8 grams of protein and less than 1 gram of carbohydrates.

Cheddar cheese. Enjoy this tasty treat on its own, or pair it with raw vegetables or a small amount of fruit or nuts. One-quarter cup of cheddar cheese contains 6 grams of protein and less than 1 gram of carbohydrates.

Almonds. One-quarter cup of sliced almonds provides 5 grams of protein paired with 5 grams of carbs.",Jenette Restivo,"February 24, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-simple-ways-to-improve-gut-health,5 simple ways to improve gut health,"Gut health is an easy thing to take for granted — or to ignore completely, if everything is generally functioning well. But poor gut health can impact your overall health in a variety of ways, from the obvious (stomach discomfort) to less obvious effects on mood and immune function.
        Why gut health matters
        People are talking about gut health and their microbiome more than they used to, but if it's not something that comes up around your dinner table, here are some basics.
        When people talk about their gut microbiome, they're referring to all the microorganisms (both good and bad) living in your gastrointestinal tract (primarily your large intestine). Most people have hundreds — or even thousands — of different species of bacteria, viruses, and fungi living in their gut.
        Gut diversity is important because different microorganisms may help support health in a variety of ways, including:
        
          improved digestion and nutrient absorption
          immune-system regulation
          protection against harmful bacteria
          reduced inflammation
          better brain health.
        
        Plus, a healthy and diverse gut microbiome may help reduce your risk of conditions including diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, some cancers, GI disorders, and cardiovascular disease.
        Five keys to a happy gut
        The good news is that you can take steps to support a healthy gut microbiome.
        1. Add more fiber to your diet
        Fiber serves as a prebiotic, or food for the good bacteria that live in your gut. Eating plenty of fiber is associated with increased microbial diversity and a reduced risk of gastrointestinal issues like constipation and Crohn's disease. Fiber helps keep the colon healthy by reducing inflammation; it also helps keep you regular.
        However, most of us don't get enough fiber. Aim to get 21 to 38 grams of fiber per day. Fiber is found in a variety of foods including legumes, whole grains, avocados, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, tofu, berries, leafy greens, and nuts and seeds.
        2. Stay hydrated
        Water is critical for healthy digestion. It helps your body absorb and transport nutrients; it helps with keeping your core body temperature steady; it aids in the production of mucus to protect your digestive tract; and it helps prevent constipation. When you become constipated, your gut microbiota changes, becoming less abundant. If you become dehydrated, your body will let you know, as not drinking enough can manifest as thirst, headache, dry mouth, less frequent urination, dizziness, and tiredness. So drink up — around four to six cups per day for most people.
        3. Manage stress
        Increased stress often manifests itself in digestive discomfort. Stress causes hormones like adrenaline and cortisol to spike, leading to symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, and heartburn. This gut-brain connection is powerful; it's why we get butterflies before a big presentation, or feel nauseous when we're in a high-stakes situation. And while we can't avoid stressful situations entirely, it's possible to learn to manage stress through techniques like belly breathing, relaxation therapy, and meditation.
        4. Get enough sleep
        Healthier gut, better sleep? Perhaps, according to research published in Frontiers in Microbiology, which found that certain bacteria in your gut may impact your sleep in a variety of ways, from your likelihood of experiencing insomnia, to how frequently you need to nap, to how long you stay asleep at night. Most people should aim to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night. If you're struggling to hit that goal, try improving your sleep hygiene, getting plenty of daytime exercise, and trying some of the stress management tips above.
        5. Stay physically active
        It's not hard to find good reasons tostay active, but here's one more: According to a systematic review published in Nutrients, participating in 150 to 270 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity exercise per week for at least six weeks has a positive effect on your gut microbiota, particularly if you combine aerobic exercise with resistance training. We already know that people who are sedentary have different gut microbiota characteristics than active people; this research suggests that you might be able to improve your gut health through exercise even if you're not currently active.",Lindsay Warner,"February 20, 2025",1

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/chickpeas-easy-ways-to-eat-more-of-this-nutritious-legume,Chickpeas: Easy ways to eat more of this nutritious legume,"If you've ever swirled a crudité through a creamy, garlicky bowl of hummus, or topped a salad with crunchy roasted chickpeas, you've tapped into the goodness of garbanzo beans.
        But even if you're new to eating legumes, chickpeas can be an easy and nutritious addition to your diet.
        What are chickpeas?
        A member of the Fabaceae (or pea) family, chickpeas are the edible fruits produced by the Cicer arietinum plant. Small, round, and usually beige-colored, chickpeas — or garbanzo beans — are a rich source of vitamins, minerals, plant protein, and fiber.
        Are chickpeas good for you?
        Chickpeas provide 14.5 grams of plant-based protein per cup (cooked), making them a good choice for people looking to get more protein in their diets without eating more meat. They also provide 12.5 grams of dietary fiber per cup, which aids digestion, helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome, and can help keep you feeling fuller for longer after eating. Plus, they're relatively low in calories and contain 4 grams of fat (a mix of healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated) per cup. And, because they're low on the glycemic index, unlike refined carbohydrates, eating them will not cause blood sugar levels to spike.
        Chickpeas provide a variety of vitamins and minerals. They're an excellent source of the mineral manganese (important for your brain and nervous system) and the B vitamin folate (important for cell growth), as well as copper, iron, zinc, and phosphorus. Chickpeas are high in vitamins A, E, and C, and a good source of, thiamine, vitamin B6, and selenium. They're also a good source of potassium and magnesium — both of which can help support cardiovascular health by helping prevent high blood pressure. Additionally, garbanzo beans are naturally cholesterol-free and low in sodium, while being rich in heart-healthy polyunsaturated fats.
        Ideas for adding chickpeas to your diet
        You can enjoy chickpeas straight out of the can (rinse them first to remove excess sodium), on salads or added to soups and stews, where they can replace some or all of the meat called for in many recipes. Dip vegetables in hummus — a dip made from chickpeas, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and tahini (sesame-seed paste). Keep an eye on portion size when enjoying hummus, since the calories from olive oil and tahini can add up, and check sodium levels on store-bought hummus. You can also swap the chicken or lamb in your gyro for falafel (made from chickpeas, herbs, and spices).
        If you lean towards DIY, it's easy (and cheaper) to buy dried chickpeas and cook them at home. Just be sure to leave yourself some time; many popular cooking methods call for soaking the dried beans in water overnight before cooking. (Or cook them ahead of time and store them in the freezer for a quick and healthy protein source you can reach for anytime.)
        You can also explore chickpea flour, a good stand-in for gluten-containing flours. Chickpea flour is slightly more dense than all-purpose flour and absorbs more moisture — so it's not quite a 1:1 substitution for all-purpose flour, but there are many recipes online to help you make the swap. Or simply buy pasta made with chickpea flour rather than white or whole-wheat; it tends to be higher in protein and fiber than traditional pasta, with a pleasantly nutty taste.
        Easy chickpea recipes
        The following recipes will work with canned chickpeas or dried chickpeas you've cooked yourself.
        
          Combine chickpeas with a squeeze of lemon, a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, and a pinch of flaky salt. Add to a salad or eat as is.
          Toss chickpeas with cucumber, tomato, red onion, feta, olives, lettuce, and Greek dressing.
          Make roasted chickpeas by patting beans dry, then tossing with extra virgin olive oil, salt, pepper, and your favorite spices. Spread in a single layer on a cookie sheet and roast for about 45 minutes at 350°. Eat as a snack or use to top a salad.
          For the smoothest homemade hummus, boil a can of chickpeas with a pinch of baking soda for about 20 minutes. Then blend the chickpeas with 1/2 cup tahini, the juice from two small lemons, one large garlic clove, a large pinch of salt, and a drizzle of olive oil to make hummus. You may need to add up to 4 tablespoons of water to achieve the desired consistency. Drizzle with more olive oil and sprinkle with herbs or spices of your choice.
          Make curried chickpeas by heating canola oil in a heavy-bottomed pot, then adding sliced onion, minced garlic, and crushed red pepper. Cook until the onion is golden (about 10 minutes). Add curry powder and cumin and cook until fragrant, then add a can of crushed tomatoes. Add a can of coconut milk and two cans of chickpeas to the pot, reduce to low heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Serve over brown rice.
          Blend together a large bunch of cilantro, equal parts fresh lime juice and olive oil (about 1/4 cup each), one large clove garlic, 2 teaspoons mustard, and 2 teaspoons sugar, plus a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss dressing with 1 cup minced red onion and 3 cups cooked and cooled chickpeas.",Lindsay Warner,"February 14, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-products-that-claim-to-stop-snoring-actually-work,Do products that claim to stop snoring actually work?,"Snoring is more than an annoying nighttime quirk; it's an issue that can affect your relationships, sleep quality, and health. Fortunately, certain lifestyle changes and products can help you manage this common problem.
        What causes snoring?
        Snoring occurs when airflow through the mouth and nose is partially blocked during sleep. The blockage causes the surrounding tissues to vibrate and produce sound — snoring.
        Various factors can narrow the airway and cause snoring, including relaxed throat muscles or a backward-slipping tongue. Here are some common factors that make snoring more likely:
        
          being overweight, which adds extra tissue around the neck that compresses the airways
          nasal issues like a deviated septum
          
            nasal polyps
          
          congestion from colds or allergies
          structural features, such as a long soft palate or uvula (the back part of the roof of your mouth), or swollen tonsils or adenoids
          poor muscle tone due to aging
          alcohol and certain medications that allow the airway to collapse more easily.
        
        In some cases, snoring may indicate sleep apnea, a serious condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. You can read more about sleep apnea below.
        Anti-snoring products
        Anti-snoring products, such as oral appliances or positional aids, can reduce snoring when used correctly. These devices most often work by helping to keep your airway open during sleep. This reduces the vibrations that cause snoring.
        Anti-snoring devices are often self-administered. If a device doesn't alleviate your snoring, your doctor can help you explore other treatment options and address any underlying causes.
        Positional aids
        Research shows that sleeping on your side (rather than on your back) can significantly reduce both the intensity and duration of snoring in many individuals without sleep apnea. For some people, positional aids that encourage side sleeping are a practical and low-cost way to reduce snoring.
        Positional aids can range from tennis balls sewn into the back of sleepwear to specialized devices that prompt your body to change position. Specialized vests, pillows, and alarms are examples of positional aids that can help snorers who struggle to maintain a side-sleeping posture.
        A literature review published in Sleep & Breathing found the effectiveness of positional aids varies from product to product. For example, vests with inflatable chambers were found to reduce snoring rates by more than half in positional-dependent snorers. Wedge pillows also significantly decreased snoring. On the other hand, wearable alarm devices that alerted snorers if they were sleeping on their back did not lead to significant improvement in snoring frequency.
        Researchers found that some users did not use the devices long-term because of issues with discomfort. Despite mixed findings, positional aids remain a low-risk option worth trying for snorers, especially those who notice improvements when sleeping on their side.
        Oral appliances
        Oral appliances work by keeping the airway open during sleep. These appliances fit over the teeth like retainers, and work by repositioning the jaw or holding the tongue forward to prevent airway obstruction.
        Oral appliances can improve sleep quality for both the user and their bed partner. When prescribed by a doctor and fitted by a dentist, these devices can be a comfortable and effective solution to address chronic snoring. (You can also purchase over-the-counter ""boil and bite"" oral appliances that you mold yourself.)
        While oral appliances can be effective, they are not without potential drawbacks. Some users experience temporary side effects such as drooling or jaw discomfort. And long-term use may lead to issues like changes in bite alignment. However, many people adjust to these devices with minimal discomfort, especially when they are properly fitted and regularly monitored by a dentist.
        Devices
        A relatively new device, called eXciteOSA, was approved by the FDA to reduce snoring and mild sleep apnea. The device is worn in the mouth and used while awake. It helps snoring by strengthening tongue muscles to prevent airway obstruction during sleep. It works by delivering gentle electrical stimulation through a mouthpiece with electrodes positioned above and below the tongue.
        In a clinical trial, users completed daily 20-minute sessions for six weeks, followed by weekly maintenance sessions. The trial showed improvements in the severity of sleep apnea as well as the percent of time spent snoring loudly. Side effects included excessive salivation, gagging, and tongue discomfort.
        Lifestyle changes to reduce snoring
        Reducing snoring frequency and intensity does not necessarily require spending money on a device. Some (free) lifestyle changes may help you reduce snoring.
        
          Avoid alcohol. Refrain from drinking alcohol within three hours of bedtime to prevent airway muscles from relaxing excessively during sleep.
          Maintain a healthy weight. Losing weight can decrease the amount of tissue in the neck and throat, reducing airway obstruction.
          Address nasal issues. Use saline rinses for a stuffy nose, minimize allergens in your bedroom, and consider a humidifier or medication for swollen nasal tissues.
          Quit smoking. Smoking irritates and inflames the upper airway, increasing the likelihood of snoring. Even exposure to secondhand smoke can contribute to the problem.
          Adjust sleeping position. Sleep on your side to prevent your tongue from blocking your airway. Try a body pillow, or sew a tennis ball to the back of your sleepwear to stay off your back.
          Elevate your head. Use extra pillows, a wedge pillow, or elevate the head of your bed to improve airflow.
        
        These strategies can help with simple snoring. But if symptoms like gasping, nighttime awakenings, or daytime sleepiness persist, consult a doctor to check for sleep apnea.
        Could your snoring be a sign of sleep apnea?
        Snoring can sometimes be a warning sign of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a sleep disorder that causes people to repeatedly stop breathing for short periods during sleep. Other signs and symptoms of sleep apnea include excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating, morning headaches, or waking up feeling unrefreshed.
        It's important to see a doctor if you (or your bed partner) suspect you have sleep apnea. Untreated sleep apnea can lead to high blood pressure, putting a strain on the cardiovascular system, and other health concerns.
        To determine if snoring is a sign of sleep apnea, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. They may check for physical factors like a narrowed airway, a large neck circumference, or elevated blood pressure, all of which can indicate a higher risk of OSA.
        When doctors suspect sleep apnea, they typically recommended a sleep study to confirm the diagnosis. While sleep studies were once conducted exclusively in overnight labs, home-based sleep studies are now widely available and can provide sufficient data for diagnosis in many cases.",Jenette Restivo,"February 13, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/chair-yoga-benefits-of-a-mind-body-practice-without-the-risk-of-falling,Chair yoga: Benefits of a mind-body practice without the risk of falling,"One aspect many practitioners love about yoga is how welcoming and inclusive it can be. The ancient movement and meditation practice can work for everyone. And there are no prerequisites to giving it a try, other than curiosity and a desire to improve your fitness, flexibility, and strength.
        Case in point: You can even practice yoga seated in a chair.
        What is chair yoga?
        Chair yoga is exactly what it sounds like: yoga that is performed while seated in a chair. Every pose, breathing exercise, or meditation is done while sitting down.
        The term may also be used to describe yoga positions that are done while standing but holding onto a chair for added support. This article will use the term to describe yoga positions done in a seated position.
        Could chair yoga be right for you?
        Anyone can try chair yoga. But it's especially helpful for anyone who has difficulty balancing, standing for a long time, or getting up from or down on the floor, where yoga is traditionally performed.
        Chair yoga is also a great option for a quick stretch if you'll be sitting for a while, such as on a long car or plane trip or at your desk during a busy workday.
        Benefits of yoga
        Yoga has been linked to a long list of health benefits, and larger, longer-term studies are in progress. Based on what we've learned thus far, the perks of a regular yoga practice may include:
        
          lower stress
          reduced risk of heart disease
          more stable blood sugar
          less back and arthritis pain
          sharper memory
          less anxiety and depression
          better sleep
          greater happiness
          weight loss.
        
        Benefits of chair yoga
        Chair yoga can deliver the above benefits while providing a more stable, seated base from which to exercise.
        In one small study among older adults with osteoarthritis in the lower body (for example, knees and hips), doing chair yoga exercises for 45 minutes twice a week for eight weeks led to less pain and fatigue, compared to participating in a health education program. Another small study found adults with knee osteoarthritis were better able to carry out their daily activities after a 12-week chair yoga program.
        In a third study, older adults experienced greater stress reduction after participating in a six-week chair yoga program, compared to those who participated in six weeks of chair aerobics, walking, or social games.
        Chair yoga workout
        If you'd like to give chair yoga a try, you can start with the five chair yoga positions described below. You can do the exercises in a sequence, or pick a couple of the movements to try any time you want a quick stretch.
        Check with your doctor before doing these moves if you have back, shoulder, or hip problems, or recently had abdominal, shoulder, or hip surgery.

          As you exhale, gently rotate your torso to the right, toward the back of the chair, looking over your right shoulder. You should feel a stretch in your torso and neck, but do not strain or force the position. Hold for 3 to 5 breaths.
          As you inhale, return to center.
          Complete 3 to 5 reps to the right, then sit the opposite way and repeat, twisting to the left.
        
        Pigeon
        
          
        
        
          Sit up straight toward the edge of a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Place your left ankle across your right thigh.
          As you inhale, sit up tall. Don't round your back; keep your spine elongated.
          If you feel a stretch in your left hip, then hold here. If not, gently press down on your left knee with your left hand, and on an exhale, lean forward slightly until you feel a stretch. Keep your chest lifted as you lean forward. Hold for 3 to 5 breaths.
          Release on an exhale.
          Do 3 to 5 reps total on that side, then repeat with your right ankle across your left thigh.
        
        Shoulder stretch
        
          
        
        
          Sit up straight in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Tighten your abdominal muscles to support your back. Hold a strap or a towel in your right hand.
          Inhale while raising your right arm over your head.
          Bend your right elbow so your right hand is behind your head and the strap or towel is hanging down your back.
          On an inhale, extend your left arm down at your side, and then bend your left elbow so your left hand is behind your back. Grasp the strap or towel with your left hand.
          If you feel a stretch in your shoulders and arms, hold here. If not, walk your hands toward each other until you feel a stretch. Hold for 3 to 5 breaths. Keep your shoulders relaxed and down, away from your ears.
          Release on an exhale.
          Repeat in the other direction, holding the strap or towel in your left hand. That's one rep.
          Continue alternating sides until you've completed 3 to 5 reps total.
        
        Safety tips for chair yoga
        When you're exercising on a chair, you need to make sure your seat is safe and sturdy. Your chair shouldn't tip, wobble, roll, or move easily. Choose a chair without arms so you have more room to move in different directions.
        As with any new exercise, start slowly, giving yourself time to get used to the movements and see how your body reacts. Never push yourself to the point of strain or pain in any chair yoga position.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/low-carb-foods-nutritious-choices-for-creating-a-sustainable-diet-thats-lower-in-carbohydrates,Low-carb foods: Nutritious choices for creating a sustainable diet that's lower in carbohydrates,"Offering a variety of benefits, from improved energy levels to better weight management, low-carb foods have become a cornerstone of many healthy eating plans. Here are some practical ways to include low-carb foods in your diet.
        What is ""low carb""?
        ""Carb"" is short for carbohydrate, one of the main nutrients (along with fats and proteins) that you must consume to fuel your body. Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy. They are found in foods such as bread, pasta, rice, fruits, and sugary snacks.
        A low-carb diet is an eating plan that significantly reduces carbohydrate intake. Most low-carb diets limit daily carbohydrate consumption to about 26% of total daily calories. This amounts less than 130 grams of carbohydrates per day, compared to a typical daily intake of 225 to 325 grams of carbs in a standard diet.
        In a low-carb diet, carbohydrates are replaced with proteins, healthy fats, and non-starchy vegetables.
        Pros and cons of low-carb diets
        Like many eating plans, low-carb diets come with both advantages and challenges. Understanding the pros and cons can help you decide whether a low-carb approach is best for your health goals and lifestyle.
        While low-carb diets can be safe for many people, it's important to consult with a health care provider before starting one, especially if you have underlying health conditions.
        Pros of low-carb diets
        Low-carb diets have been linked to several health benefits. One of the most notable is improved blood sugar control. By reducing carbohydrate intake, low carb diets can help stabilize blood sugar levels and reduce insulin resistance in people with diabetes and prediabetes.
        These diets may also help your heart by lowering triglyceride levels and increasing HDL (""good"") cholesterol. Their effect on LDL cholesterol is still unclear.
        Low-carb eating plans may also promote weight loss. Some people report feeling more satiated and less prone to overeating when they cut down on carbs and emphasize protein and healthy fats.
        Cons of low-carb diets
        One risk of low-carb eating is inadequate fiber intake. Many high carb foods like whole grains, legumes, and certain fruits are also high in fiber. Eating less of these foods also reduces your fiber intake and can lead to digestive issues such as constipation. You can avoid this by making sure to eat plenty of vegetables that are high in fiber.
        Sustaining low-carb diets over the long term can also be a challenge.
        Healthy low-carb meal ideas
        These healthy low-carb meals can help you reduce your daily carbohydrate intake.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/walking-the-right-way-improves-your-balance,Walking the right way improves your balance,"Balance is one of the senses that we often take for granted — until we lose it.
        In our 50s and 60s, we may notice that our bodies feel less stable. Gradual changes linked to growing older — such as loss of muscle mass, lack of flexibility, slower reflexes, worsening eyesight, and even certain medical conditions and medications — can affect our sense of balance.
        Poor balance often leads to falls, which can cause head injuries and other disabling injuries. Hip fractures, in particular, can lead to serious health complications and threaten independence.
        How walking can help balance
        The good news is that you can improve your balance with simple, everyday activities. Walking, for example, is an excellent way to build lower-body strength — a key component of maintaining good balance.
        Not only is walking a safe and accessible exercise for most people, but it also contributes to your aerobic activity goals while helping you stay steady on your feet.
        How to get started with walking
        
          A well-designed walking plan should safely and gradually increase your physical activity, focusing more on minutes than miles.
          If you're new to exercise, start slow and steady. Use a cane or walker if needed, and as you build strength and confidence, gradually add more minutes to your walks.
          If you're already active, choose a walking plan that aligns with your current fitness level and adjust as needed. If it feels too easy, challenge yourself by increasing your time, distance, or incorporating hills. Aim for at least 150 minutes of walking per week.
          For those who find walking especially challenging due to health issues, consulting with a physiatrist or physical therapist can help you explore alternative options.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/pilates-a-good-option-for-older-adults,Pilates: A good option for older adults?,"Nearly 12 million Americans tried Pilates in 2023, 15% more than during the previous year. Pilates is once again growing in popularity after first going mainstream in the early 2000s. And the attention on this low-impact workout might make you wonder if Pilates is a good option for you.
        What is Pilates?
        Pilates is a form of exercise invented by a German fitness enthusiast named Joseph H. Pilates. His system involves movements meant to improve balance, flexibility, and strength, especially in your core. (""Core"" refers to the muscles in the back, sides, pelvis, and buttocks that stabilize the center of the body to improve efficiency of movement.)
        Pilates may be performed using either a mat and your own body weight, or a specially designed piece of equipment called a Pilates reformer that provides resistance. Today, Pilates is available at many fitness facilities. You can also find Pilates workouts on video or online streaming platforms.
        Potential benefits of Pilates for older adults
        Pilates isn't just about stretching and strengthening your muscles. It has also been linked to the following benefits that may be particularly important for older adults:
        
          improves posture
          maintains bone density
          protects against cognitive decline
          improves back pain
          supports the immune system
          bolsters mental health.
        
        Plus it's a low-impact form of exercise, meaning it may be more comfortable and accessible for people with joint pain or mobility concerns.
        Safety considerations
        It's generally a good idea to check with your doctor before trying any new kind of exercise, including reformer Pilates, mat Pilates, or wall Pilates. (Wall Pilates uses the support of a wall to add resistance to an at-home Pilates workout.)
        Your doctor may recommend you avoid certain Pilates exercises if you have existing back pain or spine issues.
        How to get started with Pilates
        Once your health care provider has cleared you to try Pilates, look for a local studio or community center that offers Pilates for older adults or Pilates for beginners.
        Plan to arrive early for your first visit so you have time to let the instructor know about any concerns or questions you have. They'll introduce you to the movement patterns and show you how to practice safely, depending on your needs and abilities.
        How Pilates can be modified to fit your needs
        When you're first getting started, an experienced Pilates instructor can help you tailor your practice to your unique needs. That might include trying a more gentle version of Pilates or performing the exercises while seated in a chair.
        Gentle Pilates for older adults
        Pilates is generally considered a gentle, low-impact form of exercise. But certain Pilates classes may be marketed as ""gentle Pilates for seniors"" or for beginners of any age. These classes generally focus on exercises that are even gentler on the joints. Gentle Pilates may also have added emphasis on breathing techniques or be more easily adaptable to various fitness levels and abilities.
        Chair Pilates
        Pilates is often performed while lying down on a mat or the reformer machine. If you're more comfortable exercising in a chair or if lying down isn't accessible to you, you may be able to find a local studio, community center, or online platform offering chair Pilates. In chair Pilates, you perform the strengthening and stretching motions while seated.
        Note that the term ""chair Pilates"" can also refer to the use of a Pilates machine called a Wunda chair, which can further challenge your core muscles. Be sure to check ahead of time to make sure you're signing up for the version of chair Pilates you want.",Sarah Klein,"February 5, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/calcium-rich-foods-how-to-boost-your-intake-of-this-important-mineral,Calcium-rich foods: How to boost your intake of this important mineral,"Calcium is the most abundant mineral in your body, and it's a major component of your bones and teeth. But your body can't make calcium on its own, so it's essential to consume calcium-rich foods (and, sometimes, supplements) to meet your daily calcium needs.
        As with any nutrient, choosing foods with calcium rather than a supplement should be your first choice. Luckily, nature offers a bounty of choices.
        Health benefits of calcium
        Calcium is best known for building bones and keeping them healthy. But it also plays many other vital roles, like keeping your heart beating and your muscles and nerves functioning, as well as helping maintain healthy blood pressure.
        Calcium is so indispensable that your body has a backup system to keep a steady amount of it in your blood to maintain those vital functions, in case of a calcium deficiency. If you don't get enough calcium in your diet, a complex series of reactions will release calcium from your bones into your bloodstream, to go where it's needed. But if this calcium ""debt"" isn't replenished, it can weaken your bones over time and increase your risk of developing osteoporosis (a disease in which bones become more porous and less dense than healthy bones).
        How much calcium do you need?
        The U.S. recommended daily allowance (RDA) for calcium depends on age and sex; older adults (especially women) need slightly more, since they're at greater risk of weakened bones. Adults up to age 50 are advised to get 1,000 milligrams (mg) calcium per day; the recommendation is 1,200 mg daily for women over 50 and men over 70.
        People who do not eat dairy products, which are rich in calcium, may need to pay careful attention to ensure they get enough calcium through other foods or, in some cases, calcium supplements.
        Top dairy sources of calcium
        When you think of high-calcium foods, dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese probably come to mind first. Indeed, dairy foods are some of nature's most concentrated sources of calcium (see table). And many come ""packaged"" with other bone-building nutrients like protein, phosphorus, and (when fortified) vitamin D.
        The best non-dairy sources of calcium
        While they don't get as much fanfare, many plant foods are also calcium-rich, including greens, beans, tofu, nuts, and seeds. Note that some of these healthy foods also contain compounds like insoluble fiber and oxalic acid that bind with calcium and hinder its absorption. For example, some greens like spinach and chard are higher in oxalic acid — but others like kale, collard greens, and bok choy contain lower amounts, so the calcium they contain is likely better absorbed. For that reason, it's important to eat a variety of calcium-containing plant-based foods.
        You can also find a variety of plant-based beverages, such as plant milks and orange juice, that have been fortified with calcium.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/fitness-face-off,Fitness face-off,"What's in style? The question doesn't just relate to fashion. Indeed, even exercise styles go in and out of vogue, echoing trends fueled by social media and other cultural drivers.
        Case in point: high-intensity bursts of exercise have grabbed headlines over the past couple of years, with scientists generating an array of studies examining the health benefits of short spurts of movement lasting from one to three minutes. That might consist of jumping jacks, lunges, running in place, jumping rope, air boxing, running up stairs, or any other high-intensity activity.
        Meanwhile, plenty of research continues to focus on the health advantages of moderate-intensity, continuous movement. Mainstay choices for these sessions include brisk walking, cycling, jogging, and elliptical and treadmill use.
        Given the swings in popularity between the differently paced alternatives, perhaps the most pressing question is which one is better for us. It might seem certain exercise patterns might prove superior to others, but we should resist the temptation to believe that, says Dr. Meagan Wasfy, a sports cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        ""There are always trends, and each one claims to be the latest and best way to move your body,"" Dr. Wasfy says.
        Breaking down the data
        What health benefits does each approach offer? A sampling of recent studies and official health guidance weighs in.
        Evidence supporting exercise bursts includes the following:
        
          A 2022 analysis of data collected on more than 25,200 people who didn't otherwise exercise (average age 62, 56% women) published in Nature Medicine found that those who routinely did brief bursts of vigorous activity — defined as three bouts, each lasting a minute or two — had significantly lower odds of dying or developing cardiovascular disease over the following seven years than participants who didn't.
          A 2023 analysis in JAMA Oncology of more than 22,000 people who didn't exercise (average age 62, 55% women) suggested that even short, intermittent periods of intense movement — a minute at a time, three or four times a day — was linked with 18% lower cancer risk over the following 6.7 years, especially for cancers of the breast, uterus, or colon.
        
        Evidence supporting longer, moderate-intensity exercise includes the following:
        
          Adults who do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous exercise derive health benefits, including reducing their risks of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some forms of cancer, according to the CDC.
          A 2022 analysis in JAMA Internal Medicine involving 78,000 people (average age 61, 55% women) found their risk of heart disease, cancer, and premature death dropped by 10% over the following seven years for every 2,000 steps they logged each day, with the benefit peaking at 10,000 steps.
        
        Sense a theme from the findings? Regardless of intensity, it's apparent that any movement is good for your health.
        ""No one comes out ahead with regards to the long-term outcomes,"" Dr. Wasfy says. ""What matters most is moving your body and doing more of it. The sum of movement, over the course of a year or decades of your life, is what matters.""
        Exercise caveats
        One clear advantage to exercise bursts — or its cousin, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) — is that any high-intensity activity enables you to fulfill recommended exercise guidelines in less time. Health organizations advise adults to get at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise (or some equivalent combination of the two) per week. For an HIIT workout, you alternate vigorous, short sprints with brief periods of rest or lower-intensity movement.
        ""It's a time-efficient way to get your recommended exercise dose in less time,"" Dr. Wasfy says.
        High-intensity exercise does pose a few drawbacks, however. These include a greater risk of injuries and inflammation to joints and muscles. Additionally, for people with heart disease or its risk factors, sudden bursts of exercise could be more likely to bring on new cardiac symptoms.
        ""If you're writing an exercise prescription not knowing anything about someone's health history, you'd write it for moderate-intensity, continuous exercise,"" Dr. Wasfy says.
        If you'd like to increase your exercise intensity but have existing heart disease — or symptoms such as chest pain with vigorous movement — talk to your doctor in advance. Older adults who've noticed their ability to exercise has declined should also speak up.
        Ultimately, Dr. Wasfy says, you should choose a style of exercise you really like — and will do consistently — and disregard fitness trends. ""If you're healthy,"" she says, ""it's really your choice.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-your-dentist-could-save-your-life,How your dentist could save your life,"""Open wide."" It's our main task when we sit in the dentist's chair, and we might assume our dentist has one job, too — to assess the condition of our teeth.
        But looking for plaque, cavities, and gum disease is only part of the picture. Dentists have a prime vantage point to be the first line of defense in identifying problems all over the body. More than 100 conditions can produce signs in the mouth, according to the American Heart Association, and dental training enables these clinicians to spot telltale clues in the teeth, gums, tongue, palate, lips, jaw, face, and neck.
        ""I think individuals should view their dentists as an indispensable part of their health care team,"" says Dr. Christine Riedy, an associate professor in oral public health and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. ""Some people describe the mouth as the gateway to the body and oral health as the canary in the coal mine. It's true — dentists might see things that can indicate other things happening in the body.""
        A lengthy list of threats
        What conditions can dentists detect, and what signs are they looking for?
        Oral cancer. Rough spots, swelling, bumps, or unexplained bleeding in the mouth might signal head and neck cancers, as do irregularities in the face, lips, jaw, or neck. While head and neck malignancies account for only about 4% of all cancers in the United States, they're more prevalent in older adults. ""Patches of mucosa that are either red or white, as well as lumps or sores, are some of the things dentists would find suspicious,"" Dr. Riedy says. ""Seeing your dentist on a regular basis is really important to pick up those changes."" (See ""Anxiety-busting strategies for visiting the dentist."")
        Diabetes. About 9% of Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes, but an estimated 23% of adults who have the condition don't know it, according to the National Institutes of Health. When sugar levels are elevated in the blood, they're also elevated in saliva. Bacteria in dental plaque feed on that, fueling inflamed and bleeding gums. Diabetes can also lead to dry mouth and infections in the mouth that take longer to heal. ""Some dentists have put HbA1c tests [which measure average blood sugar levels over the past three months] into their screening toolkit to better understand whether a patient has diabetes,"" Dr. Riedy says.
        Sleep apnea. More than a quarter of American adults are believed to have sleep apnea: a pattern of frequent lapses in breathing during sleep, often accompanied by heavy snoring. Untreated, the condition raises risk for serious conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Dentists might suspect sleep apnea if they notice enlargement of the tonsils, tongue, or jaw muscles; a red throat; or signs of teeth grinding. ""Because people with sleep apnea sleep with their mouth open, they can get dry mouth, which also creates an environment for oral disease,"" she says.
        Osteoporosis. Four times as common among older women than men, the progressive loss of bone density characterizing this condition might show up on x-rays of the teeth and jaw. Missing and loose teeth can also be a tip-off. ""With the loss of bone density, the jawbone becomes weaker, and teeth lose their stability,"" Dr. Riedy says.
        Acid reflux. Eroded enamel on back teeth is a major clue someone has acid reflux, and their teeth may also be discolored. ""People may experience heartburn and not realize that gastric acid has actually reached their mouth,"" she says. ""They think it's only centered in the chest.""
        Eating disorders. Surprisingly, Dr. Riedy says, dentists are often the first health care providers to recognize signs of eating disorders, particularly among people who purge by vomiting. Many people with eating disorders — which affect girls and women twice as often as males — engage in binge-purge cycles that don't substantially affect their weight or appearance. ""Outwardly, maybe they don't look like they have an eating disorder, but dentists can see deterioration of the back teeth and enamel erosion due to acid,"" she says.
        
          
            
              
                Anxiety-busting strategies for visiting the dentist
                Dentists can root out our health problems — whether in the mouth or elsewhere — only if we schedule an appointment. But while we're supposed to see our dentist every six months, many people view that recommendation as optional. Only two-thirds of American adults visited a dentist in the past year, according to the CDC.
                Why the low attendance? A big part of it is fear, says Dr. Christine Riedy, an associate professor in oral public health and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. An estimated 15% of people across the world report dental anxiety — women more often than men, according to an April 2023 study in Health Affairs.
                Whether it's pain, needles, or a loss of control, various aspects of dental care might contribute to reluctance to see a dentist. So can an unpleasant encounter in the past or embarrassment about oral health. Some people don't like when a dentist or hygienist leans close to their face. Some worry about how their breath smells.
                But there are ways you can reclaim a calmer frame of mind when you approach the dental chair. Dr. Riedy suggests these strategies:
                Distraction. Listen to music or a podcast through headphones. Some dentists also offer music or videos that help divert your attention. ""Try to focus on something other than what's happening in your mouth,"" she says.
                Relaxation techniques. Meditation can lower stress levels, and ""deep breathing can slow your heart rate and help you get yourself more in control,"" Dr. Riedy says.
                Sedation. Ask your dentist if she can administer medication that calms and relaxes you during treatment, such as nitrous oxide (laughing gas). Some dentists will provide a prescription for an oral sedative you can take at home before your visit, as long as you have someone to drive you.
                Bring a buddy. ""Having someone you trust come with you to the appointment can help reduce some of your anxiety,"" she says.
              
            
          
        
        Maximizing your dental check ups
        If your dentist notices signs of another health problem, she'll likely refer you to your primary care doctor or an appropriate specialist. But you can also make it easier for her to gather as much useful information as possible during dental check-ups.
        ""It may sound basic, but often your dentist will ask if you have any health updates,"" Dr. Riedy says. ""Sharing your health history and any updates can be really important, and asking questions is crucial.""
        It's also essential to voice any health concerns to your dentist, just as you would with your primary care doctor. You may believe a problem with another aspect of your health has nothing to do with your oral health, but you might be wrong. ""Be an advocate for your own care,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/weighing-protein-powders,Weighing protein powders,"Over time, most men experience age-related muscle loss, called sarcopenia. Sufficient protein intake can help slow and reverse this condition, as the digestive system breaks down protein into amino acids, which the body uses to build muscle.
        The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of protein is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. For an average 180-pound man, that is approximately 65 grams of protein daily.
        However, some research has suggested older men may need closer to 1 to 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight. Those doing regular strength training (which also helps increase muscle mass) should aim for around 1.5 grams per kilogram to help with muscle recovery. (Check with your doctor if you are unsure how much daily protein you require.)
        The scoop on powders
        No matter your protein needs, protein powders have become an easy way for men to reach their daily quota. Depending on the brand, a single scoop can offer 15 to 30 grams of protein per serving. Powders are easy to add to your diet, as you can mix them with water or milk or blend them into a smoothie.
        But how much should you rely on powders for your daily protein?
        ""Protein powders are fine as supportive fillers to help maintain daily requirements, but men also need plenty of protein-rich foods, as they contain other nutrients that men require for muscle growth and overall health,"" says Nancy Oliveira, a registered dietitian and manager of the Nutrition and Wellness Service at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        For instance, animal proteins like lean beef, poultry, and fatty fish (salmon, tuna, and mackerel) contain B vitamins, vitamin E, iron, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids. These micronutrients assist in protein metabolism and repair of damaged cells, and they support the health of blood vessels that deliver oxygen and energy sources to muscle tissue. Plant protein foods like beans, nuts, and soy also contain phytochemicals like anti-inflammatory flavonoids and fiber that fuels the gut microbiome to support a robust immune system. (See ""Power protein foods."")
        ""The best approach is to focus on high-protein foods first and use powders here and there to fill in the gaps,"" says Oliveira. ""A general recommendation to follow is that powders should make up to one-third of your daily amount, if desired.""
        
          
            
              
                Power protein foods
                Here are some examples of how much protein you can get from typical servings of high-quality protein foods:
                
                  3.5 ounces lean chicken: 31 grams
                  3.5 ounces salmon: 24 grams
                  1 cup beans: 18 grams
                  6 ounces plain yogurt: 17 grams
                  3 ounces tempeh: 16 grams
                  1/2 cup nuts: 14 grams
                  1 cup skim milk or soy milk: 9 grams
                  1 egg: 6 grams.
                
              
            
          
        
        Choosing your powder
        Protein powders come from plants (soybeans, peas, rice, potatoes, or hemp), eggs, or milk (casein or whey protein). Which ones are best?
        ""Both plant and animal sources of protein powder will help build muscle even though they contain different ratios of amino acids,"" says Oliveira. ""Pure whey or soy or pea protein powder don't taste vastly different, so it's a personal preference. Some people have allergies to dairy or soy, so the variety of options is helpful.""
        Oliveira recommends whey, pea, soy, or hempseed protein powders, as they contain the nine essential amino acids (those that the body cannot make on its own and thus must get from food).
        She also suggests brands that are primarily pure protein and don't contain extras like sweeteners (regular sugar or artificial sweeteners) or artificial flavors and colors. ""You can always add fruit, nut butter, or chia seeds to a protein powder to enhance the flavor and texture,"" says Oliveira.
        Different ways to use
        While protein powders can be consumed at any time of day, they are especially helpful as part of a post-workout meal. The American College of Sports Medicine suggests consuming 15 to 25 grams of protein within one hour after vigorous exercise to support muscle recovery and repair. (You don't need this after doing moderate exercise for less than one hour.)
        ""A protein powder drink made from one to two cups water or milk and a scoop of powder is ideal in this situation, as people often are not that hungry for a high-protein meal immediately after exercising,"" says Oliveira. ""The drink is easily digested and absorbed and provides needed hydration."" A smoothie with protein powder also can replace a regular meal if it contains sufficient carbs, protein, healthy fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Here is a simple recipe Oliveira recommends:
        Mix in a blender one scoop of protein powder, one cup of low-fat dairy milk or unsweetened plant milk, 1/2 to 1 cup frozen or fresh fruit, 1 to 2 tablespoons of nut or sunflower seed butter, 1/2 cup plain yogurt, and 1 to 2 tablespoons of chia seeds or ground flaxseed.
        ""You can drink this for breakfast, a snack, or anytime when you need extra help getting your daily protein,"" she says. ""It's also okay to boost the protein amount of everyday foods like yogurt, oatmeal, or even coffee by adding a few spoons of protein powder,"" says Oliveira. ""But powders have their place. When it comes to protein, think food first, powders second.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-winter-affects-chronic-conditions,How winter affects chronic conditions,"We all have triggers for some particular health condition. Eat spicy food, for example, and you might get heartburn. Lift something heavy, and it might set off chronic low-back pain. And if you're coping with cold weather, you might experience a flare-up of certain diseases. Here are four chronic ailments that seem to worsen in winter.
        Psoriasis
        Winter poses many risks for people with psoriasis, which causes raised red patches of skin covered in silvery or white scales. Flare-ups can result from dry skin due to being in heated indoor air or taking long, hot showers.
        Winter bugs such as viral infections or strep throat also can trigger a psoriasis flare, as can reduced exposure to sunlight. ""UVB radiation is actually a treatment for psoriasis, as it slows down the rapid skin growth that drives psoriasis,"" says Dr. Sally Tan, director of the Atopic Dermatitis Specialty Clinic at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Recommendations: ""Take shorter, lukewarm showers; use a humidifier around the house; and moisturize with bland, cream-based emollients liberally—at least once a day, right after showering—to keep the skin well-moisturized and the skin barrier intact during winter months,"" Dr. Tan advises. ""And try to get 10 to 15 minutes of natural sunlight exposure each day. Wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even if you're just sitting indoors by a window.""
        Asthma
        Many things we breathe in — such as pollen or pollution — can set off an attack of asthma, a chronic lung condition caused by inflammation and narrowing of the airways. ""Triggers vary, but most people with asthma are bothered by breathing cold air, which cools and dehydrates the airways. That causes them to spasm and tighten, known as bronchoconstriction,"" explains Dr. Nicholas Nassikas, a pulmonologist with Beth Israel Deaconess.
        Recommendations: ""Avoiding triggers is easier said than done when you live in a cold climate,"" Dr. Nassikas says. ""Try to do outdoor activities during warmer parts of the day. Before going outside for more than a few minutes, take a puff of a rescue inhaler. When outdoors, wear a mask, which will help reduce symptoms by warming and humidifying air before it gets into the lungs. Also, continue prescribed asthma therapies; stay away from heavy pollution, such as smoke from firepits; and avoid viral illness by washing your hands and masking around people who are sick.""
        Raynaud's disease
        Raynaud's disease is a blood vessel disorder triggered by cold environments. Instead of the normal response to cold weather, with blood vessels narrowing slightly to direct more blood and warmth to the organs, the response is exaggerated (vasospasm). ""The vessels in the fingers and toes narrow excessively upon exposure to cold. This can compromise blood flow in the affected fingers and toes, which can be painful,"" says Dr. Vasileois Kyttaris, a rheumatologist at Beth Israel Deaconess.
        Recommendations: Avoid unnecessary exposure to cold, and make sure to dress warmly outside: a coat, hat, and mittens are a must, and hand and foot warmers are a big help. Put on cold-weather gear before you step outside, and leave your coat, mittens, and hat on while you're in the freezer section of a grocery store. At home, turn up the thermostat a few degrees, and block cold air coming in through drafty doors and windows. Your doctor might also recommend a vasodilator drug to open blood vessels.
        Arthritis
        Many people with arthritis (no matter which kind) say that cold weather worsens joint pain. Is it true? ""Some people tend to have more pain and stiffness during certain weather conditions, but research on the connection is inconclusive,"" Dr. Kyttaris says.
        It's not that doctors don't believe there's a link; they just don't have enough scientific evidence for one. Or the weather may affect just some people with arthritis.
        Recommendations: If you feel cold weather makes your arthritis symptoms worse, ramp up your pill-free arthritis regimen. Use heat therapy (such as a heating pad or warm shower or bath) or wear a joint brace (such as a knee sleeve) to help reduce inflammation. Most importantly, exercise. Daily physical activity can lower inflammation and enhance blood flow; both contribute to pain relief. For more information, check out the Harvard Online Learning course Joint Pain Relief Workout.
        Finally, talk to your doctor. You may need a prescription adjustment or a new medication. Or it could be that another condition is causing pain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/can-a-weekend-warrior-exercise-regimen-protect-your-brain,"Can a ""weekend warrior"" exercise regimen protect your brain?","Exercising regularly is important for preventing dementia. But if it's hard to rack up the recommended amount of activity during the five-day work week (150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, like brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity, like swimming), consider the ""weekend warrior"" approach — fitting it all into one or two weekly sessions. The approach might offer the same brain health benefits, according to a study published online Oct. 29, 2024, by the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Researchers analyzed the health and self-reported activity information of more than 10,000 dementia-free people in Mexico who were followed for about 16 years. After accounting for factors that could influence the results, such as lifestyle habits, scientists found that weekend warriors were 13% less likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia, compared with people who didn't exercise — about the same benefit seen in those who exercised during the work week. While the study was observational and can't prove cause and effect, it supports the idea that even less frequent exercise might help protect brain health, and it might be a more convenient option for busy people.

Just how risky are these drugs?Because statins have been on the market for so long, the side effects are well known. About 10% of people develop muscle aches, which disappear when they stop taking the drug. Depending on the dose, statins also increase the risk of developing diabetes by 10% to 35%, possibly by preventing your body's insulin from working well, which causes blood sugar to rise. This side effect is most common in people with obesity and prediabetes, who are already prone to developing diabetes. Regardless, the cardiovascular benefit of a statin for these high-risk patients outweighs the risk of diabetes.","Christopher P. Cannon, MD","February 1, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-heartfelt-gift-ideas-for-valentines-day,5 heartfelt gift ideas for Valentine's Day,"On February 14 — a day symbolized by hearts and dedicated to love — give that special someone a present that shows you care. Or treat yourself to one (or more) of these five gift suggestions, all of which are designed to make it easier and more enjoyable to follow the cornerstones of a heart-healthy lifestyle: eating well, getting regular exercise, sleeping soundly, and managing stress.
        Dr. Beth Frates, a lifestyle medicine coach and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, explains why and how these gifts encourage habits that benefit the heart.
        1. A cooking class
        Making home-cooked meals is one of the best things you can do for your cardiovascular health. Research suggests that people who eat more meals made at home tend to weigh less and have healthier cholesterol and blood sugar values compared with people who eat out frequently. ""You can control the amount of saturated fat, salt, and sugar in food you make yourself. You'll also avoid the preservatives, additives, and dyes found in convenience foods like frozen dinners and other processed foods,"" says Dr. Frates.
        For people who feel they don't have the time or skills to prepare healthy food, a cooking class can help. A great place to start is a single class or series of classes about Mediterranean cooking or a similar cuisine that highlights heart-healthy ingredients: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, healthy fats like extra-virgin olive oil or canola oil, and plant-based proteins like nuts, seeds, legumes, and tofu (or fish or chicken for those who choose animal proteins).
        ""Taking cooking classes together is a wonderful way to bond, to have some fun, and to nourish your body,"" says Dr. Frates. Once you hone your skills and grow more comfortable making meals, cooking can also be a great way to express your creativity, she adds. Some restaurants, supermarkets, and cookware stores offer on-site cooking classes. Alternatively, you can check local community centers and colleges, or search online.
        2. Strawberries dipped in dark chocolate
        Both strawberries and dark chocolate contain beneficial plant compounds called flavonoids, which are thought to improve cardiovascular health by relaxing blood vessels, improving blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and discouraging blood clots. Studies have linked diets rich in flavonoids to a lower risk of heart attacks and related problems.
        ""Chocolate-dipped strawberries are a classic Valentine's Day gift, and they're also delectable,"" says Dr. Frates. Look for those made with dark chocolate, which tends to have a higher flavonoid content than milk chocolate. Better yet, buy your own high-quality dark chocolate and berries and make them yourself — or maybe even together with your valentine, she suggests.
        3. Custom-fit sneakers
        If people walk, jog, or hike in shoes that don't fit properly, they can run into problems, says Dr. Frates. For example, ill-fitting shoes can cause blisters, put pressure on bunions, or leave you vulnerable to plantar fasciitis (inflammation of the fibrous band of tissue on the bottom of the foot) and Achilles tendinitis (inflammation of the tendon connecting the calf muscle to the heel). Some experts recommend replacing your walking shoes at least every 300 to 500 miles, which translates to a new pair every six to 12 months if you regularly walk about three miles per day.
        Treat your valentine to an outing to your local specialty running store, where you'll find the best selection and expert advice about footwear options. Many running stores sell walking shoes, and you can even wear running shoes for walking. Outdoor equipment stores may be your best bet for hiking boots. It's well worth the investment of time (and the possibly higher price tag) to have a knowledgeable staff member help you select a well-fitting shoe to suit your needs. Be sure to try on several different brands and styles, and take them for a test walk or jog around the store.
        4. Luxury sleep products
        Getting at least seven hours of sleep each night is vital for cardiovascular health, says Dr. Frates. Insufficient sleep can raise your risk for weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Creating a sleep sanctuary that's quiet, dark, and comfortable can make it easier to fall and stay asleep.
        A variety of accessories and products may help improve slumber. But it's important to know the preferences of your intended recipient, so ask questions or drop hints to gather clues. Some people might like a sleep machine that provides white noise or a recording of soothing sounds, such as falling rain, croaking frogs, or chirping crickets. Other might appreciate luxurious high-thread-count sheets, a silk pillowcase, or lavender-scented bath salts for a pre-slumber soak.
        If outside lights or early morning sunlight curtails sleep time, consider light-blocking curtains or shades. An eye mask made of soft, breathable material (such as cotton or silk) is another option.
        5. A subscription to a meditation app
        Meditation and mindfulness have been shown to lower blood pressure, decrease levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and increase heart rate variability (microsecond time differences from one heartbeat to the next), all of which are linked to better heart health. ""A regular meditation practice can help you to better manage stress, which is an unavoidable part of life,"" says Dr. Frates. Because meditation doesn't come naturally to most people, guidance and coaching from an in-person or online class really helps. A more convenient option is a subscription to a meditation app that you can listen to on your smartphone at your leisure.
        Popular meditation apps include Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer, and Happier. Most offer a free trial period, so you could send sign-up links to a few that you think your valentine might enjoy, and then offer to treat them to a yearlong subscription.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/sleep-hygiene-simple-practices-for-better-rest,Sleep hygiene: Simple practices for better rest,"A good night's sleep is essential for good health and functioning. It revitalizes the mind and body, and prepares you to perform at your best the following day. Researchers define a good night's sleep in terms of quantity (not too little or too much) and quality (falling asleep quickly and staying asleep).
        But many people don't sleep the amount needed to function at their best, or they spend too much time awake during the night. According to the CDC, more than one-third of adults in the U.S. don't get enough sleep — 14.5% have trouble falling asleep and 17.8% have trouble staying asleep. Good sleep hygiene can help.
        What is sleep hygiene?
        Sleep hygiene is a set of practices and routines that help you get better sleep. Adequate, good quality sleep allows your body to experience the physical maintenance and repair, immune system boost, and emotional and cognitive renewal that sleep provides.
        Sleep hygiene encompasses:
        
          making your sleeping environment comfortable and conducive to uninterrupted sleep
          keeping a consistent sleep schedule of seven to nine hours per night for most adults
          following a bedtime routine that helps you fall asleep
          establishing daytime habits that optimize restful sleep at night
          tailoring these practices for your own best results.
        
        Expert recommendations have traditionally emphasized going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day, including weekends. Although it is healthier to sleep consistently throughout the week, a 2023 consensus statement by the National Sleep Foundation suggests that after a week with insufficient sleep, it may be beneficial to get some catch-up sleep on weekends.
        The amount of sleep we need varies by age and can be affected by each individual's unique health circumstances. The CDC offers sleep duration recommendations across the lifespan. Keep in mind that these are suggestions, and every individual may not have the same needs.
        Tips for sounder sleep
        Retiring to a comfortable environment with minimal disruptions makes it easier to fall asleep and sleep soundly. What you consume during the day and before bedtime also plays an important role.
        Create a sleep sanctuary
        
          Reduce or mask noise. Heavy curtains and rugs can help absorb sound. A sleep machine that provides white noise, or a recording of soothing sounds such as falling rain, can mask outside noise.
          Minimize light. Consider light-blocking curtains or shades if outside lights shine into your bedroom.
          Replace your mattress and pillows if they're worn or uncomfortable.
          Most people sleep better in a room that's slightly cool. Keep room temperature around 65°F to 68° F at night.
          Only use the bedroom for sleep and intimacy.
          Have children and pets sleep elsewhere.
          Keep electronic devices and anything work-related in another room.
        
        Don't let food and substances interfere with a good night's sleep
        
          Consume evening meals at least three hours before bedtime.
          Avoid alcohol in the evenings. Although alcohol can make you sleepy, after a few hours it becomes stimulating and may cause you to awaken and have difficulty falling back to sleep. It can also worsen snoring and reduces REM sleep, an important stage of sleep for cognitive function and mental health.
          Avoid caffeine after lunch if it keeps you awake at night.
          Nicotine is a stimulant. Avoid smoking, which can interfere with nighttime sleep (among many other detrimental health effects).
        
        Create a relaxing bedtime routine
        Reserve an hour before bedtime to wind down away from stressful, stimulating activities. Relaxing steps and rituals like these make it easier to fall asleep:
        
          Put away electronic devices, except if used for calming music or a guided relaxation routine.
          Read for pleasure in soft light.
          Take a warm bath.
          Do some easy stretches, progressive muscle relaxation, or deep breathing.
        
        Overcoming common barriers to good sleep hygiene
        Your actions during the day can affect your sleep that night. You can adjust your behaviors to support, rather than interfere with, nighttime sleep.
        Schedule exercise and naps to support sound sleep
        
          For many people, exercising within two hours of bedtime interferes with falling asleep. For others, evening exercise is fine. Experiment to find the exercise timing that works best for you.
          Long or late afternoon naps may interfere with falling asleep at bedtime. Sleep experts recommend naps of half an hour or less, if needed, and not too late in the day.
        
        Keep a sleep diary to identify possible obstacles
        Track the following each day for at least two weeks:
        
          time you go to bed and wake up
          medications you take
          time and amount of caffeine or alcohol consumption
          time you eat dinner and anything after that
          when and how long you exercise
          what time you put down electronic devices and stop watching TV.
        
        In the morning, note length and quality of the previous night's sleep, whether you awakened during the night, and for how long. Look for any patterns between your behaviors and your sleep duration or quality that may help you identify factors that are interfering with your sleep.
        Work with a partner
        Making changes to your daily routine can be hard to do on your own. If you live with a partner or roommates, you can help each other adopt and stick to recommendations for healthy sleep.",Jessica Solodar,"January 31, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-more-probiotics,How to get more probiotics,"Our gut does more than digest food — it's a powerhouse for overall health, from boosting immunity to supporting mental well-being. Probiotics, the ""good"" bacteria in our systems, play a key role in maintaining this balance and are essential for keeping your body and mind thriving.
        There are two ways to get more good bacteria into your gut: fermented foods and dietary supplements. Probiotic supplements, which are typically sold over the counter, are reserved to treat specific ailments as suggested by your doctor. They are not recommended for everyday use. Plus, supplements do not have the same FDA oversight as medications do.
        Fermented foods, on the other hand, are an excellent natural source of probiotics. Fermenting is one of the oldest techniques for food preservation. Foods that are fermented go through a process of lactofermentation in which natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food, creating lactic acid.
        This process creates an environment that preserves the food and promotes beneficial enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as various species of good bacteria. Another way to look at fermentation is that it takes one type of food and transforms it into another kind. For instance, cabbage becomes sauerkraut, cucumbers become pickles, soybeans turn into miso, and milk can be made into yogurt, cheeses, and sour cream.
        Not all fermented foods contain probiotics. Some foods undergo steps that remove the probiotics, as with beer or wine, or make them inactive, like baking and canning. However, most fermented foods are probiotic foods as well.
        If there is a potential downside to fermented foods, it is that their taste and smell can be quite strong, which may be unpleasant for some people. The unique flavors and textures of fermented foods are due in part to the different species of bacteria used.
        On the upside, there are many types of fermented foods from which to choose, so there is a good chance you can find something you will enjoy.
        Good probiotic food choices
        The most common fermented foods that naturally contain probiotics, or have probiotics added to them, include yogurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, pickles, miso, tempeh, kimchi, sourdough bread, and some cheeses.
        Yogurt is considered the go-to player of probiotic foods because it has a flavor and texture that are generally appealing to Western palates. The number and type of bacteria species can vary depending on the yogurt brand. The probiotic content of yogurt products can range from 90 billion to 500 billion CFU per serving. (CFU stands for colony-forming units, which is how many bacteria divide and form colonies.) Look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label.
        It's easy to add yogurt to your diet. Besides having it for breakfast or a midday snack, you can substitute yogurt whenever you use mayonnaise in egg salad or potato salad, or in almost any baking recipe. Yogurt also can be the basis for sauces, salad dressings, or marinades.
        How many probiotic foods do you need? That's not easy to answer, as there is no recommended daily intake for probiotics, so there is no way to know exactly which fermented foods or what quantity is best. Therefore, the general guideline is to just add as many fermented foods to your daily diet as possible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/malnutrition-in-older-adults-strategies-for-addressing-this-common-problem,Malnutrition in older adults: Strategies for addressing this common problem,"As people age, a variety of factors can make it more challenging to eat a healthy, balanced diet. Over time, this can lead to malnutrition.
        What is malnutrition and how common is it in older adults?
        Older adults may need fewer calories each day compared to a younger person, but have similar or even increased nutrient needs.
        Malnutrition occurs when someone is not consuming enough important nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. As a result, their body cannot function well. Malnutrition can affect a person's ability to participate in everyday activities and can negatively impact their quality of life. Someone who is malnourished is more likely to experience physical and mental decline and have a higher risk of serious illness.
        You can't always tell if someone is malnourished by looking at them. Malnourished older adults may be underweight or overweight. For example, someone who is obese may be eating enough calories but not the key nutrients they need to stay healthy.
        In the U.S., malnutrition in older adults is surprisingingly common. According to a study in The Lancet, in the U.S., about one in four adults ages 65 and older are malnourished or at risk for malnutrition.
        Why are older adults vulnerable to malnutrition?
        Malnutrition in older adults may result from a variety of physical, psychological, social, and practical factors:
        
          poor appetite due to a health condition or medication side effects
          trouble chewing or swallowing, often due to dental or oral motor problems
          cognitive decline
          depression
          altered or diminished sense of smell or taste
          lack of motivation to cook after a spouse passes away
          being unable to get to a grocery store or cook for oneself
          not being able to afford healthy foods
          isolation.
        
        Signs and symptoms of malnutrition in older adults
        Warning signs and symptoms of malnutrition include:
        
          muscle weakness
          feeling tired
          irritability or depression
          having less of an appetite
          unplanned weight loss
          dental problems
          easy bruising
          frequent illness or infection.
        
        Some people experience a reduced sense of thirst as they age. Dehydration, which is caused by not drinking enough fluids, is closely related to malnutrition, and the two can occur together. Drinking plenty of water each day is important to avoid dehydration, constipation, and urinary tract infections.
        How malnutrition affects health and well-being
        Some of the health problems that result from malnutrition include:
        
          higher risk of heart disease, cancer, and osteoporosis (fragile bones)
          loss of muscle mass
          longer recovery from illness or surgery
          higher risk of infection
          slower wound healing.
        
        If you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of malnutrition, talk to your doctor. There are special tests to evaluate whether someone is at risk for or suffering from malnutrition. One quick test, the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) looks at dietary intake, weight loss, mobility, psychological stress, and body mass index (BMI).
        Strategies and solutions for healthful eating
        Treating malnutrition entails not simply eating more, but eating more healthy foods. The USDA website has nutrition tips and information on dietary needs for people ages 60 years and older.
        The following practical tips can help overcome some of the obstacles that may be interfering with proper nutrition:
        
          Prepare large quantities of foods, stews, and soups, and load your freezer with individual portions that can be easily reheated.
          If you don't like to cook alone, try cooking with a friend.
          See a dentist if you are having trouble chewing.
          Add herbs and spices to your food if you have a reduced sense of smell or taste.
          If you have trouble swallowing, drink plenty of liquids with each meal. (Also let your doctor know so that they can work with you to identify the cause of the swallowing difficulty.)
          If you don't have much appetite, eat smaller meals and add a couple of nutritious snacks or meal replacement shakes during the day.
          Look into meals offered at nearby senior centers or religious facilities. This can help with issues related to isolation.
        
        Ask your doctor about working with a nutritionist who has experience with malnutrition in older adults.
        If the act of cooking has become too difficult, your doctor can recommend an occupational therapist, who can help you find ways to make food preparation and mealtime easier.
        Treating underlying depression, if present, can also help improve appetite.
        Community resources for meal delivery
        If it's hard to get out to shop for food, many stores will deliver grocery orders at little or no charge. There also are senior markets, food pantries, and food banks. Feeding America offers a website where seniors can find these free food distribution services.
        Meals on Wheels America is a network of 5,000 community-based programs that deliver nutritious meals to nearly 2.2 million seniors annually, for free or at very low cost, depending on income.
        If affording healthy food is a problem, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest federal food assistance program. It can be a lifeline for older adults, helping them buy the food they need to maintain good health.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","January 24, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/myths-and-truths-about-vitamin-c,Myths and truths about vitamin C,"Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a powerful micronutrient that plays a key role in keeping your body healthy. Here we'll explore some myths and truths about this vital micronutrient.

What does vitamin C do in the body?

Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient, important to many functions in the body. Vitamin C plays a key role in creating collagen, a protein essential for maintaining healthy skin, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels, as well as for repairing wounds and forming scar tissue. The vitamin also helps maintain strong bones, cartilage, and teeth. In addition, it boosts the body's ability to absorb iron from plant-based foods.

Vitamin C plays a key role in supporting the immune system. A powerful antioxidant, vitamin C neutralizes free radicals — unstable molecules that can damage cells and contribute to aging and diseases like cancer and heart disease. The micronutrient is also involved in producing neurotransmitters that help nerve cells communicate.

How much vitamin C do you need?

The human body cannot make vitamin C, so it must be obtained through a person's diet or from supplements.

The amount of vitamin C you need each day depends on your age, sex, and life stage.

You may need more or less vitamin C depending on specific health conditions or lifestyle factors.

Dangers of too much vitamin C

Vitamin C is generally safe. But taking too much — more than 2,000 milligrams (mg) per day — can cause unpleasant side effects due to the body's inability to absorb excessive amounts. Common issues include diarrhea, nausea, and stomach cramps.

Rarely, high doses of vitamin C may contribute to kidney stones, especially in individuals with kidney disorders. Excessive supplementation during pregnancy can affect a baby's vitamin C levels after birth. There are also concerns about high vitamin C intake in individuals with specific health conditions, such as iron overload disorder or hereditary hemochromatosis.

Can vitamin C prevent colds or shorten the duration of colds?

The idea that vitamin C can prevent colds became popular in the 1970s, but research has largely debunked this myth. While taking vitamin C regularly doesn't appear to reduce the chances of catching a cold, some evidence suggests it might slightly shorten the duration of a cold or lessen the severity of cold symptoms.

For most people, maintaining a balanced diet with adequate vitamin C is sufficient to keep the immune system healthy without taking high-dose supplements.

Does vitamin C reduce the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease?

The relationship between vitamin C and heart health remains unclear. Some large observational studies suggest that higher intakes of vitamin C — especially from fruits and vegetables — may be associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke, likely due to its antioxidant properties, which protect blood vessels and reduce plaque buildup.

However, clinical trials testing vitamin C supplements have not shown consistent benefits in preventing or reducing heart disease. While some evidence points to a protective effect, other studies do not.

As a result, there is no specific recommendation to take more than the daily recommended amount of vitamin C for heart health.

What are some health benefits of vitamin C?

Vitamin C offers some probable health benefits, while others are less certain. For example:


	Immune function. As an antioxidant, vitamin C supports the immune system by protecting cells from free radical damage and enhancing the body's natural defenses.



	Eye health. Vitamin C is included in the dietary supplement that was shown in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) trials to prevent progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to its most damaging form. But taking vitamin C supplements has not been demonstrated to lower the chance of developing AMD overall. Higher dietary intake of vitamin C is linked to a reduced risk of cataracts. However, vitamin C supplement use has shown mixed results, with some studies even suggesting an increased risk of cataracts at high doses.
	Cancer. Epidemiological studies have shown diets that include lots of fruits and vegetables are associated with a lower risk of several cancers. This may be due, in part, to the foods' vitamin C content. However, studies on vitamin C supplementation alone have not consistently shown a reduced cancer risk.
	Cardiovascular health. Vitamin C supplements might have a modest effect on blood pressure. But clinical trials of vitamin C supplements have largely failed to demonstrate significant benefits in preventing or reducing cardiovascular events.
	General antioxidant benefits. As a key antioxidant, vitamin C neutralizes free radicals, slowing down oxidative stress that contributes to aging and various chronic diseases, such as arthritis and neurodegenerative conditions.


Good food sources of vitamin C

Vitamin C is abundant in many fruits and vegetables, making it easy to meet your daily requirements through a balanced diet.

Fruits high in vitamin C:


	citrus fruits: oranges, grapefruits, lemons, and limes
	berries: strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and cranberries
	tropical fruits: kiwi, mango, papaya, and pineapple
	melons: cantaloupe and watermelon
	tomatoes.


Vegetables rich in vitamin C:


	cruciferous vegetables: broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower
	peppers: green and red bell peppers
	leafy greens: spinach, cabbage, turnip greens, and other leafy vegetables
	root vegetables: sweet potatoes and white potatoes
	winter squash.


Some cereals, beverages, and processed foods are fortified with vitamin C.

Tips for maximizing vitamin C in your diet

A few simple facts can help you get even more vitamin C from your diet.


	
	
		Vitamin C content is highest in fresh, raw fruits and vegetables.
		Cooking, especially boiling, can reduce vitamin C levels. Opt for steaming or microwaving to minimize nutrient loss.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-could-be-causing-your-itchy-scalp,What could be causing your itchy scalp?,"An itchy scalp can be distracting, disruptive, and even embarrassing. To start down the path to relief, it helps to understand what could be causing your itchy scalp.

Common causes of an itchy scalp

There are a number of different reasons your scalp might be itchy, from simple dry skin to infection, irritation, or infestation.

Dry scalp

An itchy scalp often results from something benign, like dry skin. This is especially common in the winter and in cold, dry climates. Dry scalp treatment can involve taking a break from certain shampoos or other hair products, which might be irritating your scalp by stripping away too much of the natural oils your scalp usually produces. Look for shampoos labeled ""moisturizing"" or ""gentle,"" which might be less irritating.

Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis

An itchy scalp that also feels dry and produces white flakes on your hair or clothing could be dandruff, which is considered a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis. Seborrheic dermatitis is an inflammatory condition that can occur anywhere on the body that produces oil, such as the scalp.

Over-the-counter dandruff shampoos may help relieve the itchiness if you have a mild case. If that doesn't clear up your symptoms, your doctor might give you a prescription-strength dandruff treatment shampoo, antifungal creams or foams, or topical corticosteroids to apply to your scalp.

Allergic reactions and sensitivities

Shampoo or other hair products can contain irritants or allergens that cause itchiness and a rash. This is more common in people who dye their hair. The only solution if you're allergic or sensitive to something on your scalp is stop using the product triggering your symptoms.

If you're having trouble narrowing down the problem product, keep a symptom journal and talk to your primary care provider or a dermatologist. They can help you figure out which hair products you might need to avoid.

Atopic dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis is a type of eczema that can result in red, itchy, scaly skin, including on your scalp. Washing your hair too often in hot water can make your symptoms worse, as can scrubbing your hair and scalp too aggressively. Your doctor will likely prescribe a corticosteroid cream or other topical treatment to apply directly on your scalp.

Fungal infection (tinea capitis)

If your scalp is itchy and you also notice pus-filled bumps and hair loss, you could have a type of fungal infection called tinea capitis, also known as scalp ringworm. This infection is known for its intense itch. The fungi that cause scalp ringworm thrive in warm, damp areas like a sweaty scalp, especially if you don't wash your hair often. You'll need to take prescription oral medication for up to two months to clear the infection, so see your doctor as soon as possible. Medicated shampoo may help address symptoms while you wait for the oral meds to kick in.

Head lice

Head lice are tiny insects that live in human hair. The most common sign you may have a head lice infestation is an itchy scalp, caused by the bites of the lice. Despite the stigma surrounding lice, personal hygiene is not to blame. Lice spread easily from person to person. Getting rid of head lice is a process that requires using medicated shampoos or lotions, and carefully, repeatedly combing the lice and eggs out of your hair for at least two weeks.

Hives

Notice a red, itchy rash on your scalp that comes on quickly and disappears shortly after? You might have hives, a reaction to food, medicine, allergens, stress, sweat, or another trigger. If your hives don't disappear on their own, you can try taking an oral antihistamine to calm the itchiness. If your hives last a long time, your doctor might prescribe an oral medication to treat your symptoms.

Scalp psoriasis

Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that causes painful, itchy, and sometimes silvery, scaly patches of skin known as plaques. About half of people with psoriasis develop plaques on their scalp, which can be confused with dandruff. Your doctor might recommend treatment with over-the-counter salicylic acid, psoriasis shampoos, steroid creams, light therapy, or some combination of these treatments.

When to see a doctor for an itchy scalp

With so many possible causes, it's not always easy to determine what's causing your itchy scalp. Discuss your symptoms with your primary care doctor or a dermatologist if you're having trouble determining what's making you scratch.

Also talk to a doctor if over-the-counter treatments or home remedies don't help, or if the itch gets worse or becomes painful.",Sarah Klein,"January 21, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/gum-disease-and-heart-health-probing-the-link,Gum disease and heart health: Probing the link,"About two-thirds of people over 65 have gum disease — more formally known as periodontal disease. It starts when plaque, a sticky film of bacteria and food, builds up around the teeth. In its earliest stage, gingivitis, irritated gums can bleed easily. Left untreated, periodontal disease can worsen and, in its most severe form, cause the teeth to loosen and fall out.
        Compared with people who have healthy gums, people with periodontal disease are about twice as likely to have a heart attack. Shared risk factors — including smoking, an unhealthy diet, or lack of access to health and dental care — may explain some of this association. However, some bacterial and viral infections also appear to increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. And growing evidence suggests that bacteria and inflammation may underlie the link between the mouth and the heart.
        ""Your mouth is a gateway to the rest of your body, so it's not surprising that your oral health can affect your overall health and vice versa,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, a prosthodontist in the Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
        Hundreds of different types of bacteria occur naturally in the mouth. Some, fed by sugars, release acids that break down the outer layer of your teeth, causing cavities. Other types of bacteria form plaque that — if not removed by regular brushing and flossing — hardens into tartar, Dr. Jiang explains. Only a professional dental cleaning can remove these hard, calcified deposits.
        
          
            
              
                Signs of gum disease
                If you experience any of these signs, you may have periodontal disease:
                
                  swollen, red, or tender gums
                  gums that bleed easily
                  pus between the teeth and gums
                  bad breath
                  buildup of hard yellow or brown deposits along the gum line
                  teeth that are moving apart or loose
                  dental appliances no longer fit well.
                
              
            
          
        
        Bacteria on the move?
        The bacteria responsible for periodontal disease can travel to blood vessels throughout the body. In fact, periodontal bacteria have been found in the fatty debris (atherosclerosis) that clogs arteries located far from the mouth — and in blood clots from people who have experienced heart attacks.
        ""In both gum disease and heart disease, we find bacteria in places where they're not supposed to be,"" says Dr. Jiang. The body's immune response to these misplaced bacteria triggers an outpouring of white blood cells. The resulting inflammation may lead to tiny clots and cause a heart attack or stroke.
        In addition, many factors linked to a higher risk of heart disease—diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity — are all more common in people with periodontal disease, according to a 2021 review article about oral health and cardiovascular disease in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology.
        One way to treat periodontal disease is for dentists and hygienists to use manual scalers or ultrasound devices to scrape away tartar above and below the gum line. Known as scaling and root planing, this deep cleaning is more extensive than the twice-yearly cleanings people typically get at the dentist. But while treating periodontal disease may help bring down levels of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream, there's limited evidence it can reduce heart attacks or other cardiovascular problems.
        Preventing periodontal disease
        To prevent gum disease, daily brushing and flossing is essential — and can even reverse gingivitis before it worsens. If you've slacked off on your flossing, you may notice a little bleeding when you start up again, says Dr. Jiang. When that happens, some people get nervous and stop flossing. But don't worry; just get back into the habit and chances are the bleeding will improve within a few days, she advises. If it doesn't, and you notice other signs of gum disease (see box), schedule an appointment with your dentist.
        A healthy diet can also help, says Dr. Jiang. Most people know that hard or chewy candy and other sticky sweets promote cavities. But sugary drinks like sodas (especially if you sip them throughout the day) also feed the bacteria that cause cavities and gum disease. ""That's also true for refined carbohydrates that stick to your teeth, like crackers and breads made with white flour,"" says Dr. Jiang. What's more, a sugary diet is itself associated with higher heart disease risk.

A new blanket might help,"Weighted blankets have long been used for certain conditions. They may provide benefits for people with insomnia and anxiety, but research is scarce.

        Some people count sheep at night. You count worries. If you often find yourself lying awake at night, staring at the ceiling, you may be looking for solutions to help you get back to sleep. One approach that doesn't involve drugs or doctors is weighted blankets.
        These blankets look like regular blankets, but they're filled with plastic beads or pellets to make them heavier. They typically weigh from 3 pounds to upwards of 20 pounds. Companies are marketing them as a solution for insomnia as well as nighttime anxiety and stress reduction. And people are buying. Sales of the blankets have surged in the past two years.
        The use of weight in therapy
        The idea of using weight as a calming strategy does have some basis in current medical practice.

Weighted blankets have been around for a long time, especially for kids with autism or behavioral disturbances. It is one of the sensory tools commonly used in psychiatric units. Patients who are in distress may choose different types of sensory activities — holding a cold object, smelling particular aromas, manipulating dough, building objects, doing arts and crafts — to try to calm down.
        The blankets are supposed to work much the same way tight swaddling helps newborns feel snug and secure so they can doze off more quickly. The blanket basically simulates a comforting hug, in theory helping to calm and settle the nervous system.
        Companies that sell the blankets typically recommend that you buy one that weighs approximately 10% of your body weight, which would mean a 15-pound blanket for a 150-pound person.
        Weighing down anxiety
        The question is, do they really work? While some people swear by these blankets, concrete evidence is unfortunately lacking. There are really no definitive scientific studies to back up the claims. A randomized clinical trial to test the blankets would be very difficult. A blind comparison is impossible because people can automatically tell if the blanket is heavy or not. And it's unlikely that somebody would sponsor such a study.
        Should you use a weighted blanket?
        While there is no robust evidence that weighted blankets are truly effective, for most healthy adults, there are likely few risks to trying one — other than price. Most weighted blankets cost at least $100 and often more than $200.
        There are certain people who should not use a weighted blanket or should check with their doctors before doing so, including people with
        
          
            sleep apnea
          
          
            certain other sleep disorders
          
          
            respiratory problems or other chronic medical conditions.
          
        
        Also, check in with your doctor or a trained therapist if you are interested in trying a weighted blanket for a child.
        If you do decide to try a weighted blanket, be realistic about your expectations and realize that results may vary.
        Blankets may be of help for anxiety or insomnia. But just as swaddling works for some babies and not others, weighted blankets won't be a miracle treatment for everyone.
        Is there a better option?
        In addition, keep in mind there may be better, evidence-based solutions out there for your sleep struggles, particularly when it comes to chronic insomnia, which is defined as having trouble falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week for three months or more.
        For insomnia, a first-line recommendation is a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and relaxation techniques, practices that are supported by evidence from controlled trials.
        CBT is typically administered in a four- to 10-week program that helps you make lasting changes to your sleep habits, including limiting the amount of time you spend in bed. This helps to train you to avoid being in bed unless you are sleeping. CBT can be challenging and typically works best when performed by a professional.",Unknown,"January 16, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/overcome-your-fear-factor,Overcome your fear factor,"Fear and worry got you down? Here's how to calm these feelings.
        
        
          
        
        Have you grown more worried and fearful about life over the years? You aren't alone. Research has shown that feelings of fear, general anxiety, and nervousness tend to rise with age.
        These negative feelings can manifest in many ways. You could be more concerned about your financial future, the risk of a new or returning health problem or injury, or as the recent COVID-19 pandemic has shown, changes in world events.
        People become more fearful about daily life because they worry a setback will come at any time, and it's something they can't control.
        
          
            
              
                Tell worry to take a walk
                Need a mental break from fear or worry? Take a mindful walk during which you focus on your body awareness, movement, breathing, and surroundings. It is a simple way to refresh your mind and be more present. One study found that people who did 30 minutes of mindful walking twice a week for four weeks had less stress and better quality of life.
              
            
          
        
        A cumulative effect
        It's not clear what drives this mindset. Researchers speculate it could be a combination of biological changes in the aging brain along with the cumulative effects of unhappy life experiences, either your own or those of someone close to you.
        These ongoing feelings of fear and worry can have a deep impact on your health. You may become less active and less social, both of which can contribute to frailty, heart disease, and depression.
         If not addressed, constant fear and worry may progress to a specific disorder, such as social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia (fear of public places), or generalized anxiety disorder (chronic worrying that may lead to physical problems like chest pain and muscle fatigue).
        What to do
        There are many ways to address constant fear and worry so they do not consume your life. The first step is to identify your fear's source. The right treatment begins with recognition. Often, people cannot articulate why they are fearful or worry too much, and why it's happening.
        Consider meeting with a psychiatrist or therapist. A professional analysis can help pinpoint where your specific worries and fears may lie.
        After that, the two of you work together to create strategies that address those fears. These could include one-on-one or group therapy sessions, relaxation training exercises, or cognitive behavioral therapy (in which you learn to reframe your response to your fearful thoughts).
        Once you are aware of your specific fears and when they typically arise, you can take other means to manage them. For example:
        Practice mindfulness. Mindfulness trains your mind's attention to be more present without drifting into concerns about the past or future. This mindset helps you not to overreact to fearful thoughts and reduce any stress, depression, or anxiety that accompanies them.
        Meditation is a popular way to learn mindfulness. The goal of meditation is not to push aside or block fearful thinking, but rather to notice your thoughts and feelings and realize that you don't have to act on them. This could be as simple as closing your eyes and repeating a single phrase or word, or counting breaths.
        Consult a financial expert. If money issues worry you, meet with a financial planner or adviser. He or she can do a thorough review of your financials, create or adjust your budget, focus on specific concerns, and help set goals. This can help you feel more confident about your situation and address any issues that may trigger worry.
        Hire a personal trainer. If you avoid activity or exercise because you fear injury, hire a personal trainer who specializes in older adult conditioning. A trainer can assess your current fitness, identify strengths and weaknesses, and develop a program to help you improve.
        Because you will see and feel your physical improvements as you progress, this will help you overcome fear of injury and the worry that you can't exercise or be more active. You can realize that you are more than capable of being active than you think. Look for trainers with specialized certification from organizations like the American Council on Exercise or the National Academy of Sports Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/got-a-hangnail-heres-what-to-do,Got a hangnail? Here's what to do,"Hangnails are small, but they can be surprisingly annoying and even painful. They often appear when the skin around your nails becomes dry, cracked, or damaged. While most hangnails are harmless and can be treated at home, they can sometimes lead to infections if not properly cared for.
        What is a hangnail?
        A hangnail is a small, torn piece of skin that appears at the edge of a fingernail. Despite its name, a hangnail isn't part of the nail itself but instead a sliver of skin that can peel away from the nail's edge. Hangnails are common and can be painful, especially if they snag on something or get infected.
        Why do hangnails happen?
        Hangnails often form when the skin around your nails becomes dry and damaged. Common causes include cold weather, frequent hand washing, or exposure to harsh chemicals. People who bite their nails or pick at their skin may also be more likely to get hangnails. Hangnails can also happen if you have brittle nails or if your hands are in water a lot, as they might be when washing dishes.
        Treating hangnails at home
        Hangnails can often be managed simply at home. Here's how:
        
          Soak your fingers. Start by soaking your fingers in warm, soapy water for about 10 minutes to soften the skin.
          Trim carefully. Using sanitized nail clippers or small scissors, gently trim the hangnail close to the skin. You might be tempted to pull out the raised piece of skin, but that's something you should avoid. Tearing the skin can cause further damage at the base and increase your risk of developing an infection in the cuticle.
          Apply moisturizer. Use a fragrance-free moisturizing cream or a bit of petroleum jelly to keep the skin around your nails moisturized. Another option is to use a small amount of over-the-counter antibacterial ointment such as bacitracin.
          Bandage if needed. If the area is sore or bleeding, cover with a bandage to protect it from infection until it heals.
        
        How to prevent hangnails
        The best way to prevent hangnails is to keep the skin around your nails healthy and hydrated. These skin and nail care tips can help:
        
          Maintain clean, dry, and hydrated skin. Wash your hands and feet with gentle cleansers, ensuring they are thoroughly dried afterward. Use moisturizers daily and reapply them after each time you wash your hands. Use a fragrance-free hand cream or cuticle oil to keep your skin soft.
          Don't bite your nails. Biting your nails or picking at the skin around them can lead to tears and infection. Instead, trim your nails carefully with a clean tool and avoid cutting your cuticles.
          Protect your hands by wearing gloves. For activities like dishwashing, layer cotton gloves beneath waterproof gloves, such as vinyl ones. Use protective gloves while cleaning, gardening, or spending time outdoors in cold weather.
          Prioritize nail care. Trim your nails straight across using sharp nail clippers or scissors. Use an emery board to slightly round the tips and smooth out any rough edges or snags. Avoid using your nails as tools — for example, don't use a nail to pry open a soda can.
        
        When to see a doctor for a hangnail
        Most hangnails heal on their own with home care. However, when the protective barrier of skin around the nail is damaged, it can let in bacteria that can cause an infection. This is known as acute paronychia. Signs of infection include:
        
          Redness: The skin around the nail becomes red and inflamed.
          Swelling: The affected area may appear puffy or swollen.
          Pain or tenderness: The area around the nail may feel sore or painful, especially when touched.
          Warmth: The infected skin may feel warm to the touch.
          Pus: A pocket of yellow or white fluid (pus) may form near the nail if the infection progresses.
        
        If you notice these symptoms, it's a good idea to seek medical attention, especially if the infection doesn't improve or worsens. Infected hangnails can be painful. And left untreated, the infection can spread to other parts of your finger.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","January 15, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-retinoids-really-reduce-wrinkles,Do retinoids really reduce wrinkles?,"Topical vitamin A–based drugs called retinoids—the most used and most studied anti-aging compounds— may reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Tretinoin, under the brand name Retin-A, was the first retinoid. It was used as an acne treatment in the 1970s, but researchers later discovered that it also fades actinic keratosis spots, evens pigmentation, and speeds the turnover of superficial skin cells.
        Retinoids reduce fine lines and wrinkles by increasing the production of collagen. They also stimulate the production of new blood vessels in the skin, which improves skin color. Additional benefits include fading age spots and softening rough patches of skin. However, it takes three to six months of regular use before improvements in wrinkles are apparent—and the best results take six to 12 months.
        Because retinoids can cause skin dryness and irritation, doctors often recommend using them only every other day at first and then gradually working up to nightly applications. Wear a sunscreen during the day because retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight. These drugs must be used continually to maintain their benefits.
        Tretinoin (Retin-A, generic), tazarotene (Avage, Tazorac), and adapalene (Differin) are prescription retinoids. Adapalene is also available over the counter (in a 0.1% formulation versus the 0.3% prescription version). Other retinoids are undergoing clinical trials.
        In addition, several over-the-counter products containing retinoids, such as retinol, are available. Because they're not as strong (and thus less irritating), they are not as effective in reducing wrinkles as tretinoin; but they do improve the appearance of photo-aged skin. Tretinoin can be used with alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) for additional skin-smoothing effects.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/brain-health-rests-on-heart-health-guidelines-for-lifestyle-changes-202206291895,Brain health rests on heart health: Guidelines for lifestyle changes,"Dementia affects millions of people and millions more of their caregivers — staggering numbers that are projected to triple by 2050.
        In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a strategic public health action plan, including compiling an organized database of quality dementia research and creating guidelines for the prevention of dementia.
        Dementia is a progressive, heartbreaking deterioration of brain functioning associated with aging. While there are different causes, the most common — Alzheimer's and vascular dementias — are now thought to be closely related to, and greatly impacted by, the same diet and lifestyle factors.
        Your diet and lifestyle can lower your risk of dementia
        Several key protective health habits are highly recommended:
        Regular physical activity — any activity, for at least 150 minutes per week, is number one on the list of evidence-based actions you can take. Exercise clearly lowers the risk of dementia, even Alzheimer's. People who regularly exercise are less likely to develop dementia of any kind, and this stands even for adults with mild cognitive impairment.
        Eating a plant-based diet is crucial. There is substantial research evidence showing that eating a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and seafood is associated with a significantly lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia. This approach to eating is often referred to as the Mediterranean-style diet, but it can be adapted to any culture or cuisine.
        The WHO also recommends avoiding toxic, inflammatory foods like processed grains (white flour, white rice), added sugar, sodium, and saturated fats like butter and fatty meat. It's important to note that the WHO does not recommend taking any vitamins or supplements for brain health, because there is no solid evidence showing that these have any effect whatsoever. Just eat a healthy plant-based diet and avoid unhealthy foods as much as possible.
        The WHO also issues strong recommendations to avoid or quit smoking and to minimize alcohol use, especially in those who already have cognitive concerns.
        They mention additional lifestyle factors that have less evidence but may also help: getting enough good sleep, positive relationships, and social engagement have been shown to protect cognition.
        What's fascinating about these dementia prevention guidelines is how similar they are to those for heart disease prevention.
        How is heart health related to cognitive health?
        We have long known that the diseases and conditions that clog the arteries of the heart also clog the arteries of the rest of the body, including the brain. It all boils down to damage of the arteries, the blood vessels that are critical for blood flow and oxygen delivery to the organs. Arterial damage leads to arterial blockages, which lead to heart disease and heart attacks, strokes, peripheral vascular disease, and vascular dementia.
        Meanwhile, Alzheimer's disease used to be thought of as a different process, because the brains of people with Alzheimer's seemed to be full of tangled tube-shaped proteins (neurofibrillary tangles). However, more and more research is linking Alzheimer's dementia to the same risk factors that cause heart disease, strokes, peripheral vascular disease, and vascular dementias: obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.
        The evidence is substantial: studies show that people with these risk factors are significantly more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, studies also show that people with Alzheimer's disease have significantly reduced brain blood flow, and autopsy studies show that brains affected by Alzheimer's can also have significant vascular damage.
        Researchers are now focusing on why this is — what is the connection? It appears that good brain blood flow is key for clearing those tubular proteins that can accumulate and become tangled in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, and so one solid hypothesis is that anything that reduces brain blood flow can increase the risk for Alzheimer's, and conversely, anything that increases blood flow can reduce the risk for Alzheimer's.
        What's the take-home message?
        Even if someone has a family history of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's dementia, and even if they already have mild cognitive impairment (forgetfulness, confusion), they can still reduce their risk of developing dementia by simply living a heart-healthy lifestyle. That means a minimum of 150 minutes per week of activity; a plant-based diet aiming for at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily; avoiding toxic foods like processed grains, added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats; avoiding or quitting smoking; and curbing alcohol use.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ease-anxiety-and-stress-take-a-belly-breather-201904261861,Ease anxiety and stress: Take a (belly) breather,"Quick: think of three things that make you feel anxious or stressed. Most of us have no trouble reeling off answers. And people who suffer from anxiety disorders — such as social anxiety, phobias, or generalized anxiety — may have a variety of triggers that send anxiety soaring. While belly breathing alone can't fix deep-seated anxieties, it works well as a tool to help ease anxiety and garden-variety stress. Regularly engaging in belly breathing (or trying the mini strategy described below) can help you turn a fight-or-flight response into a relaxation response that's beneficial to your health.
        How should you breathe?
        You take up to 23,000 breaths per day, so make sure you do it right.
        How should you breathe? Like a sleeping child, says Dr. Katherine Rosa of the Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. ""If you ever watch children sleep, they all breathe from the belly and not the chest. This relaxed state is the more normal way to breathe.""
        Yet most people are chest breathers, which is how we react to stress. When we sense a threat, our fight-or-flight response automatically kicks in. We breathe at a rapid pace to suck in extra oxygen, to fuel our heart and muscles so we can flee the danger.
        Of course, we don't need our fight-or-flight response to escape predators anymore. Our threats now come from the stress of emails, personal confrontations, daily news, and traffic jams.
        ""Your fight-or-flight response is meant to be a short-term reaction that comes and goes,"" says Dr. Rosa. ""But today, we are surrounded by so many stressors that we constantly stay in this state of tension. It doesn't turn off, and we often don't even notice it."" The result: we have become a nation of chest breathers.
        Feel it in your belly
        One way to change our reaction to modern stress is to learn how to belly breathe instead of chest breathe. Belly breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, which runs from the head down the neck, through the chest, and to the colon. This activates your relaxation response, reducing your heart rate and blood pressure and lowering stress levels.
        If you are not familiar with belly breathing, try this exercise: sit in a chair, lean forward, and place your elbows on your knees. Then breathe naturally. ""This position forces you to breathe from the belly, so you know what the sensation feels like,"" says Dr. Rosa.
        A mini strategy to ease anxiety and stress
        A strategy to teach yourself mindful belly breathing is to practice what Dr. Rosa calls ""the mini."" Here's what you do: every time you feel stressed, simply take three slow and controlled deep belly breaths. ""It's a simple act, but this interrupts the fight-or-flight response and puts it on pause,"" says Dr. Rosa. ""Over time, belly breathing can buffer your resistance to your fight-or-flight response, so you are not as sensitive to stress triggers.""
        To help you be more mindful about your breathing pattern, place one hand on your belly and the other on your chest. ""You want the chest hand to be still and the belly hand to move out like you are blowing up a balloon,"" says Dr. Rosa.
        She suggests practicing belly breathing throughout the day, like once every hour or up to 10 to 15 times per day. ""As it becomes more of a habit, you can automatically engage belly breathing whenever you face a stressful event.""",Matthew Solan,"January 10, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/thinking-about-becoming-a-pescatarian-what-you-should-know-about-the-pescatarian-diet,Thinking about becoming a pescatarian? What you should know about the pescatarian diet,"If you're trying to eat a plant-based diet but finding it hard to rule out meaty foods altogether, a pescatarian diet might be a good option to consider.
        ""From a practical point of view,"" says Dr. Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, ""it's easier for people to follow in the longer term than a strict vegetarian diet.""
        What is a pescatarian diet?
        The term pescatarian (coined by combining pesce (Italian for fish) and vegetarian is a clue: it's a vegetarian diet that also includes seafood. Some 3% of American adults say they are pescatarians, according to a 2020 Economist/YouGov survey.
        What you can eat on a pescatarian diet — and what to avoid
        The pescatarian diet is primarily a plant-based dietary pattern. This eating pattern is generally understood to mean eating like an ovo-lacto-vegetarian — consuming a variety of vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, as well as eggs and dairy products — plus fish and shellfish.
        Pescatarians don't eat any meat or poultry. The reasons for this choice vary. It may be for religious reasons, concerns about their personal health, animal welfare, wanting to have less of an impact on the environment, or simply personal preferences.
        Does the pescatarian diet have health benefits?
        One of the main health benefits of being a pescatarian comes from avoiding red meat and processed meat. High intakes of these foods have been linked to higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers, as well as a shorter lifespan.
        Adding fish to a vegetarian diet can also help fill in any nutrition gaps, says Dr. Hu. Besides being excellent sources of protein and vitamin D, ""fish and seafood provide nutrients that may be missing or more challenging to get in a strict vegetarian diet, like vitamin B12, iron, selenium, and zinc.""
        And by switching from omnivore to pescatarian, you'll likely eat more fiber- and nutrient-rich plant-based foods — healthier for you and the planet, Hu adds. The pescatarian diet nicely complements other healthy eating plans, such as the Mediterranean diet.
        A healthy-fat bonus for the heart and brain
        Fatty fish like salmon, sardines, herring, and mackerel are great sources of omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats that have long been linked to better heart and blood vessel health. (Leaner fish such as cod, sole, and flounder, and shellfish like clams, provide plenty of nutrients but contain less omega-3 fats than fatty fish.) The American Heart Association recommends eating fish at least twice a week, particularly fatty fish.
        The omega-3 fatty acids in fish may also have benefits for brain health. Research suggests that people who eat fish at least twice a week may have a lower risk of developing vascular brain diseases, such as stroke, compared with those who eat little or no fish. And recent findings from the long-term Seventh Day Adventist Study reported that while people who followed any kind of vegetarian diet tended to live longer than meat eaters, the longevity boost was even greater for pescatarians — who also had lower risk of developing strokes, dementia, or Parkinson's disease in their later years compared with strict vegetarians. (The Seventh Day Adventist Study counted pescatarians as a type of vegetarian.)
        Are there potential drawbacks to a pescatarian diet?
        In general, choosing fish over meat or poultry is better for the environment, as it generates fewer greenhouse gas emissions getting to your table. But much depends on how the fish is caught and how the fisheries are managed, with some species dangerously overfished.
        Also a concern: nearly all fish contain at least traces of methylmercury, a contaminant that can harm the brain and nervous system. The highest levels are found in longer-lived, larger fish like swordfish, shark, and orange roughy, so the FDA recommends eating them only rarely — and that pregnant and breastfeeding women and young children avoid them altogether.
        You can avoid both these issues, says Hu, by thinking small. ""Small fish like anchovies and sardines — and shellfish like scallops, oysters, and mussels — have much less of an environmental impact"" than big fish, he explains. ""They're also very tasty, and have a much lower chance of having mercury and other contaminants.""
        When you buy fish, look for those produced sustainably — and choose stores that are transparent about where their fish comes from. Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch recommendations can help.
        Easy, healthy pescatarian meal ideas
        Here are some easy ways to add fish to your menu:
        
          Shake up Taco Tuesday with fish or shrimp tacos.
          Top a salad or pasta with sardines or cooked crabmeat.
          Add scallops or shrimp to your stir-fries.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/is-it-too-late-to-save-your-posture,Is it too late to save your posture?,"Rounded shoulders and a hunched stance may seem like they're set in stone by the time we reach a certain age, and you may feel you've missed the boat for better posture. But there's a good chance you can still stand up taller.
        It's not as hard as you may think. Better posture is often just a matter of changing your activities and strengthening your muscles.
        What causes posture problems?
        Poor posture often stems from modern-day habits like working in front of a computer, slouching on a couch while watching TV, or looking down at a smartphone. Poor posture could also be due to many hours spent carrying heavy objects (like equipment at work, grocery bags, or a heavy purse).
        All of these activities can make you stoop or bring your shoulders forward. This overstretches and weakens the muscles in the back of your shoulders, and shortens the muscles in the front of your shoulders and in your chest. Gravity then pulls the muscles forward, because the muscles are too weak to pull them back up.
        If the core muscles in your back and abdomen have grown weak from inactivity, that can also cause you to lean forward. Those muscles are crucial to lifting your frame and keeping you upright.
        Another cause of poor posture, as we reported in September, comes from broken bones in your back. People with brittle bones (osteoporosis) may experience compression fractures when the bones in the back (vertebrae) aren't strong enough to support the load placed on them. The bone collapses on the front side, the part closest to the chest. As collapsed vertebrae stack up, the spine becomes rounded and bends forward, a condition called dowager's hump (dorsal kyphosis).
        Poor posture consequences
        Sometimes people ask, ""Why should I change my posture? I don't mind it."" But one of the big things that happens with forward posture is that your center of gravity goes forward. This increases the risk of falling. Poor posture can also cause back or neck pain, headaches, trouble breathing, or trouble walking.

        Perk up your posture
        If you have a spinal cord injury or you've had surgery to fuse or remove bones in your back, there may be some limitations to your posture improvement.
        Otherwise, it's usually not too late to correct posture, even if you've had broken vertebrae (once they've healed and your doctor says it's okay). In that case, we'd try to prevent fractures in other segments of your back. We can't change bones, but we can change muscle mass.
        Tips to stand taller
        The key to fixing poor posture is strengthening and stretching the muscles in the upper back, chest, and core.
        Shoulder strengtheners include scapula squeezes (squeezing your shoulder blades together for 30 seconds at a time) and rows (using a resistance band to pull back your elbows like you're rowing).
        Core strengtheners include modified planks (in which you hold a push-up position while propped up on your elbows) or simply tightening your abdominal muscles, pulling your navel in toward your spine.
        An easy way to stretch your chest muscles: simply put your arms behind your back, grasp both elbows (or forearms if that's as far as you can reach), and hold the position.
        You'll also have to work on your posture in everyday activities. A simple trick when you're sitting (even watching TV): Put a rolled towel behind your shoulders. It makes you sit up straight so the towel won't fall.
        Cut down on activities that have led to poor posture, too. Take breaks from computer and TV time, and exercise more.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/chair-exercises-for-seniors-boosting-strength-flexibility-and-stamina,"Chair exercises for seniors: Boosting strength, flexibility, and stamina","Staying active as you get older is key to aging well. Physical activity can not only reduce the risk of heart disease and cognitive decline, it can also help you maintain your ability to perform everyday activities like carrying groceries, getting out of bed in the morning, and lifting your grandchildren or pets.

But as you age, you may not be able to do the same exercises you could perform easily in your 20s — or even 50s and 60s. That's where chair exercises come in, particularly if you have challenges with balance or mobility (at any age). Chair-based workouts can help you build and maintain strength, flexibility, and endurance. They also provide a stable base from which to exercise, and can alleviate pressure on achy knees or wobbly ankles.

What are the benefits of chair exercises for older adults?

Any type of exercise — including seated exercise — can help older adults remain healthy, happy, and independent. Ideally, you'll do a combination of cardio, strength training, stretching and balance exercises, each of which confers a variety of benefits. For example, cardio workouts support heart health; strength-training exercises help build and maintain muscle strength to power daily activities; and stretching or flexibility exercises allow you to move your body with ease. Improving your balance might prevent a devastating fall.

And you can get these benefits from exercises that start in a seated position. Plus, chair workouts may be more accessible to people of various fitness or wellness levels. If you have trouble balancing or experience pain during standing exercises, for example, or have difficulty getting off the floor for exercises done lying down, a chair workout may be safer or more comfortable.

Safety tips for chair exercises

The most important tip for safely working out from a seated position is to choose a sturdy chair. Your seat of choice should not tip over easily, and you also don't want it to wobble or move unexpectedly. (Definitely don't use a desk chair with wheels!)

You'll also have more room to move freely (and therefore avoid bumping or bruising yourself) if you pick a chair without arms.

If you have any concerns about performing these exercsises safely, or if you've been advised to limit your activity, review these exercises with your doctor before you begin.

Chair exercises for strength

The following chair exercises are appropriate for most older adults and can help build and maintain muscle strength. For exercises that use weights, choose a weight that allows you to do only eight to 12 repetitions. The last one or two reps should be difficult. If you can't lift the weight at least eight times, use a lighter weight. When you can comfortably perform 12 reps without completely tiring the muscle, it's time to increase the amount of weight.

Chair stand




	Place a small pillow at the back of your chair and position the chair so that its back is resting against a wall.
	Sit at the front of the chair, knees bent, feet flat on the floor and slightly apart. Lean back on the pillow in a half-reclining position with your arms crossed and your hands on your shoulders.
	While keeping your back and shoulders straight, raise your upper body forward until you are sitting upright.
	Stand up slowly, using your hands as little as possible (or not at all). Slowly sit back down.
	Do eight to 12 repetitions.
	Rest and repeat the set.


Biceps curl




	Sit in a chair. Hold weights down at your sides with your palms inward.
	Slowly bend one elbow, lifting the weight toward your upper chest. As you lift, keep your elbow close to your side and rotate your palm so it faces your shoulder.
	Pause, then slowly lower your arm, rotating it back again so you finish with your palms back at the starting position.
	Do eight to 12 repetitions.
	Repeat with your other arm.
	Rest and repeat the set.


Reverse fly




	Sit in a chair holding weights about 12 inches in front of your chest. Your elbows should be up and slightly bent, and palms should be facing each other (as if your arms are wrapped around a large beach ball).
	Lean forward at a slight angle in the chair, bending from your hips and keeping your back straight.
	Now, pull the weights apart while trying to bring your shoulder blades as close together as possible. Let the movement pull your elbows back as far as possible.
	Pause, then return to the starting position.
	Do eight to 12 repetitions.
	Rest and repeat the set.


Chair exercises to improve flexibility

The stretches below can help loosen tight muscles and help you move more comfortably.

Seated shoulder stretch




	Sit up straight on a chair.
	Put your left hand on your right shoulder. Cup your left elbow with your right hand.
	Roll your shoulders down and back, then gently pull your left elbow across your chest as you extend your left arm. Feel the stretch in your left shoulder. Hold for several seconds.
	Return to the starting position.
	Repeat one or more times to reach a total of 60 seconds in the ""hold"" position.
	Then repeat on the opposite side.


Seated hamstring stretch




	Sit up straight near the front of a chair with your feet flat on the floor.
	Extend your right leg straight in front of you with your heel grounded on the floor and your toes pointing toward the ceiling.
	Hinge forward from the hip, placing your hands on your left thigh for support. Keep your spine neutral. Hold for several seconds.
	Return to the starting position.
	Repeat one or more times to reach a total of 60 seconds in the ""hold"" position.
	Then repeat with your left leg.


Seated neck rotation




	Sit up straight in a chair with your chest lifted, shoulders down and back, and chin parallel to the floor.
	Rest your hands on your thighs.
	Slowly rotate your head to the right. Feel the stretch in the left side of your neck. Hold for several seconds.
	Return to the starting position.
	Repeat one or more times to reach a total of 60 seconds in the ""hold"" position.
	Then repeat on the other side.


Seated cardio exercises

Of course, cardio workouts like cycling and rowing occur in a seated position. If you'd rather not use any additional equipment, seated marches can get your heart pumping.

Seated march


	Sit up straight near the front of a chair with your feet flat on the floor.
	Quickly lift your left leg at the knee, then return it to the floor.
	Quickly lift your right leg at the knee, then return it to the floor.
	Continue to ""march"" or ""run"" in place for 15 to 20 seconds.
	Rest for 20 seconds.
	Repeat two more times.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-ideal-stretching-routine,The ideal stretching routine,"Stretching is an underrated but important part of daily physical activity. Along with improved flexibility, stretching can lead to many health benefits including :
        
          Increased range of motion in joints
          Enhanced circulation
          Reduced muscle stiffness and tension
          Improved physical performance
          Injury prevention
          Improved posture
          Stress relief
        
        These benefits make stretching an essential part of a healthy lifestyle. Knowing stretching basics such as how often should you stretch; how long should you hold a stretch; and how many times you should do each stretch will ensure you are getting the most out of your routine and reaping the full benefits of flexibility, mobility, and injury prevention.
        A panel of experts convened by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) reviewed a wide range of studies to help answer these questions. Based on the evidence, the panel agreed that:
        
          Healthy adults should do flexibility exercises (stretches, yoga, or tai chi) for all major muscle-tendon groups—neck, shoulders, chest, trunk, lower back, hips, legs, and ankles—at least two to three times a week.
          For optimal results, you should spend a total of 60 seconds on each stretching exercise. So, if you can hold a particular stretch for 15 seconds, repeating it three more times would be ideal. If you can hold the stretch for 20 seconds, two more repetitions would do the trick.
        
        A regular stretching routine is a simple yet powerful addition to your daily self-care.
        To learn more about improving your flexibility, read Stretching, a Special Health Report from Harvard Medical School.

If you often find yourself tense and on-edge, try these seven ways to reduce stress.
        
          Get enough sleep. Inadequate or poor-quality sleep can negatively affect your mood, mental alertness, energy level, and physical health.
          Learn relaxation techniques. Meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, deep breathing exercises, and yoga are powerful relaxation techniques and stress-busters.
          Strengthen your social network. Connect with others by taking a class, joining an organization, or participating in a support group.
          Hone your time-management skills. The more efficiently you can juggle work and family demands, the lower your stress level.
          Try to resolve stressful situations if you can. Don't let stressful situations fester. Hold family problem-solving sessions and use negotiation skills at home and at work.
          Nurture yourself. Treat yourself to a massage. Truly savor an experience: for example, eat slowly and really focus on the taste and sensations of each bite. Take a walk or a nap, or listen to your favorite music.
          Ask for help. Don't be afraid to ask for help from your spouse, friends, and neighbors. If stress and anxiety persist, talk to your doctor.
        
        Along with these ways to reduce stress, add in a healthy lifestyle — maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, regular exercise, and a diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthful fats — and high blood pressure could be a thing of the past.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/what-really-happens-in-upper-eyelid-surgery,What really happens in upper eyelid surgery?,"It's lovely to see the sun setting on the horizon or observe autumn leaves drifting downward. But watching your upper eyelids gradually fall lower each year? That's a bit unsettling. The sagging, drooping skin might affect the way you feel about your appearance. Worse, it might interfere with your vision, with eyelids hanging so low and feeling so heavy that it's hard to open your eyes. Fortunately, a routine surgery can help.
        Upper eyelid surgery
        The fix for falling upper eyelids is a type of surgery called upper blepharoplasty (""BLEFF-ar-oh-plass-tee""). It takes place in an outpatient surgery center, with anesthesia — local anesthesia (an injection to numb the area), ""twilight"" sedation (so you're very relaxed), or general anesthesia (so you're unconscious and unable to feel pain), depending on your needs.
        During the procedure, a surgeon — an ophthalmologist, an oculoplastic surgeon, or a plastic surgeon — will use a scalpel or laser to make incisions along the upper eyelid's natural folds. The surgeon will remove excess skin from both the left and right upper eyelids, possibly remove underlying fat, and close the incisions with stitches.
        The procedure takes about half an hour. If you received twilight sedation or general anesthesia, you'll have to go to a recovery room for about half an hour before you can go home.
        Recovery
        Recovery from upper blepharoplasty takes two to four weeks. You may have moderate (temporary) bruising and swelling around your eyes, but pain will be minimal.
        Icing your eyelids and keeping your head elevated will help reduce swelling. ""It's not unlike icing a twisted ankle. Put ice in a small towel and apply it to your eyelids for 10 or 20 minutes per hour while you're awake, for the first two days. At night, use extra pillows when you sleep, so gravity will help drain fluid causing inflammation,"" says Dr. Michael Yoon, an oculoplastic surgeon at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        You'll also have to rub a topical antibiotic ointment on your stitches three times a day for a week to prevent infection.
        See the difference
        After just one week, you should notice improvement — some reduced swelling and eyes that are more open than they were before surgery. ""After two weeks, most people are healed and the puffiness is gone,"" Dr. Yoon says. ""It takes longer for some people, however, so don't schedule major social events until three or four weeks after your procedure,"" Dr. Yoon suggests.
        Don't expect a major change in your appearance. ""We can't give an older person their 30-year-old eyelids. But if your eyelids interfere with your vision, we can correct that. And we can provide a rejuvenating effect that helps accentuate what you like about your eyes — their color, appearance, and alertness when engaging in face-to-face interactions,"" Dr. Yoon says.
        Candidates for surgery
        Almost anyone who's bothered by the function or appearance of falling upper eyelids is a candidate for upper blepharoplasty.
        However, it might not be right for people with certain serious eye diseases or prominent or bulging eyes because of an overactive thyroid. And it might be risky for people with severe dry eye syndrome, which can become more pronounced after surgery. ""Removing the excess skin allows the eyelid to open at a higher level. But when eyes are more open, they're more exposed to air, so existing dryness will become worse,"" Dr. Yoon explains.
        Another risk is noticeable asymmetry. ""The risk might be 5% or 10%, because the unique way people heal can occasionally lead to mildly uneven results,"" Dr. Yoon says. It's best to look for a surgeon who performs upper blepharoplasties frequently (every week).
        Is it worth it?
        If falling upper eyelids are interfering with your vision, insurance will likely cover all or part of the costs for upper blepharoplasty. The surgery won't be covered, however, if it's for cosmetic reasons only. Costs start at several thousand dollars, depending on your surgeon and where you live.
        Is it worth the investment? ""It's a good 'bang-for-your-buck' procedure,"" Dr. Yoon says. ""There's not a lot of pain and recovery, the results last 10 to 15 years, and you will literally be able to look in the mirror and see improvement.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-the-new-weight-loss-drugs-improve-your-health,Do the new weight-loss drugs improve your health?,"Q. 
          The holidays made me think of my family, my faith… and those new breakthrough weight-loss drugs. Do they actually improve your health?
        
        A. Boy, do they! The GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs you're referring to lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes and powerfully reduce weight in people with obesity. The FDA-approved formulations for weight loss are semaglutide (Wegovy), liraglutide (Saxenda), and tirzepatide (Zepbound). They are given by injections.
        The drugs lower blood sugar and weight in multiple ways: they release insulin from your pancreas, which lowers sugar levels; they block the action of a hormone that raises your blood sugar; they slow the digestion of sugars from the food you eat; and they act on the brain to reduce your appetite. Not only that, the GLP-1 drugs also quiet inflammation, stimulate the production of antioxidants, help repair damaged DNA, and slow the aging of the body's cells.
        But do these drugs actually protect you against disease? Among people who use the drugs for diabetes and obesity, evidence suggests the drugs reduce the risks of kidney disease progression, heart attack, death from heart disease, death from COVID-19, and death from all causes by 15% to 35%! They also may slow the brain inflammation that has been found in Alzheimer's disease (see ""Are some cases of Alzheimer's disease caused by infection?""), reduce the number of flare-ups of chronic obstructive lung disease, and even reduce addictive behavior.
        As with any medicine, some people experience side effects. The most common are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Currently, the drugs are very expensive and are not yet covered for weight loss by some insurance companies. Finally, we don't yet know the benefits or risks of using these drugs over the long term.
        We often argue in these pages for the value of supporting basic biological research—research done to understand how the body works rather than to achieve a specific health goal. The GLP-1 drugs are an example of why. Several decades ago, a Harvard Medical School scientist, Dr. Joel Habener, using newly available basic research tools, searched for the gene that makes a hormone called glucagon. He found the gene, and also was surprised to find another similar gene that no one knew about: a gene that makes a hormone he called glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1. His curiosity aroused, over the subsequent decades, he and other scientists identified many different effects the hormone has on the body, and how the hormone could be turned into a drug.
        To underline my point, Dr. Habener wasn't trying to cure any disease. He simply was curious. Those of us whose tax dollars supported his curiosity are the beneficiaries. His search for one known gene led him to also discover a second unknown gene and — completely unexpectedly — to the invention of medicines that dramatically reduce the risk of multiple major diseases.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sleep-apnea-and-heart-disease-a-weighty-matter,Sleep apnea and heart disease: A weighty matter,"In addition to helping control diabetes and obesity, the popular drugs known as GLP-1 agonists may also alleviate another disorder that's closely linked to cardiovascular problems: obstructive sleep apnea. This common condition — which is marked by brief pauses in breathing, often accompanied by loud snoring — doesn't just leave people groggy and sleepy during the day. Left untreated, this serious disorder raises the odds of high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke.
        Excess weight is the strongest risk factor linked with sleep apnea, which affects about 25% of men and 10% of women in the United States. More than half of people with the condition are overweight or obese, and the risk rises as body size increases, according to Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Extra fat tissue in the neck and throat can narrow the airway, and extra weight on the chest and belly puts pressure on the lungs, which makes the normal process of inhaling and exhaling less effective,"" she explains.
        
          
            
              
                What happens during sleep apnea?
                
                  
                
                The 10- to 30-second breathing pauses that characterize sleep apnea occur when the airway in your nose or throat becomes partially or completely blocked by large tonsils, a large tongue, or too much tissue in the airway.
                
                  
                    Image: © Blueastro/Getty Images
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        Treating sleep apnea
        In sleep apnea, the breathing pauses happen when the airway briefly closes (see ""What happens during sleep apnea?""). The first-line treatment is positive airway pressure (PAP), which uses a small bedside machine to push a forceful stream of air to a mask covering the nose or the nose and mouth to keep the airway open.
        A recent study found that one of the GLP-1 drugs, tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for obesity) can slash the number of breathing interruptions during sleep — a key measure of sleep apnea severity. Published June 21, 2024, in The New England Journal of Medicine, the yearlong study included 469 people with obesity and moderate-to-severe sleep apnea, some of whom used PAP machines when sleeping. Compared with people who got a placebo injection, those treated with tirzepatide had a nearly 59% drop in their apnea-hypopnea index, a measure that describes the number of times a person's breathing slows or stops during an hour of sleep. Those taking tirzepatide lost close to 20% of their body weight.
        Ditch your PAP machine?
        ""At least once a week, I see people in my clinic who have lost so much weight on one of the obesity drugs that they don't need to use their PAP machine any longer,"" says Dr. Javaheri. (The other GLP-1 obesity drug, semaglutide, is sold as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss). ""Several patients lost between 50 and 60 pounds, which was enough to completely cure their sleep apnea."" While tirzepatide is not approved for treating sleep apnea, it's currently under consideration by the FDA for that use. However, even if you qualify for a prescription for either semaglutide or tirzepatide based on your medical conditions, these medications can be challenging to obtain due high demand, limited supplies, cost, and other factors.
        That said, the growing list of health benefits from GLP-1 agonists (see ""Anti-obesity drug lowers heart-related problems"" in the February 2024 Heart Letter) may make them both more accessible and affordable in the future. If and when tirzepatide is approved for treating sleep apnea, sleep medicine clinics will likely provide the medication, says Dr. Javaheri.
        Weight loss has long been recommended for sleep apnea sufferers who are overweight or obese. After people lose at least 10% of their initial weight (that is, their weight at diagnosis), insurance companies usually pay for another sleep study to see if they've improved enough to stop using PAP, which people often find cumbersome and inconvenient. ""But I advise people using anti-obesity drugs to wait until they reach their goal weight before getting retested,"" says Dr. Javaheri.
        Other contributors to sleep apnea
        Finally, it's worth noting that obesity is just one of the factors that predispose people to sleep apnea, which also occurs in people who aren't overweight. ""Some people are born with anatomical differences that leave them prone to sleep apnea, such as a narrow airway, a thicker neck, a large tongue, enlarged tonsils, or a small, receding chin,"" says Dr. Javaheri. ""Smoking also increases the risk of sleep apnea significantly, and alcohol can cause sleep apnea or make it worse,"" she adds.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/create-a-customized-home-workout-space,Create a customized home workout space,"If you attend a weekly exercise class or work out at a fitness center a few times a week, you're already doing your heart a favor. But to better protect and improve your cardiovascular fitness and overall health, aim to do at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. Having a home workout area can make it easier to achieve that goal — especially during the winter months, when weather conditions may make outdoor exercise impractical.
        ""It's nice if you have space for a treadmill or similar type of cardio equipment that can help you get your heart rate up,"" says Mary Kate Miller, clinical supervisor of physical therapy at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Out-patient Center Malden. Not only can you exercise in the privacy of your home, you can also easily break up your workout into 10- to 15-minute stints throughout the day, whenever it's convenient for you.
        Strength-building exercise is also important, and you don't necessarily need any special equipment if you do body-weight exercises. But resistance bands, dumbbells, and ankle weights can help you adapt your movements to make them easier or more challenging.
        Machines for aerobic exercise
        If you have heart disease, always check with your doctor before starting any new exercise regimen. It's also important to consider any other health issues you have before purchasing an exercise machine. By the time most people reach middle age, it's not uncommon to have at least one joint or muscle problem, from either overuse or injury. It could be creaky knees or hips, a sore shoulder, tender wrists, or an achy lower back. Other health issues might also be worth considering, such as arthritis or osteoporosis. ""A cardio workout should be more or less pain-free, so I recommend going to a gym and try out different exercise machines to see what feels most comfortable,"" says Miller.
        For people with hip or knee arthritis, she recommends an upright or recumbent stationary bicycle, because the circular movement tends to be more comfortable for arthritic joints. Stationary bikes may also be more practical for people with balance issues. Weight-bearing exercise (which you can get from a treadmill or elliptical machine) can be beneficial for people who have or are at risk for osteoporosis. Ellipticals and some stationary bikes have arms that move back and forth, so the repetitive motion might exacerbate any pain in your shoulders or elbows. Rowing machines are great for a full-body workout, as they engage muscles in your arms, legs, and core.
        Props for building strength
        For strength training, resistance bands or tubes are ideal for beginners because they're affordable, versatile, and easy to use, says Miller. Many are sold in sets so you get a variety of resistance levels, and some include instructions that demonstrate various exercises that target the legs, arms, back, and other muscle groups.
        Using free weights like dumbbells or kettlebells can be a bit more challenging, in part because they force you to recruit more muscles to stabilize yourself. Depending on your current strength, you might start with a set of two-pound and five-pound weights or five-pound and eight-pound weights. Alternatively, you can buy adjustable dumbbells that offer a variety of weight ranges — for example, from 2.5 to 12.5 pounds, or from five to 25 or 50 pounds. For ankle weights, look for a brand with half-pound weight bar inserts that can hold up to at least five pounds per leg.
        Staying in good form
        To make sure you're using proper form and getting an effective workout, consider scheduling a few sessions with either a physical therapist or certified personal trainer, Miller advises. They will demonstrate the exercises, correct any alignment issues, and offer advice about the proper weight and number of repetitions.
        To maintain your form and motivation, watching online videos can help. One good source is the American Council on Exercise (click on ""Exercise Library"" under the Resources tab). For older adults, the National Institute on Aging has a series of 15-minute exercise videos; look for ""Exercises for Older Adults.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/letting-the-air-out,Letting the air out,"Belching loud and proud was a badge of honor as a kid. But once we're adults, belching (or burping) can be annoying and embarrassing in the company of others.
        But people shouldn't be repelled by belching, as it serves an essential purpose. ""Belching is a protective mechanism against the stomach getting overinflated from swallowing too much air,"" says Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Think about how great you feel when you have a good belch.""
        Anatomy of a belch
        There are two types of belching: gastric belching and supragastric belching.
        Gastric belching is the everyday kind that most people experience. Every time you swallow, you take in a little air, and some of it travels down the esophagus and into the upper part of the stomach. When the stomach begins to stretch out from this air, sensors in its wall send signals to your esophagus. These signals tell the sphincter (the small ring of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus) to open, allowing air that has built up in the stomach to escape up and out as a belch.
        A gastric belch often smells. ""The air might have the odor of whatever you recently ate,"" says Dr. Staller. By contrast, with supragastric belching, swallowed air stays in the esophagus and never makes it to the stomach. The air gets quickly expelled in fast and frequent odorless belches.
        People can swallow too much air for various reasons. For example:
        Eating too fast. ""When you eat quickly, you gulp more air, which is why people often feel the urge to belch after eating,"" says Dr. Staller. The solution is to eat slower so you swallow less air. Try this: At the beginning of your meal, set a timer for 20 minutes. Then pace yourself to make your meal last until the timer goes off. Chew each mouthful 30 times, and put your fork down between bites.
        Carbonated beverages. Drinks like beer, soda, and seltzer can bring extra air into the esophagus and stomach. Gulping these drinks or using a straw can also increase air intake. Cutting down on carbonated beverages, drinking slower, and not using a straw can help.
        Gum and hard candy. Chewing gum and sucking on hard candies also can lead to inadvertent air swallowing.
        
          
            
              
                What if you can't belch?
                If you can't belch, you may have a condition called retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction (R-CPD), also known as ""no burp syndrome."" ""We still have a lot to learn about R-CPD, as there are limited data on the efficacy of treatment or how to make a true diagnosis,"" says gastroenterologist Dr. Kyle Staller at Massachusetts General Hospital.
                R-CPD is believed to occur when the cricopharyngeus muscle, a sphincter muscle that sits at the top of the esophagus, cannot relax and, as a result, does not open to allow air to exit the esophagus.
                As a result, air accumulates in the stomach, esophagus, and intestines, causing bloating and pressure in the abdomen, chest, and lower neck, and gurgling sounds from the chest and neck. Because the air cannot leave through the esophagus, it instead exits the body as flatulence, which is often excessive.
                Treatment options for R-CPD include a botulinum toxin injection into the cricopharyngeus muscle or surgery to cut partway through it. Both of these approaches allow the muscle to relax and air to exit the esophagus.
              
            
          
        
        Sound of trouble
        Belching is usually nothing to worry about, says Dr. Staller, but he suggests seeing your doctor if it becomes more frequent and causes distress and discomfort. Excessive belching is a common symptom for digestive disorders like functional dyspepsia (recurring symptoms of an upset stomach with no obvious cause) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
        ""Belching could be a red flag if it accompanies other symptoms like sudden weight loss, difficulty swallowing, or blood in the stool,"" says Dr. Staller. Problematic belching also could be related to stress or anxiety, and treating these issues with psychotherapy and diaphragmatic breathing techniques often helps.
         When you do feel a belch coming, don't try to squelch it. ""There is little you can do to stop it,"" says Dr. Staller. ""You can be discreet by muffling a belch or holding it in for a few seconds until you're in a more private setting, but eventually, your body will win.""
        So, when you must belch, let it out and just say, ""Excuse me.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/clearing-up-a-foggy-memory,Clearing up a foggy memory,"At some point, most older adults experience ""senior moments."" You misplace your phone or keys, lose your train of thought during a conversation, forget directions or a name minutes after being told, or walk into a room and don't know why.
        These moments of brain fogginess can be stressful and embarrassing, but are they ever cause for concern? ""The brain is like any other part of the body, and over time, it may not function as well as it used to,"" says neuropsychologist Julie Brody Magid, clinical director of the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital Memory Disorders Assessment Clinic. ""While most memory glitches are part of normal aging, in some cases they are exacerbated by problems that people can manage.""
        Aging and the brain
        People often notice memory lapses beginning in their 50s or 60s. This is when age-related chemical and structural changes begin in brain regions devoted to memory, such as the hippocampus and frontal lobes.
        These brain regions begin to shrink, often related to narrowing of the small arteries that deliver oxygen and nutrients. ""These changes can make learning and recalling new and existing information slightly more challenging,"" says Brody Magid.
        Yet age is not always to blame. Your doctor can help you sort out whether there are other problems contributing to your memory lapses. Here are some of the possibilities:
        Depression, anxiety, and stress. Depression can disrupt the brain's ability to focus, process, and access information, according to Brody Magid. Chronic stress and anxiety can flood the brain with the stress hormone cortisol, which, over time, can affect the brain regions responsible for storing and recalling information. ""Depression, stress, and anxiety can also cause negative and preoccupying thoughts that keep people from focusing and being present, which may contribute to memory issues,"" says Brody Magid.
        Medication. Brain fogginess can be a common side effect of some medications. ""If you are taking a new drug, either prescription or over the counter, ask your doctor or pharmacist if it could be affecting your cognition,"" says Brody Magid.
        Sleep. Research has linked a decline in brain functions with sleep problems, such as sleeping less than the recommended seven to eight hours nightly, fragmented sleep, and sleep disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea.
        
          
            
              
                Mind tricks
                Even though most memory lapses are normal, you can take measures to manage and improve your existing brain skills. Here are some memory obstacles people encounter and ways to deal with them.
                Absentmindedness. This happens when you take on too many tasks or get distracted. When faced with multiple tasks, make a list, put them in order of importance, and focus on only one at a time before moving on to the next. Setting up routines and reminders can also help. For example, create a memory table by your front door or in the bedroom where you place vital objects, like your phone, medicines, keys, and glasses.
                Blocking. A common example of blocking is remembering and recalling names. When you meet someone, try linking that person with something that may help trigger name recall, like their hobby, work, background, or spouse. Another method is to associate the person with someone with the same name or a similar one, like a relative, celebrity, or movie character.
                Transience. Transience is the loss over time of certain memories like facts and events. To help retain specific memories, keep the information active in your memory; for instance, share it in conversation whenever possible, record it for future reference, and review related photographs.
              
            
          
        
        When to get checked
        If memory lapses become more frequent or substantial enough to interfere with your daily life or safety, you should get checked out, says Brody Magid.
        When speaking with your doctor, provide as much detailed information as possible surrounding your memory glitches.
        For instance, were you distracted because you were upset about something or were juggling too much at once? Does your memory recover in the moment, or does it take time for your brain to ""kick in""? Is there a pattern to your memory lapses?
        ""All of this background information can help your doctor determine if lifestyle factors or medical issues might be at play and need to be addressed, or if you need a formal examination at a memory clinic,"" says Brody Magid.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/winter-skin-woes,Winter skin woes,"If perpetually cold hands and feet weren't clear tip-offs that we're now in winter's grasp, perhaps a flurry of dry, flaky skin has driven it home.
        Rough, itchy patches are nearly universal at this time of year. But you may not have braced yourself for other skin problems that can crop up — or get worse — when temperatures plunge.
        On this undesirable list are eczema, which is marked by dry, red areas and painful cracks; psoriasis, which typically involves patches of thick, red skin coated with silvery scales; rosacea, most often characterized by facial flushing and redness and causing red bumps on the nose and cheeks; and seborrheic dermatitis, which is known as dandruff when it's on the scalp but can take the form of a scaly rash on other skin areas, particularly around the eyebrows and the corners of the nose and chin.
        Even people whose skin has been remarkably unproblematic over the years often find they're facing new winter skin woes merely because they're getting older, says Dr. Rachel Reynolds, interim chair of dermatology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. For women, the first five or so years after menopause may seem especially brutal, since diminishing estrogen levels translate into less skin moisture.
        ""As we age, our skin gets drier,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""So unless someone has already been dealing with a skin condition, they might not experience these weather-related changes until they get older.""
        Problematic behaviors
        Why do all of these problems converge in winter? Simply put, winter wreaks havoc with our skin barrier — the top layer of skin, which contains substances such as cholesterol and fatty acids that help seal in moisture and protect against irritants.
        Frosty temperatures and dry air are winter-weather characteristics that are particularly hard on skin. ""Even heating systems create more dryness,"" Dr. Reynolds notes. ""They take more humidity out of the environment, which extracts moisture from the skin.""
        Certain behaviors can aggravate the situation, including
        
          taking long, hot showers or washing hands frequently
          using harsh soaps, laundry detergents, fabric softener sheets, or heavily fragranced products
          spending a lot of time outdoors
          wearing wool, which can irritate sensitive skin.
        
        Surprisingly, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer — which became a staple during the pandemic — isn't as drying as hand washing can be, Dr. Reynolds says. ""Ironically, for someone who has to clean their hands frequently, soap and water exposure is more harsh on skin,"" she says.
        Skin protection tips
        Applying moisturizer is a go-to measure to ward off dry skin, as well as soothe problems such as eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, and seborrheic dermatitis. But Dr. Reynolds suggests taking a deeper dive on products and approaches you may not have considered:
        
          Opt for creams and ointments, since thinner lotions don't provide as much moisture.
          Coat cracked skin areas with petroleum jelly and cover with cotton gloves, plastic wrap, or another barrier to seal in moisture overnight.
          Use a humidifier to pump moisture into dry indoor air.
          Take only lukewarm showers, and shower no more than once a day — every other day if possible.
          Use moisturizing soaps and liquid body cleansers, which contain more skin-softening emollients than bar soap. ""And try to avoid soap on areas you don't need it, like your arms and legs,"" she says.
          Pat yourself dry after bathing and apply moisturizer while skin is still damp, which traps the moisture.
        
        However you respond to dry skin, don't ignore it — especially if you're at midlife or beyond, Dr. Reynolds warns. Untreated dry skin can develop into a type of eczema called nummular dermatitis, another version of the dry-skin eczema often seen on older people's legs. This itchy condition can predispose people to cellulitis, a potentially serious skin infection that can spread to the bloodstream.
        ""Everyone gets dry skin as they age, and the degree to which you get it varies from person to person,"" she says. ""Anyone around 60 or older could be predisposed to this eczema, just based on age-related dry skin.""
        See your primary care doctor if you develop an itchy, red rash. ""If it becomes more severe, your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist,"" Dr. Reynolds says.
        One last caveat: drinking water isn't a cure-all to either avoid or treat dry skin. ""Keeping up with normal fluid intake is a good idea, but the benefits of skin hydration from drinking water are sometimes overemphasized,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""A much more effective approach is hydrating your skin from the outside by practicing diligent skin care and moisturizing regularly.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-can-cause-blood-in-stool,What can cause blood in stool?,"Discovering blood in your stool can be alarming, but it doesn't always signal a serious medical condition. Regardless of the cause, it's crucial to seek medical advice if you notice blood in your stool, as early detection and treatment can lead to better outcomes if it is caused by something serious.

What does blood in stool look like?

The appearance of blood in stool can vary, and the color of the blood often gives clues about the source of bleeding.


	Bright red blood usually suggests bleeding from the lower gastrointestinal tract, such as the rectum or anus, and may be visible on toilet paper, in the toilet bowl, or on the surface of the stool. Small amounts of blood in the toilet bowl or on toilet paper are often linked to conditions like hemorrhoids or anal fissures. However, certain foods such as beets, tomatoes, or foods with red food coloring can also cause stools to appear reddish. If you notice larger amounts of bright red blood, you should immediately let your healthcare provider know.
	Dark or tarry stools may indicate bleeding from a higher part of the digestive tract such as the stomach or small intestine. As the blood moves through the gastrointestinal system, it may be partially digested, resulting in a black, sticky appearance. However, certain foods, including blood sausage, blueberries, and black licorice, can also lead to dark stools. So can iron supplements, bismuth subsalicylate (found in Pepto-Bismol), and activated charcoal.


What can cause blood in stool?

There are many potential causes of rectal bleeding or blood in stool, ranging from minor issues like foods recently eaten, hemorrhoids, or anal fissures to more significant concerns such as gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, or inflammatory bowel diseases.

Hemorrhoids

Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels that can develop either externally (around the anus) or internally (in the lower rectum). They are the most common cause of rectal bleeding in middle-aged and older adults. Factors such as chronic constipation, straining during bowel movements, pregnancy, and prolonged sitting on the toilet can cause hemorrhoids. Symptoms of hemorrhoids can include rectal pain, itching, bleeding, and, in some cases, prolapse, where the hemorrhoids protrude through the anal canal.

Anal fissures

Anal fissures are small tears in the skin of the anal canal, often caused by constipation and straining to pass hard stools. Fissures can also occur due to diarrhea, vaginal childbirth, or infections. Common symptoms of anal fissures include sharp pain during bowel movements, itching around the anus, muscle spasms in the anal area, a lump or skin tag near the anus, and bright red blood in the stool, which may be seen on toilet paper after a bowel movement.

Diverticulosis

Diverticulosis occurs when weak spots in the inner wall of the colon cause small pouches to form. Over time, the blood vessels within these pouches can become fragile and prone to rupture, leading to bleeding. While diverticulosis is quite common, many people are unaware that they have it.

Colon polyps

Colon polyps are growths that occur in the large intestine (also called the colon). They are quite common — between 15% and 40% of adults may have polyps. Most polyps are benign, but some have the potential to develop into cancer over time. Removing polyps is an important step in preventing colorectal cancer.

Most people with colon polyps don't experience symptoms. However, you should see your doctor immediately for advice if you develop rectal bleeding, as it may be a sign of polyps.

Gastrointestinal infections

Certain gastrointestinal infections can cause inflammation and irritation anywhere in the digestive tract. Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial overgrowth in the stomach that can lead to bleeding ulcers and black stools. Other bacteria and parasites that infect the intestines can cause bright red blood in the stool, often associated with abdominal cramps and diarrhea.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease — results from an abnormal reaction by the body's immune system. This can expose your entire gastrointestinal system to inflammation and lead to a series of digestive problems including abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, more urgent bowel movements, and bloody stools.

Colon cancer

Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the tissues of the colon or rectum. When cancer originates in the colon, it is referred to as colon cancer. While colorectal cancer may not always cause noticeable symptoms, common signs can include changes in bowel habits, blood in the stool (either bright red or dark), frequent gas pains, bloating, feelings of fullness or cramping, weight loss, and fatigue.

Screening for colon cancer saves lives. Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard screening test because polyps identified during the procedure can be removed before they become cancerous. Colonoscopy can also detect early cancers that can be cured with surgery. Alternative tests include stool tests for DNA and occult blood, with or without sigmoidoscopy.

When should you see a doctor for blood in stool?

Anyone experiencing persistent or recurring blood in the stool, even in small amounts, should schedule an appointment with their doctor. The stool should be assessed by a health care provider to identify the underlying cause.",Jenette Restivo,"December 17, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/skin-care-for-aging-skin-minimizing-age-spots-wrinkles-and-undereye-bags,"Skin care for aging skin: Minimizing age spots, wrinkles, and undereye bags","Aging is a natural part of life, and over time it brings changes to our skin. Many people notice age spots, fine lines, and bags under their eyes as they grow older. While we can't stop the clock, we can take steps to maintain healthier, more youthful skin. From daily skin care routines to targeted treatments, there are many ways to address age-related skin concerns.
        How does your skin change as you get older?
        As we grow older, our skin undergoes several changes. Collagen and elastin, two proteins that keep skin firm and stretchy, start to break down, leading to wrinkles and sagging. Oil glands produce less oil, which can make your skin feel dry and rough. Our skin also becomes thinner and more delicate, making it more vulnerable to damage.
        Aging skin can also lose some of its youthful glow because the process of shedding old skin, known as skin cell turnover, slows down. Additionally, exposure to sunlight over the years can lead to age spots and uneven pigmentation. These changes are natural, but certain lifestyle choices, such as protecting skin from the sun, not smoking, and following a good skin care routine, can help slow down the process.
        How to care for aging skin
        Caring for aging skin means focusing on hydration, sun protection, and gentle treatments. Here are some tips to help maintain healthy, vibrant skin.
        
          Cleanse gently: Use a mild cleanser once daily to remove dirt and oil without stripping your skin of its natural moisture. Avoid harsh soaps, which can be too drying.
          Moisturize regularly: As skin gets drier with age, applying a moisturizer can help keep it hydrated and smooth. Apply a fragrance-free moisturizer daily after showering, and whenever your skin feels dry. A moisturizer containing hyaluronic acid or glycerin can be particularly beneficial.
          Use sunscreen every day: Sun protection is one of the most important steps for slowing skin aging. Ultraviolet (UV) exposure accelerates the breakdown of collagen and elastin. It also causes DNA damage that may lead to skin cancer. Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every morning, even on cloudy days and in the winter.
          Add antioxidants: Skin care products with antioxidants like vitamin C can help protect skin from environmental damage. Vitamin C protects the skin from damage caused by free radicals, which are unstable molecules that break down skin cells. It helps brighten the skin, even out skin tone, and reduce the appearance of dark spots by inhibiting excess pigment production.
          Exfoliate gently:Exfoliating once or twice a week can remove dead skin cells and help your skin look more refreshed. For anti-aging benefits, chemical exfoliation (using topical products applied to your skin) is a better option than physical exfoliation (such as using a loofa or textured washcloth). Retinoids, alpha and beta hydroxy acids, and salicylic acid are all chemical exfoliants. Take care to use exfoliants as described in the directions. Applying too much or more often than indicated can lead to raw, irritated skin.
        
        Age spots
        The medical term for an age spot is solar lentigo. They are also called liver spots or sun spots. These are flat brown, black, or gray spots that often appear on areas exposed to the sun, like the face, hands, and shoulders. They are common in people over age 50, but younger people can get them with enough sun exposure.
        While age spots are harmless, they can be a cosmetic concern for some people. Here are a few options to reduce their appearance.
        
          Topical products: Creams and lotions with ingredients like hydroquinone, retinoid, or vitamin C can help fade age spots over time. Look for products labeled ""brightening"" or ""spot corrector"" and only apply as directed. Topical medications that contain higher strengths of these ingredients can be prescribed by a dermatologist.
          Chemical peels: A dermatologist or other licensed professional can apply a chemical solution containing topical alpha-hydroxy acids, tricholoroacetic acid, or glycolic or lactic acid to the skin. Chemical peels remove the top layer of the skin, reducing the appearance of age spots.
          Laser treatments: Laser therapy targets pigmented cells, helping to fade age spots. This is a more intense option and may require several sessions. Lasers should be cautiously used for people with very dark skin tones, and are unsuitable for those with certain skin conditions, pregnant women, and people who are prone to scarring. If you have a history of cold sores (herpes simplex) on the treatment area, you may need to avoid or take extra precautions with laser treatments.
        
        Age spots that have any irregularities, including changes in shape, color, and size, should be evaluated because these can be signs of skin cancer.
        Wrinkles
        Wrinkles are lines and creases that form in the skin, usually around the eyes, mouth, and forehead. They develop as the skin loses elasticity, and can deepen with repeated facial expressions, sun exposure, and gravity.
        Retinoids are one of the most effective options for wrinkles. ""Retinoids"" refers to a range of vitamin A-based skin care products. They boost collagen, improve skin thickness, and smooth the outer layer of the skin. Retinoids such as tretinoin (Retin-A) and tazarotene (Avage, Tazorac) are available by prescription. Topical products containing retinol or retinal, which are types of retinoids, are widely available in over-the-counter products.
        Treatment options used for age spots, including lasers and chemical peels (see above), can also be helpful for wrinkles. A few more invasive treatment options include:
        
          Neuromodulators: Neuromodulator injections like botulinum toxin (Botox) temporarily relax certain muscles in the face to smooth out wrinkles and lines. They work by blocking signals from the nerves to the muscles, which stops the muscles from contracting as much. This helps reduce wrinkles caused by facial expressions; the effects last about three to six months.
          Soft tissue fillers: Fillers such as hyaluronic acid gels are injected into targeted areas of the face to smooth out wrinkles and restore fullness in areas like the cheeks and lips. Results are immediate and can last from six months to two years.
        
        
          Microneedling: This procedure uses tiny needles to create small injuries in the skin. This encourages collagen production and can help smooth facial wrinkles.
        
        Discuss potential risks associated with these treatment options with your dermatologist or other licensed clinician.
        Crow's feet
        Crow's feet are the fine lines that develop around the outer corners of the eyes. Because the skin around the eyes is thin, it's often one of the first areas to show signs of aging.
        Treatment options for crow's feet are the same as those for wrinkles. Lifestyle choices also impact when crow's feet appear and how deep wrinkles become. Some factors to consider:
        
          Sun exposure and sunscreen: In addition to daily sunscreen, wear sunglasses or hats to protect your eyes from UV rays. This also reduces squinting, which helps prevent crow's feet.
          Managing stress: Emotions like anger, sadness, and anxiety lead to facial expressions that contribute to crow's feet. Learning to manage stress can reduce these fine lines and wrinkles.
          Smoking: Need another reason to quit? Smoking accelerates the development of crow's feet by reducing blood flow to the skin and breaking down collagen and elastin.
        
        Undereye bags
        Undereye bags, or dark circles, refer to skin darkening, puffiness, or swelling under the eyes, which can make you look tired. This common concern is usually caused by weakened muscles and tissues around the eyes. Other factors, such as lack of sleep, genetics, and fluid retention, can make undereye bags more noticeable.
        Options for addressing undereye bags range from simple makeup to hide them, to fillers and skin resurfacing, or even surgery for more severe cases.
        Here are some tips to reduce the appearance undereye bags:
        
          Keep it cool: Applying a cold compress to your undereye area can temporarily reduce puffiness.
          Use an eye cream with caffeine: Topical caffeine can help reduce dark circles under the eyes by addressing swelling and discoloration from leaky blood vessels. Studies show that caffeine gels can penetrate the skin and improve puffiness and pigmentation around the lower eyelid.
          Give peptides a try: Peptides, which are found in many eye creams, are often used to reduce dark circles. They work in different ways: some stimulate collagen and elastin, while others block enzymes that break down skin structure, and carrier peptides deliver nutrients that help repair and strengthen the skin.
          Sleep on your back: Sleeping on your back with your head slightly elevated may help prevent fluid buildup around the eyes, reduce puffiness, and lessen the appearance of dark circles.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","December 12, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/vitiligo-a-to-z,Vitiligo,"What is vitiligo?
        Vitiligo consists of white patches of skin that are caused by the loss of melanin, the pigment that is a major contributor to skin color. Melanin is produced by special cells called melanocytes, which are destroyed in people who have vitiligo. The cause of vitiligo is not known, but evidence strongly suggests that vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder, in which the body's immune system mistakenly targets and injures melanocytes.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        Vitiligo can cause minor changes or extensive changes in the skin. In some people it may be hardly noticeable, while in others it is obvious. In dark-skinned people the vitiligo patches tend to be more obvious since they contrast with normal skin. Light-skinned people may have fewer cosmetic concerns, but patches without pigment can become obvious in the summer because unaffected skin tans while vitiligo skin does not tan.
        Vitiligo occurs in about 1% to 2% of the population. Approximately 30% of people with vitiligo have a family history of the condition. About half of people with vitiligo start showing symptoms before age 20.
        People with vitiligo have an increased risk of developing other autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes. Also, people with these conditions have an increased risk of developing vitiligo.
        Symptoms of vitiligo
        Vitiligo causes patches of white skin that are often symmetrical (even), with dark or red borders. The patches can occur anywhere, but the areas most commonly affected are the backs of the hands, the face, and areas that have skin folds, such as the armpits and genitals. Body openings such as the lips, eyes, nipples, and anus are also common areas for vitiligo, as are areas that have been sunburned.
        Vitiligo can occur in bursts, so that sizeable areas of skin may rapidly lose their pigment during the beginning stages of the condition, yet then these whitened skin patches may abruptly stop expanding for months or years.
        Diagnosing vitiligo
        Vitiligo causes a pattern of skin changes that usually can be recognized easily by a doctor. If the skin changes are in a pattern that suggests other conditions, your doctor might recommend a biopsy of the skin to be certain about your diagnosis. In a biopsy, a small piece of skin is removed and examined in a laboratory. A biopsy usually is not needed to diagnose vitiligo.
        Expected duration of vitiligo
        In one out of every five to 10 people with vitiligo, some or all of the pigment eventually returns on its own and the white patches disappear. For most people, however, the whitened skin patches last and grow larger if vitiligo is not treated. Vitiligo is a lifelong condition.
        Preventing vitiligo
        There is no way to prevent vitiligo.
        Treating vitiligo
        Vitiligo is difficult to treat, and responses vary. The most important treatment is to protect areas of vitiligo from the sun. It is very easy for areas without pigment to become sunburned. This increases the risk of skin cancer. Wear sun-protective clothing and/or apply sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 to areas affected by vitiligo.
        Other treatments can be attempted if vitiligo causes emotional or social distress. The goals of treatment are to minimize the contrast in color between your normal skin and skin patches that have lost pigment.
        
          If you are light-skinned, part of your treatment may be to protect your normal skin from tanning by using sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30.
          Topical treatments can be helpful in some people. These are applied directly to the skin. Steroid creams or ointments are applied once a day for up to several months. These medications are not always effective, and they can thin the skin with continued use. Other topical medicines that may be helpful include tacrolimus (Protopic), pimecrolimus (Elidel), and ruxolitinib (and#1054;рzеlurа).
          Ultraviolet B light treatment can be effective for treating vitiligo in many patients. Ultraviolet light can be provided by a hand-held light box for smaller areas of skin. People who have many areas of skin involved can be treated by putting on goggles and standing inside a closet-sized light box for several minutes. The treatment must be repeated often, usually for three times a week and for at least six months. Side effects, which should be discussed thoroughly with your dermatologist, include itching, pain, and sunburn, as well as increased risk of skin cancers.
          Psoralen plus ultraviolet A light treatment (commonly called PUVA) causes slightly more pronounced side effects than ultraviolet B light therapy, but it is another way to treat vitiligo. Psoralens are drugs that cause skin to darken when they react with ultraviolet A light. They can be applied as a cream or taken as pills. After the psoralen medicine is used, you are exposed to ultraviolet light. PUVA treatment is not for pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding, or children younger than 10. There is also an increased risk of skin cancers.
          Oral medicines that suppress your immune system can sometimes allow normal pigment to return. For people who have large skin areas involved, oral steroids sometimes are used instead of steroids applied to the skin.
          For people with severe vitiligo, depigmentation can remove the color from normal skin, making all of the skin the same white color. A bleaching solution called monobenzone (also called monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone; brand name: Benoquin) is applied to normally pigmented skin. It may be two or three months before you see any effects. About 95% of people will be depigmented within 12 months, and must then meticulously avoid sun exposure. Side effects can occur in up to 50% of those treated, and include skin redness, dryness, itching, and burning, especially on the face. This treatment is rarely used because the skin without pigment is vulnerable to damage from sun exposure.
          Surgical treatments: These include skin grafting and other techniques to place healthy melanocytes into the skin affected by vitiligo. These options may not work well in all patients; for example, they are usually avoided for people who tend to form a lot of scar tissue in the skin.
        
        For many, ""cosmetic camouflage"" may be the best option. Spray tanning products and foundation-based cosmetics are often recommended when vitiligo affects skin in highly visible areas such as the hands, face, or neck.

        If you notice that patches of skin appear white, contact your doctor for an examination. Treatment may be most helpful if it can be started when only a small area of skin is affected. It is very important to wear sunscreen to protect the areas affected by vitiligo, since these areas are especially at risk for sunburn and for skin cancers.
        Prognosis
        For most people with vitiligo, this condition slowly worsens without treatment or needs continued treatment.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/lost-a-tooth-what-to-know-about-dental-implants,Lost a tooth? What to know about dental implants,"If you've recently lost a tooth, whether to an accident, tooth decay, periodontal disease, or another reason, a dental implant may be a solution to replace your missing tooth.
        What are dental implants?
        A dental implant is a medical device designed to replace a tooth that has been lost due to injury, genetic predisposition, or dental disease. Unlike dentures, which sit on top of the gums and can be removed, implants are permanent.
        Dental implants consist of three parts: a titanium screw (the implant) that is surgically placed into the jawbone to replace the root of the tooth; a small connector (called an abutment) that attaches to the implant above the gumline; and a crown (an artificial tooth) that is placed over the abutment. Surgery is required to insert the titanium screw into the jawbone.
        Who can benefit from a dental implant?
        Anyone who has lost one or more teeth may benefit from a dental implant. Common causes of tooth loss include:
        
          periodontal disease
          injury or accident
          smoking
          poor nutrition
          aging
          chronic diseases such as diabetes, COPD, and rheumatoid arthritis
          genetic predisposition.
        
        Who is not a good candidate for dental implants?
        You may not be a good candidate for a dental implant if you:
        
          are a current smoker
          have severe periodontal disease
          have certain underlying medical conditions such as bleeding disorders, uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, immune deficiencies, some cardiovascular conditions, and certain bone diseases
          are undergoing treatment, such as chemotherapy, which can interfere with the body's ability to heal
          are taking a bisphosphonate drug to treat osteoporosis
          are unable to maintain good oral hygiene.
        
        Benefits of a dental implant
        Missing teeth can cause problems with chewing. This, in turn, can lead to nutritional deficiencies. Missing teeth can also cause trouble with speech, and can lead to worsening oral health problems. In addition, people without a full set of teeth may feel self-conscious about their appearance.
        Dental implants can help by:
        
          restoring the ability to chew
          preventing bone loss in the jawbone
          improving gum health and oral health
          stabilizing surrounding teeth
          improving cosmetic appearance.
        
        Together, these benefits can help to improve overall health.
        The dental implant procedure: What to expect
        There are several steps involved in the dental implant procedure. The entire process — from the surgical insertion of the implanted screw to the placement of the crown — can take several months. The timing of the steps in this process varies from person to person.
        Here's what to expect:
        
          On the day that your implant is placed you will receive local anesthesia to numb the area, and possibly intravenous (IV) sedation as well. Your dental surgeon will drill a hole into the jaw where the replacement tooth will be set. The titanium screw is inserted into this hole, and the gum tissue is stitched around or over a temporary cap placed over the implant. This is an outpatient procedure, so you will be able to go home the same day.
          Over the course of several months, the bone around the implant will grow naturally and fuse with the implant to hold it in place. This process is known as osseointegration.
          The dentist will take a mold for the crown.
          Once the implant is secure, the dentist will replace the temporary cap with an abutment and attach the custom-made crown to the abutment.
        
        Some people may not have enough natural bone left in their jaw to support an implant. This may be due to a number of reasons, including gum disease, genetics, and aging. In this case, a bone graft may be necessary to replace the lost bone before an implant can be inserted. A bone graft is a surgical procedure in which damaged or diseased bone is replaced with new bone. Bone grafts can be harvested from another bone in your body (your hip or chin, for example), from a human or animal donor, or made from synthetic bone produced in a lab.
        In some cases, the implant and bone graft can be completed on the same day. This is known as one-stage implant placement. Candidates for one-stage implant placement must have very good bone density in the jawbone.
        Caring for dental implants
        Caring for an implant is the same as caring for the rest of your teeth and gums. That means brushing your teeth twice a day, flossing regularly, and visiting your dentist on a regular basis.
        While dental implants are not prone to decay, the tissue that surrounds the implant is just as susceptible to periodontal disease as the gums around your natural teeth. Your dental team may recommend special brushes that will help clean around your implants, depending on the design of your crowns.
        Potential risks and considerations
        Most dental implant procedures are successful. However, as with all surgeries, the procedure involves risks. Possible complications include:
        
          damage to the surrounding teeth during implant placement
          nerve damage to the surrounding area
          injury to the jawbone
          injury to tissue in the sinuses
          misaligned teeth that may affect your bite
          infection of the implant
          failure of the implant to fuse with surrounding bone.",Christina Frank,"December 10, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/gatorade-liquid-iv-do-you-need-extra-electrolytes,Gatorade. Liquid IV. Do you need extra electrolytes?,"Electrolytes have a well-deserved reputation for helping ward off dehydration and muscle cramps. But these essential minerals are found in plenty of the foods you're probably already eating. So when might you need extra from sports drinks or powders? Here's what you need to know before opting for an electrolyte supplement like Liquid IV or an electrolyte drink like Gatorade.
        What are electrolytes and why are they important?
        Electrolytes are minerals. When they dissolve in water, they gain an electric charge. That might sound dangerous, but it's actually key to a number of crucial bodily functions, including maintaining hydration, balancing your pH (a measure of acid-base balance), transporting waste out of your cells, supporting nerve and muscle function, and stabilizing your blood pressure.
        The most common electrolytes found in the body are:
        
          calcium
          chloride
          magnesium
          phosphorus
          potassium
          sodium.
        
        Without these minerals, your body wouldn't be able to function properly.
        What's in Gatorade, Liquid IV, and other electrolyte drinks?
        Electrolyte drinks contain water and electrolytes like citric acid, salt, and potassium citrate. Some also have added vitamins such as vitamin C, and vitamins B3, B5, and B6. But many electrolyte drinks also contain ingredients you may want to avoid, including a lot of sugar, other sweeteners, and artificial flavors and colors.
        Electrolyte packets have similar ingredients aside from the water, which you mix in yourself. You can also find electrolytes in many other forms, including tablets, capsules, and scoopable powders.
        When might you benefit from electrolyte drinks?
        If you're eating a balanced diet and don't participate in extreme physical activity, you're probably getting all the electrolytes you need from the foods you eat. Leafy greens, beans, tofu, fruits, vegetables, and table salt are all good dietary sources of electrolytes. In fact, many people get too much sodium because it's an ingredient in so many prepared and processed foods.
        Electrolyte drinks or supplements can be helpful if you're losing a lot of fluid through persistent vomiting or diarrhea. You might also need some extra electrolytes if you have a strenuous job or you frequently exercise at a high intensity, especially in hot or humid climates or at higher altitudes. That's because you lose electrolytes when you sweat.
        What are the downsides of electrolyte drinks?
        First, you may not need one. In many cases, water is all you need to stay hydrated. And money spent on unnecessary drinks or powders can add up over time.
        Depending on the electrolyte drink you pick, you might also end up consuming a lot of sugar or sodium. This could have negative consequences for your overall health if you make sports drinks a habit, especially if you already have underlying health conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure.
        Electrolyte drinks or plain water? Which to choose when you're exercising
        Most of the time, plain water is fine for rehydrating during or after any moderate-intensity activity that lasts under an hour. If you're relatively inactive, plain water is the best beverage to drink throughout your day to stay hydrated.
        Reserve sports drinks for rehydrating after high-intensity activity that lasts an hour or longer, during long workouts like a marathon, or throughout a full, physically demanding workday. You might also choose to reach for an electrolyte drink if you're exercising in hot or humid environments or at a higher altitude, or if you're sweating excessively while working out.",Sarah Klein,"December 6, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/eggs-protein-and-cholesterol-how-to-make-eggs-part-of-a-heart-healthy-diet,"Eggs, protein, and cholesterol: How to make eggs part of a heart-healthy diet","One large egg has 6 grams of protein and contains lots of healthy nutrients for just 70 calories per egg. That makes them a good choice for most people. Unfortunately, public awareness has lagged behind research findings about eggs and heart health.
        The humble chicken egg has had a checkered past in the nutrition world. Egg yolks contain cholesterol, so at one time it seemed logical to assume that eating eggs could raise your risk for cardiovascular disease. Many people still limit their egg consumption for this reason.
        But the scientific evidence around eggs and heart health has evolved. It's true that eggs are rich in dietary cholesterol. But we've learned that saturated fat and trans fat are far worse for your cardiovascular health than dietary cholesterol. The good news for egg lovers is that eggs contain very little saturated fat and no trans fat. So for most people, eating an egg a day won't negatively impact your heart health.
        How healthy are eggs?
        Eggs contain healthy vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and nutrients, including:
        
          the nutrient choline, which is good for your brain and your nerves (and particularly important for pregnant women)
          the minerals phosophorus, calcium, and potassium
          the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which are good for your eyes
          vitamins A, B, and D.
        
        One egg has only 1.24 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D. That's not a lot — a single serving of wild-caught salmon exceeds the recommended daily amount of 15 mcg. But egg yolks are one of the few naturally occurring food sources of vitamin D. So if you live in the Northern Hemisphere and have limited access to sun-induced vitamin D synthesis, eggs can help minimize a shortfall in vitamin D intake during the fall and winter months.
        How much protein is in an egg?
        A large egg has 6 grams of protein. The protein in eggs is considered high-quality protein because it contributes all nine essential amino acids. (These nine are considered essential because your body can't synthesize them on its own and must obtain them through your diet.) Each essential amino acid has unique functions, but eating a diet that includes all nine is necessary for your body to perform a range of critical tasks.
        The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.36 grams per pound of body weight. This tool from the USDA can help you calculate your exact need, but the average sedentary man needs about 56 grams of protein per day, and the average sedentary woman needs about 46 grams. You may need even more than that, based on your age, activity levels, and other factors.
        Health benefits of eating eggs
        In addition to being relatively low in calories and providing a wide range of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and nutrients, the protein in eggs can also help you feel fuller for longer by increasing the production of hormones that signal that you've eaten enough. Eating protein also reduces levels of ghrelin, the hormone that makes you feel hungry.
        Do you need to worry about cholesterol in eggs?
        While eggs yolks do contain cholesterol, we now know that most of the cholesterol in the body is made by the liver. That means our cholesterol levels aren't greatly affected when we eat foods, like eggs, that contain cholesterol.
        Instead, the liver is prompted to make cholesterol (which can increase risk of cardiovascular disease) based on the amount of saturated fat and trans fat in our diets. Eggs contain only a small amount of saturated fat — about 1.5 grams per egg — and no trans fats.
        How many eggs can you eat per week as part of a heart-healthy diet?
        Eating an egg per day is safe for most healthy people. And the benefits you get from the protein, vitamins, minerals, and relatively few calories in your eggs outweigh risks from the tiny amount of saturated fat that you also get in the egg yolk.
        But watch what you eat with your eggs. If you're eating sausage, bacon, or ham with your eggs — or cooking them in a lump of butter and then slathering them in cheese — you're right to be concerned about your heart health, because you're introducing saturated fat and sodium into your meal. Instead, try your eggs poached, hard-boiled, or cooked in a little olive oil and served alongside some cooked spinach or sauteed mushrooms.",Lindsay Warner,"December 5, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-a-quick-snooze-help-with-energy-and-focus-the-science-behind-power-naps,Can a quick snooze help with energy and focus? The science behind power naps,"If you need a quick pick-me-up during the day, a power nap can be just the thing to help restore mental clarity and fight off fatigue. Power naps can help boost productivity and improve overall well-being, especially when taken at the right time and for the right duration.
        What is a power nap?
        A power nap is a short nap that lasts anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Even though you're only resting for a short period of time, power naps can effectively increase your level of alertness and focus.
        How? Power naps allow your body and mind to rest without entering deeper stages of sleep. Once you enter deep sleep — typically about 30 minutes after you've fallen asleep — you are likely to experience ""sleep inertia"" upon waking. Sleep inertia is the drowsy feeling you may get when you wake up, in which you feel temporarily disorientated and are slower to react. It can take your body 30 to 60 minutes to recover from sleep inertia.
        Benefits of a quick snooze: An energy boost and mental clarity
        Naps offer several health benefits that can improve your quality of life. Studies show that naps can enhance mood, reduce fatigue, and improve alertness. Additional research has found that power naps may help decrease blood pressure and improve heart health, especially when taken in the early afternoon.
        Power naps may support work performance as well. Researchers at NASA found that pilots who napped 20 to 30 minutes were over 50% more alert and over 30% more proficient at their jobs than pilots who didn't nap.
        How long should a power nap be?
        Keep your power nap to 30 minutes or less to avoid sleep inertia.
        A shorter nap can also help you bypass some health risks associated with longer naps. For example, a study published in Obesity found that adults who napped longer than 30 minutes were more likely to experience higher blood pressure and blood sugar levels than people who did not nap. Short nappers did not share this increased risk.
        Set an alarm to ensure your nap doesn't exceed the 30-minute mark.
        Tips for a restorative power nap
        The following tips can help you get the biggest boost out of your power nap.
        Time it right. Aim to nap in the early afternoon, ideally between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., when your body naturally experiences a dip in energy. Napping too late in the day can interfere with nighttime sleep. That said, the ideal time to nap varies by individual. Some people may benefit from earlier naps depending on what time they wake up and go to sleep.
        Keep it short. Set an alarm to wake you after 20 to 30 minutes. A short nap will leave you refreshed rather than groggy.
        Create a cozy environment. Find a quiet, dark, and comfortable space where you won't be interrupted. If you're in a bright or noisy area, consider using an eye mask or earplugs to help you fall asleep faster.
        Listen to your body. If you frequently feel the need for a nap, it may be a sign of inadequate nighttime sleep. While a power nap can help boost energy in the short term, make sure you're prioritizing a good night's rest as well. Frequent daytime drowsiness can also be a sign of sleep apnea, a common disorder that causes people to stop breathing for short periods during sleep. Talk to your doctor if you are regularly sleepy during the day or if you're a loud snorer.
        Finally, napping is not for everyone. Some people may not feel refreshed even after a short nap. In that case, the best approach may be to avoid napping and focus on getting a good night's sleep.",Jenette Restivo,"December 4, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-latest-thinking-on-inherited-high-cholesterol,The latest thinking on inherited high cholesterol,"Nearly one-third of American adults have high levels of harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol circulating through their blood, which doubles their risk of heart disease compared to people with normal levels (see ""Classifying LDL level""). Most of these people likely have dozens of different genetic mutations, each of which raises LDL by a little bit. Over time — coupled with a less-than-ideal diet and not enough exercise — their LDL levels slowly creep up.
        But what about very high LDL? ""About 5% of the population have LDL values of 190 or higher, and their risk of heart disease is five times higher than people with near-optimal LDL,"" says Dr. Amit V. Khera, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Within this group, an important minority has familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic condition that affects about one in 250 adults.
        What is FH?
        Most people with FH have a mutation or variant in one of three different genes that provide instructions that help remove excess LDL from the bloodstream. People who inherit one variant from a parent have heterozygous FH, which can cause LDL levels as high as 350 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). People who inherit two variants (one from each parent) have homozygous FH. This very rare condition, which affects only about four in a million people, can lead to LDL levels as high as 1,000 mg/dL.
        Excess LDL in the bloodstream can accumulate in the skin and tendons, which is why some people with FH develop small, cholesterol-filled nodules on their eyelids or their tendons, especially those along the backs of the hands, the elbows, or the backs of the ankles (the Achilles tendons). But the biggest threat is the buildup of LDL in the arteries supplying the heart. People with untreated FH can succumb to a heart attack in their 40s or earlier, likely because of the cumulative exposure to high LDL starting at birth.
        
          
            
              
                Classifying LDL level
                These targets are for people without known heart disease. People who have heart disease or are at high risk for it should aim for an LDL of 70 or lower.

        Is genetic testing necessary?
        If a person's close relative — a parent or sibling — has very high cholesterol or had a heart attack at a young age (before 55 in a man or 65 in a woman), that's a red flag for possible FH. Genetic testing isn't strictly necessary, as high LDL is a reliable sign of heart disease risk in anyone, regardless of the cause.
        However, FH testing can be beneficial for two reasons, says Dr. Khera. ""First, if you've struggled your whole life with high cholesterol despite following a healthy diet and getting regular exercise, knowing there's a genetic explanation is often helpful."" Second, an FH diagnosis can be important for your biological parents, siblings, and children, each of whom has a 50/50 chance of having the same FH variant.
        Although guidelines recommend checking cholesterol levels in children and adolescents at least once between ages 9 and 11 and again between ages 17 and 21, such tests usually aren't done. And when high cholesterol is found, physicians typically don't treat children and teens very aggressively. But once they hit adulthood, treating very high cholesterol is crucial, says Dr. Khera. The Family Heart Foundation has more information on FH, including a tool to search for doctors who specialize in the condition.
        Treating very high LDL
        The latest cholesterol treatment guidelines emphasize the importance of lowering excessively high LDL and keeping it low for decades. ""It's most practical to focus on finding and treating severe hypercholesterolemia, regardless of the underlying cause,"" says Dr. Khera. The first choice is a high-intensity statin: 40 to 80 milligrams (mg) of atorvastatin (Lipitor) or 20 to 40 mg of rosuvastatin (Crestor), both of which will slash LDL by about 50%. While those drugs get many people with very high LDL close to the target range of 70 mg/dL for high-risk individuals, some need additional medications, which may include
        
          ezetimibe (Zetia), a pill that inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut
          bempedoic acid (Nexletol), a pill that blocks cholesterol production in the liver
          alirocumab (Praluent) or evolocumab (Repatha), injectable drugs that help remove excess LDL from the bloodstream
          inclisiran (Leqvio), a twice-yearly injection that interferes with a protein in the liver that regulates LDL.
        
        Following heart-healthy habits, as outlined in the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 is also crucial.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/try-this-build-a-healthier-sandwich,Try this: Build a healthier sandwich,"The benefit of making your own sandwiches is that you have complete control over what goes into them. A balanced sandwich-based lunch contains lean protein, whole grains, and a hefty serving of vegetables. To build a balanced sandwich, follow these five steps:
        STEP 1: Start with a healthful foundation. While bread is the standard go-to (choose whole-grain or oat-bran versions and look for the grain's name as the first ingredient on the package), there are other options, such as whole-wheat pita, tortillas, or flatbreads. Or go the breakfast route and try oat-bran English muffins or mini whole-wheat bagels.
        STEP 2: Spread on a flavorful accent. Try a small amount of guacamole, mustard, olive oil–based mayonnaise, pesto, roasted red pepper spread, salsa, or hummus.
        STEP 3: Add lean protein. Go for flaked water-packed tuna, grilled chicken, fresh turkey breast, low-fat cheese, hard-boiled egg, or beans like black, kidney, or garbanzo.
        STEP 4: Accessorize with produce. Consider romaine lettuce, spinach, flat-sliced carrots or celery, sliced apples, sliced red and green peppers, sliced cucumbers, tomato, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, pineapple slices, or snap peas.
        STEP 5: Top with layers. Finish with flavorful toppings like watercress, red onion, bean sprouts, or shredded cabbage.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-diseases-gender-bias,Inflammatory bowel disease's gender bias,"Just because a situation is equal doesn't make it equitable. Case in point: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — which has been diagnosed in about one of every 100 American adults — affects roughly equal numbers of both sexes. But the condition clearly inflicts a disproportionate burden on women, shaping symptoms, affecting reproductive decisions, and increasing risks of ominous downstream effects.
        IBD comprises both Crohn's disease — which can affect any part of the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus — and ulcerative colitis, which is limited to the colon. Diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, urgency, rectal bleeding, weight loss, and fatigue are commonplace among both men and women with the disorder. Some patients with IBD experience only mild symptoms, while others cope with much more severe cases. People with Crohn's, for instance, can develop abnormal, tunnel-like fistulas between their colon or rectum and nearby tissues such as the skin, bladder, or vagina.
        IBD's gender bias was highlighted by a study published in the February 2023 issue of the Journal of Personalized Medicine, which reported that women with the condition report more psychological distress and a worse quality of life than male peers. IBD can also be harder on women because of its array of specific effects on their reproductive and overall health, says Dr. Rachel Winter, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Formidable challenges
        Here's how IBD can affect women differently from men:
        Symptoms ramp up during menstruation. For many women, even without IBD, periods bring intestinal troubles such as abdominal pain, loose stools, or indigestion. For women with IBD, such overlapping symptoms can make them feel like they're having a flare even if they're not, Dr. Winter says.
        Sex can be painful. If Crohn's disease affects a part of the intestine near the perineum — the area between the vulva and anus — women can find vaginal sex excruciating. A fistula between the intestinal wall and the vagina can create the same issue, as can abdominal scar tissue from IBD-related surgeries.
        Even the idea of sex can be off-putting, since IBD patients may worry about passing stool during intercourse or feel inhibited if they have an ostomy bag that collects stool outside the abdomen.
        It may be harder to conceive. Fertility may suffer when rampant inflammation from IBD affects the fallopian tubes, where fertilization occurs. And IBD flares during pregnancy can raise the risk of complications such as low birth weight or premature birth. ""We have open conversations with all of our patients who are considering becoming pregnant in the near future, because certain medications shouldn't be taken during pregnancy,"" Dr. Winter says. ""We want to transition to medications that are safe if they conceive.""
        Women who take immunosuppressive drugs have a higher risk for cervical cancer. Certain IBD medications that suppress the immune system can raise the risk of abnormal cells developing on the cervix. Because of this, doctors advise women with IBD who take these drugs to undergo screening Pap tests more frequently than other women. IBD itself does not increase the risk for precancerous or cancerous changes of the cervix.
        Iron-deficiency anemia is more likely. Menstrual bleeding — which carries iron out of the body — already increases women's odds of anemia. Adding in digestive tract bleeding from IBD creates a double whammy. IBD also hinders the body's ability to absorb iron, increasing anemia risk.
        Osteoporosis risks increase. This bone-thinning disease already disproportionately strikes women over 50 compared to men. But women with IBD are especially at risk for osteoporosis even at younger ages, particularly if they've had problems absorbing nutrients or have taken the steroid prednisone, which weakens bones.
        Support tips
        How can women with IBD generate support for any sex-specific concerns? Dr. Winter offers these suggestions:
        Be candid. Sharing private, potentially embarrassing symptoms or downstream effects of IBD can be daunting. But it's vital to push past awkward moments and be frank with your doctor, who may be able to propose solutions you hadn't considered. ""Women should not be afraid to openly discuss any of these issues with their providers,"" she says.
        Look for dedicated IBD programs. Some academic medical centers have programs aimed directly at patients with IBD, increasing the chances that clinicians there will be well versed in women-specific concerns.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/digestive-health-changes-when-to-seek-medical-care,Digestive health changes: When to seek medical care,"It's been an eventful year in the world, and if it seems like it's been a bumpy ride for your gastrointestinal tract, too — with bouts of heartburn, diarrhea, or constipation — this is a good time to consider whether you've been experiencing temporary symptoms or signs of something more serious or chronic.
        Identify your distress
        The first step in understanding gastrointestinal distress is putting a name to the problem.
        Heartburn. This fiery feeling in your chest is usually caused by stomach acid that leaks upward into the esophagus (the tube connecting your mouth and stomach). It occurs when the ring of muscles that normally stop leakage temporarily loosen or aren't working well. Heartburn might also cause a sore throat, a cough, or a metallic taste after meals.
        Constipation. If you're not having a bowel movement at least three times a week, that's considered constipation. Or if your stool is hard and lumpy and you strain to get it out or you have the feeling you aren't evacuating completely, that's also constipation.
        Diarrhea. Diarrhea is watery, unformed stool. It usually doesn't feel great as it's brewing in your gut, and it's often uncomfortable to pass it.
        What's causing the trouble?
        The digestive tract is a sophisticated yet sensitive system that can be disrupted anywhere along its route from the mouth to the anus—and it doesn't take much to cause temporary discomfort.
        For example, stress can slow digestion and cause constipation, increase acid production and trigger heartburn, or speed digestion and send you running for the bathroom with diarrhea. ""We call the gastrointestinal tract the 'second nervous system.' There are many nerve endings going to all parts of it, including the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Stress might result in the brain telling the tract how to react, even when there might not be anything wrong structurally,"" says Dr. Alexander Goldowsky, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Other possible causes of occasional gastrointestinal problems include your diet, weight gain, an infection, or a medication side effect.
        Coping with occasional bouts
        If you've been experiencing new digestive issues, try making a few changes to see if symptoms go away in a few days or weeks.
        For heartburn. Two approaches can help. One is using over-the-counter medications. Dr. Goldowsky recommends taking a fast-acting drug that targets stomach acid. Examples include calcium carbonate (Tums), aluminum hydroxide (Mylanta), and H2 blockers such as famotidine (Pepcid) and cimetidine (Tagamet).
        The other approach is making lifestyle changes. Avoid foods and drinks that seem to trigger your heartburn, such as spicy, fatty, or tomato-based foods; citrus; garlic; onion; peppermint; and anything with caffeine, such as chocolate, tea, or coffee.
        Also: eat smaller meals, stay upright for at least two hours after meals, avoid drinking alcohol or eating late at night, and sleep on a wedge pillow.
        For constipation. To combat constipation, Dr. Goldowsky advises taking a powdered fiber supplement that you add to food or drinks, such as Metamucil, Benefiber, or Citrucel. ""Fiber is a miracle. It helps stool form a shape and get out, so you feel empty,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        He also recommends increasing fiber in your diet (great sources include beans, lentils, peas, whole grains, berries, nuts, seeds, artichokes, pumpkin, and brussels sprouts). ""Your total goal should be around 30 grams of fiber per day,"" he says, ""but it's hard to reach that goal with food. That's why the supplement is important.""
        Other ways to fight constipation include drinking more fluids to help stool move along, and exercising every day (which keeps the muscles in your intestines strong).
        For diarrhea. Dr. Goldowsky recommends using a fiber supplement for this problem, too, since fiber helps stool form properly. It's also essential to stay hydrated to replace fluids you're losing through diarrhea.
        Additionally, it's a good idea to keep track of foods that might be triggering diarrhea. Common culprits include dairy foods; foods that contain gluten, artificial sweeteners, or caffeine; fried, fatty, spicy, or sugary foods; and foods with natural sugars that are difficult for some people to digest, such as those in wheat, rye, onions, garlic, legumes (chickpeas, lentils, beans), honey, pistachios, cashews, asparagus, artichokes, and sun-dried tomatoes.
        It might also help to take an anti­diarrheal medication such as loperamide (Imodium).
        ""Medications for diarrhea are helpful, but they can overdo it and cause constipation. Take a few doses and see how you feel, then gradually reduce the amount you're taking,"" Dr. Goldowsky says.
        When to call your doctor
        Call your doctor immediately if your symptoms include bloody stools, fever, loss of bowel control, severe pain, or severe dehydration. If you don't have those symptoms but you do have heartburn, diarrhea, or constipation that isn't going away after a week or two of home remedies, it's time to see your doctor. ""We don't want to miss colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""These are unlikely causes of such symptoms, but we need to rule them out.""
        Your physician will also rule out other disorders that can cause gastrointestinal problems (such as low thyroid function), gut changes that affect how fast food moves through the digestive tract, and medication side effects that might be causing trouble.
        The encouraging news is that there's usually a way to treat the problem, including specialized diets, physical therapy, or medications. ""Don't give up. We can get you feeling better,"" Dr. Goldowsky says. ""My goal is for you to be able to control or eliminate your symptoms so you can function well and have a better quality of life.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/ichthyosis-a-to-z,Ichthyosis,"What is ichthyosis?
        Ichthyosis is the term for severe, persistent problems with dry skin that almost always start in childhood or infancy. Ichthyosis can be genetic (inherited) or can develop later in life. In a large majority of people with the disease, the cause is related to one or more genetic mutations.
        Under normal circumstances, the body continuously renews its skin surface, building new skin cells and allowing older cells to be shed from the surface. Ichthyosis disrupts this balance, either because too many replacement skin cells are produced or because the skin cells do not separate well from the skin surface when it is their time to drop off. The result is that skin cells accumulate into thick flakes that adhere to the body and can resemble fish scales.
        Ichthyosis often causes severe cosmetic concerns for the person with the condition. However, it is not a contagious disease. The condition also can interfere with the skin's critical roles in protecting against infection, preventing dehydration, and regulating body temperature.
        Most people with ichthyosis have ichthyosis vulgaris, the mildest form of the disease. It occurs in one out of every 250 people.
        Symptoms of ichthyosis
        Depending on the type of gene abnormality that causes ichthyosis, the skin can show different patterns of flaking. In most cases of ichthyosis vulgaris, for example, skin will flake over the majority of the body, but not on the inside surfaces of joints, in the groin area, or on the face.
        Symptoms of all genetic types of ichthyosis are either noticeable at birth or appear during childhood. Symptoms may include:
        
          severe dryness of the skin with thickening and flaking, which may be appear only in limited areas or may involve almost the entire skin surface
          mild itching of the skin
          body odor, because the spaces under and between skin flakes can harbor collections of bacteria or fungus
          wax buildup in the ears, causing hearing difficulties.
        
        Certain genetic conditions affect other parts of the body besides the skin, including nerve damage, deafness, or loss of the sense of smell. Adults may develop ichthyosis due to certain cancers such as lymphoma.
        Skin dryness is usually worse in winter months and in dry climates, because warmth and humidity improve these symptoms. Many people who have ichthyosis vulgaris also have allergic problems such as allergic nasal congestion, asthma, or eczema.
        Diagnosing ichthyosis
        A doctor usually can diagnose ichthyosis by looking at the skin. A family history is also very useful. In some cases, a skin biopsy will be done to help to confirm the diagnosis. In a biopsy, a small piece of skin is removed and examined under a microscope. In rare instances, genetic testing may be helpful in making a diagnosis.
        Expected duration of ichthyosis
        Most cases of ichthyosis have a genetic basis and wills last a lifetime. Sometimes, adult onset ichthyosis occurs in association with a disease, and if the disease can be treated, the ichthyosis may go away. In most people, symptoms can be controlled.
        Preventing ichthyosis
        There is no way to prevent ichthyosis. As with other genetic diseases, there is a risk that children of an affected parent will inherit the gene.
        Treating ichthyosis
        Treatment of all types of ichthyosis involves restoring the skin's moisture and facilitating more aggressive shedding of dead skin cells. Regular visits to a dermatologist can help when ichthyosis causes severe symptoms.
        To get the best results, use moisture-retaining creams or ointments after a bath or shower, so that moisture is maintained within the skin surface. Petrolatum, lanolin, or urea-containing preparations are very helpful in maintaining skin moisture.
        Also helpful are medicines that promote shedding of skin flakes. These include lotions or creams that contain lactic acid or other alpha-hydroxy acids.
        If the ichthyosis leads to scratching that causes skin infections, or if body odor is a major problem, antibiotics may be needed from time to time.
        When to call a professional
        Because ichthyosis can make the skin a less effective barrier to infection, it is important to contact a physician if you develop a fever or redness of the skin.
        Prognosis
        With continued effective treatment and good advice about skin care, ichthyosis is usually very manageable. Some forms of ichthyosis improve after childhood. Rare forms of ichthyosis can be life-threatening, even in infancy, if skin problems are severe or if the condition is associated with serious disease in other parts of the body.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/forearm-workouts-strengthening-grip-for-everyday-function,Forearm workouts: Strengthening grip for everyday function,"When you think about building strength, your mind might immediately go to strength-training workouts for the larger muscles in your body such as your back, chest, or legs.

But the muscles of the forearm — the part of the arm that extends from the elbow to the wrist — are also worth paying attention to.

Why grip strength matters

Strong forearms support grip strength, which plays an important role in how well you can grasp and hold items. Think squeezing a tube of toothpaste, turning a doorknob, or holding a glass of water.

Research has also found that grip strength is associated with many measures of overall health, especially as you age. A weak grip is associated with:


	lower total strength
	reduced bone mineral density
	falls and fractures
	sleep problems
	memory problems
	depression
	malnutrition
	death from any cause.


How strengthening forearms can improve grip

Many of the muscles that help your hand and wrist grip something solidly extend into your forearms. One study found that having larger forearm muscles was correlated with greater grip strength. Strengthening forearm muscles can help you perform gripping and grasping movements more effectively and efficiently

As of now, there's no evidence that building forearm muscles and grip strength will improve longevity or overall health. However, increased grip strength will support your ability to perform gripping and grasping tasks — from opening jars to holding a cane and opening doors — that could help you stay independent longer.

Simple forearm exercises to boost grip strength

Some of the best forearm workouts involve surprisingly simple movements. Start with one set of 10 repetitions for each of the following strength exercises. Build up to two to three sets over time.

You'll need a set of light dumbells (1 to 3 pounds) and some therapy putty (start with the softest putty), which you can purchase at a medical supply store, to perform these exercises.

Wrist extension and flexion




	Hold a light dumbbell (1 to 3 pounds) in each hand.
	Keep your arms at your sides with your elbows bent, palms facing down.
	Moving from your wrist, lift the weights upward until you feel a gentle stretch on the inside of your wrist.
	Hold for a count of five.
	Then bend your wrist and lower the weights down until you feel a gentle stretch on the outside of your wrist.
	Hold for a count of five.
	Continue for 10 repetitions.


Wrist supination/pronation




	Hold a light dumbbell (1 to 3 pounds) in each hand.
	Keep your arms at your sides with your elbows bent, palms facing down.
	Rotate your forearm, so your palm faces up. Hold for a count of five.
	Then rotate your forearm so your palm faces down. Hold for a count of five.
	Continue for 10 repetitions.


Putty grip




	Roll the putty into a ball.
	Place the putty in your palm.
	Gently squeeze and release.
	Repeat 10 times on each hand every other day.


Putty three-point pinch




	Roll the putty into a short, fat cylinder.
	Place the putty between the pads of your thumb and your index and middle fingers.
	Gently squeeze the putty between your fingers and thumb and release.
	Repeat 10 times on each hand every other day.


Some people also use tools called hand grippers or grip strengtheners for a few minutes each day to build grip strength. There are many different models available online and in fitness stores.

Gadgets to help compensate for reduced grip strength

Forearm workouts only go so far. Sometimes you need a little assistance to accomplish tasks like opening a stubborn jar or confidently holding a sharp knife.

There are a number of tools and gadgets that can help. These are often available at medical supply stores or online. They include:


	electric can openers
	jar key openers
	nonslip gripper mats to open jars
	rocker knives
	dental floss holders
	soap-on-a-rope
	shoehorns
	doorknob extenders
	book stands
	nonslip gloves.",Sarah Klein,"November 22, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/botulism-a-to-z,Botulism,"What is botulism?
        Botulism is a form of poisoning caused by exposure to Clostridium botulinum bacteria. These bacteria manufacture a chemical poison known as botulinum toxin that interferes with muscle function in many areas of the body, causing paralysis of individual muscles or groups of muscles. Exposure to this toxin is life-threatening, since one of the muscles it can paralyze is the diaphragm, the muscle that controls breathing.
        
          
        
        You can be exposed to the bacteria causing botulism in several ways, the most familiar being by eating contaminated food. In most food-borne cases of botulism in adults, home-canned foods are responsible. The bacteria that cause botulism exist in dirt and dust as a spore, but this form is inactive and does not produce toxin. However, when a spore is moved into a low-oxygen environment such as an enclosed jar or can, it can reproduce and make its dangerous toxin.
        Home-canned vegetables that are not highly acidic (asparagus, green beans, peppers, beets, and corn) are good incubators for botulism bacteria, unless they are heat-treated appropriately to kill the spores during the canning process and eaten quickly after opening. The bacteria can release large quantities of toxin into the canned food jar, causing botulism symptoms in people who sample the produce. Home-canned, smoked, or fermented fish is also a risk.
        Recent outbreaks have been reported from commercial carrot juice and home-canned bamboo shoots. In the United States, roughly 100 people become ill with botulism each year. About a quarter are due to consumption of contaminated food. Most cases today (about 70%) occur in infants. Babies less than 1 year old, especially those that are breastfeeding, have a different intestinal system than adults. Spores swallowed by an adult with a mature digestive tract usually will remain in their hibernating, inactive state. But spores ingested by a young infant can reproduce and can form toxin that is absorbed into the bloodstream, causing botulism.
        In one out of five cases of botulism in infants, the infant has eaten raw honey. More rarely, botulism spores are found in corn syrup. Since the majority of cases of infant botulism can't be traced to a food source, experts suspect that babies are exposed simply by swallowing small amounts of dust or dirt.
        Rarely, botulism is the result of a contaminated wound. Most wound botulism today occurs in people who inject or snort recreational drugs.
        Symptoms of botulism
        All of the symptoms of botulism are the result of nerve paralysis during exposure to the toxin. Symptoms usually begin within one to two days after eating contaminated food. Symptoms of infant botulism and wound botulism also appear suddenly.
        The earliest symptoms involve the eyes and face, because nerves controlling their function are affected most quickly by the botulism toxin. Early or mild symptoms, which may go away on their own, include:
        
          abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (not usually present in wound botulism)
          double vision, blurred vision (especially when viewing close objects), or drooping eyelids
          dryness of the mouth.
        
        More severe cases can cause these additional symptoms:
        
          slurred or garbled speech
          difficulty swallowing
          muscle weakness in arms or legs; general fatigue
          difficulty breathing, sometimes severe
          in infants, usually constipation at first; also lethargy and a ""floppy"" neck, arms, and legs, demonstrating weak muscles; difficulty feeding; failure to cry well.
        
        Diagnosing botulism
        If your doctor suspects botulism after asking you about your medical history and examining you, both blood and stool samples may be tested to check for the presence of botulinum toxin. Generally these tests are done in a government laboratory that specializes in detecting botulism. Sometimes botulism bacteria can be grown from a stool sample.
        Botulism is uncommon enough that your doctor will consider other explanations for your symptoms. In most cases, several other tests will be ordered:
        
          a brain scan, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, to check for other diagnoses such as stroke
          blood tests to check for Lyme disease
          a lumbar puncture to help to distinguish botulism from a similar illness called Guillain-Barre syndrome
          an electromyogram, a test of nerve and muscle function, to determine if the problem might be another muscle-weakening disease such as polymyositis or myasthenia gravis.
        
        Once definite evidence of botulism is found with laboratory tests, usually no additional testing is needed.
        Expected duration of botulism
        Most paralysis symptoms of botulism last for several weeks and then slowly go away in the following months. Sometimes fatigue and shortness of breath can last for years.
        Preventing botulism
        You can prevent food-borne botulism with careful food-handling techniques:
        
          When home canning, use a pressure cooker that can reach temperatures adequate to kill botulism spores. Preserved food should be heated above 248º F (120º C) for at least five minutes during the canning process. Some foods, such as jams and jellies, do not require a pressure cooker because their high sugar level makes it difficult for Clostridium botulinum bacteria to grow.
          Do not eat or store cooked foods that have stayed at room temperature for more than four hours.
          Do not eat or even taste canned goods from a jar that has a bulging lid or a bad odor.
          Do not leave foil-wrapped baked potatoes at room temperature. They should be served hot or refrigerated.
          Do not store chopped garlic or onions in oil at room temperature.
          If you are eating home-canned fish or vegetables, first boil the food for 10 minutes with frequent stirring. This will destroy any botulinum toxin that has been produced in storage.
          Do not feed honey or corn syrup to infants less than 1 year old.
        
        To prevent wound botulism, do not use recreational injected drugs. Report deep wounds promptly to a physician.
        Treating botulism
        Botulism usually requires hospitalization, sometimes for a prolonged time. The main treatment for botulism is administration of an antitoxin (a chemical antidote to the toxin), and good nursing support and physician care, sometimes in an intensive care unit, with machine support by a ventilator as needed to assist breathing. If antitoxin is given early in the course of the disease, it will prevent further paralysis from the toxin, but it does not affect symptoms that are already present. Physical therapy can be helpful in aiding recovery of muscle strength.
        Infants with botulism present a special challenge: They are treated with antitoxin but are not given antibiotics because killing the botulism bacteria in their gut can cause a sudden release of more antitoxin. Instead, medicines that cause vomiting or treatments such as enemas are used to remove undigested food from the gut.
        Wounds that are a source of botulism must be treated with surgery to remove contaminated tissue.
        When to call a professional
        Botulism can worsen rapidly and is a life-threatening emergency. If you or your infant has symptoms of botulism and these symptoms do not have a known explanation, you should contact a physician immediately.
        Prognosis
        Although botulism can cause severe and prolonged symptoms, most people recover completely from the illness. Early treatment reduces the risk of permanent disability and death.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/7-ways-to-snack-smarter,7 ways to snack smarter,"Choosing the right snacks can be a game-changer for maintaining energy and overall health, but looks can be deceiving when it comes to nutrition. Many snacks marketed as ""healthy,"" like bran muffins and cereal bars, are actually loaded with hidden sugars and unhealthy fats. Even ""fat-free"" options can sneak in excess salt and sugar to make up for the flavor loss, which may ultimately do more harm than good. Knowing what to look for can help you enjoy satisfying, nourishing snacks that support your goals rather than derail them.
        
          Here are 7 tips for smarter snacking.
        
        
          Go for the grain. Whole-grain snacks can give you energy with staying power. Try some whole-grain low-salt pretzels or tortilla chips, or a serving of high-fiber cereals.
          Bring back breakfast. Many breakfast foods can be repurposed as a nutritious snack later in the day. How about a slice of whole-grain toast topped with low-sugar jam? Low-sugar granola also makes a quick snack.
          Try a ""high-low"" combination. Combine a small amount of a food with healthy fat, like peanut butter, with a larger amount of a very light food, like apple slices or celery sticks.
          Go nuts. Unsalted nuts and seeds make great snacks. Almonds, walnuts, peanuts, roasted pumpkin seeds, cashews, hazelnuts, filberts, and other nuts and seeds contain many beneficial nutrients and are more likely to leave you feeling full (unlike chips or pretzels). Nuts have lots of calories, though, so keep portion sizes small.
          The combo snack. Try to have more than just one macronutrient (protein, fat, carbohydrate) at each snacking session. For example, have a few nuts (protein and fat) and some grapes (carbohydrates). Or try some whole-grain crackers (carbohydrate) with some low-fat cheese (protein and fat). These balanced snacks tend to keep you feeling satisfied.
          Snack mindfully. Don't eat your snack while doing something else — like surfing the Internet, watching TV, or working at your desk. Instead, stop what you're doing for a few minutes and eat your snack like you would a small meal.
          Take it with you. Think ahead and carry a small bag of healthful snacks in your pocket or purse so you won't turn in desperation to the cookies at the coffee counter or the candy bars in the office vending machine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/do-you-need-diagnostic-tests-for-heartburn,Do you need diagnostic tests for heartburn?,"You just enjoyed a delicious meal, but now there's a burning feeling creeping up your chest—classic heartburn. Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or ""acid reflux,"" which occurs when stomach acid flows back into the esophagus.  But sometimes, this pain can be so intense it mimics a heart attack, making you wonder if it's something more serious.
        While doctors often skip extensive tests for straightforward cases, certain red flags—like trouble swallowing, internal bleeding, or severe, unresponsive symptoms—can call for deeper investigation. Here's a look at some of the diagnostic tests your doctor might recommend to get to the root of persistent heartburn.
        
          Upper GI endoscopy. This is the most commonly ordered initial test when people have worrisome symptoms. For this test, a person receives intravenous medicine to induce relaxation. It's called conscious sedation. The doctor sprays a local anesthetic in the back of the throat to prevent gagging. Next the doctor inserts a flexible tube called an endoscope down the throat. The tube has a light and camera attached, which let the doctor inspect the lining of the esophagus, stomach and first part of the small intestine to look for areas of irritation, ulcers, or strictures. Special tools can be inserted through the endoscope to take a biopsy (tissue sample), if necessary.
          Barium study. After drinking a liquid barium mixture, a person has an x-ray of the chest and upper abdomen. Barium helps define the esophagus on the x-ray image and can help the physician identify problems such as a hiatal hernia, esophageal ulcers, or a stricture (narrowing) of the esophagus. This test is called an upper GI series when the stomach and first part of the small intestine are also examined.
          pH monitoring. This test is used less frequently than those described above. It monitors a person's reflux episodes over 24 hours via a thin, acid sensing probe inserted through the nose and positioned at the bottom of the esophagus just above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This is an excellent method for documenting acid reflux in people who have unexplained chest pain, coughing, wheezing, or hoarseness. It's also used to assess the effectiveness of acid-suppressing drugs when symptoms persist. A wireless form of the pH monitor is contained in a capsule and looks like a pill. It is placed in the esophagus and can be used to monitor pH levels for 48 hours, during periods while the person is both on and off acid-suppressing therapy. The wireless pH system is particularly useful in people who do not respond to PPIs.
          Impedance testing. This test can be done at the same time as pH monitoring. It measures how well food and gas pass through the esophagus and is a good way to evaluate both acid- and non-acid reflux.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/bouncing-back-from-stress,Bouncing back from stress,"We all experience stress in our lives. Traffic. Monthly bills. Health concerns. Relationship issues. Because the mind and body are so closely linked, these constant worries can take a toll on health, contributing to a host of diseases.
        While you can't erase all sources of stress, you can learn how to reduce stress and also build resilience—which is your ability to bounce back from stress.
        William James was a notable Harvard philosopher-psychologist of the late 19th century and a graduate of Harvard Medical School. James was also a stressed-out melancholic. He marveled at people he called ""the healthy-minded""—optimistic and positive people who appeared to live hap­pier and healthier lives. Amid the run-of-the-mill volatility everyone must deal with, James observed that the healthy-minded seemed to turn challenges and potential failures into grist for opportunities and successes.
        The characteristics that James saw as ""healthy-minded,"" statistician and risk-management specialist Nassim Nicholas Taleb called ""antifragile."" In his book Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder, Taleb defines fragility as the tendency to be damaged by volatility and uncertainty—the kinds of things that often create a chronic stress response.
        By contrast, says Taleb, the antifragile person realizes that stress is just the price we pay for being alive. Cultivating anti­fragility helps us use our strengths to overcome chal­lenges and become stronger in the process.
        A prime example of antifragility is the Navy Seals. The Seals are able to manage high degrees of stress and still function admirably. Faced with life-threatening situations, they can rapidly change the focus of their attention and address the issue at hand efficiently and flexibly.
        
          Brain scans show that Seals have altered acti­vation in a prefrontal brain region called the insula, which is involved in managing stress signals. As a group, Navy Seals exhibit at least seven characteris­tics of resilient people:
        
        
          Calm, innovative, nondogmatic thinking
          The ability to act decisively
          Tenacity
          Inter­personal connectedness
          Honesty
          Self-control
          Optimism and a positive perspective on life.
        
        Whether adopting a ""healthy-minded"" mindset, cultivating antifragility, or thinking like a Navy Seal, building resilience is a powerful tool against stress. People tend to think of resilience as a trait that you either have or don't have, but it's actually a capacity that you can develop with the right approach.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/emlisteriaem-how-to-protect-yourself-from-this-common-cause-of-food-poisoning,Listeria: How to protect yourself from this common cause of food poisoning,"Listeria infection is rare compared to other types of food-borne illness. But outbreaks from deli meats and other foods do occur from time to time.
        What is Listeria?
        Listeria infection is a food-borne illness caused by bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes. A Listeria infection is also called listeriosis. Most people develop listeriosis from eating contaminated foods.
        Food poisoning from Listeria can be dangerous, or even deadly. About 1,600 people get a Listeria infection each year in the U.S., and about 260 people die from the disease.
        How Listeria causes food poisoning
        The bacteria that cause listeriosis can be found in moist environments, including soil, water, and decaying vegetation. Animals can also carry Listeria bacteria in their intestines without getting sick themselves. As a result, tood can become infected with Listeria during harvesting, processing, preparation, or storage.
        If contaminated food is eaten, the bacteria can cause food poisoning.
        Symptoms of listeriosis
        The symptoms of listeriosis vary depending on whether the infection is limited to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or has spread beyond the gut.
        People infected with Listeria may feel symptoms within a few hours or days after eating contaminated food. Intestinal symptoms include diarrhea and vomiting. Symptoms usually resolve within three days, and most people feel better with rest and drinking plenty of fluids.
        Invasive listeriosis, the term for listeriosis that spreads beyond the GI tract, can take several weeks to cause symptoms. Symptoms of invasive Listeria infection include:
        
          fever
          muscle aches
          fatigue
          headache
          stiff neck
          gastroenteritis
          confusion
          loss of balance
          seizures.
        
        A severe Listeria infection may spread to the bloodstream or brain. Severe infections may cause life-threatening conditions such as sepsis, meningitis, or encephalitis.
        Some pregnant women who develop listeriosis have no symptoms or have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, or a serious infection in the newborn.
        Foods most likely to be contaminated with Listeria
        The foods that are most likely to be contaminated with Listeria include:
        
          deli meats
          hot dogs
          unpasteurized raw milk
          unpasteurized soft cheeses
          raw sprouts
          smoked seafood.
        
        While these foods have the highest risk of Listeria monocytogenes contamination, listeriosis can affect almost any improperly handled or prepared food.
        How to reduce your risk of food poisoning
        Some tips to reduce your risk of food poisoning from listeriosis or other food-borne illnesses, such as Salmonella poisoning, include the following:
        
          Set your refrigerator at 40o  F (4o C) or lower and your freezer at 0o F (andndash;18 o C). Those temperatures can slow the growth of Listeria, which can grow even in cold temperatures. Use a refrigerator thermometer and adjust the settings if necessary.
          Use refrigerated foods by the date listed on the package. The longer you keep them, the higher the risk of Listeria growing.
          Clean your refrigerator regularly, and wipe up spills right away so Listeria doesn't have a place to grow.
        
        Other steps you can take to reduce your risk of food poisoning include washing your hands before and after handling food, and using separate cutting boards and utensils for produce and raw meats or seafood.
        A food thermometer can help ensure that meat, poultry, fish, and other foods are cooked to a safe internal temperature.
        Raw pet food is another potential source of Listeria contamination, so take care when preparing your pet's meals.
        Who is at greatest risk for severe illness from Listeria?
        People at greatest risk for severe illness from Listeria include pregnant women, newborn babies, people ages 65 and older, and people with a weakened immune system, such as those being treated for cancer.
        Listeria can harm a fetus even if the mother has mild symptoms. About one in four pregnant women who get listeriosis will miscarry or lose their baby shortly after birth.
        What to know about food recalls
        When a number of people get sick from eating or drinking the same contaminated food, it's defined as a food-borne disease outbreak. This can lead to a food recall by the U.S. government.
        If a food in your home matches the details on a food recall notice, don't open or consume the product. Instead, bring the product to the place where you bought it for a refund, or dispose of it to make sure no one will consume it.
        FoodSafety.gov, a U.S. government website, maintains a current list of food recalls and food-borne disease outbreaks, and advises what to do with a recalled product.
        Treating food poisoning caused by Listeria
        Most people with intestinal symptoms of listeriosis, such as vomiting and diarrhea, recover within a couple of days with rest and fluids.
        Women who are pregnant will be prescribed an antibiotic to treat listeriosis. Antibiotics are also prescribed to people who are very ill or who are at risk of becoming very ill with an invasive Listeria infection.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","November 15, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-probiotics-help-calm-inflammatory-bowel-disease-202411133081,Can probiotics help calm inflammatory bowel disease?,"Approximately three million Americans have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is an umbrella term for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, illnesses marked by chronic or repeated bouts of inflammation in the digestive tract. Both types of IBD represent a complex interplay of genes, environment, and immune factors.

Current therapies for IBD suppress the immune system to reduce inflammation. But emerging research on the human microbiome may help scientists better understand and manage IBD. And some preliminary studies on cells, animals, and humans have investigated whether probiotics — which are sometimes called ""good"" bacteria — are beneficial for people with IBD.

The healthy microbiome: Building a barrier

The human intestinal microbiome is the vast community of trillions of helpful and harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms that inhabit our gut. Ideally, the lining of the gut acts as a barrier that prevents harmful bacteria and toxins from entering the bloodstream.

A healthy microbiome helps this lining block out harmful bacteria while enabling it to absorb nutrients. Beneficial bacteria in the microbiome promote a healthy, hospitable gut environment that limits inflammation and helps crowd out harmful bacteria.

Recent studies on human cells and in mice suggest that a healthy microbiome produces substances that


	nourish cells lining the colon, so that they form a tight barrier difficult for harmful bacteria to penetrate
	interact with immune cells in the gut, reducing inflammation
	prompt the gut lining to make mucus that acts as an additional barrier to harmful bacteria.


In animal studies, a healthy microbiome is essential to help build and maintain an effective barrier. Animals raised in the laboratory without a microbiome, or whose microbiome has been depleted by antibiotics, have intestinal linings that are easily damaged.

An unbalanced microbiome: Inflammation and damage

What happens if the microbiome doesn't have a good balance of helpful and harmful bacteria? The gut lining may become increasingly permeable. That may allow potentially harmful bacteria and their toxins to cross into the intestinal tissue and then into the bloodstream, triggering inflammation that can damage the gut.

An imbalanced microbiome is known as dysbiosis. And the inflammatory cascade linked to dysbiosis is a hallmark of IBD.

Probiotics: More promise than evidence

Probiotics — live microorganisms in supplements or in fermented foods like kombucha, kefir, yogurt, and sauerkraut — have been proposed as therapies for IBD. The idea is that by eating beneficial bacteria we can restore and maintain a balanced microbiome, reduce inflammation, and improve the gut barrier. But what does the evidence say?

Thus far, no probiotic therapy is routinely prescribed for IBD. Small randomized studies have compared specific probiotics with standard immunosuppressive therapies for IBD. The studies measured IBD symptoms, remission rates, or quality of life. Results were mixed at best:


	Ulcerative colitis. Some studies suggest that certain bacterial strains, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, are somewhat effective for ulcerative colitis, reducing symptoms, promoting remission, and improving quality of life. But these effects are modest compared to standard therapies, and probiotics have not shown enough benefit to be accepted in medical practice.
	Pouchitis. Some people with IBD may need surgery to remove the colon (large intestine). This can lead to inflammation in the remaining small intestine, which gets formed into a J-shaped pouch and attached to the anus. However, 25% to 45% of people who have a J-pouch later experience inflammation known as pouchitis. Several studies show that combining standard medication with a probiotic mix called VSL#3 effectively quells the symptoms and inflammation of pouchitis. VSL#3 contains eight strains of bacteria. It is used to treat chronic pouchitis, which is the only accepted use of probiotics in common practice for IBD.
	Crohn's disease. Probiotics have not been studied as rigorously in Crohn's disease as in ulcerative colitis. Most of the limited set of studies found that probiotics are no better than placebo in reducing symptoms or promoting remission.


Diet, fiber, and prebiotics: A role in IBD?

The makeup and activity of our microbiomes can be altered by diet. That's true even if the foods you consume aren't well-known probiotic stars like kombucha, yogurt, kefir, and other fermented foods.

Gut bacteria that break down dietary fiber are a cornerstone of a healthy microbiome. A high-fiber diet can boost the number of these bacteria, as well as their beneficial and anti-inflammatory effects.

Food ingredients that are not absorbed by the gut but are instead consumed by the gut microbiome are called prebiotics. We have limited — though promising — evidence supporting prebiotics for people with IBD. Currently, no specific prebiotic food or supplement is recommended for general use.

However, the Mediterranean diet, which encourages fiber-rich vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, may modestly reduce symptoms and markers of inflammation in IBD. While these effects are small and inconsistent, the Mediterranean diet improves overall health in people with or without IBD. Largely for this reason, the American Gastroenterology Association recommends it for people who have IBD.

The bottom line

Probiotics, and possibly even prebiotics, hold promise. But we don't yet know how to harness their full potential for treating IBD. While current evidence suggests probiotics may one day be an effective way to help treat IBD, the complexity of the microbiome means that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to work.

Many questions remain: Which strains of bacteria in the gut should we study? How do we determine the best cocktail of probiotics to reap maximum benefit? Given that everyone's microbiome is different, is a personalized approach to probiotics the right strategy? How can we define ideal dosage and formulation of probiotics?

Delivery method (capsules, powders, foods), dosage, and duration of treatment all require more research. Until these questions are answered, probiotics and prebiotics remain complementary strategies in treating IBD alongside standard immunosuppressive therapies.","Jake Dockterman, MD, PhD","November 13, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/digestive-enzymes-how-supplements-like-lactaid-and-beano-can-help-with-digestion,Digestive enzymes: How supplements like Lactaid and Beano can help with digestion,"If you're struggling with bloating or discomfort after consuming dairy, beans, or certain vegetables, digestive enzyme supplements might be what your body needs to process these tricky foods.

What are digestive enzyme supplements?

There's a lot that goes on behind the scenes during digestion. As food makes its way through your gastrointestinal (GI) tract, your digestive organs break it down into smaller parts, in part by using digestive juices. Digestive juices contain enzymes that break down food into smaller components of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. There are different enzymes for different components; for example, the enzyme amylase breaks down carbohydrates, the enzyme protease breaks down proteins, and the enzyme lipase breaks down fats.

Your pancreas, stomach, and small intestine naturally produce these enzymes. However, sometimes the body doesn't produce enough enzymes. This can slow down digestion and lead to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and gas.

Sometimes people can't make enough digestive enzymes because of a health condition like chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis. In these cases, a doctor will prescribe enzyme pills to substitute for the lack of natural enzyme production.

However, in cases of lactose intolerance or difficulty digesting complex carbohydrates found in beans and certain gas-producing vegetables, over-the-counter (OTC) digestive enzyme supplements may be enough improve digestion and provide relief from discomfort.

How do supplements like Lactaid and Beano work?

Lactaid and Beano are two popular digestive enzyme supplements that can help people digest specific foods more easily. Both supplements target specific digestive issues by providing enzymes the body may not naturally produce in sufficient quantities. And both are available without a prescription.

Lactaid dietary supplements contain lactase, an enzyme that breaks down lactose, a sugar found in dairy products. People who are lactose intolerant lack sufficient lactase, leading to symptoms like gas, bloating, and diarrhea after consuming dairy. Lactaid dietary supplements can be used every time you eat foods that contain dairy. But many people find that they can digest certain forms of dairy (like hard cheeses) more easily than other forms (like milk or ice cream). A little experimentation can help you figure out when you need an assist from an enzyme supplement.

Beano contains alpha-galactosidase, an enzyme that helps break down a type of non-absorbable fiber found in beans, root vegetables, and some dairy products. These foods can be difficult for the body to digest, and may cause gas and bloating. Beano breaks down the non-absorbable fiber before it reaches the intestines, where it would otherwise ferment and produce gas. Taking Beano before meals can help prevent gas-related symptoms like flatulence, abdominal cramping, and bloating. Beano is taken in tablet form right before eating or with your first bite.

Who can benefit from digestive enzyme supplements?

Digestive enzyme supplements can benefit people who struggle to digest certain foods due to low levels of the enzymes that process those foods. For example, individuals with lactose intolerance (which affects up to 75% of the world's population) may benefit from lactase supplements like Lactaid.

Similarly, more than 20% of the population experiences abdominal pain caused by intestinal gas resulting from difficulty digesting complex carbohydrates in beans and certain vegetables. They may find relief from supplements like Beano.

While the evidence is still unsettled, some people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may find digestive enzymes helpful for managing their symptoms.

Are digestive enzyme supplements safe?

Digestive enzyme supplements are generally safe for most people, but there are a few important considerations.

For example, Beano may cause allergic reactions in people with alpha-gal syndrome or mold allergies. Those with galactosemia, a metabolic disorder that causes an inability to metabolize the sugar galactose, should consult their doctor before using Beano.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women and young children should check with their doctor before using a lactase product like Lactaid.

Finally, as is the case with all OTC supplements, digestive enzyme supplements are not regulated by the FDA. As a result, the quality and content of these products can vary. This means you can't always be sure about the ingredients or enzyme concentration in these supplements. Prescription enzyme medications, on the other hand, are tightly regulated.",Jenette Restivo,"November 13, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/brown-rice-versus-white-rice-a-head-to-head-comparison,Brown rice versus white rice: A head-to-head comparison,"You can find rice in a rainbow of colors: purple, black, gold, red, brown, and, of course, white. But when you're faced with the decision of brown rice versus white rice, how do you know which to choose?

What is the difference between brown rice and white rice?

The difference between the two comes down to more than just color. It's also about how they are processed.

Brown rice is a whole grain, which means it contains all three components of the grain: the bran, endosperm, and germ.

When white rice is processed, it's stripped of the bran and the germ. The remaining endosperm is starchier and not as nutrient-dense as the whole grain.

White rice typically cooks faster than brown rice.

Nutritional comparison: Brown rice versus white rice

Brown rice and white rice can both be part of a healthy diet. But because brown rice retains the bran and germ, it's more nutrient-dense than white rice. For example, brown rice delivers more fiber, magnesium, potassium, iron, and certain B vitamins (B1, B3, B6, and B9) than white rice.

White rice is easier to digest, in part because it's lower in fiber. That may be beneficial for some people at certain times. For example, individuals with irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease may need to watch how much fiber they get during flare-ups of those conditions.

But if you're otherwise healthy, a diet rich in fiber-filled whole grains — including brown rice — is linked with a number of health perks, including reduced risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, and weight management.

The glycemic index: How brown rice and white rice compare

The glycemic index (GI) is a scoring system that ranks foods from 0 to 100 based on how much they increase blood sugar. The lower the GI score of a food, the lower and slower your blood sugar climbs after you eat. Glycemic index is particularly important for people with diabetes, who are more likely to experience quick, high blood sugar spikes than those without the condition.

White rice has a high glycemic index, in the range of 73 ± 4. Brown rice is categorized as a medium glycemic index food, with a GI of 68 ± 4.

Eating white rice is also linked to a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, while eating brown rice is linked to a lower risk.

Calorie comparison

The calories contained in brown and white rice are similar.


	A cup of cooked medium-grain brown rice contains 218 calories.
	A cup of cooked medium-grain white rice contains 242 calories.


The bottom line: Is brown rice healthier than white rice?

Brown rice, which contains more nutrients and fiber and has a lower glycemic index value, is a healthier choice for most people. But if you're experiencing a flare-up of a digestive condition that makes it harder to digest fiber, white rice may be a better option for you — at least until your symptoms improve.",Sarah Klein,"November 8, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/celiac-disease-exploring-four-myths-202411063079,Celiac disease: Exploring four myths,"Celiac disease is a digestive and immune disorder that can keep the body from absorbing necessary nutrients. ""Our conception and awareness of celiac disease has evolved over the past few decades, but there are still aspects that remain poorly understood,"" says Dr. Ciaran Kelly, medical director of the Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        Perhaps not surprisingly, misconceptions are widespread among the general public. One example? Many people assume that everyone who has celiac disease is plagued by abdominal pain, bloating, or diarrhea. But actually, many adults newly diagnosed with this inherited gluten intolerance don't have these symptoms.
        What's more, gluten — the sticky protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye — can cause gastrointestinal distress and other symptoms in people who don't have celiac disease. Read on for a deeper dive into four myths and facts about celiac disease and related digestive conditions.
        Myth # 1: Celiac disease is usually diagnosed at a young age
        Not typically. While celiac disease can develop any time after a baby's first exposure to gluten, it's usually diagnosed much later in life. According to the National Celiac Association, the average age of diagnosis is between 46 and 56. Around 25% of people are diagnosed after age 60.
        Celiac disease is slightly more common in women and among people with other autoimmune conditions, including type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (a common cause of low thyroid levels), and dermatitis herpetiformis (a rare condition marked by an itchy, blistering rash).
        ""We don't know why some people go from being susceptible to actually having celiac disease,"" says Dr. Kelly. The prevailing theory is that some sort of physical or emotional stress — such as a viral infection, surgery, or anxiety from a stressful life event — may ""flip the switch"" and cause the disease to appear, he says. ""Increasing numbers of people are being diagnosed at midlife and older, often after they're found to have conditions such as anemia or osteoporosis caused by nutrient deficiencies,"" says Dr. Kelly.
        Myth #2: Celiac disease only affects the gut
        When people have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune system attack that can ravage the lining of the small intestine. A healthy small intestine is lined with fingerlike projections, called villi, that absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the immune system attacks the villi, causing them to flatten and become inflamed — and thus unable to adequately absorb nutrients.
        While gastrointestinal problems can occur, they aren't always present. In fact, celiac disease can present with many different symptoms that affect the nervous, endocrine, and skeletal systems. A few examples are brain fog, changes in menstrual periods, or muscle and joint pain.
        Myth # 3: Celiac disease versus gluten intolerance
        If you feel sick after eating gluten, you probably have celiac disease, right? Actually, that may not be true. Some people have non-celiac gluten sensitivity (also called gluten intolerance), which can cause uncomfortable digestive symptoms after eating gluten. But gluten intolerance differs from celiac disease.
        
          Celiac disease is diagnosed with blood tests that look for specific antibodies. If antibodies are present, a definitive diagnosis requires an intestinal biopsy to look for signs of damage that characterize the condition.
          Non-celiac gluten sensitivity does not trigger antibodies or cause intestinal damage. Yet some people with this problem say they also experience brain fog, trouble concentrating, muscle aches and pain, and fatigue after eating gluten-containing foods.
        
        ""Non-celiac gluten sensitivity appears to be a real phenomenon, but it's not well defined,"" says Dr. Kelly. It's unclear whether people experiencing it are intolerant to gluten or to something else in gluten-containing foods.
        
          One possibility is sugarlike molecules known as FODMAPs, which are found in many foods — including wheat. Short for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, gas and bloating can occur when gut bacteria feed on FODMAPs.
          Another possibility is an allergy to wheat, which can cause symptoms such as swelling, itching, or irritation of the mouth and throat after eating wheat. Other symptoms include a skin rash, stuffy nose, and headache, as well as cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Some people may develop a life-threating allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis.
        
        Myth #4: A gluten-free diet always relieves the symptoms and signs of celiac disease
        The sole treatment for celiac disease — adopting a diet that avoids all gluten-containing foods — doesn't always help. This problem is known as nonresponsive celiac disease.
        ""About 20% of people with celiac disease have ongoing symptoms, despite their best efforts to stick to a gluten-free diet,"" says Dr. Kelly. Others have intermittent signs and symptoms, particularly when they are accidentally exposed to gluten. Accidental exposures often happen when people eat prepared or restaurant foods that claim to be gluten-free but are not. Cross contamination with gluten-containing foods is another potential route.
        Potential solutions to nonresponsive celiac disease are being studied. Three promising approaches are:
        
          Enzymes that break down gluten, which people could take alongside gluten-containing foods. ""It's a similar concept to the lactase pills taken by people who are lactose intolerant to help them digest dairy products,"" says Dr. Kelly.
          Dampening the immune response to gluten by inhibiting an enzyme called tissue transglutaminase that makes gluten more potent as an antigen.
          Reprogramming the immune response to prevent the body from reacting to gluten.",Julie Corliss,"November 6, 2024",1

        Buccal fat is the layer of fat located between your cheekbones and jawline, giving your face its natural fullness. Everyone has buccal fat, but the amount can vary from person to person. Some people naturally have fuller cheeks, while others have more defined or slimmer faces. Factors like genetics, age, and body weight can all affect how much buccal fat you have.

While buccal fat can provide a youthful appearance, too much of it may give the face a rounder or puffier look. People who opt for buccal fat removal surgery often want a more defined look, particularly in the lower part of the face. It's especially popular among those who feel their face looks too round or chubby, even if they are at a healthy body weight.
        Surgery to remove buccal fat
        Buccal fat removal surgery is a cosmetic procedure during which a surgeon removes a portion of the fat pads in the lower cheeks. The surgery is typically done under local anesthesia, although intravenous or general anesthesia can also be used. The surgeon makes a small incision inside the mouth, so there are no visible scars. He or she removes just enough fat to slim the face without making it look too hollow or gaunt.
        The surgery usually takes less than an hour, and most people can go home the same day. After buccal fat removal surgery, your doctor may recommend sticking to a liquid diet for several days or more. They might also give you instructions on using special mouth rinses to help lower the risk of infection.
        Recovery from buccal fat removal is fairly quick, typically about two to three weeks. You may experience some swelling, bruising, or discomfort in the days following the procedure, but this usually goes away within a week or two. Full results are visible once the swelling has completely gone down, which may take several months.
        Risks and complications of surgical buccal fat removal
        As with any surgery, buccal fat removal comes with risks and potential complications. These can include:

Infection. Any time you have surgery, there's a risk of infection. Proper care, such as using a special medicated mouth rinse after surgery, can help lower this risk.
        Bleeding. Though rare, some people may experience bleeding during or after the procedure.
        Nerve damage. There is a small risk of damaging the facial nerves, which could lead to temporary or permanent numbness in the cheeks.
        Overcorrection. Removing too much buccal fat can result in a hollow or sunken appearance, especially as you age and naturally lose fat in the face.
        Facial asymmetry. Buccal fat pads on both sides of the face are not always the same size. Even with careful planning, a surgeon might remove too much fat from one side, leading to an uneven or distorted appearance.
        Because of these risks, it's important to consult with an experienced surgeon who has performed many buccal fat removal surgeries. The doctor should evaluate your facial structure to determine if you're a good candidate for the procedure.
        Nonsurgical ways to reduce face fat
        If you're not ready to consider surgery, or want to explore nonsurgical ways to reduce facial fat, there are a few options you can try:
        
          Cosmetic treatments: Dermatologists can use heat, cooling, or injections to target fat cells in the face, offering alternatives to surgery. While these options can help reduce fat, the results will be less dramatic compared to surgical procedures.
          Diet and exercise: If you're carrying extra weight, losing body fat can naturally slim down your face. A healthy diet and regular exercise can help reduce overall fat, including in the face. Keep in mind, however, that you can't spot-reduce fat from specific areas of the body.
          Hydration: Staying hydrated is essential for your health and can be helpful if you're trying to reduce facial fat. Research shows that drinking water can help you feel fuller and support weight loss efforts.
          Adequate sleep: Getting enough sleep is important for weight loss, which can help reduce facial fat. Lack of sleep raises cortisol levels, which can increase appetite and lead to weight gain. Aim for at least eight hours of sleep per night to support weight management.
          Facial exercises: While the effectiveness of facial exercises is still debated and continues to be investigated, some believe that targeted exercises can help tone the muscles in your face and reduce fat.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","November 5, 2024",1

They look ghastly, but can they also harm my health?But cuticles are somewhat delicate and can be damaged when we bite or trim them, encouraging cracks and fraying. A nail infection known as paronychia can result when bacteria enter this broken skin, leading to a red, swollen, painful area around the nail. If the infection isn't treated, nail health can suffer. Nails can grow abnormally, turn yellow or green, develop ridges, and even fall off. Mild nail infections can be treated at home by soaking the infected nail area in warm water for about 15 minutes several times a day. If symptoms don't improve, see your doctor, since the infection may need to be drained with a tiny cut or you may need antibiotics to clear it up.","Toni Golen, MD","November 1, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-charcoal-toothpaste-safe-for-my-teeth,Is charcoal toothpaste safe for my teeth?,"Q.
          My daughter-in-law is raving about charcoal-infused toothpaste she recently bought, saying it really helps whiten teeth. But is it safe?
        
        A. Charcoal toothpaste has recently become a trendy tooth-whitening choice, joining the ever-swelling ranks of whitening products lining store shelves. It contains activated charcoal, which is a fine powder composed of coconut shells, wood, and other natural substances oxidized under heat. Since it's abrasive, it can indeed help remove surface stains on teeth, but there's no evidence it works on stains below the enamel — limiting its effectiveness.
        While using charcoal on teeth is safe in small doses, you shouldn't use this type of toothpaste every day. It's simply too abrasive for the task, risking damage to tooth enamel, the protective outer covering of the teeth. Charcoal toothpaste may even stain teeth inadvertently when charcoal particles get caught in tiny tooth cracks or leave teeth gray or black around the edges. And lastly, most charcoal toothpastes don't contain fluoride, which protects your teeth against decay. You're better off opting for a standard, fluoride-containing toothpaste instead of a trendy newer product.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/nutritional-power-couples,Nutritional power couples,"Peanut butter and jelly. Macaroni and cheese. Chicken and waffles. We're all familiar with food pairings that simply taste great together. But many of us aren't aware that certain combinations are actually better for our bodies than eating either item by itself.
        That's because some foods work synergistically, meaning their joint effect is greater than the sum of their parts. Eaten together, these foods empower your body to absorb nutrients more efficiently. Other smart couplings promote satiety, the feeling of fullness that may be elusive when consuming just one choice or the other, says dietitian Nancy Oliveira, manager of the Nutrition and Wellness Service at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        ""Thinking about grabbing a handful of, say, grapes or nuts is okay, but there might be a benefit to a little more planning — creating snack pairings or having a meal with a few components, versus eating each one alone,"" Oliveira says. ""You'll get a variety of nutrients, but you may also improve the absorption of vitamins, and you might feel much more satisfied for longer.""
        Fruitful fusions
        Which foods are a nutritional love match? Consider these dynamic duos:
        Beans and brown rice. Perhaps this tasty union conjures memories of leaner years when you needed to fill your belly on a budget. But the fiber-filled combination also creates a complete protein source, containing all nine amino acids we need to maintain muscle and move nutrients through our bodies. The protein and fiber in beans also slow the digestion of the carbohydrates in rice, keeping us fuller longer. We can derive similar effects by pairing whole-wheat bread and peanut butter, Oliveira notes.
        Spinach and citrus. Envision a refreshing salad of spinach and mandarin oranges. This blend provides the vitamin C needed to properly absorb iron, which is plentiful in spinach, but mixing any combination of citrus fruit with spinach will achieve the same effect. Another enticing iron-vitamin C pairing can be found in hummus and bell peppers. ""That makes a great snack,"" Oliveira says.
        Cereal and milk. This comforting breakfast staple wraps in vitamin D — which is added to most cereals — with calcium in milk (which, like many dairy products, is also likely fortified with vitamin D). ""Vitamin D helps the intestines to absorb more calcium so it can enter the bloodstream,"" Oliveira explains. Together, the nutrients keep bones and muscles healthy and help nerves function properly.
        Tomatoes and olive oil. Healthy fats such as olive oil or avocadoes may improve the body's uptake of lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that can prevent cell damage implicated in cancer. In addition to tomatoes, lycopene is found in other red-hued fruits and vegetables, including watermelon, red bell peppers, and red cabbage. ""There's evidence that lycopene works better in the presence of fat,"" Oliveira says.
        Apples and peanut butter. Spreading this fan favorite on juicy apple slices is no guilty treat. The pair powers you up with a trifecta of nutrients: fiber, protein, and healthy fats. And any type of nut butter will do. ""When you have those ingredients together in a meal or snack, you're more likely to feel satisfied longer than if you have the fruit alone,"" Oliveira says. ""Protein, fiber, and fat stick around longer in the gut.""
        Turmeric and black pepper. This duo makes a case for spicing things up. Turmeric contains the potent anti-oxidant curcumin, but it's very poorly absorbed in the gut. Blending it with piperine — a compound in black pepper — dramatically enhances its absorption, boosting turmeric's anti-inflammatory effects.
        Salmon, broccoli, and wild rice. Okay, this is a trio, not a duo. But Oliveira considers the combination particularly compelling, since the salmon and broccoli's calcium and wild rice's vitamin K are especially beneficial for bone health. ""Getting these bone-promoting vitamins in one meal could be great for women who have osteoporosis,"" she says.
        Nutritional caveats
        While pairing certain foods is an easy way to get more nutritional bang for your buck, Oliveira points out some noteworthy caveats.
        First, the way people absorb nourishment is highly individual. That means there's no guarantee your body will extract as many nutrients from a certain food pairing as, say, your sister does (or vice versa).
        Additionally, Oliveira cautions against framing certain food combinations as ""super pairings"" that must be eaten together or not at all.
        ""Then you might limit your diet — like, if you don't have hummus on hand, you won't eat the bell peppers,"" she says. ""You shouldn't think this is the only way to eat these foods. But if you happen to, you could benefit more.""
        
          
            
              
                Lonely? Watch for food cravings
                Reaching for the ice cream when you're feeling alone in the world may have a biological basis, it turns out.
                Lonely women experience more intense food cravings, exhibit more uncontrolled eating, and eat poorer-quality diets than peers who feel more socially connected, according to a new study. These women also exhibit more brain activity in regions associated with cravings for sugary foods.
                Published online April 4, 2024, by JAMA Network Open, the analysis involved 93 healthy, premenopausal women (average age 25). Researchers asked participants about their social connections, feelings of isolation or loneliness, and eating behaviors. Participants also underwent brain MRI scans while they viewed images of different types of foods, as well as images unrelated to food.
                The findings reinforce a concept dietitians have long observed: people who feel lonely tend to crave more unhealthy foods, says Nancy Oliveira, a dietitian at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
                ""Loneliness can make us want to reward ourselves when we're feeling bad,"" she says. ""It's a counterbalance. We may turn to things that automatically help us feel better. And food is powerful; it stimulates those reward regions in our brain very quickly.""
                If you're feeling isolated, Oliveira suggests these self-care strategies instead:
                Tune in to music. ""Listen to three of your favorite songs in a row and your mood will probably change right there,"" she says.
                Take a walk. ""Trees emit a chemical called phytoncides that can lower stress hormone levels,"" she says. ""That's one of the reasons we feel better in nature.""
                Meditate or practice deep breathing. ""It's counterintuitive to our lifestyles in this fast-paced world, but making time for deep breathing exercises can do wonders to change your head space,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/are-you-resistant-to-meditation,Are you resistant to meditation?,"Meditation is supposed to be easy: sit quietly, clear your mind, and do a little deep breathing to elicit the relaxation response that eases you into a state of calm, peace, and relief. That bliss doesn't come easily for many people, however. Why not, and what are some strategies to get past this?
        Meditation blocks
        Meditating can be tough if you're new to the practice, especially if you're attempting it on your own and aren't sure what to do.
        Meditating can also be challenging if you're multitasking and you're too stimulated from a hectic schedule. ""If your mind is in go-go mode, suddenly pausing is difficult. It's hard to temporarily set aside the things that are usually front of mind,"" says Dr. Darshan Mehta, medical director of the Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts ­General Hospital.
        Dr. Mehta says people can learn to meditate and then come to relish the experience. But you'll need to do it frequently enough that it becomes a natural part of your life, particularly if you're easily distracted, extremely stressed, struggling with pain, or coping with difficult situations (such as caregiving, dealing with a new medical condition, grieving, or going through a divorce).
        Meditation benefits
        Meditation benefits are worth working for. The practice triggers a cascade of mental and physical health perks. Meditating helps improve well-being, and it helps lower your blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and levels of the stress hormones that cause chronic inflammation.
        Numerous studies from the Benson-­Henry Institute have found that meditating might even make a difference at the cellular level. It potentially activates genes that help your blood vessels work better, control blood sugar, and turn off the stress response. It might also deactivate genes tied to inflammatory bowel disease and chronic inflammation.
        Enlist help
        It's hard to start meditating without guidance. Dr. Mehta suggests taking a class at a local meditation center or hospital, with a knowledgeable instructor who can lead you through the practice. You can even take a virtual (online) meditation class. ""A class will also give you a sense of belonging and community that you're not alone in your struggle and that you can do this,"" Dr. Mehta says.
        If you're uncomfortable with a class, consider working with a meditation coach who can give you guidance, as this article is doing, but in the moment of your challenge, to redirect you and get you back on track. Or you might try an app that will guide you through the meditation process. Some of the most popular include Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer, and Ten Percent Happier.
        Other tips for meditating
        Dr. Mehta also recommends these tips to overcome meditation resistance.
        Make it a routine. When you schedule meditation at the same time each day, it eventually becomes part of your routine. ""You reinforce the habit and break the circuit of stress. Consistent routine causes the brain to rewire itself. You'll even look forward to meditating,"" Dr. Mehta says.
        Create the right environment. Choose a setting that will be free from interruptions, including those from your smartphone, for at least five to 10 minutes. ""It doesn't have to be a cave,"" Dr. Mehta says. ""Just create a micro-environment, such as a corner of a room, where you know you can pause and feel comfortable. It will help shift your thinking and prepare your mind for meditating.""
        Eliminate physical distractions. It might be too hard to meditate and relax if you're hungry or you're in pain. Consider talking to your doctor if an aspect of your health is interfering with meditating.
        Find a meditation style. There are many types of meditation, such as Transcendental Meditation, mindfulness meditation, and guided meditation. Choose one that appeals to you. If it's not a good fit, try another.
        Ignore your thoughts. Try to tune out passing thoughts the way you might ignore a TV commercial. Or when an unwanted thought threatens to disrupt your meditation, imagine that the thought is disappearing into thin air, so you're no longer aware of it.
        Give it time. ""Getting used to meditating won't happen overnight,"" Dr. Mehta says. ""But when you do it every day, meditation will eventually become part of who you are and what you do.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/essential-stretches-to-fight-stiff-winter-muscles,Essential stretches to fight stiff winter muscles,"Does cold weather seem to leave you with stiff, sore muscles? It's not your imagination; there's science behind the symptoms. Fortunately, you can relieve discomfort and protect your muscles by stretching regularly.
        How cold affects muscles
        When the mercury drops, it threatens your body's core temperature, which functions best at about 98.6° F. To stay warm, your body will send more blood toward your core. ""The muscles in your legs and arms get less blood flow — and less oxygen — than they would in warmer temperatures. With less oxygen, the muscles are stiffer, they don't work as well, and they fatigue easily,"" says Dr. Sarah Eby, a sports medicine physician with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Cold weather also affects nerves (which contribute to muscle function) and makes blood flow to muscles even less efficient.
        All of these changes increase the risk for muscle and tendon injuries, especially if you're less active in the winter and your muscles are weak and tight.
        Two types of stretches
        Dr. Eby recommends two kinds of stretches to ward off cold weather consequences.
        Dynamic stretches get your muscles ready for activity. They consist of flowing, repetitive motions, such as walking briskly. The activity sends blood, heat, and oxygen to the muscles to help them work more efficiently and make them less likely to tear. During winter, they're best done when you're inside.
        Most of the year, you need just a few minutes of dynamic stretching before an activity, and you might focus only on muscles you'll be using (such as leg muscles before a walk). ""But in cold weather, everything tightens up, and you need a dynamic warm-up for your whole body. Do lunges or squats, bring each knee to your chest, make circles with your arms, and twist your trunk left and right. Loosen up for about 10 to 15 minutes,"" Dr. Eby says.
        Static stretches keep muscles long and flexible and should be done only when your muscles are warmed up (after a workout, for example).
        To do a static stretch, you hold a certain position for 20 to 30 seconds, without bouncing (which can tear muscle fibers). Examples include
        
          clasping your hands behind you, straightening your arms, and lifting them toward the ceiling, to stretch your chest and shoulders
          reaching for your toes while sitting on the floor with your legs out in front of you, to stretch the hamstrings (in the back of your thigh)
          doing a deep lunge while keeping your back heel planted on the ground, to stretch your calf muscles.
        
        Static stretches feel good and lengthen the muscles, which fights stiffness, increases your range of motion, and improves your posture, balance, and agility. Dr. Eby recommends doing them every day as a preventive measure or to relieve pain and stiffness.
        For more information about stretching, check out the Harvard Special Health Report Stretching.

                Stand up straight and hold the back of a chair. Extend your right leg back and press your heel against the floor. Bend your left knee and feel the stretch in your right calf. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds and return to the starting position. Repeat. Then repeat on the other side, with your left leg back and your right knee bent.

        What else you can do
        While stretching might be enough to avoid stiff winter muscles, the following tips can also help.
        Stay hydrated. This helps prevent lactic acid from building up in your muscles and causing cramps.
        Dress for the elements. ""Dress warmly, with a hat, a neck gaiter, and a vest or a coat, so you don't need to shunt as much blood away from your arms and legs,"" Dr. Eby says.
        Take vitamin D3. Vitamin D deficiency can make muscles sore and achy. Take 1,000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day.
        Avoid junk food. Stay away from highly processed foods, such as cookies, chips, and frozen dinners. These can contribute to inflammation throughout the body, causing muscle discomfort.
        If pain doesn't go away
        If muscle pain doesn't go away, you might have an injury, such as a muscle strain. An important clue: ""Sore muscles feel better once you loosen up and exercise. Strained muscles get worse as you keep going,"" Dr. Eby says.
        She recommends putting an ice pack on suspected muscle strains, applying topical pain relievers, and seeing your doctor if symptoms persist.",Heidi Godman,"November 1, 2024",1

The alternative is open heart surgery, in which a cardiac surgeon uses an artery or vein taken from elsewhere in the body to reroute blood around the blocked artery.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/how-to-love-the-exercises-you-hate,How to love the exercises you hate,"Everyone has exercises they perform grudgingly or even avoid. ""Even though the movements are beneficial, you hate them because they can be difficult or too challenging,"" says Vijay A. Daryanani, a certified personal trainer and a physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation. ""However, by modifying the movements and adjusting your expectations, you can begin to enjoy the exercises you usually struggle with."" Here's a look at three common exercises men often hate, why they need to do them, and how to learn to love them.
        Squats
        Squats activate all major leg muscles at once: the quads and hamstrings (thighs), gluteals (buttocks), and gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris (calves). ""Squats can help you build and maintain a stronger lower body, which makes overall movement easier and safer and allows you to stay active and avoid injuries,"" says Daryanani.
        Why you hate them. Since most men suffer from tight hip flexors and hamstrings, squatting low can be difficult, and if done incorrectly, squats can cause back pain.
        Learn to love them. Daryanani points out that you essentially perform a squat any time you sit and stand. ""Therefore, you can get many of the same benefits from regular squats by performing sit-to-stand exercises,"" he says. ""They provide support and are easy to perform, so you can avoid awkward movements that may put stress on your back.""
        Here's how to do it: Sit in a chair with your feet hip-width apart and place your hands on your thighs. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Exhale as you slowly stand. Then slowly sit in a controlled movement. Take three to five seconds to stand and sit, making sure not to use momentum.
        To make it easier, use a chair with arms and put your hands on the chair's arms as you stand. For a challenge, do the exercise with your arms crossed in front of your chest, hold a dumbbell or heavy book with both hands at chest level, or hold a dumbbell in each hand. Using a lower chair also can increase the difficulty.
        Push-ups
        The old-school push-up is a multipurpose exercise that engages your body from top to bottom by using the arms, chest, core, hips, and legs.
        Why you hate them. Push-ups often are used as a measure of strength and vitality. ""If you can't do many, or if you struggle, you may see this as a sign of weakness, so you avoid even trying,"" says Daryanani. Also, push-ups were long viewed in the military and gym classes as punishment, so the exercise has an aura of negativity.
        Learn to love them. ""Push-ups easily can be modified in many ways so anyone can successfully do them with confidence,"" says Daryanani. For instance, begin with push-ups done at an angle against a wall or kitchen counter. ""By positioning yourself closer or farther away from the wall or counter and changing the angle, you can increase or decrease the difficulty,"" says Daryanani. ""This way, you can focus on engaging the muscles and can perform with better form."" When you are ready to move to the floor, begin with knee push-ups.
        Eventually, you can work up to regular push-ups. And never worry how many you can do at one time. ""Proper execution and form, where you can feel your muscles fully engaged, is what's important,"" says Daryanani. ""It's always better to do five good push-ups than 10 bad ones.""
        Bridges
        Another great all-in-one move, the bridge works the buttocks, back, and core — where some of your most powerful muscles are. ""You engage these muscles whenever you roll over, get off the floor, or lift heavy objects,"" says Daryanani.
        To perform a bridge, lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart and parallel to each other. Place your arms at your sides, palms down. Relax your shoulders against the floor. Tighten your buttocks, then lift your hips up off the floor as high as is comfortable. Hold for five seconds, then return to the starting position.
        Why you hate them. Bridges can feel awkward at first, especially if you have tight or weak core or back muscles. ""Plus, they are not something individuals are accustomed to doing regularly outside of a yoga class,"" says Daryanani.
        Learn to love them. If you can't lift your hips very high or if arching your back is too difficult, place bolsters or pillows under your back for support. ""This way, you can hold the pose longer and reduce the risk of straining your back,"" says Daryanani. Another option is to lift your hips just high enough to engage your muscles, which may be only a few inches.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/the-facts-on-fiber,The facts on fiber,"Think you eat enough fiber? Think again. Adults should eat 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories consumed. This is 28 to 34 grams of fiber per day for most men. However, most eat less than half that amount, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025.
        Why so little? Blame poor food choices, says Dr. Walter Willet, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""People eat more ready-to-eat processed foods, which are made from refined grains stripped of fiber, such as white rice and white flour and found in pasta, pastries, cakes, and crackers.""
        Changes in eating patterns also play a role. As people age, they often need fewer calories. Eating less further cuts down on their fiber intake. Also, many fiber-rich foods require more chewing than other foods, which can be difficult for some older adults.
        The two types
        There are two types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber pulls water from the stomach, turning the fiber into a gel. This slows digestion and makes you feel full after eating. It also helps soften stools. In comparison, insoluble fiber doesn't dissolve in water. It adds necessary bulk to stool, preventing constipation.
        But fiber has other health benefits. Research has found that a high-fiber diet lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and is linked with lower incidences of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes.
        Studies also have discovered that adequate fiber can also alter the gut microbiome to support the immune system and protect against inflammation. High levels of dietary fiber also may help reduce the risk of developing dementia, according to a study published in 2023 in Nutritional Neuroscience.
        Finding fiber
        There are many high-fiber foods from which to choose, so there is a good chance you can find many to add to your diet. Examples include fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. (You can find a list of fiber-rich foods at /fiber.)
        Men can get their necessary daily fiber from two to four servings of fruit; two to five servings of vegetables, whole grains, or legumes; and one to two servings of nuts and seeds. But don't get bogged down in tracking exact fiber amounts for each meal or worrying about eating enough of both fiber types. ""Keep it simple, and just focus on eating a variety of fiber-rich foods and avoiding refined grains,"" says Dr. Willett. However, it's fine to start by eating only one or two of your favorite high-fiber foods. ""If you love blueberries, have two daily servings of just those,"" says Dr. Willett. ""Gradually, you can add other fiber foods.""
        
          
            
              
                The role of supplements
                Over-the-counter fiber supplements come in capsules, powders to be mixed with water, and chewable tablets. Common brands include Benefiber, Metamucil, Citrucel, and Konsyl. Are they ever a good option? If you have trouble eating fiber-rich foods — due to food sensitivity or difficulty chewing high-fiber foods — these can occasionally be used to increase your fiber, according to Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard's T.H. Chan of Public Health. ""Some people also may benefit from a supplement if they suffer from constipation due to medication or follow a low-carbohydrate diet for health reasons,"" he says. ""However, supplements should never replace a healthy diet as your primary source of fiber, as they don't provide the valuable micronutrients you get from high-fiber foods."" If you think you may benefit from a fiber supplement, speak with your doctor.
              
            
          
        
        Small changes
        Another approach is to make small changes to your eating habits. For example, commit to eating beans, lentils, or peas at least three times a week. Switch out regular pasta for versions made from whole wheat, quinoa, chickpeas, or lentils.
        Replace white rice with whole grains like brown rice or bulgur. ""Something simple like starting your day with a bowl of steel-cut oatmeal is also a good beginning,"" says Dr. Willett. ""I top mine with some yogurt, nuts, and in-season fruit, which adds variety along with more fiber.""
        Be careful about too much fiber in a race to increase your daily intake. ""Your digestive system can't always tolerate a lot of fiber at one time, which can lead to gas, bloating, diarrhea, and stomach cramps,"" says Dr. Willett. ""Take it slow, and make sure to drink plenty of water daily as you increase your fiber.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cant-shake-that-cough,Can't shake that cough?,"Dry. Hacking. Loose. Deep. Phlegmy. Barking. Chesty. A cough can sound like any of these descriptors — often more than one at the same time — and these characteristics can sometimes point toward its cause.
        Now add another: lingering. What does that tell us? Not as much as we might hope, a Harvard expert says.
        A natural reflex that helps keep our airways clear, the average cough — typically due to a cold or another respiratory virus — lasts three weeks or less, says Dr. Jessica McCannon, a pulmonary critical care specialist with Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham. When a cough endures for eight weeks or more, it's considered chronic. Only rarely is this dangerous, but it certainly can be mystifying.
        ""When people come to a lung doctor for a chronic cough, they usually hope that at the end of the first visit they'll leave with an answer and some medication and will quickly feel better,"" Dr. McCannon says. ""But of all the things we care for, it's one of the most difficult. And if we don't talk about that up front, I think people will have ongoing frustration and disappointment.""
        Many possible culprits
        Indeed, be prepared for a detective hunt. Many chronic coughs have more than one contributor, so doctors don't just look to the airway or lungs to unearth the cause.
        ""Often we're thinking top to bottom — about the sinuses, swallow function, and esophagus and stomach in addition to the airways and lungs themselves,"" Dr. McCannon says.
        More than a dozen conditions or situations can explain a lingering cough, including
        
          sinus problems, such as sinusitis
          bronchitis
          seasonal allergies
          gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
          side effects from medications, such as ACE inhibitors to treat high blood pressure.
        
        But only a handful of chronic cough triggers are serious, such as
        
          asthma
          chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
          interstitial lung disease, a progressive condition involving coughing and breathlessness
          chronic lung infections
          bronchiectasis, chronic inflammation of the tubes leading to the lungs
          lung cancer.
        
        Occasionally, chronic coughs arise from ""very weird causes"" such as impacted earwax, Dr. McCannon points out. And sometimes the culprit is all too clear: smoking — whether tobacco, marijuana, or vaping. ""Basically, anything going into the lungs that shouldn't be there will potentially cause a cough.""
        Seeking a diagnosis
        It's reasonable to try over-the-counter medications to quell your cough. The choice depends on the apparent cause of the cough, so you might take cough suppressants, antihistamines if you think it may be allergies, or antacids for acid reflux as a possibility. But if they don't make a dent, Dr. McCannon says, it's time to see a health care professional. ""Tell your doctor what's worked and what hasn't. That can give us some clues,"" she says.
        Certain red flags make a doctor's visit more pressing. Schedule an appointment (or a follow-up) if your lingering cough doesn't resolve after treatment with antibiotics or if you also experience breathlessness; wheezing; chest pain, pressure, or tightness; blood in your sputum; weight loss; or fatigue.
        ""A lingering cough with any of those things should lead you to seek care soon,"" Dr. McCannon says.
        Getting to the bottom of things will likely involve a physical exam, x-rays, or lung function testing. Your doctor may order CT imaging as well, ""although that's certainly not necessary at the threshold of three months unless there are other warning signs,"" she says.
        To make your doctor's visit more fruitful, Dr. McCannon suggests one important strategy: track your cough.
        ""Note its patterns. What circumstances bring it on? Is it productive or dry? Is it worse after meals, or when you're lying down? Does it intrude on sleep?"" she asks. ""Paying attention to the circumstances in which you notice it can provide us with some really helpful clues.""

We'll explore smart snack ideas that support a healthy, balanced diet and will help you stay on track without sacrificing flavor.
        The role of snacks in a balanced diet
        For many of us, snacking is a part of daily life. One survey found that 75% of Americans snack daily, with many replacing meals like breakfast or lunch with a snack.
        Snacking by itself isn't necessarily a problem. The problem occurs when your snacks are too large or you snack too often, especially if your snacks of choice are unhealthy foods that offer little nutritional value — think chips, cookies, and other processed foods high in sugar, salt, refined grains, and unhealthy fats. When we choose these foods, we miss the chance to give our bodies the whole, nutrient-rich foods they need.
        How snacks can prevent overeating
        When we choose sensible amounts of the right foods, snacking can prevent the energy dips our bodies may experience if we go several hours between meals. Snacking can also help control appetite by preventing unhealthy cravings. And done right, snacks can provide our bodies with extra bursts of nutrients, especially when we choose snacks like fresh fruit or nuts.
        Because excessive snacking can lead to weight gain, it's important to control your portions and choose lower-calorie, nutrient-dense snacks. For example, opt for fresh, whole foods like fruits and vegetables that provide essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants. Reach for small quantities of high-protein snacks like nuts, cheese, and beans, which can make your snacks more satisfying and keep you full longer. And opt for whole-grain versions of bread or crackers.
        You can try out some smart snacking strategies like portioning out your snacks ahead of time and making an effort to eat mindfully by savoring the flavors, colors, and textures of your snack.
        Tips for assembling healthy snacks
        The most healthful and satiating snacks contain a combination of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. This doesn't have to be complicated. For example, a handful of whole-grain crackers (carbohydrate) with some low-fat cheese (protein, fat) and a small amount of dried fruits (carbohydrates) provides all three macronutrients.
        With a little planning and the right ingredients, you can create quick, nutritious options that will keep you energized throughout the day. These simple tips can help you assemble satisfying snacks that are good for your body.
        Prep healthy options like fruit and veggies by keeping them washed and ready. You can store your prepared produce in containers in the refrigerator to make your snacking choice easier.
        Prioritize minimally processed whole foods.
        Plan ahead so when hunger strikes, you're ready with something healthy.
        Experiment with different food groups. Try combinations like yogurt with berries, carrots with hummus, or bananas with peanut butter. These combos are balanced, satisfying snacks.
        Keep temptations out of sight by storing unhealthy snacks in harder-to-access areas of your kitchen. Or commit to not keeping unhealthy snacks in your house so they don't tempt you. Make sure that healthier options, like fruits and vegetables, are within easy reach.
        Stay hydrated throughout the day. Drink water or unsweetened tea instead of sugary drinks.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/hiit-workouts-for-older-adults-a-guide-to-safe-and-effective-high-intensity-interval-training,HIIT workouts for older adults: A guide to safe and effective high-intensity interval training,"Known for its ability to deliver effective results in less time than traditional workouts, HIIT is a big ""hit"" with younger fitness enthusiasts. But here's the good news: HIIT workouts can benefit older adults too. Here are some tips for older adults to make this style of exercise safe, effective, and rewarding.
        What is HIIT?
        High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a workout style that alternates between intervals of intense effort and recovery. The goal of HIIT is to push your body hard during the high-intensity intervals and allow it to recover during intervals of low- to moderate-intensity activity.
        During the intense bursts of exercise in a HIIT session, your heart rate rises. A simple way to judge if you are exercising at high intensity is to use the talk test. If you can sing while exercising, you're at low intensity. If you can have a conversation while exercising, your effort is moderate. When you can't say more than a few words without having to take a breath, you're working at high intensity.
        During recovery periods, your heart rate dips from that peak, but still stays elevated relative to your baseline. This sustained increase means a HIIT workout burns more calories and improves cardiovascular fitness more efficiently than sustained moderate-intensity exercise. The structure of HIIT makes it highly efficient, helping you gain maximum benefits in minimal time.
        A HIIT workout consists of four essential parts:
        
          a warm-up of lower-intensity movements targeting the same muscles as the main workout
          high-intensity intervals during which you increase speed, resistance, or incline to maximize your effort
          recovery intervals, or active rest periods, equal in length or slightly longer than high intensity intervals
          a cool-down with light activity like walking or marching.
        
        One of the most appealing features of high-intensity interval training is its flexibility. Cardio, strength, or combination workouts can be turned into interval sessions by increasing incline, speed, or resistance to create high-intensity intervals and alternating those with recovery intervals.
        Key benefits of HIIT: Boosting cardiovascular health and strength
        HIIT workouts offers significant health benefits. Below are some key benefits of incorporating HIIT into your routine:
        
          Improves aerobic fitness. HIIT has been shown to increase VO2 max, a measure of how much oxygen your body consumes while exercising and the best available measure of aerobic fitness. This increase occurs across age groups.
          Benefits heart health. Interval training strengthens the heart muscle and improves cardiovascular health. The periodic boosts to your heart rate during HIIT sessions promote more efficient oxygen use.
          Boosts metabolic function. HIIT improves the function of mitochondria — tiny energy generators found in every cell of your body.
          Builds muscle. According to studies, HIIT can increase fat-free mass, which includes muscle, by 1% to 3%. This is important for older adults who begin to lose muscle at increased rates as they age.
          Preserves muscle power. HIIT helps maintain fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are essential for quick, explosive movements. This is especially important because fast-twitch fibers naturally decline with age, making activities that require sudden bursts of energy more challenging.
          Fast results. Research shows that HIIT can lead to fitness benefits faster than traditional, steady-state workouts. A 20-minute HIIT session burns more calories and strengthens the heart more than 20 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise.
        
        Modifications and precautions: Adapting HIIT to your abilities
        Remember that intensity depends on your fitness level — what feels intense for you might feel different to someone else. Avoid trying to keep up with younger or more experienced athletes. Instead, focus on gradually increasing your own challenge. Even small bursts of effort can boost your fitness.
        If you're older, or haven't exercised in a while, modify high-intensity interval training as needed to suit your current fitness level. For example, you may not need to jog as fast or use as much resistance to raise your heart rate as the person next to you at the gym.
        Consult your doctor before starting a HIIT program, especially if you have any health conditions. If you have heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure, be extra cautious and consult a medical professional before incorporating high-intensity efforts into your routine. Call 911 right away if you experience upper body discomfort including chest pain, shortness of breath, or faintness during or after exercising.
        In terms of frequency, you don't have to do HIIT workouts every day, nor should you. In fact, HIIT is only recommended two to three times a week.
        Getting started with HIIT
        Getting started with HIIT as an older adult doesn't have to be intimidating. You can get all the benefits of HIIT just by tweaking whatever exercise you do today. The key is to begin with manageable intervals and gradually increase the intensity as your fitness improves.
        For example, if you're used to walking for 30 minutes, try walking at your normal pace for five minutes, then walk as fast as you can or jog for one minute. Afterward, return to your usual pace for three minutes. Repeat this cycle several times.
        If your preferred exercise is swimming, you might try to alternate one leisurely lap with one or two laps swimming at a challenging pace. Work your way up to repeating this pattern for 30 minutes.
        As you get stronger, you can increase the time and intensity of the higher-intensity intervals while reducing the recovery periods. Always listen to your body and progress at a pace that feels comfortable.
        Some soreness after a workout is normal, but let your doctor know if you experience persistent or intense muscle pain that starts during a workout or right afterward, or if your muscle soreness lasts for more than one to two weeks.",Jenette Restivo,"October 18, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/an-easy-hiit-home-workout-for-older-adults,An easy HIIT home workout for older adults,"High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been one of the most popular fitness trends for over a decade. It's no wonder. HIIT workouts efficiently boost cardiovascular health, improve metabolism, and burn fat.
        Despite what you may think, you can enjoy the benefits of a HIIT workout even if you are older or haven't exercised in a while. The key is to start with shorter and lower-intensity intervals, focus on proper form, and gradually progress to suit your fitness level and physical abilities. Try this sample HIIT workout at home to see if HIIT is a fit for you.
        Sample HIIT workout for older adults
        If you'd like to try a HIIT workout, this routine is a great way to start. It requires no equipment, and you can easily modify the intensity of each HIIT exercise.
        HIIT alternates intervals of high-intensity exercise with periods of recovery. To create a HIIT workout from the exercises below, do each exercise for 30 to 60 seconds. Then march in place for 30 to 60 seconds to recover before moving on to the next exercise. You can always march in place for longer if you're not ready to push yourself again. Repeat this pattern, gradually working up to a 30-minute workout. As you're getting started, do only as much as you can do while maintaining good form.
        HIIT workouts should never be painful or so draining that you can't finish the intervals.
        A note on terminology: In the following exercises, ""tempo"" tells you the time to allot to each of the key movements in an exercise. For example, a 3–1–3 tempo means you should count to 3 as you do the first part of the exercise, hold the new position for a count of 1, and return to the starting position as you count to 3. Faster-paced cardio moves often have a tempo that looks like 1–1–1–1–1, meaning one count for each portion of the exercise.
        Warm up
        As with any exercise, begin with a dynamic warmup. This can be as simple as a 10-minute walk or easy pedaling on a stationary bike. Try to warm up the muscle groups you'll be using during the workout.
        Moving squat with arm sweep
        
          
        
        
          Stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Keep your shoulders back and down at all times. Tighten your abdominal muscles.
          Step out to the right, bending your knees and hips, and lowering into a squat as you sweep your arms out to the sides and up overhead. Keep your knees no farther forward than your toes as you squat. Don't let your shoulders come up toward your ears as you raise your arms.
          Straighten your legs, bringing your left foot next to your right and your arms down to your sides as you return to the starting position, but to the right of where you started.
          Repeat, stepping to the right two or three more times, depending upon the amount of space you have. Reverse, stepping to the left.
          Repeat this sequence for 30 to 60 seconds.
        
        To make this exercise easier: Take smaller steps to the side. Don't squat so low. Keep your hands on your hips.
        To make this exercise harder: Squat lower, but not below knee height. Move faster while maintaining good form.
        Side kick
        
          
        
        
          Stand up straight with your feet about hip-width apart. Keep your upper body relaxed.
          Bend your arms so your hands are in front of your chest like a boxer. Make loose fists with your hands.
          Step forward with your left foot, placing it in front of your right foot.
          Lean your upper body to the left, raise your right knee out to the side, and then extend your leg, kicking to the side with your foot flexed. Tighten your abdominal muscles and power the move from your gluteal (buttock) muscles. Your knees and toes should be pointing forward as you kick.
          Bend your right knee, lower your leg, and step back to the starting position.
          Repeat for half of the 30 to 60 second interval period, and then switch sides, kicking with your left leg for the rest of the interval. The tempo of this interval is 1–1–1–1.
        
        To make this exercise easier: Kick lower. You can hold on to the back of a chair for balance if needed.
        To make this exercise harder: Kick higher. Add a punch with the same-side arm.
        Plank stand
        
          
        
        
          
        
        
          Stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Tighten your abdominal muscles.
          Hinge forward from your hips, bending your knees, and place your hands on the floor. Bend your knees as much as you need to in order to place your hands on the floor.
          Walk your hands out until your body is in a plank position. Your body should be in line from your head to your heels and your hands directly beneath your shoulders in the plank position.
          Then walk your hands back toward your feet and roll up to the starting position.
          Repeat for the duration of the 30 to 60 second interval. The tempo for the interval is 1–4–1–4–1.
        
        To make this exercise easier: Start on all fours and walk your hands out to a plank from that position. You can keep your knees on the floor for the easiest variation or raise them off the floor as you move your hands out.
        To make this exercise harder: While in the plank position, raise and lower each leg, lifting your foot off the floor, before walking your hands back.
        Tips for preventing injuries
        To stay safe and prevent injuries during HIIT workouts, keep these tips in mind:
        
          Always start with a thorough warm-up to prepare your muscles and joints for the workout.
          Proper form is essential to avoid strain. Consider working with a trainer or physical therapist to ensure you're doing the movements correctly.
          Don't jump into high-intensity exercises too quickly. Begin with lower-intensity intervals and gradually increase the intensity as your fitness improves.
          Allow time for rest and recovery. Don't do more than two or three high-intensity or high-impact workouts per week. Instead, allow rest days between workouts to avoid burnout and injuries.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/midlife-adhd-coping-strategies-that-can-help-202102052381,Midlife ADHD? Coping strategies that can help,"Trouble staying focused and paying attention are two familiar symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a common health issue among children and teens.
        When ADHD persists through early adulthood and on into middle age, it presents many of the same challenges it does in childhood: it's hard to stay organized, start projects, stay on task, and meet deadlines. But now life is busier, and often expectations from work and family are even higher. Fortunately, there are lots of strategies that can help you navigate this time in your life.
        Staying organized
        Organizational tools are a must for people with adult ADHD. They'll help you prioritize and track activities for each day or the coming weeks.
        
          Pick the right tools. Tools can include a pen and paper to make lists, or computer or smartphone apps to set appointment reminders, highlight important days on the calendar, mark deadlines, and keep lists and other information handy.
          Schedule updates. Set aside time each day to update your lists and schedules. Don't let the task become a chore in itself; think of it like a routine task such as brushing your teeth, and do it daily so it becomes an established habit.
          Set a timer. And a word of caution: smartphones and computers can also turn into a distraction. If you have adult ADHD, you may find yourself spending hours looking at less useful apps or sites. If that's a frequent trap for you, set a timer for each use or keep the phone off or in another room when you are trying to work.
        
        Staying focused
        Just being organized doesn't mean your work will get done. But a few simple approaches can at least make it easier to do the work.
        
          Declutter your home and office. Give yourself an appealing work environment and keep important items easily accessible.
          Reduce distractions. This could mean changing your workstation so it doesn't face a window, moving to a quieter space, or just silencing your smartphone and email alerts.
          Jot down ideas as they come to you. You may have an ""aha"" moment for one task while you're in the middle of another. That's okay; just write down that thought and get back to it later, after your more pressing work is finished.
        
        Meeting deadlines
        Deadlines pose two big challenges when you have adult ADHD. First, it's hard to start a project, often because you want it to be perfect, or you're intimidated by it so you put it off. Second, when you do start a project, it's very easy to become distracted and leave the task unfinished.
        How can you avoid these traps?
        
          Put off procrastinating. Put procrastination on your to-do list — like a chore — and fool yourself into actually starting your work.
          Deal with emails, phone calls, or other matters as soon as you can. That way there will be fewer things hanging over your head and overwhelming you later on.
          Be a clock watcher. Get a watch and get in the habit of using it. The more aware you are of time, the more likely you'll be able to avoid spending too long on a task.
          Take one thing at a time. Multitasking is overrated for everyone — and it's a nightmare for people with adult ADHD. Focus on completing one task, then move on to the next.
          Be realistic about your time. This can mean having to say no to new projects or other commitments.
        
        Get more help
        The ideas listed here can help you start coping with adult ADHD, but they may not be enough to help you overcome adult ADHD's challenges.
        Consider hiring an ADHD coach who can provide more strategies and give you additional tools to cope with your condition. Look for an ADHD coach who is a licensed mental health professional who specializes in treating ADHD, and may also have a certification in ADHD coaching from the ADHD Coaches Organization.",Heidi Godman,"October 18, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/tofu-making-a-place-for-this-nutritious-plant-based-food-in-your-diet,"Tofu: Making a place for this nutritious, plant-based food in your diet","Many people are concerned about getting enough protein in their diet, but they don't necessarily want to eat more meat. Eating more tofu is one way to add a healthy plant-based protein to your regular rotation.
        What is tofu?
        Tofu is a soy-based food made from soybeans, water, and a class of ingredients called coagulants that keep the two together. Tofu originated in China, but it's now eaten all over the world. It comes in different varieties, categorized by firmness, and can be enjoyed in many ways, including baked, grilled, stir-fried, and steamed.
        Nutritional benefits of tofu
        Tofu is rich in protein, calcium, manganese, copper, and selenium, though the precise amount of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals found in a given amount of tofu will vary by the brand and firmness you select. Tofu is also relatively low in calories compared to other protein sources. And while it's higher in fat than some other foods, most of that fat is the heart-healthy polyunsaturated type.
        Are there any health concerns associated with eating tofu?
        The safety of soy has been hotly debated in the nutrition community for years, due to research in animals that suggested it may be linked to an increased risk of certain cancers. This was thought to be due to the way that certain compounds in soy products can act similarly to estrogen in the body (some types of cancer cells need estrogen to grow).
        However, human studies have not shown the same results. There is currently no evidence linking major health concerns to eating tofu.
        People who are allergic to soy should not eat tofu because they could have an allergic reaction. Otherwise, tofu is generally considered safe for most adults.
        Types of tofu
        You'll typically be able to find four types of tofu in grocery stores:
        
          Silken tofu: This is the softest form of tofu, and it's typically used in creamy dishes.
          Medium tofu: Firmer than silken tofu but still soft, medium tofu is best incorporated into dishes where the tofu doesn't need to hold its shape.
          Firm tofu: Firm (and extra-firm) tofu is sold in a solid block. This type of tofu holds its shape even when you cut it. It can be used in a number of recipes and preparations.
          Extra-firm tofu: The densest form of tofu is even more versatile than firm tofu because it can stand up to frying and grilling and still hold its shape. It also absorbs more flavor from marinades than other types of tofu.
        
        Tasty tofu recipes
        So how do you cook tofu? You have more options than you might have guessed. Tofu can be used in all sorts of recipes, including:
        
          
            scrambles
          
          
            stir-fries
          
          
            smoothies
          
          salads (top your salad with air-fried tofu for a change from grilled chicken, canned tuna, or steamed salmon)
          soups (dice up some firm or extra-firm tofu and drop it into a simmering pot of your favorite soup).
        
        It's common to press excess water out of firm or extra-firm tofu before cooking it. To do so, take the block of tofu out of its packaging, wrap it in a clean towel, position it between two plates, and place something heavy on top. Leave it for several hours, then pour off any excess liquid.
        You can marinate your tofu before cooking it to give it more flavor. Use dry or wet ingredients, and let the tofu soak up the marinade for several hours. Or, skip the marinade and simply add a flavorful sauce to the tofu while cooking.
        You can bake the tofu in the oven, saute it in a pan, fry it in an air fryer, stir-fry it in a wok, or toss it on the grill. Experiment with different preparations until you find your favorite ways to enjoy tofu.",Sarah Klein,"October 16, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd-a-to-z,Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"What is ADHD?
        Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), usually first diagnosed in childhood, can appear in a variety of forms and has many possible causes. People with ADHD probably have an underlying genetic vulnerability to developing it, but the severity of the problem is also influenced by the environment. Conflict and stress tend to make it worse.
        The main features of this disorder are found in its name. Attention problems include daydreaming, difficulty focusing, and being easily distracted. Hyperactivity refers to fidgeting or restlessness. A person with the disorder may be disruptive or impulsive, may have trouble in relationships, and may be accident-prone. Hyperactivity and impulsiveness often improve as a person matures, but attention problems tend to last into adulthood.
        ADHD is the most common problem seen in outpatient child and adolescent mental health settings. It is estimated that ADHD affects more than 5% of children. Boys are diagnosed with ADHD about twice as much as girls.
        ADHD can continue into adulthood. The activity component is less apparent in adults, who tend to have problems with memory and concentration. They may have trouble staying organized and meeting commitments at work or at home. The consequence of poor functioning may be anxiety, low self-esteem, or mood problems. Some people turn to substances to manage these feelings.
        Symptoms of ADHD
        The symptoms of ADHD — inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsive behavior — often show up first at school. A teacher may report to parents that their child won't listen, is ""hyper,"" or causes trouble and is disruptive. A child with ADHD often wants to be a good student, but the symptoms get in the way. Teachers, parents, and friends may be unsympathetic because they see the child's behavior as bad or odd.
        A high level of activity and occasional impulsiveness or inattentiveness is often normal in a child. But the hyperactivity of ADHD is typically more haphazard, poorly organized, and has no real purpose. And in children with ADHD, these behaviors are frequent enough that the child has a harder-than-average time learning, getting along with others, or staying reasonably safe.
        ADHD symptoms can vary widely. Here are common characteristics of the disorder in the two major groups (inattention and hyperactivity).
        Inattention
        
          carelessness
          difficulty paying attention over time
          not appearing to be listening
          failing to follow through with teachers' or parents' requests
          trouble organizing work, often giving the impression of not having heard the teacher's instructions
          avoiding tasks that require sustained attention
          losing materials necessary to complete tasks
          becoming easily distracted
          forgetfulness in day-to-day activities.
        
        Hyperactivity
        
          excessive restlessness or fidgety behavior
          inability to stay seated
          running or climbing that is inappropriate
          inability to sustain quiet leisure activities
          driven behavior, as if ""on the go"" all the time
          excessive talking
          impulsive behavior (acts without thinking)
          frequently calling out in class (without raising hand, yelling out answer before question is finished)
          difficulty waiting for his or her turn in group settings
          frequent intrusive behavior or interrupting of others.
        
        Many children with ADHD also show symptoms of other behavioral or psychiatric conditions. In fact, such problems may be different ways that the same underlying biological or environmental problems come to light. These associated conditions include learning disabilities and disorders characterized by disruptive behavior.
        
          Learning disabilities — Up to a quarter of children with ADHD may also have learning disabilities. This rate is much greater than the rate found in the general population.
          Oppositional, defiant, or conduct disorders — These behavior disorders, which involve frequent outbursts of extremely negative, angry, or mean behavior, affect as many as half of all children who have ADHD. Children who have both ADHD and behavioral disturbances are more likely to have a poor long-term outcome, with higher rates of school failure, antisocial behaviors, and substance abuse.
        
        Diagnosing ADHD
        There is no single test to diagnose ADHD. For a child, a pediatrician may make the diagnosis or may make a referral to a specialist. Parents and teachers may be alert to the problem and may have the child evaluated. For adults, a mental health professional generally performs the evaluation.
        The clinician will ask about symptoms related to ADHD. Since, in children, many of these characteristics are seen in a school setting, the clinician will also ask about behavior in school. To help collect this information, the evaluator will often interview parents, teachers, and other caregivers or ask them to fill out special behavioral checklists.
        Since other conditions may cause the symptoms of ADHD, the medical history and physical examination are important. For example, the doctor may look for trouble with hearing or vision, learning disabilities, speech problems, seizure disorders, anxiety, depression, or other behavior problems. In some cases, other medical or psychological testing may be useful to check for one or more of these conditions. These tests can sometimes help clinicians and teachers develop practical suggestions.
        Expected duration of ADHD
        In most children with ADHD, symptoms begin before age 12 and last through adolescence. Symptoms of ADHD may continue into adulthood.
        Risk factors and prevention
        The causes of ADHD are not fully understood. There are numerous factors that are associated with the development of ADHD. It may be difficult to avoid these factors, but addressing them may reduce the risk of developing the disorder.
        Common risk factors
        
          temperament — novelty seeking, negative emotion, difficulty controlling impulses
          psychosocial adversity — child abuse or neglect, severe marital conflict, father's criminal behavior, mother's mental disorder, poverty, the child's foster care placement
          complications during pregnancy or delivery — poor maternal health, fetal distress, low birthweight
          premature birth
          mother's use of tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs during pregnancy
          exposure to neurotoxins, such as lead
          a history of ADHD in close relatives.
        
        Treating ADHD
        Although no treatment eliminates ADHD completely, many helpful options are available. The goal of treatment is to help children improve social relationships, do better in school, and keep their disruptive or harmful behaviors to a minimum. Medication can be very helpful, and it is often necessary.
        Drug treatment by itself is rarely the answer. Medication and psychotherapy together usually have the best results. For example, a behavioral program may be put in place where structured, realistic expectations are set.
        Stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) and forms of amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine) have been used for many decades. They are relatively safe and effective for most children to help them focus their thoughts and control their behavior. Long-acting forms of stimulants are usually preferred for children, because one dose in the morning can provide a daylong effect.
        Despite their name, stimulants do not cause increased hyperactivity or impulsivity. If the disorder has been properly diagnosed, the medication should have the opposite effect. Common mild side effects are decreased appetite, weight loss, stomachaches, sleep problems, headaches, and jitteriness. Adjusting the dose can often help eliminate these problems. Stimulant drugs are associated with some serious concerns and side effects, including:
        
          Tics. There is some evidence that tics (uncontrolled movements) are more likely in patients with a family history of tic disorders, but that is still controversial.
          Substance abuse. Stimulant drugs can be and are abused. Research has also shown that stimulant treatment may reduce the risk of substance abuse for some people with ADHD. There is not enough evidence to say that stimulants either increase or decrease the risk of later substance abuse.
          Growth delays. Experts disagree about the effects of stimulants on growth. There is some evidence that children taking stimulants grow at a rate that is less than expected. Some doctors recommend stopping stimulants periodically during periods of expected growth.
          Cardiovascular risk. Children taking stimulants do show small increases in blood pressure and heart rate. But major heart complications in children, teens, and adults taking these drugs are extremely rare. If your child does not have underlying heart disease, your doctor may not recommend getting an electrocardiogram before starting a stimulant.
        
        Since such risks vary widely depending on the individual, it is important to discuss the potential benefits and risks of each treatment with your doctor.
        Another potential problem, which strictly speaking is not a side effect, is that stimulants can find their way to people other than the person being treated for ADHD. Called diversion, it is fairly common among adolescents and young adults. The drugs are most often taken to improve academic performance. Some individuals do take stimulants to get high.
        Other nonstimulant medications are also available to treat ADHD. These are especially useful when there is reluctance to start a stimulant. Atomoxetine (Strattera) or viloxazine (Qelbree) can be effective for treating ADHD. They work by a different chemical mechanism than stimulants. The antidepressant bupropion (Wellbutrin) is helpful in some cases. Two other medicines — guanfacine and clonidine — also have shown some benefit for ADHD symptoms, but they have weaker effects than stimulants.
        Other treatment approaches, used alone or in combination, may include:
        
          Behavioral therapy — This refers to techniques that try to improve behavior, usually by rewarding and encouraging desirable behaviors and by discouraging unwanted behaviors and pointing out the consequences.
          Cognitive therapy — This is psychotherapy designed to change thinking to build self-esteem, stop having negative thoughts, and improve problem-solving skills.
          Social skill training — Developing social skills improves friendships.
          Parent education and support — Training classes, support groups, and counselors can help to teach and support parents about ADHD, including strategies for dealing with ADHD-related behaviors.
        
        Because many children with ADHD also are troubled by poor grades and school behavior problems, schools may need to provide educational adjustments and interventions (such as an individualized educational plan) to promote the best possible learning environment for the child.
        When to call a professional
        Call your doctor if your child shows symptoms of ADHD, or if teachers notify you that your child is having academic difficulties, behavioral problems, or difficulty paying attention.
        Prognosis
        ADHD can cause significant emotional, social, and educational problems. However, when ADHD is diagnosed early and treated properly, the condition can be managed effectively, so children can grow up to have productive, successful, and fulfilling lives. Although some children appear to grow out of their ADHD as they reach their adolescent years, others have lifelong symptoms.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/narcolepsy-a-to-z,Narcolepsy,"What is narcolepsy?
        Narcolepsy is a disorder that causes sudden episodes of deep sleep. These episodes can occur often and at inappropriate times, for example while a person is talking, eating, or driving. Although sleep episodes can happen at any time, they may be more frequent during periods of inactivity or monotonous, repetitive activity.
        Narcolepsy usually appears between ages 15 and 30, but the condition can appear earlier or later. Once it appears, narcolepsy is present for life. Men and women are affected equally.
        About 50% of people with diagnosed narcolepsy have the combination of marked daytime sleepiness and sudden episodes of muscle weakness (called cataplexy). The muscle weakness can be so severe that a person with narcolepsy will collapse to the floor, but not become unconscious. This type of narcolepsy is associated with a shortage of a brain-stimulating protein called orexin (also known as hypocretin).
        The cause of other types of narcolepsy is unknown. A genetic (inherited) predisposition appears to play a role.
        People with narcolepsy don't require extra hours of sleep, but they do need daytime naps because they have difficulty staying awake for long periods. During the night, healthy people normally progress through several stages of sleep before entering or leaving the state of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM). During REM sleep, your brain waves resemble those of an awake person, visual dreams occur, and muscle tone is slack. In narcolepsy, the brain-wave pattern can skip some or all of the other sleep stages, causing the person to move from the awake state immediately to REM sleep, or to awaken directly from the REM sleep stage.
        Symptoms of narcolepsy
        The earliest symptom of narcolepsy is usually daytime sleepiness, which may be extreme. However, it may take years to recognize the disorder because other, more common causes of daytime sleepiness often are blamed for the symptoms.
        Narcolepsy has four main symptoms. It is common for people with narcolepsy to have more than one symptom, but it is rare for a person with the disease to experience all four:
        
          Excessive daytime sleepiness — This is always present and is usually the most prominent symptom.
          Cataplexy — This is the sudden, temporary loss of muscle tone, which causes paralysis of the head or body while the person remains conscious. It can last a few seconds or several minutes. Mild attacks can cause slurred or stuttering speech, drooping eyelids or hand weakness that causes the person to drop objects. Severe attacks can cause the knees to buckle, leading to collapse. Typically, cataplexy is brought on by laughter, excitement or anger. The sudden relaxing of muscle tone is probably the result of the brain abruptly entering REM sleep.
          Sleep paralysis — This is the temporary inability to move while falling asleep or awakening. It lasts no more than several minutes. Like cataplexy, sleep paralysis probably is related to insufficient separation between REM sleep and the awake state.
          Hypnagogic hallucinations — These are dreamlike images that are seen during the awake state instead of during sleep. These often-frightening visions are seen just as the person is falling asleep or waking up. They tend to occur in people who also have sleep paralysis.
        
        Symptoms usually begin during adolescence or young adulthood. People with narcolepsy complain of fatigue, experience impaired performance at work and school, and may have difficulty in social relationships. Excessive daytime sleepiness can be disabling and may greatly diminish a person's quality of life. Memory lapses and visual disturbances may be particularly upsetting.
        More than 50% of people with narcolepsy experience periods of memory lapse or blackouts caused by very short periods of sleep called microsleeps. Microsleeps are not unique to people with narcolepsy, and they can be experienced by anyone who is severely sleep deprived. They are periods of sleep that last only a few seconds, and usually are not noticed. During such episodes, a person may get lost while walking or driving, write or speak nonsense, misplace objects, or bump into things. Later in the course of narcolepsy, a person also can develop insomnia (difficulty sleeping) during normal sleeping hours.
        Diagnosing narcolepsy
        To diagnose narcolepsy, your doctor will ask you about your history of typical episodes and will have you undergo an overnight sleep study. The sleep study checks for other explanations that could account for daytime sleepiness, such as sleep apnea or other causes of sleep interruptions. The sleep test measures brain waves, eye movements, muscle activity, heartbeat, blood oxygen levels, and breathing.
        A specific study called a multiple sleep latency test is a necessary part of the evaluation for narcolepsy. This test must be done after the person has had an adequate night's sleep. A multiple sleep latency test consists of four 20-minute opportunities to nap, which are offered every two hours throughout the day. Patients with narcolepsy fall asleep in approximately five minutes or less, and move into REM sleep during at least two of the four naps. Normal, well-rested sleepers take about 12 to 14 minutes to fall asleep for a daytime nap, and don't fall directly into REM sleep.
        Expected duration of narcolepsy
        Narcolepsy cannot be cured and does not go away. In most cases, symptoms can be diminished with medications, regularly scheduled naps, and good sleep habits.
        Preventing narcolepsy
        There is no way to prevent narcolepsy. For people who have the condition, avoiding conditions that bring on narcolepsy episodes may help to reduce their frequency. If you have narcolepsy and your symptoms are not controlled with medicines, you should never smoke because you could fall asleep with a lit cigarette, and you should never drive.
        Treating narcolepsy
        The main symptom of narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness, can be partially relieved with medications that stimulate the central nervous system. Doctors often prescribe a trial of modafinil (Provigil) first. Other potential choices include armodafinil (Nuvigil), pitolisant (Wakix), or solriamfetol (Sunosi).
        regularly scheduled time for exercise and short naps during the day also helps reduce daytime sleepiness.
        Cataplexy and sleep paralysis can be treated with a variety of medicines that can make you more resistant to entering REM sleep. Most of these medicines were developed for use as antidepressants. Examples of potentially effective medications include venlafaxine (Effexor), fluoxetine (Prozac), and protriptyline (Vivactil).
        Cataplexy also can be treated with sodium oxybate (also called gamma hydroxybutyrate or Xyrem), although the use of this drug is tightly controlled because it has been abused recreationally. For reasons that are not well understood, a low dose of this medicine reduces cataplexy attacks and improves daytime sleepiness in people who have narcolepsy with cataplexy, even though the drug causes sedation in most people without narcolepsy.
        Psychological counseling may be important for difficulties associated with self-esteem and for emotional support, especially since people with narcolepsy have difficulty doing tasks that require concentration, and may be regarded as unmotivated by family and peers.
        When to call a professional
        Call a doctor if you are excessively sleepy during the day. You should be evaluated as quickly as possible if episodes occur while you are driving a car or operating machinery.
        Prognosis
        People with narcolepsy have a significantly higher risk of death or serious injury resulting from motor vehicle or job-related accidents, and they must take care to avoid situations where such accidents might occur.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/giardiasis-a-to-z,Giardiasis,"What is giardiasis?
        Giardiasis is an intestinal illness caused by infection with the parasite Giardia lamblia, which lives in contaminated water. Although the illness most often occurs in developing countries, giardiasis is also a common cause of waterborne illness in the United States. A person can remain infected with Giardia until the infection is diagnosed and treated.
        In developing areas of the world, it is common for more than 20% of a country's population to have ongoing Giardia infection. In the United States, only one or two out of every 10,000 people have Giardia in a typical year, but the infection is found in about one out of three people who have prolonged diarrhea symptoms if they have recently traveled to a developing country.
        As one part of their life cycle, G. lamblia parasites change into cysts. Contagious cysts are found in the feces of infected people or animals. You can become infected with G. lamblia by:
        
          drinking water that has been contaminated with Giardia cysts (usually because the water has come into contact with sewage)
          eating uncooked fruits or vegetables that have been washed in contaminated water
          eating uncooked fruits or vegetables from a garden where contaminated fertilizer has been used
          touching feces, diapers, or objects soiled with feces, then failing to adequately wash your hands
          having direct contact with an infected person or animal, then failing to adequately wash your hands.
        
        G. lamblia can survive in cold, chlorinated water for up to two months, and outbreaks have occurred in municipal water supplies.
        People at greatest risk of giardiasis include:
        
          children in day care centers and their families
          day care workers
          travelers to developing countries
          campers who drink unprocessed water
          homosexual men (because of anal sex).
        
        Children are three times more likely to develop giardiasis than adults. It is possible that the human body develops some immunity to the parasite over time.
        Symptoms of giardiasis
        Up to two-thirds of people infected with the organism do not have any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can appear suddenly and be obvious or they may worsen slowly. Typically, symptoms start one to three weeks after exposure and include:
        
          watery diarrhea
          abdominal cramping
          bloating
          nausea with or without vomiting
          gas
          floating or unusually smelly stools
          weight loss
          new intolerance to milk and dairy foods in your diet
          low-grade fever
          loss of appetite.
        
        Some of the symptoms can take several months or more to begin because they are caused by gradual changes in the lining of your intestine. G. lamblia interferes with the body's ability to absorb fats, so your stools may have more fat in them during a Giardia infection. This is why your stools may float and smell foul.
        Diagnosing giardiasis
        Your doctor will ask you about your travel history, whether you might have had contact with contaminated water during camping or hiking, and whether your home has well water. If the patient is a child who attends day care, the doctor will ask about any recent outbreaks of diarrhea at the day care center. He or she also will review the patient's symptoms.
        The diagnosis is made by testing the stool for Giardia antigen, a protein that is made by G. lamblia parasites, or by identifying G. lamblia cysts or parasites in stool samples. Multiple stool samples may need to be collected since the infection can only be detected in a portion of collected stool samples, even if infection is present.
        Infrequently, diagnosis may require an inspection of the intestine with a procedure called endoscopy. In this procedure, an instrument called an endoscope is inserted through your mouth into your intestine. An endoscope is a narrow, flexible, cord-shaped instrument that is equipped with a camera. If necessary, your doctor can use the endoscope to take a small piece of tissue from your small intestine (a biopsy) to be examined in a laboratory.
        Expected duration of giardiasis
        The worst symptoms of giardiasis typically last for five to seven days, as long as diagnosis and treatment is not delayed. Symptoms can take as long as several months to completely go away after treatment because the intestine needs to repair itself. It is common to be intolerant to milk and other dairy products that contain lactose for the first few months after a Giardia infection. In some people who are not treated, the infection can cause repeated bouts of abdominal pain and diarrhea for a year or longer.
        Preventing giardiasis
        There is no vaccine that can prevent giardiasis. Medicine to prevent infection is not recommended. The best way to prevent infection is good travel habits and good sanitation.
        Travelers should take special care to avoid food and water that could be contaminated. It is safest to eat produce that has been peeled or cooked. Cooking kills Giardia parasites and cysts.
        To prevent giardiasis caused by contaminated water, drink water only from approved sources. When camping and when traveling to developing countries, drink bottled water or other beverages that have been bottled or canned. Campers can drink bottled water, treat water with iodine for eight or more hours, use a high-quality water filter or boil water for at least one minute. Travelers to developing countries should avoid drinking beverages that are served with ice.
        It is always a good habit to wash your hands frequently. This can reduce your risk of Giardia infection at home and while traveling. It is especially important to wash your hands after you use the bathroom, before you eat, after you change a diaper and after you care for a sick person or animal.
        Treating giardiasis
        If you don't receive treatment for a Giardia infection, you will probably eventually recover on your own. However, treatment is a good idea for anyone who is having symptoms. Treatment can also help if you don't have symptoms because treatment can prevent the spread of infection to others. This is especially true for children and for people who prepare or serve food.
        Commonly prescribed medications used to treat Giardia infection include tinidazole (Tindamax), nitazoxanide (Alinia), and metronidazole (Flagyl).
        A doctor should examine and consider treatment for sexual partners and people who have had close contact with the infected person, such as household members, even if they have no symptoms. Pregnant women generally are not treated with medications during the first trimester.
        If you have giardiasis, be sure to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Over-the-counter medications for diarrhea, such as loperamide (Imodium), may help your symptoms. Wash your hands frequently if you have giardiasis or if you are caring for a person or animal with this infection.
        When to call a professional
        See your doctor if you get diarrhea, especially if this diarrhea lasts for longer than several days, produces stools that float and smell foul, or if you also have abdominal cramps, bloating and fever.
        Prognosis
        In otherwise healthy people, giardiasis generally goes away completely within weeks, with or without treatment. In some cases, Giardia can be a long-term problem if it is not treated.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs-a-to-z,Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),"What is IBS?
        Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that causes a variety of symptoms, including:
        
          abdominal pain
          diarrhea and/or constipation
          bloating
          gassiness
          cramping.
        
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        The severity of the disorder varies from person to person. Some people experience symptoms that come and go and are just mildly annoying. Others have such severe daily bowel problems that IBS affects their ability to work, sleep, and enjoy life.
        In addition, symptoms may change over time. A person may have severe symptoms for several weeks and then feel well for months or even years.
        Most people are never cured of IBS. However, the disorder is not related to any other disease. It does not develop into colitis. People with IBS do not have an increased risk of colon cancer.
        IBS usually starts in early adulthood. It affects twice as many women as men. Approximately 10% to 20% of the population has IBS, but half of all people with the condition never seek medical care for their symptoms.
        No one knows what causes IBS. Some studies suggest that the nerves of the colon may be much more sensitive than usual in people with IBS. The normal movement of food and gas through the colon causes pain, intestinal spasms, and an irregular pattern of bowel movements.
        Stress does not cause IBS, but stress can increase the frequency and severity of symptoms.
        IBS has been called irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis, and functional bowel disease.
        Symptoms of IBS
        People with IBS may have some or all of these symptoms:
        
          mild or severe abdominal pain, discomfort, or cramping that usually goes away after a bowel movement
          periods of diarrhea or constipation, or alternating between these two symptoms
          bloating, gassiness, or a feeling of having a distended abdomen
          mucus in bowel movements
          feeling as though a bowel movement is incomplete.
        
        Although the symptoms of IBS often change over time, people tend to develop their own pattern. For example, some people have mostly diarrhea, some have mostly constipation, and others have abdominal pain without a major change in bowel movements.
        Diagnosing IBS
        There is no test for IBS. Your doctor will diagnose IBS if you have the typical symptoms and have been tested for other disorders that can cause similar symptoms.
        Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms. Your doctor will examine you, testing your abdomen for tenderness and feeling to determine whether internal organs are larger than normal. The doctor will check for fever or weight loss. If you have any of these signs, you likely have something other than IBS.
        Depending on your medical history, your doctor may do tests to eliminate other diseases that may cause similar symptoms. These tests might include:
        
          blood tests
          stool sample, to check for blood or evidence of infection
          sigmoidoscopy, in which a flexible, lighted tube with a tiny camera on the end is inserted into the rectum and up the left side of the colon
          colonoscopy, in which a longer tube examines the entire colon.
        
        Your doctor may suggest that you stop eating or drinking certain foods for up to three weeks to determine if your diet is contributing to your symptoms. For example, your doctor may ask you to eliminate milk products if he or she suspects lactose intolerance.
        Expected duration of IBS
        IBS symptoms may be a daily problem throughout a person's life. Symptoms may come and go, lasting a day, a week, or a month before disappearing. Dietary changes with or without medication may help to reduce the frequency or severity of symptoms.
        Preventing IBS
        Because no one knows what causes IBS, it is impossible to prevent the disorder. Once diagnosed with IBS, a person may be able to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms by reducing stress or changing the diet.
        Treating IBS
        Changing your diet may improve symptoms dramatically. It often takes a long time to discover what works well for you, and you may need to alter your original program if symptoms flare.
        Keep track of the different foods you eat throughout the day. See which foods seem to make your symptoms worse. After you discover your particular trigger foods, eliminate them from your diet. Some common IBS trigger foods include:
        
          cabbage, broccoli, kale, legumes, and other gas-producing foods
          caffeine
          alcohol
          dairy products
          fatty foods, including whole milk, cream, cheese, butter, oils, meats, and avocados
          raw fruits
          foods, gums, and beverages that contain sorbitol, an artificial sweetener.
        
        The way you eat may help to create IBS symptoms. Eating large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea, so eating smaller meals more often may help some people with IBS. Eating quickly can cause you to swallow air, which can cause belching or gas.
        Adding fiber to your diet, especially if constipation is one of your main symptoms, often helps to regulate your bowel movements and reduce abdominal discomfort. At first, fiber will increase the amount of gas in your system, so add fiber gradually. Over time, the body adjusts to the effects of fiber and the gassiness will decrease. Fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain breads and cereals are good food sources of fiber.
        Your doctor may recommend a fiber supplement. Some experts believe that the fiber methylcellulose creates the least amount of gas, and brands of this fiber are often recommended for people with IBS. Psyllium is also a good source of fiber.
        A low-FODMAP diet helps relieve symptoms for many people with IBS. You need to review a list of foods that have a high amount of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, and reduce their intake.
        If your symptoms are not relieved after you eliminate trigger foods and add fiber, your doctor may prescribe medications.
        For people that have frequent loose stools (diarrhea-predominant IBS), medication options include:
        
          antidiarrheals — loperamide (Imodium), diphenoxylate (Lomotil and other brand names)
          antispasmodics to reduce cramping — dicyclomine (Bentyl)
          pain-reducing agents — amitriptyline (Elavil), desipramine (Norpramin)
          alosetron (Lotronex) is approved only for women with severe diarrhea-predominant IBS who have very severe diarrhea and have not responded to other treatments. To receive this drug, you must sign a form stating that you are aware of life-threatening complications, such as a blocked, ruptured, or damaged bowel.
        
        For people with constipation-predominant IBS, fiber and plenty of fluids are the mainstays of therapy. If medication is needed, your doctor may prescribe an osmotic laxative such as lactulose.
        Other drugs available for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome include:
        
          lubiprostone (Amitiza), which is approved for women with persistent constipation
          linaclotide (LINZESS) and plecanatide (Trulance), which are approved for adults age 18 and older.
        
        Both drugs act on the cells that line the inside of the intestines. They promote increased fluid secretion into the intestine, making stool passage easier.
        Stress reduction through mindfulness, meditation, yoga, or other practices, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can be extremely helpful.
        When to call a professional
        It is useful for anyone with irritable bowel symptoms to discuss their symptoms with a doctor, so that diet, fiber, stress reduction, and drug treatment strategies can be planned.
        After you have been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, contact your doctor if you have:
        
          an episode of severe symptoms
          unexplained weight loss or fever
          blood in your stool
          abdominal pain that is accompanied by vomiting, dizziness, or fainting
          abdominal pain or diarrhea that awakens you from sleep.
        
        Prognosis
        There is no cure for IBS. But most people can lessen the symptoms by making dietary changes, reducing stress, and — if necessary — taking medication.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/folliculitis-treatment-and-prevention,Folliculitis treatment and prevention,"If you have red, itchy, painful bumps on your skin, you may have folliculitis. Learn what folliculitis is, how to treat it, and ways to prevent it.

What is folliculitis?

Folliculitis is an inflammation of the hair follicles, the tiny pockets in your skin from which hair grows. When these follicles become inflamed or infected, it can lead to small, red, and sometimes pus-filled bumps on the skin. Folliculitis can happen anywhere you have hair, but it's most common on the face, scalp, arms, and legs.

Folliculitis causes and symptoms

Folliculitis is most often caused by bacterial infection. Other infectious causes of folliculitis include fungi, viruses, and parasites. Folliculitis can also result from noninfectious causes, for example, when hair follicles are irritated or damaged by things like shaving or rubbing against right clothing. Types of folliculitis include:


	Bacterial folliculitis:Staphylococcus aureus bacteria are the most common cause of bacterial folliculitis. So-called ""hot tub"" folliculitis is usually caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria and may occur in people who use hot tubs with poorly maintained water.
	Fungal folliculitis: Also called pityrosporum folliculitis, this condition is often seen during the teenage years due to more active oil glands. It appears across the shoulders, back, and neck.
	Viral folliculitis: Often caused by the herpes simplex virus, this type of folliculitis is usually painful and occurs in groups or clusters on the skin.
	Eosinophilic folliculitis: Primarily seen in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. It involves an accumulation of a type of white blood cell (eosinophils) around the hair follicles, leading to irritation and inflammation.
	Demodex folliculitis: This condition is caused by tiny Demodex mites, which live in the hair follicles and oil glands on our skin. When there are too many of these mites, they can cause irritation and redness, leading to folliculitis. This is most common in people with rosacea.
	Noninfectious folliculitis: Also called pseudofolliculitis, this can be caused by irritation from shaving or wearing tight clothing.


Symptoms of folliculitis can vary based on the cause, but often share common features. Common symptoms include:


	clusters of small red bumps or white-headed pimples around hair follicles
	itching or burning skin
	painful, swollen bumps
	pus-filled blisters that break open and crust over.


Folliculitis is often mistaken for keratosis pilaris (KP), a common skin condition characterized by small, rough bumps often found on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks, or buttocks. Unlike folliculitis, KP is caused by a buildup of keratin that blocks hair follicles. KP can be managed with exfoliation and moisturizing.

Treating folliculitis

Treatment for folliculitis depends on the severity and cause. For mild cases, keeping the affected area clean and avoiding irritants might be enough. Warm compresses can help soothe itching and promote healing. Most folliculitis resolves on its own within seven to 10 days.

If your folliculitis does not improve on its own, see your doctor. For persistent cases, a doctor might prescribe medications that are applied to the skin or taken by mouth. For folliculitis caused bacterial infection, a doctor might prescribe a topical antibiotic or antibiotic pills. If the cause is a fungus, an antifungal cream or shampoo may be recommended. Viral folliculitis can be treated with antiviral medications, and Demodex folliculitis can be treated with antiparasitic medications.

In severe cases, a minor procedure to drain large boils might be necessary. Eosinophilic folliculitis usually requires treatment of the underlying, immune-suppressing condition.

Preventing folliculitis

Folliculitis can often be prevented by adopting simple habits that make your skin less susceptible to infection and irritation. Preventive measures include:


	Practice good hygiene. Keep your skin clean and dry. Clean your skin gently with a mild soap and water, particularly after sweating from exercise or spending time outdoors.
	Avoid tight clothing. Wear loose, breathable clothes to reduce irritation.
	Shave carefully. Use a clean, sharp razor and shave in the direction of hair growth. Consider using shaving cream or gel to reduce friction.
	Limit exposure to hot tubs. If you do use a hot tub, make sure it's clean and well maintained.
	Avoid sharing personal items. To reduce the risk of infection, don't share towels, razors, or clothing.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","October 10, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/diverticulosis-and-diverticulitis-a-to-z,Diverticulosis and diverticulitis,"What are diverticulosis and diverticulitis?
        In diverticulosis, small pouches develop and bulge out through weak spots in the walls of the colon, typically in the part of the colon called the sigmoid colon on the left side of the abdomen. These small, balloon-like pouches are called diverticula.
        The condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States ages 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        If the diverticula become inflamed or infected, the condition is called diverticulitis.
        Diverticulitis can lead to serious complications such as abscess, perforation, intestinal blockage from internal scarring, or fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two organs. A rare but life-threatening complication called peritonitis can occur when diverticula rupture, leaking infection into the abdominal cavity.
        Symptoms of diverticulosis and diverticulitis
        Most people who have diverticulosis don't have any symptoms, but some have mild cramps, constipation, or bloating. Diverticulitis causes more severe symptoms, including any of the following, but particularly the first two:
        
          steady abdominal pain
          tenderness to pressure in the lower abdomen, especially on the left side
          fever
          nausea
          vomiting
          chills
          cramping
          change in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea)
          sharper pain with breathing or jarring movements such as walking.
        
        Lower intestinal bleeding can occur in people with diverticulosis. The loss of blood can cause weakness and dizziness.
        Diagnosing diverticulosis and diverticulitis
        The condition is more prevalent as people age. For example, it is estimated that half of people in the United States aged 60 to 80 have diverticulosis, but only one person in 10 develops it by age 40. It is equally common in women and men. However, unless you have had a colonoscopy, CT scan of your abdomen, or barium enema, you would not be aware they exist.
        On the other hand, diverticulitis almost always causes symptoms. Your doctor will ask about your medical history, bowel habits, and diet and will conduct a physical examination. Your doctor will press on your abdomen to check for tenderness.
        Based on the location of your symptoms and the location of abdominal pain and tenderness, your doctor may be able to make the diagnosis without further testing. If your doctor is unsure or concerned that you may have an abscess or other complication, he or she will likely order additional studies. These usually include blood tests for signs of infection and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan.
        Lower intestinal bleeding is commonly caused by a broken blood vessel within a diverticula. But it is often very difficult to identify the exact bleeding site, even with colonoscopy.
        Expected duration of diverticulosis and diverticulitis
        Diverticula do not disappear unless the section of colon is removed surgically. Diverticulosis is a lifelong condition that can be managed, primarily with adjustments in diet.
        Symptoms of diverticulitis or bleeding from diverticulosis may subside within a few days after treatment, may continue, or may get worse in the case of severe illness or complications.
        Preventing diverticulosis and diverticulitis
        People whose diets contain large amounts of fiber are less likely to develop diverticular disease. The recommended daily fiber intake is at least 20 grams per day, but a healthier goal is 35 grams of fiber daily, preferably from fruits, vegetables, and grains. Your doctor also may recommend unprocessed bran or a fiber product. It is important to increase fiber intake gradually and to drink more water to increase the bulk of the bowel movements, which reduces pressure inside the bowel.
        Physical activity also may lower the risk of diverticulosis. Many doctors previously recommended that people with diverticulosis avoid eating nuts, popcorn, and foods with seeds. This restriction has not been proven to prevent diverticulitis.
        Treating diverticulosis and diverticulitis
        The only possible treatment for diverticulosis is to increase fiber in the diet. Fiber will not heal existing diverticula, but it may prevent more from forming.
        If you have symptoms of mild diverticulitis, your doctor may recommend a short period of observation without antibiotics. There are no specific dietary recommendations, but many doctors suggest a low-fiber diet until symptoms resolve. If the diagnosis is uncertain, an abdominal CT scan is usually ordered. Depending on the results, your doctor can then decide if treatment at home with oral antibiotics versus intravenous (IV) antibiotics, either at home or in the hospital.
        If fever and pain continues, you may be developing complicated diverticulitis, For example, an abscess can develop when a diverticulum becomes perforated (develops a hole). An abscess is a collection of pus. A surgeon then will help your doctor plan the next step: drainage or surgery. The choice depends on the extent of the problem and your overall health. Drainage means that the surgeon cleans out the pus.
        Surgery also may be required during the hospital stay to treat a particularly severe episode of diverticulitis. Emergency surgery is required if the abscess breaks open and causes peritonitis, the most serious potential complication of diverticulitis. Peritonitis requires surgical repair as well as intravenous antibiotics.
        For persistent or recurrent bleeding from diverticulosis, surgery may be the only option.
        The most common procedure, known as a colon resection, involves removing the part of the colon that contains the bleeding diverticula and reattaching the ends.
        When done during emergencies, a colon resection is often done as a two-stage process. First, a section of colon is removed, but because of infection, it is not safe to rejoin the ends. Instead, the surgeon creates a temporary hole, or stoma, in the abdomen and connects the colon to it, a procedure called a colostomy. A bag is attached to collect the stool. Later, a second operation is done to reattach the end of the colon, and remove the colostomy.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        After successful treatment for diverticulitis, your doctor normally will recommend a high-fiber diet. Later, you may need to have a procedure called a colonoscopy, which is an internal examination of the colon.
        In general, surgery is not recommended after only one or even two attacks without complications. However, it is usually recommended after a third episode occurs in the same location within the colon.
        Repeated episodes of diverticulitis can lead to internal scarring and narrowing of the colon, which also may require surgery to remove a piece of the colon.
        When to call a professional
        Call your doctor if abdominal pain in one spot lasts for longer than a few hours, especially if it becomes worse or is accompanied by fever.
        Prognosis
        With proper treatment and a high-fiber diet, the outlook for people with diverticulosis and uncomplicated diverticulitis is excellent. Most people with diverticulosis never have symptoms.
        People who have diverticulitis usually improve within two to four days after treatment begins. Over 85% of patients recover with bed rest and liquid diet, with or without antibiotics. Most never have a second episode of diverticulitis.
        The prognosis varies if complications develop and is particularly serious in the case of peritonitis.
        About 90% of people who have a colon resection do not have symptoms return after the surgery.

Today, popular calisthenics exercises like squats, chin-ups, burpees, and planks have been added to the mix. Calisthenics exercises can range from easy to hard and can be modified as needed to meet your fitness level.
        Benefits of calisthenics
        Calisthenics has been practiced since the time of the ancient Greeks. This type of exercise offers multiple benefits. Here are a few:
        Convenience: Calisthenics became one of the most popular exercises during the COVID-19 pandemic. The exercises can be done anywhere and anytime. You can do these exercises when it's convenient for you, where it's convenient for you, and without any special equipment. Plus, it's free.
        Adaptability: Body-weight exercises can be tailored to fit your fitness level, whether you're just starting out or are already an athlete. As you get stronger, you'll be able to complete more repetitions of the exercise, or incorporate modifications such as pulses or isometric holds to challenge the muscles.
        Efficiency: Even smaller amounts of body-weight exercise can yield positive results. In one study, a routine of eight simple lower-body exercises — such as squats, knee lifts, and heel raises — led to a 15% increase in muscle strength and power after 10 months.
        Effectiveness: Body-weight training is highly effective, which is why both the military and elite gymnasts use it to achieve results. Research shows that body-weight exercises can build muscle effectively without the need for external weights. Studies also show calisthenics can increase aerobic capacity, muscle endurance (especially in the core), and flexibility.
        Getting started with calisthenics
        Getting started with calisthenics is straightforward since you don't need equipment or a gym. All you need is some space where you can safely do the exercises. This can be in your own home if you have a flat surface with enough space to perform the exercises.
        Having a repertoire of go-to exercises that are easy to do can also make starting a calisthenics program easier. You can modify these exercises to become more challenging as you develop greater strength and stamina.
        Before starting any new exercise program, discuss your goals and plans with your doctor, especially if you have a medical condition such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, or osteoporosis.
        To get the best results from your calisthenics program, keep these tips in mind:
        
          Warm up properly. Give yourself five to 10 minutes to warm up before a workout. This allows your body to prepare for exercise by providing more oxygen to your muscles, lubricating your joints, and increasing your range of motion.
          Build up gradually. Taking on too much too soon can lead to injuries. As you gain strength, you can gradually add repetitions, sets, and additional exercises.
          Focus on form. As with all exercises, good form will ensure that you get the most benefits and will help you avoid injuries.
          Don't lock your joints. When straightening out your legs and arms, always leave a slight bend in your knees and elbows.
          Work in a pain-free range of motion. When moving your arms or legs, stick with a range that feels comfortable.
          Let muscles recover. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends only two or three complete strength workouts a week; consider giving yourself a day off in between.
          Keep moves slow and controlled, and breathe throughout. Blood pressure rises if you hold your breath during resistance exercises.
        
        Sample calisthenics workout
        You can try the exercises below as part of a calisthenics routine. When you are training for strength, aim for eight to 12 repetitions, or reps. If you cannot do all the reps at first, just do what you can, and then gradually increase reps as you improve. Beginners can start with one set of reps, working up to three sets as you develop strength. Rest 30 to 90 seconds between sets.
        Knee lift (warm-up exercise)
        
          
            
          
        
        Starting position: Stand up straight with your feet together.
        Movement: Lift your right knee as high as is comfortable, touching both hands to the knee. Lower your leg, and then repeat with your left knee. This is one rep.
        Half squat
        
          
            
          
        
        Starting position: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms at your sides.
        Movement: Slowly bend your hips and knees, lowering your buttocks about eight inches, as if you're sitting back in a chair. Let your arms swing forward to help you balance. Keep your spine neutral. Hold. Slowly return to the starting position.
        Kneeling push-up
        
          
        
        Starting position: Kneel on all fours with your hands shoulder-width apart. Walk your hands forward and lower your hips so your body is at a 45° angle to the floor and forms a straight line from head to knees.
        Movement: Bend your elbows out to the sides and slowly lower your upper body toward the floor until your elbows are bent about 90°. Press against the floor and straighten your arms to return to the starting position.
        Make it harder: Lift your knees off the floor and do push-ups supporting yourself on your hands and the toes and balls of your feet.
        Side lunge with a knee lift
        
          
        
        Starting position: Stand up straight with your feet together and your arms at your sides.
        Movement: Step out to the side with your left foot while keeping your right foot in place. As your left foot hits the ground, transfer most of your weight to your left leg, hinge forward at your hips, and bend your left knee, lowering into a lunge. Keep your right leg straight and put your hands on your left thigh for support. Press into your left foot to stand back up, shifting your weight onto your right foot, and raise your left knee to hip level. Get your balance, and then step out with your left leg again for another lunge. Continue for 30 seconds. Repeat the sequence, stepping out to the right for 30 seconds.
        Plank with a knee drop
        
          
        
        Starting position: Kneel on all fours with your hands and knees directly aligned under your shoulders and hips. Extend both legs with your feet flexed and toes touching the floor so that you are balancing on your palms, toes, and balls of your feet, like the top position of a push-up. This is the plank.
        Movement: Tighten your abdominal muscles. Lower both knees toward the floor, then extend your legs again to return to the plank position.",Jenette Restivo,"October 3, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/evoking-calm-practicing-mindfulness-in-daily-life-helps-202110142617,Evoking calm: Practicing mindfulness in daily life helps,"It's easy to say you simply don't have time to be mindful. With so much going on in daily life, who has time to stop and be present? But everyone has at least 10 minutes to spare to practice mindfulness.
        The point of these brief, daily reflections is to help you tap into calmness whenever life gets too hairy. Practicing everyday mindfulness can also improve your memory and concentration skills and help you feel less distracted and better able to manage stress . And mindfulness tools have been successfully incorporated into treatments for anxiety and depression.
        There is more than one way to practice mindfulness. Still, any mindfulness technique aims to achieve a state of alert, focused, relaxed consciousness by deliberately paying attention to thoughts and sensations without passing judgment on them. This allows the mind to focus on the present moment with an attitude of acceptance.
        Three easy mindfulness exercises to try
        Here are three simple exercises you can try whenever you need a mental break, emotional lift, or just want to pause and appreciate everything around you. Devote 10 minutes a day to them and see how the experience changes your outlook. It's time well spent.
        Simple meditation
        A quick and easy meditation is an excellent place to begin practicing mindfulness.
        
          Sit on a straight-backed chair or cross-legged on the floor.
          Focus on an aspect of your breathing, such as the sensations of air flowing into your nostrils and out of your mouth, or your belly rising and falling as you inhale and exhale.
          Once you've narrowed your concentration in this way, begin to widen your focus. Become aware of sounds, sensations, and ideas. Embrace and consider each without judgment.
          If your mind starts to race, return your focus to your breathing. Then expand your awareness again.
          Take as much time as you like: one minute, or five, or 10 — whatever you're comfortable with. Experts in mindfulness meditation note that the practice is most helpful if you commit to a regular meditation schedule.
        
        Open awareness
        Another approach to mindfulness is ""open awareness,"" which helps you stay in the present and truly participate in specific moments in life. You can choose any task or moment to practice open awareness, such as eating, taking a walk, showering, cooking a meal, or working in the garden. When you are engaged in these and other similar routine activities, follow these steps.
        
          Bring your attention to the sensations in your body, both physical and emotional.
          Breathe in through your nose, allowing the air to fill your lungs. Let your abdomen expand fully. Then breathe out slowly through your mouth.
          Carry on with the task at hand, slowly and with deliberation.
          Engage each of your senses, paying close attention to what you can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste.
          Try ""single-tasking,"" bringing your attention as fully as possible to what you're doing.
          Allow any thoughts or emotions that arise to come and go, like clouds passing through the sky.
          If your mind wanders away from your current task, gently refocus your attention back to the sensation of the moment.
        
        Body awareness
        Another way to practice mindfulness is to focus your attention on other thoughts, objects, and sensations. While sitting quietly with your eyes closed, channel your awareness toward each of the following:
        
          Sensations: Notice subtle feelings such as an itch or tingling without judgment, and let them pass. Notice each part of your body in succession from head to toe.
          Sights and sounds: Notice sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. Name them ""sight,"" ""sound,"" ""smell,"" ""taste,"" or ""touch"" without judgment and let them go.
          Emotions: Allow emotions to be present without judging them. Practice a steady and relaxed naming of emotions: ""joy,"" ""anger,"" ""frustration.""
          Urges: When you feel a craving or an urge (for instance, to eat excess food or practice an unwanted behavior), acknowledge the desire and understand that it will pass. Notice how your body feels as the craving enters. Replace the wish for the craving to go away with the specific knowledge that it will subside.",Matthew Solan,"October 1, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/gardening-and-yard-work-exercise-with-a-purpose,Gardening and yard work: Exercise with a purpose,"After an afternoon of raking leaves from your lawn or pulling weeds from your garden, you may wonder how much all that activity counts toward your daily exercise quota. The answer? More than you might think.
        ""Many yard and gardening tasks require enough effort to count as moderate-intensity exercise,"" says Dr. I-Min Lee, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert on the role of physical activity in preventing disease. For example, raking and many other garden chores require at least 3 metabolic equivalents (METs) — a standard measure that exercise researchers use to gauge exertion (see ""Lawn and garden care: How much effort?"").
        The U.S. physical activity guidelines call for doing at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise. You can meet that goal doing garden or yard chores — whether you do it all in just two days on the week-end or spread it throughout the week.
        
          
            
              
                Lawn and garden care: How much effort?
                A metabolic equivalent (MET) is a measure used by exercise researchers based on how much oxygen per minute the average person uses during a particular activity. One MET is the amount of energy you expend when you're sitting quietly. Activities rated at 2 METs use twice as much oxygen as sitting, 3 METs means three times as much oxygen, and so on. Activities that use 3 to 5.9 METs count as moderate-intensity exercise. Many common garden chores fall into this category.

        Stronger and safer?
        You may glean a few added health benefits from these outdoor endeavors. Several yard and garden chores — digging holes, shoveling soil and spreading compost, or bagging lawn clippings or leaves, for example — strengthen various muscles, including those in the legs, arms, and core. As Dr. Lee points out, the exercise guidelines also recommend muscle-strengthening exercises two days a week. Another benefit: As is also true for activities like walking, swimming, and dancing, gardening or yard work has a low rate of injuries when compared with higher-intensity, vigorous activities such as running.
        Reap what you sow
        There's even evidence to support body-wide benefits from gardening, according to a 2023 study in The Lancet Planetary Health. Researchers enrolled nearly 300 adults who hadn't gardened previously. They assigned half to a community gardening group, and asked the others to wait a year to start gardening. All wore activity monitors and took periodic surveys gauging their nutrition habits and mental health.
        People in the gardening group increased their physical activity levels by about 42 minutes per week. They also ate about 7% more fiber per day — possibly because they ate what they grew — compared with those who didn't garden. Plus, the gardeners reported greater reductions in stress and anxiety. All of those changes help lower the risk of heart disease. Other evidence points to improvements in physical and mental health from gardening, even if you grow flowers or other landscape plants instead of produce.
        If you enjoy gardening and yard work, it can be a good way to meet your exercise goals and bolster your cardiovascular health, says Dr. Lee. ""After all, the best regimen is doing activities that you enjoy, since you are more likely to consistently engage in them,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/depressions-cognitive-cost,Depression's cognitive cost,"Elaine's memory lapses seemed minor, but they happened often. She frequently forgot where she parked her car or why she walked into a room; reminiscing with a good friend, she could barely remember a wondrous vacation the two had shared in their 40s. Now in her mid-60s — and with a mother with Alzheimer's disease — Elaine fretted that these memory blanks signaled she, too, was developing dementia.
        But the true culprit was a lot sneakier: longstanding depression. A battery of cognitive tests ruled out dementia, easing Elaine's mind but provoking distress that a condition characterized by persistent sadness and apathy could also steal her ability to recall simple details.
        ""Few things are as depressing and anxiety-provoking as being aware you're having memory lapses or being afraid you might develop dementia,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School who conducted Elaine's cognitive tests.
        Inattention a factor
        An estimated 21 million American adults — roughly 8% — have experienced at least one episode of depression, and women are twice as likely as men to have the condition, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
        Most people associate depression with its hallmark symptoms, which include not only sadness and apathy, but also loss of enjoyment in things that previously brought pleasure, appetite changes, and trouble sleeping. Yet memory is often a casualty as well, with research suggesting that having depression increases a person's risk for memory problems. Depressive symptoms can even speed memory decline in older people, according to a study of 8,200 adults published online June 11, 2024, by JAMA Network Open.
        Dr. Budson points out that memory glitches common in depressed people are a byproduct of an overstimulated mind. ""I think of these more as attention deficits than memory deficits,"" he says. ""If someone has depression, they always have something on their mind that prevents them from focusing their full attention on where they are and what they're doing.""
        Indeed, just getting through the day can feel exhausting when you're depressed. But an inability to drum up energy and attention is only one contributor to depression-fueled memory problems, Dr. Budson says. It's believed that depression also alters levels of brain chemicals that help us focus, such as dopamine and norepinephrine. Memory issues may also stem from other depression-related changes in the brain involved in creating, combining, and recalling memories.
        How dementia is distinct
        Importantly, however, memory problems show up in depression quite differently than in Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.
        Someone who's depressed, for example, is likely to have a harder time retrieving long-ago memories — like the camping trip her family took when she was 8 — than remembering what she ate for breakfast that morning. A person with dementia, on the other hand, can typically summon memories from many years ago with ease, but can't recall where she went yesterday.
        That's because dementia damages the hippocampus, a brain structure in charge of helping us learn new information and retrieving recent memories. We don't need the hippocampus to retrieve older memories, though, which is why people with Alzheimer's have less difficulty recalling their childhood or early adulthood.
        ""People with Alzheimer's can remember things that happened 20, 30, and 50 years ago quite well, at least in the early stages of the disease, but have great difficulty remembering things that happened that morning or yesterday or last week,"" Dr. Budson says. ""The pattern is almost the exact opposite of what you see in depression.""
        Positive memories fade first
        Another curious distinction in depression-related memory problems is how the mood disorder doesn't target all memories in the same way. Often, the first to fade are recollections of happier times — just when that type of boost would be especially welcome. Why? Again, brain biology is the culprit: areas that process positive or rewarding experiences are disrupted in people with depression.
        Many, if not most, memories are context-dependent, Dr. Budson explains. Case in point: visit the town where you grew up or your old high school, and ""all of a sudden you'll be able to retrieve memories you didn't even know you still had,"" he says.
        But this type of context-dependent memory retrieval doesn't just involve places—it's also relevant for moods. ""When you're feeling happy, you're more likely to be able to easily retrieve memories of other times when you were feeling happy,"" he explains. ""And when you're depressed, it's easy to retrieve memories of other times when you were feeling depressed, but difficult to retrieve those from when you were feeling happy.""
        This unlucky phenomenon might make it more difficult to recover from depression, creating a vicious cycle. ""It's hard to remember those happy times — and that you can be happy again,"" Dr. Budson says. ""I don't know if that worsens depression, but it makes it hard to get out of it.""
        Proactive steps
        Dr. Budson offers these strategies to lower your risk of depression and protect your memory if you're prone to the mood disorder:
        Get your heart pumping. Regular aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, biking, or swimming, not only generates feel-happy endorphins, but also increases growth factors in the brain that help produce new cells in the hippocampus.
        Stay socially engaged. Spending time with friends and family and engaging in social activities may not only stave off depression, but also help ease it. ""Being around people you like and who like you is super-helpful,"" he says.
        Plan around your triggers. Hard experience may have taught you that certain people, places, or events can trigger your depression to recur. Avoid those situations as much as you can, and consider alternative actions during happier moments, when you have the mental bandwidth to plan ahead.
        Keep your ""happy people"" on speed dial. Many of us have a special someone — perhaps a friend, relative, or religious adviser — who can lift our spirits on the bleakest days. Reach out to that person if you find yourself in emotional quicksand. To help you remember to do that, add reminders to your phone or calendar.
        Log your favorite memories. Knowing it's normal to have difficulty summoning up pleasant memories when you're depressed, post a written list of some of your favorites on a bulletin board or refrigerator. ""When you're feeling blue, read the list,"" Dr. Budson says. ""It might just make you smile.""
        
          
            
              
                Common infection's dark side: Could it trigger Alzheimer's?
                Being infected with Helicobacter pylori—a stomach bacterium found in an estimated two-thirds of the world's population—may be linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in adults 50 and older, a new study suggests.
                Passed from one person to another, H. pylori is often harmless. But it can lead to indigestion, ulcers, and (in rare cases) stomach cancer. Alzheimer's may join that list, according to the study, which was published in the March 2024 issue of Alzheimer's and Dementia.
                Researchers analyzed medical records spanning nearly three decades from more than 4.2 million people in the United Kingdom ages 50 and up. None of the participants had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's at the study's start. People with a symptomatic H. pylori infection had 11% higher odds of developing Alzheimer's disease over an average follow-up period of 11 years, the study found.
                The findings are only observational and therefore do not prove that H. pylori causes dementia. But the possibility doesn't surprise Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. ""We've known for more than 10 years that other infections are also associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease,"" he says.
                How might infections be linked to Alzheimer's? Research increasingly suggests that beta-amyloid—a type of protein involved in Alzheimer's-related brain plaques— is normally deposited in the brain to help it fight off infection, Dr. Budson says. But some people, due to genetic or other factors, aren't able to clear this protein out of the brain after the threat has passed.
                ""We all make a bit of amyloid during the day, and when we sleep at night, it gets flushed away,"" he says. ""That's why it's important to get a good night's sleep. But over a lifetime, people sometimes generate a little too much amyloid or have trouble clearing it away. When too much of it builds up, that's what leads to Alzheimer's.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/erratic-sleeping-behavior-may-increase-diabetes-risk,Erratic sleeping behavior may increase diabetes risk,"Seven to nine hours of sleep per night is generally regarded as a healthy amount. But sometimes people sleep too little, and then try to catch up by sleeping more than usual. However, a study published online June 27, 2024, by the journal Diabetologia found that this kind of erratic sleeping may increase a person's risk for diabetes.
        Researchers collected health questionnaires from approximately 36,000 adults in their 50s. The information included the average number of hours they slept on weekdays and weekends. The researchers divided sleep patterns into three categories: short (less than seven hours), normal (seven to nine hours), and long (more than nine hours). Next, to show how consistently people slept from night to night, they created nine sleep trajectory combinations — for example, short-short, short-normal, short-long, normal-normal, and normal-short.
        Five years later, the questionnaires were repeated. The researchers found that people who regularly reported short-long or long-short sleeping patterns — meaning they bounced back and forth from sleeping less than seven hours to longer than nine — had a 50% higher risk for diabetes than people who regularly slept the normal seven to nine hours.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/cognitive-benefits-from-high-intensity-interval-training-may-last-for-years,Cognitive benefits from high-intensity interval training may last for years,"Engaging in regular exercise is linked to multiple health benefits, including maintaining cognitive abilities and perhaps reducing the risk of dementia.
        Results from a study published online July 8, 2024, by Aging and Disease suggest high-intensity interval training (HIIT) may be better for brain health than other, less vigorous routines. HIIT workouts consist of repeated cycles of short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by brief ""recovery"" periods of lower-intensity movement.
        In the study, researchers enrolled 151 healthy adults, ages 65 to 86, in a six-month exercise program. Participants underwent a battery of tests to assess function in the hippocampus — the brain area associated with learning and memory. Everyone was randomly assigned to do one of three half-hour exercise routines: balance and stretching, brisk walking on a treadmill, or four HIIT cycles on a treadmill. (Each HIIT cycle consisted of four minutes at 85% to 95% of a person's maximum heart rate, followed by three minutes of recovery.)
        Everyone did approximately 30-minute workouts three days a week for about six months, for a total of 72 sessions. On repeat testing, only the HIIT exercisers showed positive changes in hippocampus functioning compared to their initial evaluation. At a follow-up evaluation five years later, the researchers found that again only the people in the HIIT group retained their improved cognitive function, even if they were no longer doing HIIT.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/unraveling-dizziness,Unraveling dizziness,"Dizziness can be an unsettling and scary experience. An episode may last only a few seconds or linger for several minutes or even longer. It may be an isolated incident, but in some people, episodes recur, especially during certain activities.
        But what does being ""dizzy"" really mean? Many people have a difficult time articulating what they experience when they say they feel dizzy because it can encompass a range of sensations. One common experience is lightheadedness; another is a spinning feeling along with unsteadiness.
        Lightheadedness
        This is feeling faint, like you might pass out. It's often due to a fall in blood pressure. If you quickly sit or lie down, the lightheadedness should pass within a couple of minutes. Here are some common reasons for this phenomenon:
        Vasovagal response. This is the most common reason for fainting. Vaso refers to blood flow and pressure, and vagal describes the action of the vagus nerve, which signals the heart to beat more slowly. Typically, when blood pressure begins to fall, the heart beats faster to compensate.
        However, with a vasovagal response, the heart rate slows while blood pressure falls, which reduces blood flow to the brain. Anyone can experience this from an emotional or physical shock. Unless you sit or lie down right away, you could lose consciousness and fall.
        Orthostatic hypotension. This usually occurs when you stand quickly. When you stand, gravity moves more of your blood toward your feet. Your body normally compensates by alerting your blood vessels to contract and your heart to pump harder and faster to re-establish the blood supply to your head. However, with orthostatic hypotension, your blood pressure falls and stays lower than it should, and your heart rate does not speed up to compensate, creating the lightheadedness. Again, this should resolve with lying down.
        Dehydration. Dehydration develops when you don't consume enough fluids. Your blood volume drops, lowering your blood pressure. Unlike with the vasovagal response or orthostatic hypotension, your heart rate increases. However, it might not be enough to prevent you from feeling lightheaded.
        Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). People with diabetes, especially those who take insulin, are very prone to hypoglycemia. And some people without diabetes are sensitive to falling blood sugar levels even if their actual blood sugar number remains in the normal range. Too much exercise, too little food or carbohydrates, a missed or delayed meal, or a combination of these factors can cause blood sugar levels to drop.
        Medication. The vast majority of medications list dizziness or lightheadedness as a possible side effect.
        Heart problems. An abnormal heart rhythm or rate that's too slow or too fast can decrease blood flow to the brain, causing lightheadedness. If you lose consciousness or continue to feel lightheaded while lying down, call for immediate medical advice.
        Spinning sensation
        This can feel like your body or the environment around you is spinning. It can cause you to become unbalanced, often with nausea and a feeling of motion sickness. The episodes might last less than a minute or as long as a day or two, and can recur. Most often they fall into the category of vertigo. For example:
        Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV happens when tiny calcium crystals break free from a sac deep inside the ear and travel into nearby passageways, floating in the fluid there. When your head moves, the displaced crystals also move, sending signals to the brain and causing a spinning sensation.
        Labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis. These two terms refer to inflammation, usually from a viral infection, in the inner ear (labyrinthitis) or in the nerve in the ear that senses balance (neuritis). The vertigo symptoms can be very similar, but when there is also some hearing loss it usually indicates labyrinthitis.
        Seeking solutions
        When you feel dizzy, you should first lie down or at least sit with your feet up and keep your head still. If you quickly feel better and the dizziness does not return when you get up and move, that is generally reassuring. However, if the symptoms persist or recur, it's best to call for medical advice and arrange an appointment.
        Identifying the specific cause of ongoing or frequent dizziness can be challenging because most often there isn't a diagnostic test to answer the question. Instead, you and your doctor can consider factors like stress, long COVID, insufficient sleep, and many other possibilities. For persistent or recurrent vertigo, your doctor can recommend an over-the-counter medication. Examples include dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) and meclizine (also available by prescription under the brand name Antivert), which help with the feeling of motion sickness. For BPPV, your doctor may move your head and body through a sequence of positions called the Epley maneuver to reposition the tiny free-floating crystals.
        Most importantly, you should always report any other associated symptoms such as new headaches, loss of appetite, weight loss, or night sweats, which might indicate a serious condition.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-intermittent-fasting-help-with-weight-loss,Can intermittent fasting help with weight loss?,"Intermittent fasting — the use of a strict eating schedule to help with weight loss — continues to grow in popularity. But can it really help?
        ""Recent research has found that intermittent fasting has a similar or even modest benefit over traditional calorie-restriction dieting for weight loss,"" says Dr. Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""But perhaps its main advantage is its simplicity, making it easier to follow compared with other weight-loss plans.""
        Timing your eating
        Whereas other weight-loss diets emphasize what you should and should not eat, and how much, intermittent fasting focuses on when you can eat.
        Intermittent fasting means you don't eat for a designated amount of time during the course of the day. There are many ways to do this, but one of the most popular approaches is called 16/8. Here, you do all your eating during an eight-hour period (for example, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and then don't eat at all over the following 16 hours (in this case, from 6 p.m. until 10 a.m. the next day). The pattern then repeats.
        You can drink plain water, tea, or coffee during the fasting period, and you need to follow regular healthy eating habits during your eight-hour eating window.
        Short-term studies suggest that people stick to intermittent fasting diets better than low-carb diets. ""The 16/8 schedule is often easier to follow, since you sleep for about half of the fasting period,"" says Dr. Hu. ""You just don't eat after dinner — no nighttime snacking — and either skip or postpone breakfast.""
        The state of ketosis
        How might intermittent fasting help with weight loss? Not eating for such a long period can place the body in short-term ketosis, where the body burns fat for energy, according to Dr. Hu.
        Ketosis is the metabolic process that kicks in when your body runs out of glucose (its preferred energy source) and begins burning stored fat. ""Sixteen hours of not eating is sufficient for some people to start producing ketones or go into ketosis,"" says Dr. Hu.
        Intermittent fasting has been linked with various health benefits, such as reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as obesity, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Research has also suggested it may be linked to a healthier gut microbiome, with possible improved digestion and protection against infections. Some people who follow intermittent fasting claim it helps increase energy levels, too.
        Still, the existing evidence of intermediate fasting's benefits is limited, and any long-term benefits or drawbacks are unknown. ""Most studies have not looked at large populations and only explored its effect over several weeks or up to one year,"" says Dr. Hu.
        Go slow with fasting
        Should you try intermittent fasting to help with weight loss? There doesn't appear to be much downside, and the approach may help you manage your eating habits, according to Dr. Hu. ""For instance, it could help reduce your daily calories, especially if you're a late-night snacker.""
        Check with your doctor before trying intermittent fasting, especially if you have diabetes, take blood pressure medication, or tend to get dizzy if you stand up too quickly. ""Low blood sugar levels from not eating for so long could cause problems,"" says Dr. Hu.
        He suggests aiming for a 16/8 schedule, but take a gradual approach. For instance, first try a 12/12 schedule, where you eat during a 12-hour window and fast for 12 hours. ""Follow this for a few days to get used to the schedule, and then extend the time to 14/10,"" says Dr. Hu. ""When you feel ready, move to 16/8.""
        Intermittent fasting is not a quick weight-loss solution, so don't expect to immediately see or feel changes. ""It can take a while for the practice to translate to lost pounds,"" says Dr. Hu. ""Generally, people tend to lose about half a pound to one pound per week. Still, slow and steady weight loss is more successful and sustainable over the long term.""
        Dr. Hu adds that while intermittent fasting may help jump-start weight loss, a healthy eating strategy is necessary for success. ""Any benefit you may gain from fasting won't last if you aren't eating healthy foods, controlling portions, and reducing your intake of snacks and processed foods.""
        Also, be mindful that intermittent fasting takes discipline, and you must stick with it to see any long-term benefits.
        ""You can't follow it now and then and expect any significant changes,"" says Dr. Hu. ""But if you get off schedule for a day or two, you haven't negated your efforts. Just pick it up again and keep going. Eventually, you may see intermittent fasting become a part of your everyday life.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/harvard-researchers-irregular-sleep-patterns-linked-to-diabetes,Harvard researchers: Irregular sleep patterns linked to diabetes,"Getting the right amount of sleep is essential for good health. But if the duration of your nightly Z's varies significantly, you might be boosting your diabetes risk, suggests a Harvard-led study published online July 17, 2024, by Diabetes Care. Researchers asked more than 84,000 diabetes-free people (average age 62) to wear activity trackers for a week, and then followed their health for more than seven years. People whose sleep duration varied the most (fluctuating by more than an hour from night to night) had a 34% higher risk for diabetes, compared with people whose sleep duration was more consistent. The association was strongest among those who slept more than eight hours per night, on average. ""However, the association was also present among those who slept seven to eight hours per night. This suggests that even for those who get enough sleep each night, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule is still important,"" says Sina Kianersi, the lead author and a researcher at Harvard affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. The study doesn't prove that inconsistent sleep causes diabetes, but other studies have tied varying sleep duration to diabetes risk factors, including a big belly and high blood sugar, blood pressure, and triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood).

Doing body-weight exercises or using small dumbbells or resistance bands does a nice job of keeping muscles strong. But recent evidence suggests that lifting heavier loads might have longer-lasting benefits. The study, published online June 18, 2024, by BMJ Open Sport and Exercise Medicine, involved almost 400 physically active people (average age 71) who were randomly assigned to one of three groups. People in the first group spent a year doing three weekly sessions of heavy machine-based weight lifting; those in the second group did strength training three times a week with resistance bands and body-weight exercises; the others were told to simply keep up their usual activity. After the initial year, participants chose how active to be, and their muscle strength was measured periodically. Four years after the study began, the exercisers who did heavy weight lifting still had strong leg muscles, while people in the other two groups had lost leg strength. The study indicates that intensive strength training is beneficial, even in older age. If you'd like to increase the amount of weight you lift, do it gradually, and consider working with a personal trainer for guidance.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/is-it-dementia-or-depression,Is it dementia or depression?,"In older adults who experience intellectual decline, it's sometimes difficult to tell whether the cause is dementia or depression. Both disorders are common in later years, and each can lead to the other.
        Depression in the elderly can also lead to a phenomenon called pseudodementia — an apparent intellectual decline that stems from a lack of energy or effort. People with this problem are often forgetful, move slowly, and have low motivation as well as mental slowing. They may or may not appear depressed. This syndrome responds well to treatments for depression. As mood improves, a person's energy, ability to concentrate, and intellectual functioning usually return to previous levels.
        Although depression and dementia share certain traits, there are some differences that help distinguish one from the other:

          Decline in mental functioning tends to be more rapid with depression than with Alzheimer's or another type of dementia.
          Unlike people with Alzheimer's, people with depression are usually not disoriented.
          People with depression have difficulty concentrating, whereas those affected by Alzheimer's have problems with short-term memory.
          Writing, speaking, and motor skills aren't usually impaired in depression.
          Depressed people are more likely to notice and comment on their memory problems, while those with Alzheimer's may seem indifferent to such changes.
        
        Since there is no simple test that can reveal whether someone has depression or dementia, treatment is often worth trying. If depression is at the root, treatment can produce dramatic improvement.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-seniors-guide-to-dental-care,The senior's guide to dental care,"The eyes may be the gateway to your soul, but oral health is a window into overall health. ""Good dental health not only protects against gum disease, gum inflammation, and tooth loss, but also can protect against many other age-related diseases,"" says Dr. Len Brennan of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. ""A healthy mouth really can lead to a healthier body.""
        A healthy smile
        Poor oral health can have severe consequences. Research has shown that gum inflammation (gingivitis) raises the risk for lung disease, heart disease, blood vessel blockage, and strokes.
        Tooth loss from gum disease (periodontitis) may raise your risk of dementia. In the October 2021 issue of the JAMDA: The Journal of Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, researchers looked at 14 studies and found that older adults who had lost more than one tooth had an almost 50% higher risk of developing cognitive impairment and a 28% higher risk of being diagnosed with dementia.
        Poor dental health also can affect your social life. ""Insecurities about your smile can make you feel less attractive and less likely to socialize, which can increase isolation,"" says Dr. Brennan.
        
          
            
              
                Making sense of sensitive teeth and dry mouth
                Two common dental problems many older adults face are sensitive teeth and dry mouth. Tooth sensitivity often occurs when you eat or drink hot or cold food. A typical cause is gum shrinkage, which exposes more of a tooth's root. Grinding your teeth when you sleep also can cause sensitivity, so you may need to use a mouth guard at night. A dry mouth means you produce less saliva, which makes tasting, chewing, swallowing, and even talking difficult. Dry mouth also is a common side effect of many medications and is linked with such health conditions as diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer's, and autoimmune diseases. Because both sensitive teeth and dry mouth have many different causes, check with your dentist to find the source of your problem.
              
            
          
        
        Rinse, brush, floss
        Like other aspects of health care, prevention is the best medicine when it comes to your teeth and gums. ""Investing in proper dental care and upkeep is relatively inexpensive,"" says Dr. Brennan. ""Dental treatments are where it can get costly.""
        He recommends seeing your dentist every six months for check-ups, x-rays as needed, and cleanings. In between, you should follow a daily dental hygiene routine to reduce plaque buildup, gingivitis, and cavities. There are three basic steps: rinsing, brushing, and flossing.
        Rinsing. Before you brush, rinse with plain water to dislodge food particles. After brushing, you can rinse again with an over-the-counter alcohol-free mouthwash with fluoride, which can help protect against tooth decay. Some products can reduce tooth sensitivity. Ask your pharmacist for a suggestion. If you have trouble controlling plaque, gingivitis, bad breath, or dry mouth, speak with your dentist about a therapeutic mouthwash.
        Brushing. Brush at least twice a day for no less than two minutes each time. Choose a toothpaste with the American Dental Association (ADA) Seal of Acceptance, which verifies it contains decay- and plaque-fighting fluoride. Toothpastes come in gel, paste, or powder forms. While the ingredients can differ slightly, all toothpastes contain the same general components: mild abrasives, humectants, flavoring agents, thickening agents, and detergents.
        Some brands also contain other ingredients that might reduce tooth sensitivity or tartar buildup, prevent enamel erosion, or whiten teeth. Ask your dentist for a recommendation for these specific issues.
        ""Natural"" toothpastes also are popular, but again look for the ADA seal. Natural means certain ingredients are omitted, such as artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, and sweeteners. It also means that certain active ingredients that help with cleaning are derived from plant sources.
        Select a brush with soft or extra-soft bristles. Replace toothbrushes every three to four months, or more often if the strands are visibly matted or frayed.
        When brushing, tilt the brush at a 45° angle. Beginning with the upper teeth, take several up-and-down short strokes from the gum line to the bottom of the tooth. Do one tooth at a time before moving on to the next. To clean the inside surfaces of the front teeth, hold the brush vertically and make several up-and-down strokes. Repeat the process for the lower teeth.
        If you have arthritis that makes it hard to brush or hold a toothbrush, or if it's difficult to reach the back teeth, invest in grip aids that slide over your brush's handle. Another option is an electric toothbrush. You can get more strokes from the brush's vibrations than from your hand motion. Some brands come with timers that tell you when you've brushed long enough.
        Flossing. It doesn't matter if you floss before or after brushing, according to Dr. Brennan. ""But also try to floss more than once daily, if possible, preferably after a meal to reduce bacteria buildup in the mouth.""
        You can use either waxed or unwaxed floss. People with particularly tight teeth may find waxed floss easier to use, but both kinds work the same.
        Wrap the floss around your middle fingers, which helps you to reach the back teeth. Loop the floss around each tooth, so it makes a C shape. Beginning at the gum line, slide it up and down the tooth several times. Avoid just moving the floss back and forth in a sawing motion. Not only do you miss cleaning the entire tooth, but the friction can irritate the gums.
        ""If gum bleeding occurs, that doesn't mean you should stop flossing,"" says Dr. Brennan. ""Instead, just be more gentle around that area.""
        If traditional flossing is difficult, you can try over-the-counter tools, such as dental picks, floss picks, pre-threaded flossers, tiny brushes that reach between the teeth (which are especially helpful to get under crowns and bridges), and water flossers.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/whats-the-right-way-to-brush-your-teeth,What's the right way to brush your teeth?,"Getting your teeth cleaned professionally feels like a dental health reset. Your teeth get scrubbed, scraped, and polished to perfection. Whether they stay that way is up to you. What happens at home (think Vegas rules) can be very different from what happens at the dentist's office. But don't grit your teeth over it. Check out these three tips to boost your tooth-brushing game and improve your health in the process.
        1. Understand the incentives.
        Every time you eat or drink something, bits of food or residue can cling to your teeth and gums. The debris and its bacteria turn into a sticky film called plaque. If it's left on the teeth too long, it calcifies. The hardened plaque is called calculus, and it can't be removed with a toothbrush.
        ""Inside the calculus are bacteria that release acids that cause cavities, break down your enamel, and tunnel inside the tooth toward the nerve and jaw bone, causing infection if left untreated. From there, bacteria can travel to other parts of your body, including the brain, heart, and lungs,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, a prosthodontist in the Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
        Plaque-related bacteria can also irritate and infect the gums, which damages gum tissue, ligaments holding the teeth in place, and the jaw bone — resulting in tooth loss.
        Knowing all that, it may not be a surprise that poor dental health is associated with health conditions such as high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, and pneumonia.
        2. Select a good toothbrush.
        A dizzying variety of toothbrush options range from simple plastic sticks with bristles to high-tech tools with bristles that spin or vibrate. But guess what: ""It's not the toothbrush that matters, it's the technique,"" Dr. Jiang says. ""You might have a brush that does all the work for you. But if you don't have an excellent brushing technique, you'll miss plaque, even with an electric toothbrush.""
        So beware of fancy marketing promises that suggest one toothbrush is better than another. Instead, she recommends:
        
          Get a toothbrush you like and will use regularly.
          Choose bristles based on your gum health. ""If your gums are sensitive, you'll need soft bristles that don't cause irritation. If you don't have gum problems, it's fine to use hard bristles,"" Dr. Jiang says.
          Replace your toothbrush every few months. ""It's time for a new brush if the bristles are splayed out and no longer upright, or your teeth don't feel clean after you brush,"" Dr. Jiang says.
        
        What if you want an electric toothbrush because holding a brush or brushing with good technique is hard for you, or you just enjoy the gadgety-fun appeal of a high-tech brush?
        Dr. Jiang says that's okay, too — whether it's a snazzy device with a timer, pressure sensors, Bluetooth connectivity, and apps to guide you through brushing (prices range from $40 to $400) or a basic battery-operated gizmo (prices start at $5). ""Just try to test out the settings to see if you're comfortable with them, and bring the toothbrush to teeth cleanings if you have any questions about how to use it,"" she says.
        3. Use the right brushing technique.
        No matter what kind of toothbrush you use, Dr. Jiang suggests using this brushing method twice daily and flossing before or afterward each time:
        
          Brush with a fluoride toothpaste for two minutes. Divide the time among the upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right teeth — 30 seconds per section.
          Angle the brush. ""The bristles should be aimed toward the gums where they meet the teeth, a junction where plaque and calculus collect. You don't want the bristles to be perpendicular to your teeth, at a 90-degree angle, but angled, at a 45-degree angle,"" Dr. Jiang says.
          Make circles with the bristles. ""Rotate the bristles around and around in a gentle sweeping motion to help grab debris at the gum line,"" Dr. Jiang says.
          Brush without distractions so you can focus on your brushing technique.
          Be gentle. If you press too hard while brushing, you'll irritate and possibly injure your gums. Brush your tongue, too. It collects loads of bacteria that need to be brushed away.
          Rinse your mouth and your brush. Wash away all traces of toothpaste and food debris.
          Take a peek at your gums. When you finish brushing, pull your lips away from your teeth to see if you left food particles around your teeth. Your gums should not look red or swollen.
        
        Not sure you're brushing the right way? Dr. Jiang suggests practicing without toothpaste. When you rub your tongue against your teeth, everything should feel smooth.
        See a dental hygienist for cleanings every six months, and your dentist at least once a year — even if these visits make you anxious. And if you notice any problems between visits, give the dental team a call. But remember: much of the work in keeping your teeth clean comes from good home habits, not the dentist's office.",Heidi Godman,"September 27, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/stretching-to-help-arthritis-pain,Stretching to help arthritis pain,"If you're experiencing arthritis, you shouldn't let the pain keep you from staying physically active. When arthritis makes movement painful, it's only natural to try to avoid it. Yet if you keep an arthritic joint bent rather than moving through its range of motion, you allow muscles to stiffen in that position. Over time, the muscles actually shorten, curtailing range of motion and causing other problems. That can lead to a host of other problems, including weight gain, difficulty walking, and poor balance. 
        A regular stretching routine can help you avoid this vicious cycle. Doctors and physical therapists often prescribe stretching as part of a treatment plan to help maintain or reclaim abilities and ease discomfort. Stretches can also help improve range of motion in people with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease. 
        If you have arthritis, it's best to talk to your doctor before starting any exercise routine, including a stretching routine. Once you get the okay, try these tips to help you get started:
        
          Warm up thoroughly. Take extra time to warm up before you stretch. A hot shower or bath, a heated pool, or even warm compresses or a heating pad can also relax stiff joints before you stretch.
          Stretch during your least painful time of day. Morning won't work for some people, since that's when their joints are stiffest. You might do your stretches when pain relievers are at their peak effectiveness.
          Adapt stretches. Use pillows or rolled-up towels to adjust your range of motion in each stretch. Choose seated stretches, if necessary.
          Expect some discomfort. While you should stretch only to the point of mild tension, not pain, you may experience some discomfort. Try this guideline: if discomfort following stretches or other activities lasts longer than two hours, or is more severe than your usual pain, ease up on your routine. Try holding each stretch for less time. As stretching becomes easier, gradually step it up again.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/hives-urticaria-a-to-z,Hives (urticaria),"What are hives?
        Hives, also called urticaria, are circumscribed swellings on the skin that often are itchy. Often they are pink or red, but they don't have to be. Hives happen when the cells in the skin called mast cells release histamine, a chemical that causes tiny blood vessels (capillaries) to leak fluid. When this leaking fluid accumulates in the skin, it forms the swellings that we recognize as hives.
        Hives can be triggered by physical factors such as heat, cold, exercise, sunlight, stress, sustained pressure on a skin area (such as from a belt or shoulder strap), a sudden increase in body temperature (from a fever or a hot bath or shower) or from an irritating chemical, cosmetic or soap applied to the skin. Hives also can be one symptom of a whole-body (systemic) allergic reaction to something that was:
        
          inhaled — pollens, animal dander, molds
          injected — insect stings or bites, especially bee stings, or injected medication
          ingested — foods (tree nuts; fish and shellfish; dairy products; legumes, especially peanuts), food additives, medications such as penicillin or aspirin.
        
        Hives probably affect about 20% of people in the United States at some time in life, with the greatest number of episodes occurring in people aged 20 to 30. In rare cases, allergic reactions that trigger hives set off a chain reaction throughout the body, resulting in a life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis. Sometimes, hives last for six weeks or more, a condition called chronic (or idiopathic) urticaria. Often, no cause is found for this chronic condition, and it usually goes away on its own after several weeks.
        Symptoms of hives
        Hives appear as ""wheals"" (swellings) on the skin, sometimes pink or red and surrounded by a red blotch. Typically round or oval, hives often itch. Hives vary in size, and some may blend to form larger areas of swelling. Hives can affect skin on any area of the body, especially the trunk, thighs, upper arms and face. Most individual hives fade quickly, but new crops may appear every 24 to 72 hours if the person continues to be exposed to the environment or substance that triggered the hives.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        If hives are an early sign of a whole-body reaction, other symptoms to look for include swelling of the tongue, lips or face; wheezing; dizziness; chest tightness; and breathing difficulties. If these symptoms occur, get immediate medical attention. You could be developing anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition.
        Diagnosing hives
        Your doctor will ask about your history of allergic reactions, and about your recent exposure to pets, plants, insects or new foods or medications. During a physical examination, your doctor usually can distinguish between hives and other types of skin rashes. Also, he or she will check for other signs of a serious allergic reaction.
        If the condition occurs frequently, your doctor may order blood tests or perform skin testing for allergies. If your doctor suspects that you are undergoing anaphylaxis, he or she will begin treatment immediately and closely monitor your blood pressure and breathing.
        Expected duration of hives
        Individual hives usually fade within eight to 12 hours, but recurrent hives can continue to reappear for weeks or months. In cases of chronic urticaria (hives), the condition may last for six months or more.
        Preventing hives
        You can prevent hives by identifying and avoiding the particular circumstance or substance that triggered your skin reaction. If your doctor determines that you are allergic to insect venom, you may be advised to keep an epinephrine kit for emergency injections to prevent anaphylaxis. Keep the medicine in a convenient place if you work outside or play a sport. Keep an antihistamine in your medicine cabinet and take it the first signs of hives or itching. Older adults and people with heart disease should double check with their doctor before taking antihistamines.
        Treating hives
        To relieve most uncomplicated episodes of hives, your doctor may suggest a lotion such as Sarna or an antihistamine, such as cetirizine (Zyrtec, others) or loratadine (Claritin, others). There are many over-the-counter antihistamines available. Generic versions work as well as the brand name drugs. It is critical to relieve the itching because scratching can stimulate more hives and itching.
        If these medications are not effective, you may be given a prescription medication such as cyproheptadine (Periactin) hydroxyzine (Atarax or Vistaril) or desloratadine (Clarinex).
        For cases that are even more resistant to treatment, H2 receptor blockers might be added. These include nizatidine (Axid), famotidine (Pepcid) or cimetidine (Tagamet). Doxepin (Adapin, Sinequan) before bed is particularly helpful for people having a difficulty sleeping because of the itching.
        When other options fail, medications that suppress or alter the immune system may be prescribed. These include omalizumab (Xolair), montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) or corticosteroids (such as prednisone).
        When to call a professional
        Call your doctor immediately if hives appear after you have started taking a new medication or after you have been stung by an insect. Get emergency treatment if hives occur with wheezing, dizziness, chest tightness, breathing difficulties or swelling of the tongue, lips or face.
        Prognosis
        Most simple cases of hives fade quickly, and the affected skin returns to normal within hours. Even when you have episodes that recur over several weeks, without a known cause, they often stop coming back after a few months. Consult your doctor if hives persist for several days or if itching interferes with your ability to sleep or perform normal daily activities.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-the-portfolio-diet-the-best-diet-ever-202409233072,Is the portfolio diet the best diet ever?,"News flash: What we eat can play a pivotal role in warding off — or treating — disease and enhancing quality of life. You may already believe this, and certainly mounting evidence supports that idea. But on the cluttered shelf of diets claiming top health benefits, which one ranks as the absolute best?
        That's a trick question. In fact, there is no single best diet. A good diet for me may be different from what's best for you. And for either of us, there may be several good choices with no clear winner.
        How can you choose the right diet for you?
        When thinking about what diet might be best for you, ask yourself:
        
          What goals are most important? A goal might be weight loss, improved health, avoiding disease, or something else.
          How do you define ""best""? For some people, best means the diet with the highest number of health benefits. For others, it may focus on one specific health benefit, such as lowering cholesterol. Still other people may prefer a diet that delivers the greatest benefit for the lowest cost. Or a diet that is healthy and also easy to stick with.
          What health problems do you have? One diet may have an advantage over another depending on whether you have cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or none of these.
          Which foods do you like best? Your tastes, culture, and location may shape your dietary preferences, and powerfully affect how likely you are to stick with a specific diet.
        
        Which diets are high in health benefits?
        Two very well studied diets demonstrate clear benefit, including lowering risk for heart disease and stroke and reducing high blood pressure: the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet.
        But the portfolio diet may be as good as or better than these plans, at least for combatting cardiovascular disease that contributes to clogged blood vessels, heart attacks, and stroke. What? You've never heard of the portfolio diet? You're not alone.
        What is the portfolio diet?
        Just as a financial advisor may recommend having a diverse investment portfolio — not just stocks, not just bonds — the portfolio diet follows suit. This largely plant-based diet focuses on diverse foods and food groups proven to lower harmful blood lipids, including LDL (so-called bad cholesterol) and triglycerides.
        If you choose to follow this eating pattern, you simply need to learn which foods have a healthy effect on blood lipids and choose them in place of other foods. For some people, this only requires small tweaks to embrace certain foods while downplaying other choices. Or it may call for a bigger upheaval of longtime eating patterns.
        Which foods are encouraged in the portfolio diet?
        Below are the basics. Eating more of these foods regularly may help lower levels of harmful blood lipids:
        
          plant-based proteins such as soy, beans, tofu, peas, nuts, and seeds
          high-fiber foods such as oats, barley, berries, apples, and citrus fruit; other examples include bran, berries, okra, and eggplant
          phytosterols, which are a natural compound in plant-based foods such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and nuts (other sources are foods fortified with phytosterols or dietary supplements)
          plant-based oils high in monounsaturated fat such as olive oil, avocado oil, safflower oil, and peanut oil.
        
        See? Some of your favorite foods make the cut. That's a major strength of this approach: the list of recommended foods is long. So, it's likely that you're already eating and enjoying some of the recommended foods.
        Which foods are not part of the portfolio diet?
        It's worth highlighting foods that are not on this list, such as
        
          red meat
          highly processed foods
          refined grains and added sugar, which may contribute to chronic inflammation
          butter, cream, and other dairy products high in saturated fat and cholesterol.
        
        What can the portfolio diet do for you?
        Researchers have shown that the portfolio diet can improve blood lipids. But can it also lower the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular problems?
        Yes, according to a 2023 study published in Circulation. More than nearly 17,000 people kept careful food diaries for 30 years. Those who most closely followed the portfolio diet, compared with those who followed it the least, were more likely to have favorable lipids and inflammation. They were also 14% less likely to have a heart attack, and 14% less likely to have a stroke.
        This was true even after accounting for factors that could affect cardiovascular disease risk, such as taking cholesterol-lowering medications, exercise, smoking, or having diabetes or a family history of cardiovascular disease.
        Because this was an observational study, it can't conclusively prove that the portfolio diet, rather than another factor, was responsible for the observed cardiovascular benefits. And we don't know how much benefit came from reducing or eliminating certain types of foods, rather than from the specific foods eaten.
        Does the portfolio diet help people lose weight or deliver other health advantages?
        What about the portfolio diet for weight loss? Although some people lose weight on the portfolio diet, it's not billed as a weight-loss diet. Understanding its potential benefit for other conditions such as obesity, cognitive decline, diabetes, and cancer awaits further research.
        Go beyond diet to boost health
        Of course, diet is not the only way to improve cardiovascular health and your overall health. You'll stay healthier by
        
          not smoking
          getting regular exercise
          maintaining a healthy blood pressure and weight
          preventing diabetes when possible, or getting good medical care to treat it if necessary
          taking prescribed medications such as cholesterol-lowering drugs.
        
        The bottom line
        It's probably best to move past the idea of there being a single best diet. The overall pattern of your diet and your portion sizes are probably more important. For most people, it's also a good idea to move away from restrictive diets that are nearly impossible to stick with and toward healthier overall eating patterns. The portfolio diet checks both those boxes.
        There's a lot of overlap between the portfolio diet and other healthy diets. So, no one should be suggesting it's the best diet ever. But if you're trying to eat healthier, it's a great place to start.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","September 23, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/vitiligo-managing-and-living-with-this-challenging-skin-condition,Vitiligo: Managing and living with this challenging skin condition,"Vitiligo is a chronic condition that affects skin color. Because vitiligo affects physical appearance, living with the condition can be challenging and can affect emotional well-being.

What is vitiligo?

Vitiligo is a lifelong condition in which patches of skin lose color due to the destruction of melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin. Melanin is the pigment that gives skin its color. Vitiligo can appear on any body part and affects individuals of any age, ethnicity, or gender.

Quick facts about vitiligo:


	About 30% of people with vitiligo have a family history of it.
	It occurs in about 1% to 2% of the population.
	About half of people with vitiligo show symptoms before age 20.
	In one out of every five to 10 people with vitiligo, some or all the pigment eventually returns, causing the white patches to disappear.


What causes vitiligo?

Vitiligo is believed to be an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly targets and destroys its own cells. In the case of vitiligo, the immune system targets an individual's melanocytes, the cells that produce skin pigment. In addition, the melanocytes in a person with vitiligo may be less capable of managing an imbalance between antioxidants and harmful free radicals in the body. In both cases, the melanocytes are damaged and destroyed, resulting in patches of skin losing pigment or color.

Although most individuals with vitiligo are otherwise in good health, there is a link between vitiligo and thyroid disorders, such as hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.

What does vitiligo look like?

In vitiligo, patches of skin lose their pigment, resulting in areas that appear milky white or lighter than the surrounding skin. The edges of the patches can look smooth or irregular and may show redness or brownish discoloration.

Vitiligo can appear anywhere on a person's skin. The areas most often affected are:


	the fingers and wrists
	in the armpits
	groin and genitals
	around the mouth and eyes
	inside the mouth.


Vitiligo can also cause loss of pigment in hair on the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, and body hair.

Vitiligo can be particularly noticeable on darker skin due to the contrast between affected and unaffected areas. In lighter-skinned individuals, the lack of pigment often becomes more apparent in the summer, when surrounding skin tans while the vitiligo patches do not.

Types of vitiligo

There are two main types of vitiligo: non-segmental and segmental.

Non-segmental vitiligo is the most common type, affecting up to 90% of people with vitiligo. This type progresses slowly, with new patches forming periodically on both sides of the body, often symmetrically, such as on both knees or hands.

Segmental vitiligo is less common but is more frequently seen in children. This type is more localized, causing rapid pigment loss on one side or part of the body. Segmental vitiligo usually stabilizes within six to 12 months, after which no new patches develop.

In rare instances, vitiligo can spread to cover the entire body, a condition known as universal vitiligo.

Diagnosing vitiligo

To diagnose vitiligo, your doctor will review your medical history and conduct a thorough skin examination. In some cases, an ultraviolet light called a Wood's lamp is used to highlight areas of depigmentation, which appear chalky and bright under the lamp.

Your doctor may perform other tests such as:


	blood testing to check for other autoimmune diseases
	an eye exam to detect uveitis, an eye inflammation associated with vitiligo.


A skin biopsy, in which a small skin sample is examined in a laboratory, is rarely necessary. It can help confirm the diagnosis if the skin changes suggest other conditions.

Treatment options

Although there is no cure for vitiligo, there are treatments to help stop disease progression, restore skin color, and prevent new patches. For most people, the whitened skin patches last and grow larger if vitiligo is not treated.

Your doctor's recommendations for treatment will depend on your needs, overall health, and vitiligo type.

Topical medications. Topical treatments include topical steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors (such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus), and topical vitamin D analogs (such as calcipotriene). These prescription medications are applied directly to the skin.

Ruxolitinib (Opzelura) is a newer medication approved by the FDA in 2022 to restore lost skin color in people with vitiligo. This cream is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that is prescribed for individuals ages 12 and older primarily to treat small areas of vitiligo. Clinical trials have shown that ruxolitinib cream can effectively repigment the skin, with results lasting up to two years.

Light therapy. This treatment exposes the skin to ultraviolet light, encouraging repigmentation. Ultraviolet light can be provided by a hand-held lightbox for smaller areas of skin, or delivered in a closet-sized lightbox if a larger area of skin is involved. The treatment must be repeated often, usually three times a week for at least six months.

Depigmentation. This approach, which involves lightening unaffected skin to match the depigmented areas, is only used for people with severe vitiligo. This treatment is rarely used because the depigmentation is permanent and the skin without pigment is vulnerable to damage from sun exposure.

Surgery. Surgical options like skin grafts or melanocyte transplants may be explored in severe cases or those that don't respond to other treatments. Surgery is not suitable for everyone, particularly people prone to scarring.

Protecting and caring for your skin if you have vitiligo

If you have vitiligo, protecting your skin from the sun is crucial to managing the condition. Vitiligo-affected skin is more susceptible to sunburn and skin cancer.

To protect your skin, stay out of the sun, wear sun-protective clothing, and apply sunscreen daily to all exposed skin. Avoid tanning beds and sun lamps, as they can worsen vitiligo.

In addition, skin injuries such as cuts, scrapes, and burns can trigger new spots or patches of vitiligo, so you should take care to protect your skin.

Living with vitiligo

Some people embrace their natural skin with vitiligo. Others may not be comfortable with their appearance and may use makeup, self-tanner, or skin dye to cover light patches. Vitiligo can affect quality of life, leading to stress, sadness, and low self-esteem.

If vitiligo is affecting your mental health, seek psychological support and counseling. A mental health professional can provide valuable support for coping with difficult feelings and managing depression. It may also be helpful to connect with others by joining a vitiligo support group or seeking emotional support from family and friends.",Jenette Restivo,"September 23, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/halitosis-common-causes-effective-treatments-and-powerful-prevention-for-bad-breath,"Halitosis: Common causes, effective treatments, and powerful prevention for bad breath","During a conversation with a coworker, you notice them taking a step back, leaving you wondering if that raw onion in your lunch salad might have left you with bad breath.

What Is halitosis?

Halitosis is the medical term for bad breath. Halitosis can be temporary (the result of eating a dish with plenty of garlic, for example) or chronic. Chronic cases are typically caused by an underlying condition, such as gum disease.

Common causes of bad breath

Bad breath is often due to a buildup of bacteria in the mouth. This buildup can occur for a number of reasons. Some common causes of chronic bad breath include:


	Poor oral hygiene. If you don't brush and floss regularly, particles of food can remain in your mouth and produce a bad smell as they decay. Decaying food particles can also promote bacterial growth.
	Dry mouth. Saliva performs an important function by washing away food particles and bacteria in the mouth. Without enough saliva, food particles and bacteria remain. Dry mouth has many possible causes. These include certain medications, such as those that treat incontinence, depression, and allergies, as well as salivary gland problems.
	Gum disease. Gum diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis result from long-term bacteria buildup in the pockets between teeth, and can cause bad breath.
	Certain foods and beverages. Foods with strong odors, like garlic and onions, cause bad breath. Coffee and strong-smelling alcoholic beverages can also be culprits.
	Tobacco. Smoking stinks. It not only causes bad breath, but it increases your risk of cancer and other serious diseases.


Treating halitosis

Your dentist can help figure out the underlying cause of your halitosis and come up with ideas for keeping it at bay. It may simply be a matter of learning how to brush and floss properly. If the cause is gum disease or another dental problem, you may need a deep cleaning or other procedure.

Preventing bad breath: Tips for a fresh mouth

The best way to prevent bad breath is to maintain optimal oral hygiene habits. These include:


	brushing your teeth twice a day
	flossing once a day to remove any food particles left after brushing
	getting regular dental checkups every six to 12 months.


When you might need to see a doctor for bad breath

If you're brushing and flossing consistently and your dentist has ruled out other oral conditions, you may want to consult your doctor. In some cases, bad breath can be caused by medical conditions like diabetes or gastroesophageal reflex disease (GERD).",Christina Frank,"September 19, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/melanoma-a-to-z,Melanoma,"What is melanoma?
        Melanoma is cancer of the cells (melanocytes) that give skin its color. It develops when these cells change and reproduce aggressively. The number of cases of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is increasing faster than any other cancer.
        Doctors aren't completely sure why melanoma rates are soaring. It could be from spending too much time in the sun during outdoor activities. It could also be due to global changes, such as the depletion of the ozone, which absorbs many of the sun's harmful rays.
        Your pattern of sun exposure appears to affect your risk of developing melanoma more than the total amount of sun exposure in your lifetime. Short bursts of intense sun seem most dangerous, especially if you get sunburned. Being out in the sun can cause changes (mutations) in skin cells' genes.
        The most common type of melanoma spreads on the skin's surface. It is called superficial spreading melanoma. It may stay on the surface or grow down into deeper tissues. Other types of melanoma can start anywhere on or inside the body.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        Your risk of developing melanoma is higher if you have:
        
          red or blond hair
          green or blue eyes
          fair skin
          a history of being in the sun a lot, especially as a child
          a mother, father, sister or brother with melanoma. If one of these relatives has melanoma, you are eight times more likely to develop it.
        
        Features of freckles or moles that raise your risk of melanoma include:
        
          a new mole appearing after age 30
          a new mole at any age if it is in an area rarely exposed to the sun
          a change in an existing mole
          one or more atypical moles — moles that look like a fried egg, or moles that are darker than others or have irregular borders or an irregular shape
          20 or more moles larger than 2 millimeters across
          5 or more moles larger than 5 millimeters across (larger than a pencil eraser)
          freckles caused by being in the sun.
        
        Symptoms of melanoma
        Melanoma is usually visible as a single dark skin spot. It may appear anywhere on the body, but it most commonly develops on the back, chest, and legs. Most of the time, melanoma develops on normal-looking skin, but it can grow out of an existing mole.
        Watch a mole for the A, , C, D and Es of melanoma:
        
          Asymmetry (one side doesn't match the other)
          Border irregularities
          Colors or shades of skin that are different within the same mole
          Diameter larger than 6 millimeters (larger than a pencil eraser)
          Evolving (a newly developing mole).
        
        A mole that bleeds, feels numb, or has a crusty surface may also hint at melanoma.

        If your doctor thinks a mole may be melanoma, he or she will do a biopsy of the skin or refer you to a specialist for the procedure.
        Before the biopsy, your doctor will check for enlarged lymph nodes close to the mole. If you have a melanoma, enlarged lymph nodes can mean that the cancer has spread. After a skin biopsy, nearby lymph nodes can swell because the skin incision is healing.
        In a biopsy, a doctor removes a piece of tissue and examines it in a laboratory. Based on this report, your doctor can then determine the thickness of the melanoma and how deep the cancer has grown below the skin's surface. That's the most important factor in predicting whether it can be cured.
        Melanomas deeper than 1 millimeter are more likely to have spread to other parts of the body. Your doctor may suggest additional tests including:
        
          blood tests
          imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans and MRIs
          additional biopsies.
        
        If the cancer is advanced, the biopsy sample of your melanoma may be tested to see if it has one of the gene mutations common in melanoma. Some melanoma treatments have been designed to attack specific genetic subtypes of this cancer.
        Expected duration of melanoma
        Melanoma can usually be cured if it is removed when the tumor has not gone deep into the skin. More advanced melanoma requires longer treatment. If you have one melanoma, you are at risk of developing another, so have a doctor examine your skin regularly. About 1 out of 20 people who have a melanoma will develop a second melanoma within 20 years.
        Preventing melanoma
        To reduce your risk of melanoma, stay out of the sun. A bad sunburn is a major risk factor. Spending a lot of time in the sun as a child may pose the greatest risk. To be safe in the sun, take these steps:
        
          Apply plenty of sunscreen and apply it frequently. It should:
	have a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30provide broad spectrum coverage against both UVA and UVB raysbe water resistant.
          Wear protective sunglasses, clothing (long sleeves and long pants) and wide-brimmed hats.
          Stay out of the sun when it is strongest (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.).
          Ask your doctor if any medications you take could make your skin more likely to be damaged by the sun.
          Avoid tanning salons. If you want to look tan, use sunless tanning creams. They are available in department and drug stores.
        
        Melanoma is often easy to spot early, because it can be seen on your skin. If you are at risk of developing melanoma, ask your doctor to examine your skin. Also ask your doctor how often you should have your skin checked.
        Your doctor will pay special attention to any atypical looking moles. Because some melanomas can arise from existing moles, your doctor may remove atypical moles. These moles may be more likely to become cancerous. Alternatively, your doctor may take pictures of your moles. He or she can compare the photos to your moles in the future to see if they have changed.
        Examine your skin regularly, especially if you have risk factors for melanoma. Use a full-length and hand-held mirror. Have someone examine your scalp using a blow dryer to part your hair. That person can also examine your back and other areas that you can't easily see. Watch for new moles and changes in existing ones. Keep an eye on moles that you've had since birth; these moles may be more likely to turn into melanoma.
        Treating melanoma
        Major advances have been made in the treatment of melanoma.
        Surgery is the initial treatment for melanoma that appears in just one spot. The doctor removes the visible tumor along with 1 to 2.5 centimeters of healthy skin around the tumor, depending on the size of the tumor. (Nearby skin can contain microscopic bits of the cancer.)
        In some cases, the doctor may perform a specialized procedure during which the tumor is shaved away one thin layer at a time. Each layer is examined under the microscope as it is removed. This technique helps the doctor remove as little healthy skin as possible.
        If the melanoma is more than 1 millimeter deep, your doctor will want to know if the melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes. To do this, he or she may inject a radioactive liquid into the tumor. The liquid flows through the natural drainage pathway that connects the tumor to nearby lymph nodes.
        The drainage path can be tracked, and the first lymph node along the path is called the sentinel node. This node is removed and examined for cancer cells. If the sentinel node has no cancer, the other nodes are most often cancer-free.
        If cancer is found in the sentinel node, most often all the lymph nodes in the area will be removed. However, it's not been absolutely proven that removing all lymph nodes improves survival. Although spreading cancer cells might be removed, cells that are fighting the cancer also are removed.
        When cancer has spread to one or two other sites only, surgical removal similar to what was done the first time can improve survival.
        Additional therapies can often help people with thicker tumors that have grown deep into the skin and/or spread to more areas of the body. The cancer cells are tested for certain specific markers. The results guide the type of therapy that has the greatest chance of improving quality of life and survival.
        Most often patients are treated with immunotherapy and/or drugs designed to block major pathways that allow cancers to grow. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are less effective. But they can be used when other therapies don't work or stop working.
        When to call a professional
        Early treatment of melanoma is crucial. If you detect any of the ABCDE signs or see any suspicious skin changes, call your doctor right away. If you delay, melanoma can spread. If melanoma runs in your family, of if you have other risk factors, be especially alert. Have your doctor examine your skin regularly.
        Prognosis
        Five key factors help to determine how serious melanoma is:
        
          tumor thickness — How deep it goes into the skin
          location — Melanoma on the arms or legs may not be as serious as a tumor somewhere else on the body
          age — People older than 60 are in more danger
          gender — Males are more likely to die of the disease
          spreading of the tumor — Twenty percent of people with melanoma have cancer in lymph nodes when their cancer is diagnosed.
        
        The thickness of the tumor is the most important factor in determining whether it can be treated. Tumors on the skin's surface usually can be cured. Deeper cancers are more difficult, sometimes impossible, to treat. If melanoma cells break away and spread to organs such as the lungs, liver or brain, the cancer can be cured in only a small number of patients.
        If treatment begins when the tumor is less than 0.75 millimeters deep, the chance of a cure is excellent. More than 95% of people with small melanomas are cancer-free as long as 8 years later. However, for deeper melanomas, the survival rate is variable.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/rosacea-a-to-z,Rosacea,"What is rosacea?
        Rosacea (rose-ay-shah) is a common, long-lasting skin condition that causes inflammation and redness of the face. It usually starts with redness on the cheeks and nose, and also can affect the forehead and chin. The late comedian W.C. Fields, who was known for his wicked wit and red, bulbous nose, had an advanced case of rosacea.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        Rosacea tends to affect fair-skinned adults between ages 30 and 50 who have ""peaches and cream"" complexions and a history of blushing easily. Women develop rosacea more often than men, but men are more apt to develop lumpy, enlarged noses, a condition called rhinophyma. Rosacea often is mistaken for sunburn and often goes undiagnosed. It is a very treatable condition.
        Symptoms of rosacea
        There are four progressive stages of rosacea:
        
          First stage — Flushing and intermittent facial redness
          Second stage — Persistent redness on the cheeks, nose, chin or forehead
          Third stage — Small, pus-colored or red bumps, along with tiny blood vessels that appear as red, thin lines called telangiectasias
          Fourth stage — Bumps and skin thickening of the nose.
        
        Here's a detailed look at the most common symptoms of rosacea.
        
          Redness — Facial skin redness looks like a sunburn or blush. This is caused by flushing, which occurs when excess blood rapidly flows through the skin's blood vessels and the vessels enlarge to handle this flow. Gradually, this redness becomes more noticeable and does not go away. Facial skin also may become very dry.
          Pimples and Papules — Small, red and solid ""papules"" or pus-filled ""pimples"" may appear on the face, similar to those found in teen-age acne. In fact, rosacea has often been nicknamed adult acne or acne rosacea. Rosacea has different causes than acne, however, and adults with rosacea do not have the whiteheads or blackheads (called comedones) commonly seen in acne.
          Red lines (telangiectasias) — Facial blushing or flushing causes small blood vessels to expand and eventually to show through the skin. These enlarged blood vessels appear as thin red lines (telangiectasias) on the face, especially on the cheeks. At first, telangiectasias may be hidden by the redness of flushing or blushing, but they usually reappear after this redness fades.
          Nasal bumps — Left untreated, rosacea eventually can create small, knobby bumps on the nose, which make the nose appear swollen. This condition is more common among men and is called rhinophyma.
          Eye irritation — Red, dry eyes develop in about half of people with rosacea. Eye involvement is usually relatively mild. Rarely, severe involvement of the eyes develops. If untreated, it can affect vision.
        
        Diagnosing rosacea
        A doctor usually can diagnose rosacea based on the history of flushing and the appearance of your skin. In the early stages of rosacea, the rash sometimes can be mistaken for sunburn, acne, hot flashes of menopause or allergy to cosmetics.
        Expected duration of rosacea
        Symptoms of rosacea commonly come and go in cycles, often triggered by substances and situations that make the face flush. By seeking medical help early and adhering to medical treatments, you can improve your skin condition and perhaps stop, or reverse, the progress of this condition.
        Preventing rosacea
        Although a recent study found fewer cases of rosacea among people who drank caffeinated coffee, there is no proven way to prevent rosacea. The symptoms may be reduced by recognizing these common triggers: hot drinks, alcohol, spicy foods, stress, sunlight, extreme heat or cold. These conditions increase blood flow and cause the small blood vessels in the face to widen (dilate). If you have rosacea, try to identify your particular triggers and either modify them or avoid them entirely.
        To cleanse and moisturize your face, you should select facial products that do not burn, sting, irritate or cause redness when they are applied. You should wash your face with lukewarm water and a mild soap, using your fingertips to apply the soap gently. You should avoid toners, astringents, scrubs, exfoliating agents and products that contain alcohol or acetone. Hydroxy acids and tretinoin (for example, Retin A) may sensitize the skin to sun and can worsen rosacea.
        Sunscreens and sun blockers should be used regularly and liberally to protect the face. Use sunscreens with SPF factor of 30 or higher. If chemical sunscreens cause stinging, switch to physical sun blocks, which contain titanium or zinc oxide.
        Treating rosacea
        Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe the following:
        
          Brimonidine (Mirvaso) or oxymetazoline (Rhofade) – These topical medications constrict blood vessels and may work best for the facial redness of rosacea.
          Topical antimicrobials — Topical metronidazole cream or gel (MetroCream, MetroGel) and is the most frequently prescribed first-line therapy. Other options include topical ivermectin (Sklice or Soolantra) or sodium sulfacetamide (Klaron and others), especially for rosacea manifest by pimples and papules.
          Azelaic acid —It is a topical gel containing dicarboxylic acid and is used for the inflammatory pimples of mild to moderate rosacea.
          Oral antibiotics -- Tetracycline and tetracycline derivatives, such as doxycycline, are prescription drugs taken by mouth once or twice per day. They are sold under several brand names. Improvement is usually noticeable within the first two months after beginning treatment.
          Beta-blockers and alpha antagonists — These medications may reduce flushing through their effect on blood vessels. Propranolol (Inderal) and nadolol (Corgard) are beta-blockers, and clonidine (Catapres) is an alpha antagonist. The use of these drugs for rosacea is off-label, meaning that the FDA has not approved their use for rosacea. Beta-blockers usually are used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease. Clonidine was developed to treat high blood pressure, but also is used to decrease hot flashes in menopause.
          Estrogen — When prescribed for other menopausal symptoms, this female hormone may help when rosacea is aggravated by the hot flashes of menopause. The smallest dose of estrogen that controls menopausal symptoms should be used, then the hormone should be stopped when hot flashes no longer occur.
          Laser treatment — This is used to get rid of dilated blood vessels or to remove excess nose tissue.
          Surgical procedures — Surgical shave techniques or dermabrasion can also be helpful in removing excess nose tissue in rhinophyma.
        
        When to call a professional
        Contact your doctor if you notice a persistent facial blush, or if your complexion shows persistent pimples and red, dry, scaly blotches. Also call your doctor if you suspect that constant redness on your cheeks is not caused by sunburn or by your tendency to blush easily. Remember, it's easy to misdiagnose rosacea as acne, and using nonprescription acne medications may worsen your rosacea by irritating skin that is already dry and sensitive.
        Prognosis
        The progression of rosacea varies from person to person, depending on factors such as genetics, skin sensitivity, skin complexion, length of time spent in sunlight without sunscreen, consumption of alcohol and spicy foods, and exposure to extreme hot and cold temperatures. With appropriate treatment and avoidance of triggers, rosacea generally can be well controlled.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/tinea-versicolor-a-to-z,Tinea versicolor,"What is tinea versicolor?
        Many microorganisms normally live on our skin, including a group of yeast species called Malassezia. The yeast lives in our pores. Under certain conditions, it can shift its form from a round or oval yeast shape to a string-like, branching shape. These branching forms are named hyphae. The yeast can migrate under the skin and produce azelaic acid, a substance that can change the amount of pigment (color) in new skin cells. In its hyphae form, the yeast causes a rash called tinea versicolor, also called pityriasis versicolor.
        Tinea versicolor is common year-round in the tropics and subtropics and is seen in the summer months in more temperate climates. Sun exposure, use of oils on the skin, naturally oily skin and sweating are all suspected to be triggers that can cause the round or oval yeast to convert to its hyphae form, resulting in the rash. This rash can spread between people who have skin contact.
        Tinea versicolor occurs more often in teenagers and young adults and appears on the back, neck, upper chest, shoulders, armpits and upper arms. Most people who get this rash are in good health. However, tinea versicolor is more likely to occur if you have a suppressed immune system, for instance, if you are taking a corticosteroid medication such as prednisone for another health problem. It is also more common in women who are taking birth control pills and in pregnant women.
        Symptoms of tinea versicolor
        The skin rash is made up of scattered pink, tan, brown or white patches on the skin. Each person will usually have only one of the colors. These patches are usually flat, without texture, but may flake. They may be small round spots or areas that start smaller then get larger and combine with other areas. The rash may be itchy, especially when a person is hot or sweaty.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        The skin spots may be more obvious after skin has been exposed to the sun, because these areas do not tan evenly.
        Diagnosing tinea versicolor
        Your doctor can examine skin scrapings under the microscope to see if the yeast is present. Your doctor may also shine a black light (ultraviolet light) on the rash to help confirm the diagnosis. Yeast types in the Malassezia group may glow yellow-green under the light.
        Expected duration of tinea versicolor
        Your doctor can examine skin scrapings under the microscope to see if the yeast is present. Your doctor may also shine a black light (ultraviolet light) on the rash to help confirm the diagnosis. Yeast types in the Malassezia group may glow yellow-green under the light.
        Preventing tinea versicolor
        Because the rash occurs more readily in hot, humid conditions, keep your skin as dry and cool as possible when you are in this climate. Tinea versicolor can be spread through skin-to-skin contact or by coming in contact with contaminated articles such as towels, clothing or bedding.
        The tinea versicolor rash continues to return in 40 percent to 60 percent of people. If you have had more than one episode of tinea versicolor, skin treatment every two weeks with a shampoo that destroys yeast (such as anti-dandruff shampoos that contain selenium sulfide) can help to prevent the rash from recurring. This may be especially helpful prior to travel to a tropical climate or during months with warm weather. Another option is to take antifungal medicines by mouth to prevent the rash from returning.
        Treating tinea versicolor
        Topical treatment should be tried first in most cases. Therapies include lotions or anti-dandruff shampoos containing selenium sulfide (Selsun), zinc pyrithione, ketoconazole shampoo (Nizoral), terbinafine spray (Lamisil) and antifungal creams. Topical treatments are used one or two times each day. Treatment can last days or weeks, depending on how the rash responds.
        Short courses of oral medications, such as itraconazole [Sporanox] or fluconazole [Diflucan]), are also effective. The oral medications are usually reserved for people with a widespread rash and those who have failed topical therapy.
        For six months after your original treatment, you may be advised to apply topical treatments occasionally or take one or more doses per month of oral antifungal medicine to help prevent the rash from returning.
        When to call a professional
        If you have a skin rash that you think may be tinea versicolor, you should make an appointment with your doctor to have the rash evaluated.
        Prognosis
        There are no serious complications from tinea versicolor. In most people, the rash goes away with treatment. However, it takes several months for the skin to return to its normal appearance. The rash can return after treatment in some people who don't use antifungal treatments from time to time to suppress the rash.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/insomnia-a-to-z,Insomnia,"What is insomnia?
        Insomnia is difficulty getting enough sleep or trouble sleeping without interruption. You may have difficulty falling asleep, may wake up too early, or may wake up periodically during the night. Insomnia of any kind can keep you from feeling rested and refreshed during the day.
        Almost all of us have episodes of insomnia at some time, but insomnia is not a short-term problem for everyone. Insomnia is classified as chronic when it happens almost every night for at least one month. Insomnia can be related to a medical or psychiatric illness, can be caused by mental stress or excitement, or can be caused by your daytime and bedtime habits.
        Your habits and surroundings are the usual causes of short-term insomnia problems. Factors that contribute to insomnia can include:
        
          stress or anxiety
          a change in sleeping environment (being a guest at a hotel or a relative's home)
          an uncomfortable sleeping environment (too hot, too cold, too bright, too noisy)
          an uncomfortable mattress
          pajamas that are too tight
          having a bed partner who snores or has disruptive sleep patterns
          watching television, reading a book or problem-solving in your bed, so your brain associates lying down in bed without activities other than sleeping
          eating a heavy meal before bedtime
          taking a prescription medication that has insomnia as a side effect
          drinking alcoholic beverages before bedtime
          having a high intake of beverages containing caffeine (coffee, tea, cola) during the day
          cigarette smoking
          exercising immediately before bedtime
          not exercising enough during the day, so you have energy to spare
          taking a hot bath or shower before bed
          traveling to a different time zone
          traveling to a much higher altitude
          shift work.
        
        Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to insomnia. Women who are pregnant may have insomnia because of hormone changes, heartburn, leg cramps or a need to urinate more frequently. In addition, the unborn baby's increasing size often makes it harder for the mother to find a comfortable sleeping position.
        Chronic insomnia may be caused by a medical or psychiatric problem. Some common causes of chronic insomnia include:
        
          psychiatric illness, especially depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
          chronic medical illnesses, especially kidney disease, heart failure or asthma
          painful illnesses, especially arthritis, neuropathy, acid reflux or cancer
          hormone imbalance, especially menopause or hyperthyroidism
          taking a prescription medicine that has insomnia as a side effect
          restless legs syndrome: this disorder causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs. Symptoms can include twitching of the legs, a habit of repetitive leg movements, and leg cramps.
          obstructive sleep apnea.
        
        Sleep apnea is a common condition. However, often the people that have this problem don't realize it. Snorers or people who are overweight may have repeated episodes in which breathing stops for 10 seconds to 30 seconds during sleep, just when the person is relaxing into deep sleep.
        Sleep apnea is caused most often by relaxing the tongue and throat tissues, which can settle into a position that closes your airway. Your body reacts to sleep apnea by releasing adrenaline-like ""alarm"" hormones so you will awaken and resume breathing. These hormones keep you awake for periods of the night.
        Symptoms of insomnia
        Symptoms of insomnia can include:
        
          difficulty falling asleep
          waking up periodically during the night
          waking up in the early morning, but not feeling rested
          feeling tired and irritable during the day
          having trouble concentrating.
        
        Diagnosing insomnia
        Your doctor often can determine the cause of your insomnia by asking about your habits and sleep environment, by reviewing your symptoms, and by examining you. Your doctor may suggest that you keep a sleep diary (a log of your sleep patterns) to provide an exact record of how many hours you sleep, whether symptoms may be your trigger for awakenings, and at what times you wake up.
        If your doctor suspects that a medical illness is causing your insomnia, you may need additional tests. In some patients, an overnight sleep study at a sleep clinic may be necessary. During a sleep study, your brain waves, breathing pattern and oxygen levels can be monitored, and your body movements can be observed.
        Expected duration of insomnia
        Insomnia may last only one or two nights, or it may continue for weeks, months or years. How long insomnia lasts depends on its cause, and on the success of lifestyle changes and treatment.
        Preventing insomnia
        It helps to have habits that promote healthy sleep:
        
          Follow a regular sleep schedule. Have a routine bedtime and wake up at roughly the same hour each morning.
          Sleep in loose, comfortable clothes in a comfortable bed.
          Eliminate any sources of noise or bright lights that prevent or disrupt sleep. If noise from outside your bedroom can't be eliminated, it might help if you drown out that noise by creating a monotonous noise of your own. Use a fan, a channel with static noise on your radio, or a recording of ocean waves to make a noise that can lull you to sleep.
          Maintain a comfortable temperature in your bedroom.
          Cut down on beverages containing caffeine during the day, since the stimulating effects of caffeine can last for many hours.
          Avoid heavy meals before bedtime.
          Eliminate alcohol, since many people experience wakefulness as the effect of the alcohol wears off.
          Exercise daily, preferably early in the day.
          If you read before bed, do this in a chair or in another room.
          Consider sleeping in a separate bed or separate room if your partner keeps you awake.
        
        If you have chronic insomnia because of chronic pain, medical illness or psychiatric problems, seek prompt treatment for your health problem. Don't assume that insomnia is an unavoidable part of your illness.
        Treating insomnia
        Changes in your bedtime surroundings and habits that can promote sleep are usually the most important way to manage insomnia.
        Behavioral therapies also may be used to treat some patients with insomnia. These therapies include:
        
          Relaxation therapy — Special techniques to quiet the mind and relax the muscles
          Sleep restriction — A program that at first permits only a few hours of sleep per night, then gradually increases the nightly sleeping time
          Reconditioning — A program that teaches the patient to associate the bed only with sleeping (and sexual activity) by having the patient go to bed only when sleepy and avoid daytime naps
        
        If insomnia is one of the symptoms of a medical disorder, treating the underlying problem may be all that you need. For example, treating restless legs syndrome with specific medication or sleep apnea with a special mask can markedly improve quality of sleep.
        Your doctor may prescribe sleeping pills for short term or occasional use. Today there are a wide variety of medications to choose from. Some act quickly and are most helpful if you have trouble falling asleep. Others have a longer duration of action when the problem is staying asleep. Many of the medications are available as generics, which tend to be much less expensive. Older people should avoid the longer acting drugs because the sedation can last much longer than eight or nine hours.
        Melatonin, a dietary supplement, works for some people and not others. It has a good safety profile when used in the doses directed on the label.
        When to call a professional
        Call your doctor if you are worried about sleeping problems, especially if insufficient sleep or disturbed sleep is interfering with your ability to function normally during the day. Insomnia is an urgent medical problem if sleep problems are making it unsafe for you to drive a car or to perform potentially dangerous tasks at work.
        Prognosis
        In many people with insomnia, normal sleep patterns return within a few days, especially if a lifestyle issue (stress, a habit of heavy meals before bed, a change in time zones) disappears or is modified.
        In people with chronic insomnia, the outlook depends on the underlying problem. In people with obstructive sleep apnea, most experience relief when they use a nighttime nose mask that provides modest continuous air pressure through the mouth and nose. This mask must be prescribed by a doctor.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-to-help-your-child-get-the-sleep-they-need-202008312264,How to help your child get the sleep they need,"It's tempting at this time of year to let summer sleep schedules stay in place or let bedtimes slide, especially when parents feel tired out, too. But it's important that children have a regular routine — and that they are sleeping during the dark hours and awake during the light ones, as our bodies do best that way.
        That's true for families who are home-schooling, as well: even when the trip to school is just a walk to the kitchen table, allowing for more sleep than those catching an early bus may get, no child should be spending all morning in bed.
        Sleep is crucial for all of us, and this is particularly true for children. Without enough quality sleep, children are more likely to have health and behavioral problems — and difficulty learning. Here are a few simple things you can do to help your child get the sleep they need.
        Have a regular schedule
        Our bodies do best when we go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time every day.
        
          Children and teens need eight to 10 hours of sleep. Count back 10 hours from when your child needs to get up in the morning. That's roughly the time they need to be getting ready for bed (for younger children, count back 11 hours).
          For example, if your teen needs to be up at 7, then they should be getting ready for bed by 9, and in bed by 10 (since most of us don't fall asleep the moment our head hits the pillow). A younger child should start getting ready (bathing, etc.) by around 8.
          Understand that teens are biologically wired to fall asleep later and wake up later and will naturally have later bedtimes. Unfortunately, most school districts don't accommodate to this, so you are often working against biology.
          While it's okay to stay up a bit later on weekends, don't let the bedtime vary by more than an hour or so.
        
        Turn off the screens before bed
        The blue light emitted by screens can keep us awake.
        
          It's best if the screens can be off two hours before you want your child asleep. Use that time when they start getting ready for bed as the time that the screens go off.
          The only real way to achieve this is to get all devices out of the bedroom.
          Teens will fight you on this. If you can, hold firm (and buy them an alarm clock if they say they need their phone for this). At the very least, be sure that the phone is on Do Not Disturb mode overnight.
        
        Have an environment that encourages sleep
        
          Quiet things down. If you are watching TV, turn the volume down, and in general try to not make much noise after children go to bed.
          Consider a white noise machine or a fan (or air conditioner if you live somewhere warm). There are also white noise apps for those teens who won't give up their phones.
          Room-darkening curtains can make a difference for children who tend to wake up at the first light of dawn — or who can't fall asleep if it's not fully dark outside.
        
        Know how other factors influence sleep
        
          Busy teens often have difficulty getting everything done in time to get enough sleep. Talk with your teen about their daily schedule and look for ways to help them get more shut-eye, such as getting homework done during the school day, or limiting video games or other activities that eat into homework time. Sleep needs to be the priority.
          Limit caffeine. It's best not to have any, but certainly nothing from mid-afternoon on.
          Limit naps! For a tired older child naps may seem like a good idea, but they can interfere with nighttime sleep. Naptime is okay through preschool.
          Make sure your child gets exercise. It's not only important for their health, it helps their sleep.
          Have calming routines before bed (not exercise!).
        
        If your child is having trouble falling asleep, or is waking up at night, talk to your doctor. It's also important to talk to your doctor if your child is snoring or having other breathing problems at night. Don't ever ignore a sleep problem; always ask for help.","Claire McCarthy, MD","September 12, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-your-child-need-to-bathe-every-day-202109202598,Does your child need to bathe every day?,"The daily bath or shower is a routine for many of us — and for our children, too. But is it really necessary?
        The short answer is no.
        Obviously, there are days when washing up makes good sense — like if your child is grimy from a day in the dirt; covered in sweat, paint, or other visible dirt; or had an explosive poop. It's also a good idea to wash up if your child has spent the day in a pool (the chlorine may be irritating to the skin), a body of water (there could be things in the water that are irritating or unhealthy), or used bug spray to ward off ticks and mosquitoes. And certainly, it's best for everyone in the vicinity when a stinky teenager takes a soapy shower.
        Sometimes a doctor may recommend daily bathing for certain skin conditions. And we all need to wash our hands regularly to prevent infection. But full-body washing just for the sake of washing? Not so much.
        Why not bathe a child daily?
        Lots of bathing can lead to dry, irritated skin. But also, the skin has natural protective oils, and natural bacteria, that help to keep us healthy and safe — and that can get washed away with daily bathing.
        If your baby or preteen looks pretty clean, isn't stinky, isn't covered in bug spray, and hasn't been in a pool or other body of water, it's fine to skip the bath or shower. Really, bathing two or three times a week is fine. In fact, for many kids, even just once or twice a week is fine. You can always do a quick wipe with a wet washcloth to the face, groin area, and any dirty spots.
        Stinky teenagers might need more bathing or showering, depending on activity level and deodorant use. But even they may be able to get away with washing their face and using a soapy washcloth on their groin and underarms.
        Tips for healthy bathing
        When you do bathe children, here are some tips for healthy bathing.
        
          Don't use hot water — use warm water instead.
          Keep it short — preferably just enough time to get the washing done.
          Avoid antibacterial soaps and bubble baths. Use mild, unscented soap and shampoo.
          Make sure bathing is supervised for all babies and young children.
          Pat dry rather than rubbing dry. If your child tends to have dry skin, using a mild, unscented greasy moisturizer after the bath can be helpful.
        
        If your child has eczema or any other skin condition, check with your doctor to get tailored advice for bathing your child.","Claire McCarthy, MD","September 11, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/boosting-your-childs-immune-system-202110122614,Boosting your child's immune system,"Parents often wonder: What can we do to keep our children healthy? Are there ways to boost the immune system and ward off illnesses?
        The answer is yes — but there are no magic wands or magic supplements. The best way to keep the immune system healthy is, basically, to take necessary steps to keep healthy. As boring as that sounds, it's tried and true.
        Here's what you can do to help keep your children healthy this school year.
        Give them a healthy diet
        By healthy I mean a diet with lots of fruits and vegetables (five servings a day are recommended, and they should take up half of every meal plate), whole grains, and lean protein. A healthy diet also has dairy or another source of calcium, and healthy fats like vegetable oils.
        The foods to avoid are processed foods, foods with added sugar, and foods with unhealthy fats, like the saturated fats found in animal products. That doesn't mean your child can't ever eat cookies or ice cream. But if you want to your child to be healthy, they shouldn't eat those foods every day. (The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has suggestions for healthier baked goods and other ways to make your family's diet healthier).
        There are many supplements that claim to boost your immune system. While the jury is still out as to whether most of them make a real difference, none of them take the place of a healthy diet. If you have a child who refuses vegetables or otherwise has a limited diet, a multivitamin with iron may make sense; talk to your doctor about whether vitamins or supplements are a good idea for your child.
        Make sure they get enough sleep
        We all need sleep to refresh and recharge our bodies, and that includes children. The amount of sleep a child needs varies by age (from 12 to 16 hours a day for infants to eight to 10 hours for teens), and also from child to child (some just need more than others). You can encourage healthy sleep by limiting screens — for teens, devices really should be shut off an hour or two before bedtime, and preferably not be in the bedroom at night — and keeping to a regular schedule.
        Get them active
        Exercise keeps us healthy and less likely to get sick. Children should really be active for an hour a day. ""Active"" doesn't have to mean playing a sport or going to the gym; it could be playing at the playground or going for a walk. More is not necessarily better; if you have a child who is a serious athlete, exercising several hours a day, make sure that the exercise isn't eating into sleep or causing burnout, both of which could cause problems with the immune system.
        Manage stress
        Stress makes us less healthy and more prone to infection. Make sure that kids have downtime to play, and access to activities and people that make them happy. Spend time together as a family, and create opportunities for your children to talk about anything that might be worrying them. If you have concerns about your child's moods or emotional health, talk to your doctor.
        Make sure they are up to date on important vaccines
        Immunizations protect us from all sorts of illnesses. Check with your doctor to see if your child is up to date on immunizations. The flu shot is recommended yearly for all people 6 months of age or older.
        Don't forget the simple precautions
        Everyone in the family can take simple precautions to help stay healthy. Wash your hands. Cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow. Stay away from sick people to the extent that you can. Masks can help, too, especially in crowded indoor spaces.
        If your child has a health problem that could make it harder to fight off an infection, talk to your doctor about any extra or different precautions you should take.","Claire McCarthy, MD","September 11, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/gratitude-enhances-health-brings-happiness-and-may-even-lengthen-lives-202409113071,"Gratitude enhances health, brings happiness — and may even lengthen lives","Several evenings a week, as Tyler VanderWeele gathers around the dinner table with his wife and two young kids, the family deliberately pauses during the meal to do something simple but profound. Each member shares several things for which they're grateful — an act that VanderWeele, co-director of the Initiative on Health, Spirituality, and Religion at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, feels changes his family dynamic for the better.
        ""I do think it makes a difference and can be a very powerful practice,"" he says. ""Even on those bad days where life seems difficult, that effort is worthwhile.""
        Gratitude, health, and longevity
        How can the power of gratitude affect our lives? Recent research has pointed to gratitude's myriad positive health effects, including greater emotional and social well-being, better sleep quality, lower depression risks, and favorable markers of cardiovascular health. Now, new data from the long-term Nurses' Health Study shows that it may extend lives.
        ""Gratitude has been one of the most widely studied activities contributing to well-being, but we couldn't find a single prior study that looked at its effects on mortality and longevity, much to our surprise,"" says VanderWeele, co-author of the new research.
        What did the study look at?
        Published July 2024 in JAMA Psychiatry, the new study drew on data from 49,275 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. Their average age was 79. In 2016, participants completed a six-item gratitude questionnaire in which they ranked their agreement with statements such as, ""I have so much in life to be thankful for,"" and ""If I had to list everything I felt grateful for, it would be a very long list.""
        Four years later, researchers combed through participants' medical records to determine who had died. There were 4,608 deaths from all causes, as well as from specific causes such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory diseases, neurodegenerative disease, infection, and injury. Deaths from cardiovascular disease — a top killer of women and men in the United States — were the most common cause.
        What did the researchers find?
        Participants with gratitude scores in the highest third at the study's start had a 9% lower risk of dying over the following four years than participants who scored in the bottom third. This did not change after controlling for physical health, economic circumstances, and other aspects of mental health and well-being. Gratitude seemed to help protect participants from every cause of death studied — including cardiovascular disease.
        But what does this actually mean?
        ""A 9% reduction in mortality risk is meaningful, but not huge,"" VanderWeele says. ""But what's remarkable about gratitude is that just about anyone can practice it. Anyone can recognize what's around them and express thanks to others for what's good in their life.""
        While the study couldn't pinpoint why gratitude is associated with longer life, VanderWeele believes several factors may contribute.
        ""We know that gratitude makes people feel happier. That in itself has a small effect on mortality risk,"" he says. ""Practicing gratitude may also make someone a bit more motivated to take care of their health. Maybe they're more likely to show up for medical appointments or exercise. It may also help with relationships and social support, which we know contribute to health.""
        What are the study's limitations and strengths?
        The study was observational. This means it can't prove that gratitude helps people live longer — only that an association exists. And the particular sample of people analyzed is both the biggest strength and limitation of the research, VanderWeele says. All were older female nurses with high socioeconomic status. The vast majority were white.
        ""Does the longevity effect extend to men, to those who are younger, and to those with lower socioeconomic resources?"" VanderWeele asks. ""Those are all open questions.""
        On the plus side, he says, the study sample's large size is one of its biggest strengths. So is the extensive data gathered on potential confounding factors such as participants' physical health, social characteristics, and other aspects of psychological well-being.
        ""Between the quality of the data and the size of the sample, we were able to provide reasonable evidence for this modest longevity effect,"" he says.
        Try this: Six questions to evoke gratitude
        Not feeling especially grateful today? You have the power to change that. Asking yourself certain questions can evoke gratitude, such as
        
          What happened today that was good?
          What am I taking for granted that I can be thankful for?
          Which people in my life am I grateful for?
          What is the last book I read or movie, show, or social media clip I saw that I really appreciated, and why?
          What am I most looking forward to this week, month, and year, and why?
          What is the kindest thing someone has said or done lately?
        
        Similarly, a few simple actions can infuse gratitude into your days. Try VanderWeele's family routine of regularly expressing gratitude around the dinner table. Another well-known practice — that's perhaps becoming forgotten in this digital age — is penning thank-you notes.
        ""I do think writing a thank-you note or gratitude letter gets your mind to dwell on something positive for a longer period, to think more deeply about it, because you have to put it not just in words, but in writing,"" VanderWeele says. ""It also deepens the relationship and builds that bond.""
        One less-recognized but valuable gratitude practice is called a ""savoring exercise,"" which builds on aspects of mindfulness. All that's required is ""pausing, looking around you, and taking in and enjoying everything that's good in your current setting,"" VanderWeele says. ""It's not a big leap to go from recognizing the good to expressing gratitude for what you have.""",Maureen Salamon,"September 11, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/rem-sleep-what-is-it-why-is-it-important-and-how-can-you-get-more-of-it,"REM sleep: What is it, why is it important, and how can you get more of it?","You may not think much about your dreams, other than occasionally wondering what they mean. But dreams are an important part of a sleep stage known as REM sleep. All sleep is important, but REM sleep plays a key role for brain health and function.

What is REM sleep?

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is part of your body's normal sleep cycle. Each of your body's sleep cycles lasts about 80 to 100 minutes. Most of us experience four to six sleep cycles per night. Your first REM episode usually lasts for just a few minutes. They lengthen during each subsequent sleep cycle. Toward the end of the night, you may spend up to half an hour in REM sleep.

REM sleep is when most of your dreams occur. During REM sleep, your heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, and breathing increase. Your eyes move rapidly, even though they are closed. The muscles in your arms and legs also become temporarily unable to move. This prevents you from acting out your dreams as you experience them.

How much REM sleep do you need?

Just like your overall slumber patterns, your REM sleep needs shift as you age. Newborns spend about half their snooze time in REM sleep. This starts to decrease by about 6 months, and continues to decline throughout childhood and the teen years. By age 20, most people spend just over 20% of their total shut-eye time in REM sleep. In older adults, time spent in REM sleep decreases slightly, to about 17% by age 80.

Benefits of REM sleep

Benefits of REM sleep include:


	Improved learning. During REM sleep, your brain prunes its synapses, the spaces in which brain cells communicate with one another. This appears to improve memory and problem-solving abilities.
	Mood regulation. REM sleep helps your brain process emotional memories, including ones associated with fear.
	Brain development. REM sleep is thought to aid in the development of the central nervous system, which includes your brain and spinal cord. That may be one reason why infants, particularly newborns, require so much REM sleep.
	Protection against dementia. People who get less REM sleep may have a greater risk of developing dementia, according to a study published in the journal Neurology. The researchers found that for every 1% reduction in REM sleep, there was a 9% increase in the risk of dementia.


REM sleep is so important that if you don't get enough one night, your body will naturally increase it the next — you'll enter this stage earlier and stay in it for longer. This is known as REM rebound.

How to get a good night's sleep

Sleep is elusive for many of us — over 14% of American adults experience trouble falling asleep most days of the week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most REM sleep occurs at the end of the night, so getting enough total sleep helps to maximize REM sleep.

Here are some tips to help you fall asleep and stay asleep:

Stick to a sleep schedule. Set a regular bedtime and wake-up time and stick to it, even on weekends and when you're on vacation. This will help to regulate your sleep/wake cycle and make it easier for you to drift off at night. If you can't fall asleep within 20 to 30 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room, and do something relaxing like reading or knitting until you feel sleepy again. Don't stay in bed and watch the clock, which can make insomnia worse. If you have trouble sleeping one night, try not to sleep later or nap the next day. Doing so will disrupt your routine. You may be more tired that day, but you will sleep better that night.

Limit alcohol and caffeine. A nightcap may help you nod off, but it suppresses your REM sleep. Caffeine also interferes with a good night's rest because it blocks brain chemicals that promote sleep. A study published in the Journal of Biological Rhythms found that three 150-milligram servings of caffeine a day — the equivalent of about 4-1/2 cups of coffee — affected REM sleep in young healthy men.

Stay active. Exercise itself has been shown to slightly decrease REM sleep. But a 2024 study published in the journal Scientific Reports found that regular physical activity increases the amount of deep, restorative sleep that you get, which in turn boosts mood and energy. Try to exercise outside in the morning, since natural light helps to set your body's sleep/wake cycle.

Relax before bed. Try the following calming rituals an hour or two before bedtime:


	Listen to soft music.
	Take a warm bath or shower.
	Stretch.
	Read. Avoid doing it on your phone or tablet, however, as those devices emit blue light that can interfere with sleep.",Hallie Levine,"September 9, 2024",1

        So what can you do?
        Sleep-alone campaign step one: Understanding
        Before you do anything, be sure you understand why your child wants to sleep with you. It's most likely simply because they love you and feel most secure snuggled next to you, but before you work to change the habit, be sure that your child is ready for — and can handle — the change. If your child has been more clingy or irritable than usual, or is having difficult behaviors in any way, touch base with your doctor.
        Sleep-alone campaign step two: Changing habits
        Changing where your child sleeps is changing a habit. When it comes to changing habits, it helps to be practical and — this is really important — consistent. Here are some tips:

          Make an appealing sleep space for your child. Not that anything can really take the place of you, but it is certainly easier to get them to stay in their own room or space if they like it there. Work with them to set up and decorate in a way they like.
          As you create the space, keep in mind what keeps your child awake. If it's light, use room-darkening curtains. If it's darkness, think night lights and flashlights. If it's noise, think about getting a white-noise machine. Set your child up for success. Please: no TVs or devices in the bedroom. They get in the way of healthy sleep.
          Have a consistent bedtime. Try not to let your child stay up late — or sleep late — on weekends. This way your child is more likely to be tired when you want them to be tired.
          Have a consistent, calming, and nurturing bedtime routine. Try to lower the energy level, perhaps with a bath and then some snuggling and reading stories. You want to help them wind down, and also be sure they end the day feeling loved.
          If your child has a hard time going to bed alone, it's okay to sit in the room and ease yourself out bit by bit after lights are out (you can literally move closer and closer to the door). Try to gradually shorten the time you are in the room.
          If your child gets out of bed, bring them back to their bed. This is the hard part: your child won't like it, and it can be exhausting for you if they keep creeping out of their bed and into yours. But if you give in and let them stay in your room, they will stay in your room. Every night.
          Use incentives. Make sure your child gets major kudos for any progress at all — and maybe earns something extra for staying in their own bed all night. Try to steer away from things, if possible, and think more about quality time (an extra story, a fun outing).
        
        If nothing is working, or your child is really upset, talk to your doctor. There may be more going on, and the two of you can work together to figure things out and help your child. Both of you deserve a restful night's sleep.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/a-guide-to-combatting-sarcopenia-and-preserving-muscle-mass-as-you-get-older,A guide to combatting sarcopenia and preserving muscle mass as you get older,"Sarcopenia is the progressive loss of muscle mass and function that occurs as a natural part of aging. It affects about 5% to 13% of people ages 60 to 70, and up to 50% of people who are 80 or older.
        Strong muscles help you carry groceries, climb stairs, swing a golf club, and get out of a chair. They harvest oxygen and nutrients from the blood more efficiently than weak muscles, and burn more calories without even trying, which helps with weight control.
        So it may not come as a surprise that loss of muscle mass has many downsides. Sarcopenia is closely linked with a greater incidence of falls and makes you more likely to break a bone. It can also put you at risk for post-operative complications, longer hospital stays, and is linked with metabolic disorders, cognitive impairment, and mortality. All these factors can cause loss of independence and may make it harder for you to age in place safely.
        Sarcopenia: A look at age-related muscle loss
        Both men and women naturally start losing muscle mass as they get older. For most people, it's a gradual decline of about 3% to 5% each decade, starting at age 30.
        Getting older is a major (and unavoidable) cause of muscle loss, but other factors that can affect muscle mass include inactivity, obesity, insulin resistance, malnutrition, and inadequate protein intake. Conditions including cancer, liver disease, kidney dysfunction, and metabolic disorders are also linked with loss of muscle mass.
        Here's how it works for the average person: As you age, the number and size of your muscle fibers shrinks, causing your muscles to thin, or atrophy. At the same time, your body starts producing fewer of the proteins your muscles need to grow, causing your muscle cells to get smaller. This one-two punch makes it harder to build and maintain muscle mass. Hormonal changes also affect your muscle fibers. All of these natural changes lead to reduced muscle mass.
        Sarcopenia affects men and women equally. Symptoms of sarcopenia include difficulty performing everyday activities like climbing stairs or walking briskly; loss of stamina; poor balance and falls; and a decrease in muscle size.
        While you may not be able to completely prevent age-related sarcopenia, you can take steps to slow its progression.
        Strength training: Building muscle through exercise
        You can build stronger muscles by strength training, which uses resistance (like body weight, free weights, elastic bands, or specialized machines) to build muscle, or by power training, which focuses on both strength and speed. Ideally, you'd do a combination of both, as they help build and maintain muscle and can also bolster your bones by stimulating them to get stronger.
        On the flip side, people who don't do strength training as they age can expect to lose four to six pounds of muscle per decade — and that muscle is often replaced by fat.
        You're never too old to benefit from the gains made through strength and power training. But if you've never done it before or if you're dealing with a chronic condition, talk to your doctor before starting. You also might consider working with a certified personal trainer, physical therapist, or physiatrist to help you learn proper form and avoid injury.

Hold the weights so your palms are facing forward. Slowly press the weights straight up until your arms are fully extended. Pause. Slowly lower the dumbbells to shoulder level. Do eight to 12 repetitions. Rest and repeat the set.
        Power move: Lift the weights quickly. Hold briefly. Lower your arms at a normal pace. Do six to 10 repetitions.
        Building muscle through proper nutrition
        It's easier to build muscle when you're eating enough of the right foods. Most people know that you need quality sources of protein in your diet to help build lean muscle mass, but you also need carbohydrates for fuel and energy, and healthy fats such as olive oil, avocados, nuts, and fatty fish to help supply energy to muscles.
        The role of protein in maintaining muscle
        Getting enough protein is essential for regulating your immune system, hormone production, growth, and, yes, building lean muscle mass. Your body uses protein to help build and repair the small tears created by strength training.
        The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 grams per pound). The USDA's online tool can help you calculate your exact needs, but if you're trying to build muscle, you may want to aim for a slightly higher number. Research suggests that increasing your daily protein intake to 1 to 1.2 grams per kilogram (kg) of body weight per day can help repair muscle fibers broken down through regular strength and power training.
        Lean chicken, eggs, milk, Greek yogurt, and whey- or plant-based protein powders can all help you meet your protein needs, as can these high-protein snacks.
        Why it's important to preserve muscle as you get older
        Preserving muscle mass as you age is crucial to helping you stay strong, balanced, and independent.
        But gaining and maintaining muscle has some unexpected benefits too, such as improving your heart health, helping to control your blood sugar, improving cholesterol levels, and helping to keep weight within a healthy range. It can also improve longevity, with one study finding that middle-aged adults who did just one to three strength workouts a week were 40% to 70% less likely to have a heart attack or stroke. And, because weight and power training helps strengthen the muscles around your joints, it can expand range of motion in joints, and help prevent or ease lower back pain. Finally, a strength or power training session can even boost your mood, which is in itself a pretty good reason to hit the weights with regularity.",Lindsay Warner,"September 6, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/xylitol-what-to-know-about-this-popular-sugar-substitute,Xylitol: What to know about this popular sugar substitute,"The next time you pop a stick of sugar-free chewing gum in your mouth, take a look at the list of ingredients: Chances are you'll see an ingredient called xylitol. This sugar alcohol that tastes as sweet sugar but has fewer calories and negligible effects on blood sugar levels and insulin.
        For this reason, xylitol is used in many sugar-free gums, candies, baked goods, and diabetes-friendly foods. You'll also find xylitol in toothpaste, mouthwash, and other types of oral-care products.
        What is xylitol?
        A naturally occurring sugar alcohol found (in trace amounts) in many fruits and vegetables, xylitol can be processed from certain trees or from a plant fiber called xylan. It tastes about as sweet as regular sugar, but with only about half the calories per serving. Store-bought xylitol is a white, crystalline powder that can be used as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in recipes.
        What are the health benefits of xylitol?
        Eating too much sugar has been linked to a host of serious health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and tooth decay, so sugar-free sweeteners like xylitol are a compelling alternative.
        Xylitol is lower in calories and carbohydrates than sugar
        Xylitol is an excellent alternative to sugar for people who need to watch their weight, their blood sugar levels, or both. The sugar alcohol contains about 2.4 calories per gram (compared with 4 calories per gram in regular sugar). That makes it a good option for those who want to limit their simple carbohydrate intake, like people with diabetes or related metabolic syndromes.
        Xylitol doesn't cause blood sugar spikes
        When measured on the glycemic index (GI), a measure of how quickly food raises blood sugar, xylitol's GI score is 7, while regular sugar has a GI score of about 60. Xylitol's lower GI score correlates to more sustained energy without the spike and plunge associated with a sudden intake of regular sugar.
        Xylitol is good for your dental health
        Xylitol may help prevent tooth decay by reducing levels of bad bacteria in your mouth. According to a review published in the Journal of International Society of Preventive & Community Dentistry, consuming 5 to 10 grams per day of xylitol-containing products (like lozenges, candies, chewing gum, toothpaste, or mouth rinse) significantly prevented cavities and tooth decay compared with products that do not contain xylitol. So don't be surprised if your dentist recommends a xylitol-containing chewing gum at your next checkup.
        Xylitol in everyday products
        Many sugar-free products contain xylitol, including sugar-free candy, gum, baked goods, mints, cough syrup, chewable vitamins, some nut butters, ice cream, and oral hygiene products like toothpaste and mouthwash. You can also buy xylitol in bulk at most grocery stores or online retailers to use in cooking and baking.
        Possible side effects
        Most people can add xylitol to their diets without noticing any side effects. But some people may experience digestive problems like gas, bloating, and diarrhea if they consume too much too quickly. If you notice uncomfortable digestive problems, cut back your xylitol intake and reintroduce it slowly. And if you have other digestive issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), you may want to avoid sugar alcohols entirely.
        Additionally, an observational study published in the June issue of European Heart Journal found that high levels of xylitol were associated with greater risk of heart attack or stroke in adults years later. While more research is needed (the study was small, and observational versus experimental), it's best to keep your consumption of xylitol in check.
        Keep xylitol away from your dog
        Xylitol is highly toxic to dogs, causing dangerously low blood sugar, liver failure, and even death. Keep sugar-free products out of your dog's reach, and always check the ingredient label on ice cream and peanut butter before offering it to your pup.",Lindsay Warner,"September 4, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/mpox-is-back-what-to-know-and-do-202409033067,Mpox is back: What to know and do,"Ever heard of mpox? Wondering why it's back in the news?
        Many of us first learned about mpox (formerly called monkeypox) in 2022, when the largest known outbreak spread to nearly 100,000 people in more than 100 countries. While mpox often circulates in central and western Africa, the 2022 outbreak quickly spread from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to places it had never been detected before. In the US alone, it caused more than 32,000 infections and 58 deaths.
        Now, a new outbreak of mpox has put it back in the news. What should you know — and do — about this latest international health emergency? What are your risks? Are vaccines available? If you get mpox, how can you avoid spreading it?
        What's different about the 2024 mpox outbreak?
        This time, a new strain of the virus (called Clade 1b) is spreading quickly. That's why the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a second mpox global health emergency in August 2024.
        Already, more than 15,600 cases and 500 deaths have been reported, mostly in the DRC. And mpox has been found in countries that previously hadn't identified any cases, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Recent cases diagnosed in Sweden and Thailand have public health officials bracing for additional international spread, including to Asia, Europe, and the US.
        6 things to know about mpox
        What is mpox and how does it spread?
        Mpox is a viral infection caused by the same family of viruses as smallpox. In central and western Africa it's common in certain animals, including squirrels and rats. People can become infected after contact with infected animals. Mpox can spread from person to person through close physical contact, including sex.
        What are the symptoms of mpox?
        Mpox causes flulike symptoms, fever, headache, enlarged lymph nodes, and a unique rash. The rash usually begins a few days into the illness as small flat spots. The spots evolve over a week or two to become small fluid-filled bumps (vesicles) similar to chickenpox, and then larger pus-filled blisters. Over another week or two, the blisters scab over and heal. Once that happens, a person is no longer contagious.
        Although the disease is usually mild, some people develop complications. Serious complications include pneumonia, vision loss due to eye infection, and sepsis, a life-threatening infection.
        What is your risk of getting mpox?
        Location and activities factor into your risk for developing mpox.
        Risk increases if you
        
          have close physical contact with an infected animal or person
          have contact with bedding, clothes, or other objects or surfaces touched by an infected person
          live in or visit a place where the mpox virus is endemic — that means present in the environment, such as in the soil or infected animals or people
          are a man who has sex with men
          have many sexual partners.
        
        When people get mpox, risk factors for experiencing more severe disease or complications like pneumonia include:
        
          pregnancy
          young age (especially children younger than age 1)
          having a weakened immune system
          having eczema (because this weakens the protective skin barrier).
        
        Why is the new mpox outbreak so worrisome?
        The new outbreak of mpox is especially worrisome because the strain of the virus is deadlier than in 2022. The virus is spreading more quickly and reaching places where mpox had not previously been found.
        In addition, the new outbreak has disproportionately affected kids and teens in resource-poor countries. Many are already suffering with malnutrition, or other infections such as cholera.
        It's worth noting that the strain of mpox from the 2022 outbreak (Clade 1) is still circulating at a low level in the US. Right now, fewer than 15 people a week are diagnosed with it and treatment is available.
        Are there mpox vaccines and treatments?
        There are two vaccines available to prevent mpox in the US:
        
          Jynneos is approved to prevent mpox and smallpox. It requires two doses four weeks apart.
          A vaccine called ACAM2000 is approved for preventing smallpox and is considered effective for mpox. It could be made available if needed, but its potential side effects make it a second choice.
        
        Resource-poor countries in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere have had limited access to vaccines. Even in resource-rich countries like Europe and the US, vaccine hesitancy has been an obstacle to containing the outbreak. In one study, only half of a vulnerable population in Illinois received the initial dose of the mpox vaccine, and only a quarter received both recommended doses.
        An antiviral drug called tecovirimat is approved to treat smallpox. Animal studies suggest it may be effective in treating mpox as well. Now being investigated as an mpox treatment, the drug may be available by enrolling in a study. A 2024 study found tecovirimat did not reduce the length of time adults and children with Clade 1 mpox had symptoms. However, the death rate (1.7%) was half of what was expected. But it's unclear whether the low death rate was actually due to drug treatment.
        How can someone with mpox avoid spreading it?
        If you are diagnosed with mpox, it's important to take these measures to avoid infecting others:
        
          Avoid close contact with others until your skin lesions have healed.
          Wear a well-fitting medical mask while near others; those visiting you should wear a mask as well.
          Stay several feet or more away from others.
          Use a separate bedroom and bathroom.
          Clean all surfaces you've touched.
          Don't share eating utensils, towels, or bedding with others.
          Increase room ventilation by opening windows or using a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifier.
        
        Some experts recommend avoiding contact with pets or other animals because they could become infected and spread the disease to new animal species in new places.
        The bottom line
        Will mpox be the next pandemic? That's unlikely. The virus that causes mpox spreads mainly by direct contact — unlike the virus that causes COVID-19, which spreads through small respiratory droplets that are easily breathed in. Also, people with mpox who are contagious typically have obvious symptoms, so they can take steps to avoid spread.
        Currently, the risk mpox poses to most people in the US appears to be quite low. To help make sure it stays that way and to help countries where mpox is common, US public health officials are working with their counterparts in other countries to contain the outbreak. To be successful, we'll need a robust. well-coordinated international effort, including financial support to resource-poor countries to fund educational programs, vaccination, testing, and treatment.","Robert H.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/high-lipoproteina-raises-heart-attack-risk-even-in-healthy-people,High lipoprotein(a) raises heart attack risk even in healthy people,"High blood levels of lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a) — a variant of LDL cholesterol — may triple the risk of a heart attack, even among people with no other risks for heart disease, a new study confirms.
        The study included 6,238 people ages 43 to 65 who had their Lp(a) levels measured. Values in the top 10% — 216 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) or greater — were defined as high, while values in the lower 50% — less than 42 nmol/L — were defined as low. Most had conditions or habits that raised their heart disease risk, known as standard modifiable risk factors (SMuRFs). These include diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, and unfavorable cholesterol levels. While about 4% of the study participants had all four SMuRFs, nearly 24% had none.
        Over a median follow-up period of nearly nine years, high Lp(a) levels were linked to nearly triple the risk of heart attack, regardless of the presence or number of SMuRFs a person had. Having a high Lp(a) was equivalent to having two SMuRFs. The findings support more widespread Lp(a) testing, according to the authors, whose study was published May 21, 2024, in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-does-everything-taste-salty-to-me,Why does everything taste salty to me?,"Q.
          Everything I eat lately tastes like it's been doused in salt, even if I know it hasn't. Why might this happen?
        
        A. This phenomenon certainly puts a damper on enjoying your food. But you should know there are many possible reasons food can taste oversalted.
        Do you have seasonal allergies? Sometimes postnasal drip leads to a salty sensation, as can an allergy to a particular food. Also on the list of potential culprits are gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diabetes, certain autoimmune conditions, and vitamin B12 deficiency. Even a chronically dry mouth — which can be a side effect of various medications — can make food taste especially salty.
        Even if you have one of these conditions, don't just accept living with a salty mouth. It's wise to mention the issue to your primary care doctor. She'll work with you to help improve your symptoms, which may be as easy as changing your medications. Otherwise, she may recommend some simple blood tests to investigate the cause.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/doomscrolling-dangers,Doomscrolling dangers,"What was the first thing you did when you woke up this morning? If you reached for your phone and scrolled through the news — scanning headline after headline blaring bad tidings — you're doing something called doomscrolling. And you're definitely not alone.
        It's an understandable urge: with wars raging across the world, frequent mass shootings, multiple climate disasters, and a polarized populace poised to vote in another presidential election, our newsfeeds are ablaze with distressing information. Many of us scan it hungrily, constantly; we hit refresh, and the stream starts anew.
        The phenomenon of doomscrolling — one of the Oxford English Dictionary's words of the year in 2020 — rose to prominence during the pandemic when our upended lives prodded us to relentlessly track the latest COVID casualties. But more than four years later, we're still living through tremendous social, political, and economic unrest, and doomscrolling has emerged as an insidious threat to our minds and bodies, Harvard experts say.
        With the media's propensity to blast mostly bad news (as the saying goes, ""if it bleeds, it leads""), ""we're not getting any messages about hope — it's all negativity,"" says Dr. Richard Mollica, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
        ""It has been one onslaught after the other,"" agrees Dr. Aditi Nerurkar, a lecturer in the Division of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""Our brains and bodies are expertly designed to handle short bursts of stress. But over the past several years, the stress just doesn't seem to end. Doomscrolling is our response to that.""
        Women particularly vulnerable
        Who's susceptible? Every last one of us. ""If you have a device, it's open season for doomscrolling,"" Dr. Nerurkar says.
        The behavior is rooted in our brain's limbic system — often referred to as the lizard or reptilian brain — that's dominated by a structure called the amygdala. It promotes self-preservation and drives the fight-or-flight response to danger, fueling us to troll for threats.
        ""Stress stokes our primary urge to scroll,"" she says. ""We're hypervigilant and scanning for danger. The more you scroll, the more you feel you need to.""
        But two key groups are especially vulnerable: women and people with a history of trauma, Dr. Mollica says. Women are hit harder by doomscrolling because ""most of violent media is about hurting women and children,"" he says.
        Meanwhile, people who've lived through violence doomscroll out of fear, says Dr. Mollica, who is also director of the Harvard Program in Refugee Trauma at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""They don't feel safe in the world and want to get a handle on what's going on so they can calm their anxiety. But in these same people, doomscrolling acts as a trigger.""
        Physical and mental ripple effects
        Perhaps unsurprisingly, stomach-churning news has a tendency to turn our stomachs. But nausea is far from the only physical effect of doomscrolling. Others can include headaches, muscle tension, neck and shoulder pain, low appetite, difficulty sleeping, and even elevated blood pressure, according to Harvard experts.
        ""When people doomscroll for hours, they're sedentary for a long time too,"" Dr. Nerurkar notes. ""The ripple effects are vast and problematic.""
        In the wake of the pandemic, doomscrolling's mental health effects have been examined more extensively. An April 2023 research review published in Applied Research in Quality of Life analyzed three separate studies involving a total of about 1,200 adults, suggesting doomscrolling is linked to worse mental well-being and life satisfaction.
        An August 2024 study of 800 adults published in Computers in Human Behavior Reports reinforces those findings, suggesting doomscrolling evokes greater levels of existential anxiety — a feeling of dread or panic that arises when we confront the limitations of our existence. Yet another study in Computers in Human Behavior in April 2024 provided additional perspective, suggesting that employees who doomscroll while at work may become less engaged with their professional tasks.
        On a practical level, Dr. Nerurkar says, doomscrolling can give us ""popcorn brain,"" which happens when we spend too much time online. ""It's the real, biological phenomenon of feeling your brain is popping because you're being overstimulated online,"" she explains. ""Then it's hard to engage with the real world, which moves at a much slower pace.""
        How to cut back
        While keeping abreast of current events is essential, doomscrolling provides no extra benefits. ""We need to stay informed, but not at the expense of our mental health,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. ""And cutting back is not about abstinence; it's about decreasing reliance.""
        How to accomplish this? Strategies mainly revolve around creating ""digital boundaries that can give your brain and body a chance to recalibrate to normal,"" she says.
        Dr. Nerurkar and Dr. Mollica suggest these approaches:
        Keep your phone off your nightstand. That doesn't mean it can't be in the bedroom, but keeping your phone out of easy reach means you can't compulsively grab it upon waking. ""It could be the biggest game changer for your stress from doomscrolling,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. ""You're acclimating yourself instead to wake up to the light, look at your bed partner, and go to the bathroom and brush your teeth, creating a buffer to your stress response.""
        Follow suit in your work space. Similarly, place your phone in a desk drawer or 10 or more feet away from where you're planted during working hours.
        Don't bring your phone to the dinner table. At mealtime, leave your phone more than an arm's length away, and set it to silent mode.
        Switch your phone to grayscale. This type of visual boundary makes scrolling less enticing by dialing back the saturation levels of colors on your screen. ""There's some early data that this decreases screen time,"" Dr. Nerurkar says.
        Opt out of notifications. These types of beeps and dings — which alert us to new headlines, emails, messages, and the like — are self-selected. Opting out is as simple as reviewing your phone's settings. ""This is about re-establishing some boundaries,"" Dr. Nerurkar says. ""Are you using your device, or is your device using you?""
        Focus on community news. Local headlines tend to be less doom-and-gloom and more uplifting. ""Stick to the environment you live in,"" Dr. Mollica says.
        Just say no. Tell people who are sharing depressing or violent stories that you're not interested. ""This puts you in control,"" Dr. Mollica says. ""You're not giving your power to someone else.""
        Focus on the good. Volunteer at a charity or another altruistic organization such as an animal shelter. Or take part in emotionally freeing activities, like a dance class or nature walks. ""You need to share positive emotional experiences with others,"" Dr. Mollica says.
        Talk to your doctor. If you find you can't stop doomscrolling or that it makes you extremely upset, it's time to discuss it with a professional. ""A small percentage of people really need professional help, and the best place to start is by talking to your primary care doctor about it,"" Dr. Mollica says. ""Certain problems are very hard to overcome on your own.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/a-healthy-lifestyle-late-in-life-still-offers-benefits,A healthy lifestyle late in life still offers benefits,"Even late in life, following healthy habits can help people live longer, suggests a study published online June 20, 2024, by JAMA Network Open. Researchers examined the lifestyles of 5,222 people aged 80 and older. They then looked at who in the group reached age 100 (centenarians) and who did not. The team ranked each person's lifestyle on a scale from zero to 6, with higher scores suggesting healthier behaviors. The scores were calculated based on habits such as diet diversity, regular exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, and body mass index (BMI). The participants who scored between 5 and 6 lived the longest, on average, and were most likely to become centenarians. Those who scored between zero and 2 lived the shortest time.
        According to the researchers, three of the lifestyle habits had the most impact on longevity: diet, exercise, and not smoking. Centenarians consumed the greatest amounts of fruits, vegetables, fish, beans, and tea. They also engaged in regular exercise, such as running and practicing qi gong, and never smoked. (Alcohol consumption and BMI didn't affect whether someone lived to 100.)
        It's important to note that the results only showed an association and did not account for people's lifestyles when they were younger. However, they do suggest that continuing healthy habits even at an advanced age might offer life-prolonging benefits.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cooling-off-heartburn,Cooling off heartburn,"At some point, everyone experiences heartburn — that deep, painful burning sensation in the chest that can be so intense it's mistaken for a heart attack. Heartburn (also known as acid reflux) occurs when stomach acid flows backward into the esophagus, the tube connecting the mouth and stomach. It often happens when you eat too quickly or too much, or after you eat rich, spicy, or acidic foods.
        Heartburn usually goes away on its own, but sometimes you need an over-the-counter remedy to get relief. For more severe and ongoing heartburn, you might need stronger medication. Which should you use, and when? Here's a breakdown.
        Occasional heartburn
        For now-and-then heartburn, use antacids. They quickly neutralize digestive acids in the stomach and esophagus. ""They work well for people with mild, occasional heartburn and provide immediate relief,"" says Dr. Andrew T. Chan, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Liquid antacids provide faster relief, but many people find tablets more convenient. There are three categories of over-the-counter antacids: magnesium-based (Maalox, Mylanta), aluminum-based (Amphojel), and calcium-based (Tums, Rolaids). ""There aren't data to support whether one works better than the others,"" says Dr. Chan.
        Other products, like Gaviscon, contain both aluminum and magnesium. The combination of ingredients creates a foam layer when ingested, which floats to the top of the stomach to help block acid reflux. Another option is a seltzer (Alka-Seltzer), which has sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) as the active ingredient. ""These are the least powerful antacids,"" says Dr. Chan. They contain high levels of sodium, so do not take them if you are on a salt-restricted diet or have heart failure, high blood pressure, or kidney problems.
        Recurring heartburn
        If heartburn strikes many times a week, symptoms become more severe, or antacids don't work, you can try an over-the-counter H2 blocker. These work by blocking histamine, a chemical that signals the stomach to produce acid. ComBrands include famotidine (Pepcid) and cimetidine (Tagamet).
        H2 blockers are taken twice a day for one to two weeks. People whose heartburn is troublesome only at night often need only a single dose taken in the evening or at bedtime. ""H2 blockers are fine to take in the short term, but check with your doctor if you need to continue taking one after a few weeks,"" says Dr. Chan. ""They can prescribe a stronger H2 blocker if needed."" Also consult your doctor before taking an H2 blocker if you take a blood thinner, antidepressant, or blood pressure medication.
        
          
            
              
                Making changes
                If you take medication to manage recurring or persistent heartburn, you also should focus on adopting healthy lifestyle habits. They help reduce your dependence on drugs, and may even make it possible for you to stop taking them. For example:
                Weight loss and exercise. Losing excess weight and engaging in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise daily can prevent flare-ups and reduce symptoms.
                Avoid trigger foods. Keep a daily food diary in which you list the foods and beverages that coincide with heartburn symptoms. Choose one and remove it from your diet for two weeks. Then add it back and note whether symptoms return. Repeat the process as needed until you find your trigger foods and drinks.
                Eat smaller meals. A large meal can remain in the stomach for several hours, increasing the risk of acid reflux. Eat frequent smaller meals a day instead of three large ones.
              
            
          
        
        Persistent heartburn
        If symptoms become intense or linger longer than two to three weeks despite taking an H2 blocker, you should consult your doctor. ""Persistent heartburn is caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD,"" says Dr. Chan. If you are diagnosed with GERD, your doctor will probably recommend a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), the strongest stomach acid inhibitor medication.
        PPIs — such as omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and esomeprazole (Nexium) — inhibit certain cells from ""pumping"" acid into the stomach, which lowers acid levels and reduces heartburn pain. PPIs are available over the counter or by prescription and are usually taken once daily.
        ""While both nonprescription and prescription PPIs work basically the same, your doctor will advise you on which one you need,"" says Dr. Chan. Long-term treatment with a PPI is often necessary, as heartburn usually returns when treatment ends. However, once your heartburn is under control, you may continue with a lower-dose PPI or switch to an H2 blocker.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tattoos-may-raise-lymphoma-risks,Tattoos may raise lymphoma risks,"Having a tattoo may increase your risk of developing lymphoma, a type of white blood cell cancer, a new analysis suggests.
        The study, published in the June 2024 issue of eClinical Medicine, analyzed the nearly 12,000 cases of lymphoma among Swedish adults ages 20 to 60 that were diagnosed between 2007 and 2017. Using questionnaires, researchers determined which participants had one or more tattoos. After adjusting for other risk factors, the researchers found that tattooed participants had a 21% higher risk of lymphoma than their non-tattooed peers. But size didn't seem to matter: no evidence was found that lymphoma risk increased among individuals with larger areas of tattooed skin.
        The popularity of tattoos has exploded in recent years. Nearly one-third of Americans have a tattoo, and 22% have more than one, according to the Pew Research Center. Tattoo ink often contains carcinogens, which may trigger an immune response when injected under the skin, study authors said. However, the study was observational, meaning it couldn't prove tattoos cause lymphoma — only that an association exists.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/music-as-medicine,Music as medicine,"Just a few gentle strums of ukelele music can immediately transport us to a place of calm. This mysterious effect is one reason board-certified music therapist Lorrie Kubicek helps many patients take up the easy-to-play instrument after they're diagnosed with cancer or another major health condition — transforming a fraught situation into a constructive one.
        ""Instead of saying 'I have to go to the hospital for my chemo,' patients start saying, 'I have to go to the hospital for my ukelele lesson,'"" says Kubicek, co-director of the Katherine A. Gallagher Integrated Therapies Program at Harvard-affiliated Mass General Cancer Center.
        But music therapy is far more than a pleasant diversion, exemplifying how the art and science of medicine can work in tandem. With ancient roots — the Chinese character for medicine includes the character for music — the approach also helped rehabilitate World War II veterans' minds, bodies, and spirits.
        Characterized by personally tailored music interventions such as singing, songwriting, playing an instrument, listening to music, or moving to the beat, music therapy strikes a chord in many areas of medicine. Evidence increasingly suggests it helps people better manage disease symptoms and treatment side effects by curbing stress, soothing pain, promoting sleep, and boosting focus.
        ""Music connects you to a part of yourself that's well, and that's true no matter what patient population we're working with,"" Kubicek says. ""Music remains, no matter the challenges a person is facing.""
        Personalized approach
        Music therapy isn't the same thing as music medicine, in which patients simply wear headphones and listen to their favorite music for relaxation or distraction while undergoing medical treatment. It also doesn't require any musical background or experience to participate or benefit.
        The therapy begins with a one-on-one assessment with a music therapist to explore how each person relates to music and what problems they may face. ""We combine this information with evidence-based interventions to help patients feel, deal, or heal as quickly as possible,"" Kubicek says. ""We figure out how music can help you move toward your goals in a way that sets you up for success.""
        Building on decades of research, recent studies indicate this type of intervention can provide important relief by reducing anxiety during medical treatment, according to a 2021 research review published in Psychiatry Research.
        ""We see this all the time,"" she says. ""Because of music's connection to the limbic system in the brain, it can help you access the relaxation response and calm your nervous system, slowing down your breathing. It really helps shift your mind from what it's stuck on or worried about and helps you land in the moment you're in.""
        People with Alzheimer's disease were the focus of a research review published online in March 2023 by Alzheimer's Research and Therapy, which suggested that music therapy improved memory, attention, and orientation in these patients. And for people with psychiatric illnesses such as depression, Kubicek says, music therapy can ""bring energy and joy back at a very dark time in people's lives. It's also really beautiful to see how music can connect people of different ages and stages, cognitive abilities, and cultures.""
        Stretching the benefits
        Regardless of diagnosis, music therapy can hit the right notes as long as you feel a connection to music. ""You don't need to be a musician. You just need to love music and have something you want to develop or nurture,"" she says.
        You also don't need to wait for your doctor to offer music therapy. Ask her — or your local hospital or clinic — to refer you to a program. ""If you do have a specific diagnosis, you can always ask your health care team,"" Kubicek says. You can also find a music therapist near you through the American Music Therapy Association.
        To maximize the therapy's benefits, find a balance between taking risks and staying in your comfort zone, Kubicek advises. ""When we're exploring music, often we're trying something new for the first time,"" she says. ""Find that 'stretch zone,' because you don't know the full effect of what music can do for you until you try.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/fit-balance-exercises-into-a-busy-day,Fit balance exercises into a busy day,"Adding balance exercises to a hectic schedule might seem like one chore too many. How are you supposed to squeeze in another 30-minute regimen when you're already exercising daily, working, and running errands? The answer is by doing a little balance training at a time. ""Just a minute of balance exercise here or there has a cumulative effect. As your balance improves, it gets easier to carry out daily functions,"" says Kristina Dunlea, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        We need good balance to safely perform upright activities, such as walking, getting up and down from a chair or bed, climbing stairs, or reaching up for a dish in a cupboard. Unfortunately, balance declines over time, increasing the risk of falls — a leading cause of injury and disability past age 65.
        Finding the time
        Since you need only a minute for a balance exercise, Dunlea recommends integrating it into a free moment that's already built into your day.
        ""For many people, it's when they're standing and waiting for coffee to brew or brushing their teeth. Or it might be during TV time: think of commercials as your cue to get up and do a balance exercise,"" she suggests.
        Those opportunities also come with equipment to keep you safe if you become unstable during a balance exercise, such as a counter or desk to hold on to or a chair to fall back on.
        Balance exercise ideas
        A counter or sturdy chair works well for several effective balance exercises.
        For example, a sturdy chair is a good spot for a sit-to-stand exercise — going from a sitting to a standing position, arms crossed, then returning to a sitting position and repeating the process. Dunlea recommends doing this exercise five to 10 times in a row. ""It strengthens your leg and abdominal muscles and trains you to shift the main weight of your body up over your feet — your base of support,"" she explains.
        A counter works well for doing one minute of heel raises, tandem standing or walking, or standing on one leg (see ""3 balance exercises to try at home""). ""Standing on one leg is especially helpful for tasks requiring you to shift your weight and balance on one leg for a moment, such as climbing stairs or stepping up onto a curb,"" Dunlea says.
        But don't continue a balance exercise if it's so challenging that you're at risk of falling. And if you currently have balance problems, it's best to work with a physical therapist before trying these moves on your own. For more information, check out the Harvard Special Health Report Better Balance.
        3 balance exercises to try at home
        
          Tandem standing
        
        
          
        
        Stand with your arms at your sides. Place your left foot directly in front of your right foot, heel to toe, and squeeze your inner thighs together. Lift your arms out to your sides to help you balance. Hold the position up to 30 seconds. Return to the starting position, then repeat with your right foot in front.
        
          Heel raises
        
        
          
        
        Stand with your arms at your sides. Lift your heels, shifting your weight to the balls of your feet. Try to balance evenly without allowing your ankles to roll inward or outward. Hold. Lower your heels to the floor, maintaining good posture as you do. Repeat 10 times.
        
          Single leg stance
        
        
          
        
        Stand with your arms at your sides. Bend your right knee, lifting that foot several inches off the floor, and balance on your left leg. Hold the position up to 30 seconds. Return to the starting position, then repeat the process while balancing on your right leg.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/drinks-on-a-plane-consider-saying-no,Drinks on a plane: Consider saying no,"Some people enjoy having a bit of bubbly when jetting off to a new locale, perhaps as a way to toast the start of an adventure. But drinking champagne or any other alcoholic beverage on an airplane might pose risks ranging from falls to heart attacks. This is particularly true if you intend to sleep on the flight, such as on a long-haul overnight flight. So it might be time to rethink your drink order.
        Your body on a plane
        Before you even take a sip of alcohol, your body experiences physiological effects of being high above sea level: there's less atmospheric pressure to force oxygen into red blood cells for delivery throughout your body, and blood oxygen drops from normal levels of 96%–100% to about 90%, or even below 90%.
        Your body has a way to compensate for that. You breathe faster to take in more oxygen. Your heart rate increases to move blood through your system faster. However, reduced blood oxygen levels and increased heart rates can be dangerous for people with a heart condition.
        Complicating factors
        Small dips in blood oxygen can become more pronounced on a plane when you add other factors into the mix, and drinking alcohol is one of them. ""Some studies suggest that alcohol impairs the ability of red blood cells to take up oxygen by altering hemoglobin, the molecule that actually carries the oxygen,"" says Dr. Matthew Mosquera, medical director of the Alcohol, Drugs, and Addiction Inpatient Program at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        The following factors can also lead to lower blood oxygen:
        Aging: Our ability to adapt to changes in blood oxygen levels declines as we age.
        Sleeping: Breathing normally slows during sleep, even on an airplane.
        Underlying conditions: Less oxygen gets to your lungs if you have lung disease, sleep apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep), or heart problems.
        What's the risk?
        The more contributors to low blood oxygen you have, the harder it becomes for your body to compensate, especially on a plane. That was illustrated in a study published online June 3, 2024, by Thorax.
        Researchers wanted to know more about the combined effects of alcohol consumption and airplane cabin pressure during sleep on a plane. They randomly assigned 48 healthy people (ages 18 to 40) to spend two nights sleeping at normal air pressure or at the equivalent of airplane cabin pressure. Participants drank alcohol (the equivalent of two beers or two glasses of wine) before one of the nights and were sober for the other. They also wore devices measuring their blood oxygen and heart rate.
        Compared to sleeping in normal air pressure, sleeping in airplane cabin pressure made blood oxygen levels lower and heart rates higher. Combining drinking and sleeping when in airplane cabin pressure made oxygen levels even lower and heart rate even higher.
        ""Drinking and sleeping on a plane puts a big strain on your body, especially your cardiovascular system,"" Dr. Mosquera says. ""And there's even more strain if you have heart or lung disease. It places you at a higher risk for a heart attack or stroke.""
        Other alcohol risks on a plane
        Drinking alcohol on a plane poses additional health risks. For example, it
        
          increases your fall risk
          causes dehydration, which adds to the strain on your cardiovascular system
          impairs your judgment and ability to focus (which you don't want when it's time to get off the plane)
          may help you fall asleep, but reduces the time you spend in good-quality deep sleep.
        
        What you should do
        Is it best to pass on alcohol when the drink cart approaches? That depends. ""If you're healthy, drinking in moderation might be okay,"" Dr. Mosquera says. However, he urges you to consider the following:
        
          Think twice about drinking alcohol and taking certain medications. Alcohol can worsen drowsiness from drugs that make you sleepy.
          Drink extra water. This will help your body flush out the alcohol, and prevent dehydration caused by alcohol.
          Be mindful of your balance. Take your time going from a sitting position to standing, to avoid falls.
        
        And if you have heart or lung disease, sleep apnea, or chronic lung disease, or if you've had a stroke in the past — especially if you plan to sleep on the flight — it may be wisest not to drink alcohol.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/eating-a-sodium-rich-diet-is-tied-to-increased-eczema-risks,Eating a sodium-rich diet is tied to increased eczema risks,"Sodium-rich diets are associated with increased risks for many health problems, such as high blood pressure, kidney disease, heart attacks, stroke, and more. And a study published online June 5, 2024, by JAMA Dermatology suggests that eating a sodium-rich diet is also tied to increased risks of fueling eczema — a common type of atopic dermatitis characterized by dry, itchy skin and rashes. Researchers evaluated the health information of more than 215,000 people (ages 37 to 73) who'd each submitted a urine sample. When scientists analyzed sodium levels in the urine samples — a measure of how much sodium had been consumed in the past 24 hours—they found that the average was 3 grams. Each additional gram of excreted sodium over the average was associated with 11% increased odds of having eczema, 16% increased odds of having a flare up, and 11% increased odds of a severe case. While the study found an association, it doesn't prove that sodium intake causes eczema. However, many convincing studies have shown that high sodium intake is linked to other health problems, and it won't hurt to cut back if you're consuming more than the national recommendations of no more than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium per day — about 2.3 grams.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/grain-of-the-month-brown-rice,Grain of the month: Brown rice,"Whole-grain rice comes in an array of colors, including gold, purple, red, and black. But the most common is brown, which refers not to a particular variety but the natural color of the grain.
        Rice that is milled and polished to remove the bran and germ components, leaving only the starchy endosperm, is known as white rice. But that refining process also strips away key nutrients. Compared with white rice, brown rice contains higher amounts of fiber, certain B vitamins (B1, B3, B6, and B9), magnesium, potassium, and iron. Research suggests that swapping white rice for brown rice may improve blood sugar levels and help with weight control.
        You can now find different varieties of brown rice in stores, including fragrant, long-grain basmati rice (common in Indian cuisine) as well as jasmine rice (popular in Thai and other southeast Asian countries).
        To cook brown rice, combine one cup of rice with about two cups of water (or low-sodium vegetable broth) in a saucepan with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cover and simmer for 45 to 50 minutes. To save time, cook a large batch and store household-sized servings in the freezer for up to several months.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/fruit-of-the-month-dried-fruits,Fruit of the month: Dried fruits,"Raisins, dates, figs, and other dried fruits may not hold as much appeal as fresh fruits. But these small, sweet nuggets can be an easy way to reach your goal of eating at least two servings of fruit daily.
        For one thing, they stay fresh for a long time, so you don't need to worry about spoilage. They're lightweight, making them easy to bring for snacks, and they're particularly tasty when paired with nuts. One classic combination is raisins and peanuts. Dried apricots and almonds are another nice mix.
        Because they're energy-dense, dried fruits are fairly high in calories, so be careful not to overdo it — a serving is just a quarter-cup. However, all the nutrients are also concentrated along with the calories. Most dried fruits are good sources of potassium and fiber. They're also rich in antioxidants and several vitamins and minerals. Note that some dried fruits contain added sugar, so check the label to make sure you're not getting extra empty calories with your fruit.
        Dried fruits are also good stirred into oatmeal, mixed into muffins, or tossed into salads or grain-based dishes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/exercise-can-boost-your-memory-and-thinking-skills,Exercise can boost your memory and thinking skills,"Exercise benefits health in so many ways. It preserves muscle strength; keeps your heart strong; maintains a healthy body weight; and staves off chronic diseases such as diabetes.
        But exercise has brain benefits too. Many studies have suggested that the parts of the brain that control thinking and memory are larger in volume in people who exercise than in people who don't. One finding is that engaging in a program of regular exercise of moderate intensity over six months or a year is associated with an increase in the volume of selected brain regions.
        Exercise can also boost memory and thinking indirectly by improving mood and sleep, and by reducing stress and anxiety. Problems in these areas frequently cause or contribute to cognitive impairment.
        
          Which exercise is the best for the brain?
        
        Is one exercise better than another in terms of brain health? We don't know the answer to this question, because almost all of the research so far has looked at one form of exercise: walking. ""But it's likely that other forms of aerobic exercise that get your heart pumping might yield similar benefits,"" explains Dr. Scott McGinnis, assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.
        A study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society found that tai chi may enhance cognitive function in older adults, especially in executive function, which manages cognitive processes such as planning, working memory, attention, problem solving, and verbal reasoning. That may be because tai chi, a martial art that involves slow, focused movements, requires learning and memorizing new skills and movement patterns.
        
          How to maximize the brain benefits of exercise
        
        Dr. McGinnis recommends establishing exercise as a habit, almost like taking a prescription medication. Aim for a goal of exercising at a moderate intensity — such as brisk walking — for 150 minutes per week. Start with a few minutes a day and increase the amount by five or 10 minutes every week until you reach your goal.
        And since several studies have shown that it takes about six months to start reaping the cognitive benefits of exercise, he reminds you to be patient as you look for the first results — and to continue exercising for life.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/seaweed-a-tasty-nutritious-snack,"Seaweed: A tasty, nutritious snack","Depending on your upbringing, you might know seaweed best as the wrapping of your favorite sushi roll, a nuisance best avoided at your local beach, or a standard part of your everyday diet. While people from Asian and Pacific cultures have been eating seaweed for centuries, it's seen a rise in popularity as a tasty and nutritious food option around the world. So does it live up to the hype?
        What is seaweed?
        Seaweed is the name given to any number of plants and algae that grow in bodies of water.
        There are many different types that grow naturally all over the world. But edible seaweed is most popular in Asian cuisines.
        Some of the most common types of seaweed used in food include:
        
          nori
          aonori
          kombu
          wakame
          dulse
          ogo
          kelp
          hijiki
          spirulina.
        
        Seaweed's nutritional profile
        The exact nutritional makeup of seaweed varies by the type you're eating. No matter the type you choose, seaweed is low in calories, fat, and sugar, and is typically a good source of minerals and plant chemicals known as phytochemicals. Nutrients that seaweed can contain include iron, magnesium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B9, iodine, vitamin K, fiber, DHA and EPA (healthy omega-3 fatty acids), potassium, and phytochemicals including polyphenols and carotenoids. Check the Nutrition Facts label to see how much of which nutrients are found in that specific product (and check the serving size to see how much you need to eat to get those amounts).
        It's worth noting that some seaweed preparations are high in sodium. In addition, some types of seaweed contain high amounts of iodine, which is essential in limited quantities but can be harmful when eaten in large amounts. Seaweed can also contain the heavy metals arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead, which it can absorb if grown in areas contaminated with those substances.
        Possible health benefits of seaweed
        Some preliminary research has linked seaweed to lower risk of heart problems, anti-cancer properties, blood sugar control, and healthy thyroid function. But more high-quality human studies are needed to learn whether and the extent to which eating seaweed contributes to these benefits.
        Ideas for incorporating seaweed into meals and snacks
        You can find lots of different types of dried seaweed for sale online and at Asian grocery stores. Increasingly, you can buy seaweed, especially seaweed snacks (which are typically small sheets of dried nori, the type used in sushi rolls) in many mainstream supermarkets. You can enjoy these straight out of the package.
        To incorporate dried seaweed into cooked foods, you can soak it in water for a few minutes, then:
        
          Use it to flavor broths and soups.
          Toss with sesame oil, rice wine vinegar, and cucumber or lettuce for a quick seaweed salad.
          Saut' it with garlic.
          Wrap it dry around rice and fish to make your own sushi roll.

          Heat rash (miliaria) occurs due to obstruction of sweat ducts on the skin, which are responsible for helping the body maintain a normal temperature by releasing water to the surface of the skin. As these sweat glands get blocked with excessive sweat on an extremely hot day, they do not function properly and red itchy bumps develop.
          Grover disease, a rash of small, red, itchy bumps on the chest and back, can also be triggered or worsened by excessive heat and sweating. Often this clears up within a few weeks or months. Less often symptoms may persist for years, with flares during the summer months.
          Eczema is a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, itchy plaques that affects millions of people in the United States. Increased sweating during heat waves can lead to skin irritation and inflammation, aggravating eczema symptoms. Dehydration caused by fluid loss through sweating can make the skin more susceptible to eczema flare-ups.
          Rosacea, which causes facial redness, visible blood vessels, and acne-like bumps, is also heat-sensitive. Heat causes blood vessels to dilate as the body attempts to cool itself, resulting in visible redness and flushing. High temperatures, especially combined with sun exposure, can cause flare ups.
          Melasma. Hyperpigmentation disorders like melasma also worsen with heat. Melasma is characterized by irregular dark patches on the face and is often triggered by UV exposure from the sun. Heat can increase the activity of melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment, making these patches more pronounced. Additionally, the combined effects of heat and UV radiation accelerate collagen and elastin degradation, leading to premature aging and loss of skin elasticity.
          Skin cancer risk rises with increased exposure to UV radiation. Heat waves — now beginning earlier, ending later, and lasting longer — contribute to UV exposure, particularly among people who work outdoors. And preliminary research suggests prolonged exposure to high temperatures may further boost skin cancer risk. This could be of particular concern for firefighters, who face extended exposure to extreme heat.
        
        Heat waves, air pollution, and skin
        During heat waves, levels of environmental pollutants like ozone and particulate matter can rise. And reactions between these pollutants, heat, and UV radiation spawn secondary pollutants such as peroxyacetyl nitrates (PANs). Pollutants like these can irritate the skin and contribute to inflammation through oxidative stress and DNA damage, so inflammatory conditions such as eczema and rosacea may worsen.
        Can heat affect medications?
        High temperatures compromise the effectiveness of certain medications. For instance, EpiPens, which are crucial for managing life-threatening allergic reactions, can lose their potency when exposed to high temperatures. Check the instructions on all of your medicines to see which ones should be stored in a cool, dry place or refrigerated. If you're not sure which medicines might be affected by heat, talk to your pharmacist or doctor.
        Retinoids in skin care products, antibiotics taken for acne, and immunomodulators for autoimmune diseases can make skin more susceptible to sun damage. This can lead to severe sunburns or rashes known as photodermatoses. If you experience this, contact your health care team for advice.
        Protect your skin when temperatures climb
        Keep skin cool
        
          Wear light, breathable clothing. Choose natural fibers like cotton and linen to help regulate body temperature and prevent sweat-induced skin issues. Avoid synthetic fabrics, which can trap heat and moisture.
          Take cool baths or showers. Use cool or tepid water to bathe. Avoid hot showers, which can strip the skin of natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation.
          Find cool spaces. If your home is not air-conditioned, seek out cooler places and ways to cool off during heat waves.
        
        Keep skin hydrated
        
          Drink ample water and eat water-rich foods. Foods like watermelon and cucumbers can provide additional hydration.
          Moisturize your skin. Apply light, non-comedogenic moisturizers immediately after bathing. Look for ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin, which are beneficial for enhancing skin hydration.
        
        Limit exposure to sun and pollution
        
          Use protective clothing. Wear wide-brimmed hats, UV-blocking sunglasses, and long-sleeved shirts to shield the skin from harmful radiation.
          Wear sunscreen. Apply broad-spectrum mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, or iron oxide to protect against UV radiation and pollutants.
          Use topical antioxidants. Use products like vitamin C in your morning skin care routine to mitigate oxidative stress.
          Wash up. Cleansing face and body at the end of the day may help you limit skin exposure to pollutants while also rinsing off any sunscreen residue.",Kathyana P. Santiago Mangual,"August 14, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/lifestyle-strategies-to-help-prevent-natural-age-related-decline-in-testosterone,Lifestyle strategies to help prevent natural age-related decline in testosterone,"As men get older, their testosterone levels naturally decrease, which can cause undesirable symptoms for some. However, adopting healthy lifestyle habits can help improve or maintain testosterone levels.
        What is testosterone and what does it do?
        Testosterone is a hormone primarily produced in the testes. It plays a crucial role in male development and characteristics, influencing muscle mass, bone density, and sex drive. It's also important for regulating mood and cognitive function.
        Testosterone levels change throughout life: they are low before puberty, increase sharply during puberty, and then gradually decrease by about 1% each year, although there are some exceptions.
        What can cause levels of testosterone to drop?
        Signals from the brain to the pituitary gland regulate testosterone production in men. The pituitary gland, which is found at the base of the brain, sends messages to the testes to produce testosterone. A ""feedback loop"" carefully monitors levels of this hormone in the blood.
        Anything that affects this system can contribute to declining testosterone levels. Aging is the most common cause, but other genetic and acquired conditions can also lead to drops in testosterone. These include:
        
          
            obesity
          
          chronic diseases, such as kidney disease, diabetes, lung disease, and cirrhosis
          critical illness, such as a heart attack, surgery, or head trauma
          certain medications, such as glucocorticoids (steroids) and opioids
          congenital disorders, such as Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome
          stress
          
            sleep apnea
          
          tumors.
        
        What are the symptoms of low testosterone?
        Many men with low testosterone never have symptoms. When symptoms do occur, low testosterone can cause a range of effects. Some symptoms are general, such as fatigue, poor concentration, and mood changes. Others are more specific, such as:
        
          reduced sex drive
          
            erectile dysfunction
          
          infertility
          physical changes including decreased muscle mass, increased body fat, and thinning hair.
        
        If you have any of these symptoms, ask your doctor if it might be related to low testosterone. He or she can order a blood test to check the level. Because blood testosterone levels can fluctuate, it's important to do the test in the morning before 10 a.m. In general, a normal total testosterone level is 300 ng/dL or higher.
        Natural ways to help maintain testosterone levels
        Certain lifestyle habits can help slow the natural testosterone decline that comes with age. Doctors often recommend a trial of intense lifestyle changes for men with low testosterone before considering medications.
        Here are some natural ways to maintain and improve testosterone levels as you age.
        Maintain a healthy weight and lose weight if needed
        Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for testosterone levels. Excess body fat, particularly around the abdomen, can contribute to lower testosterone. Losing weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise can help boost testosterone production up to 30%, according to some research.
        Exercise
        Regular physical activity is one of the best ways to maintain healthy testosterone levels. Both resistance training like weightlifting, and cardiovascular exercises such as running or swimming, can increase testosterone.
        The largest improvements are seen with moderate- or high-intensity resistance exercises involving large muscle groups, such as squats and bench presses.
        Other lifestyle changes
        Other factors that can affect testosterone levels include:
        
          Diet. Well-rounded diets full of healthy fats, proteins, and nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables support healthy testosterone production. Foods that have been linked to increased testosterone include onions, oysters, fatty fish (which contains healthy omega-3 fats), and extra virgin olive oil.
          Alcohol. Excessive alcohol consumption can lower testosterone levels, impair sexual function, and reduce sperm count due to hormone disruption. Reduce or avoid alcohol, or at least limit your intake to no more than one drink per day.
          Smoking. Nicotine found in cigarettes and chewing tobacco has been linked to lower testosterone levels, though some studies suggest smoking may not affect or could even increase these levels. However, smoking can negatively affect male reproductive health, including sperm count, motility, and morphology. Quitting smoking may help some men restore a normal testosterone level.
          Environmental toxins. Chemicals found in certain plastics, including bisphenol A or BPA, disrupt hormone-producing glands and have been associated with decreased testosterone levels and reduced sperm count. Try to avoid BPA-containing products such as plastic bottles, containers, and certain canned foods. Instead, look for ""BPA-free"" labels.
        
        The role of sleep in testosterone production
        Adequate sleep is essential for maintaining testosterone levels. Most testosterone release occurs during sleep, particularly during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage.
        Sleep apnea, a condition in which you stop breathing for short periods while you are asleep, can negatively affect hormone levels, including testosterone.
        Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night to support healthy hormone production. If you have sleep apnea or are concerned you may have symptoms of this condition, talk with your doctor about treatment options.
        Manage stress to help libido
        Chronic stress can also negatively impact testosterone levels and libido. High stress increases cortisol, a hormone that can interfere with testosterone production.
        Stress affects not only the body but also the mind. It can cause mental distractions and make it hard to focus on or enjoy sex. Additionally, stress can impact your mood, potentially leading to anxiety and depression, both of which can reduce your interest in sex.
        Enhancing mental well-being through relaxation techniques and mindfulness, and adopting a healthier lifestyle to minimize the negative effects of stress, are important for maintaining testosterone levels and healthy libido.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","August 13, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heart-palpitations-identifying-possible-causes-and-managing-triggers,Heart palpitations: Identifying possible causes and managing triggers,"Do you occasionally feel your heart doing flip-flops when you're stressed or nervous — for example, right before you give a big presentation? These are called heart palpitations. They are very common, but they can feel scary.
        Here's a closer look at what heart palpitations are, what they feel like, causes, and, when you might need to worry.
        What are heart palpitations?
        Have you ever noticed your heart seeming to beat more forcefully or faster than usual? This is known as heart palpitations. They happen to a lot of people — in fact, they are one of the top reasons people see their primary care provider or even a cardiologist.
        Heart palpitations may feel uncomfortable, but most of the time they're harmless. They should always be checked out by your doctor, however, in case they're being triggered by an underlying medical condition.
        What do heart palpitations feel like?
        If you have heart palpitations, you may feel like your heart is pounding or racing. You may also feel it not just in your chest, but in your neck. Some people describe a sensation of ""flip-flopping"" in their chest, where their heart seems to skip a beat.
        Some people experience heart palpitations all day. Others just notice heart palpitations at night, during exercise, or in times of stress.
        What causes heart palpitations?
        There are many different causes of heart palpitations. These include:
        Physical stress or strong emotions. Heart palpitations can be brought on by physical stress, such as intense exercise, or a fever. They can be triggered by strong emotions as well. When you are upset, your body releases stress hormones that can affect your heart rate.
        Heart conditions. Sometimes heart palpitations are due to an electrical misfire in your heart that causes it to beat quickly or erratically. One of the most common causes is atrial fibrillation, a rapid, irregular heartbeat.
        Hormonal changes. Up to 42% of perimenopausal women and 54% of postmenopausal women report that they experience heart palpitations.
        Certain substances. Caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine can all trigger heart palpitations.
        Metabolic changes. Low blood sugar can lead to heart palpitations. You may also experience them if your body produces too much thyroid hormone, a condition known as hyperthyroidism.
        Do you need to worry about heart palpitations?
        See your doctor if you have heart palpitations; most of the time, they can find the trigger. The evaluation usually involves a test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical signals of your heart.
        If you have heart palpitations but a normal ECG, your doctor may ask you to wear a heart monitor for a couple of weeks. You push a button on the portable device when you feel a heart palpitation, and that information is sent to your doctor. It can help to pinpoint a cause.
        Sometimes, heart palpitations can indicate a heart attack or stroke if they occur along with other symptoms. Call 911 if you also experience:
        
          shortness of breath
          chest pain or pressure — it may be constant, or it may come and go
          chest discomfort that radiates into your arms, back, stomach, neck, or jaw
          sweating, nausea, or lightheadedness.
        
        Lifestyle changes to prevent heart palpitations
        If your heart palpitations aren't due to an underlying medical condition, the following lifestyle changes may help to prevent them or reduce their frequency.
        Try vagal maneuvers. These are physical movements you can do to stimulate your vagus nerve, which helps to control your heart rate. Your doctor may recommend that you:
        
          cough
          hold your breath and bear down, like you are having a bowel movement
          place an ice-cold towel over your face.
        
        Steer clear of certain substances. Limit caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, certain soft drinks, and even chocolate. Don't have more than one alcoholic beverage per day. More than that can promote palpitations in some people, and it increases the risk of atrial fibrillation. In addition, don't smoke or consume nicotine-containing products.
        Tweak your medications. Certain drugs can trigger heart palpitations. These include asthma inhalers and some over-the-counter cough and cold medications. Your doctor may be able to suggest alternatives.
        Manage stress. If you are depressed or anxious, your body releases stress hormones that can impact your heart rate. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to help you manage your emotions, such as regular exercise, talk therapy, and relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga.
        Medical treatment for heart palpitations

          here
           for part one.
        
        Most of us don't think twice about standing up. Yet for people affected by a disorder called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), the simple act of standing can provoke lightheadedness and a racing heartbeat. This post discusses diagnosis, treatment, and living with POTS.
        How is POTS diagnosed?
        Measuring blood pressure and heart rate while lying down, then while standing (orthostatic vital signs), can help cardiologists like me diagnose POTS. Within 10 minutes of standing, the heart rate rises at least 30 beats per minute (bpm) in POTS and, importantly, the blood pressure remains stable (systolic blood pressure drops by no more than 20 mm Hg).
        These findings, along with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (most commonly lightheadedness and fatigue), must be present for at least three to six months for a person to be diagnosed with POTS. Because many doctors are not familiar with POTS, and since there is no laboratory test to confirm it, people often experience symptoms for several years before being diagnosed.
        Accordingly, when David, a firefighter, came to my office, we measured his heart rate and blood pressure lying down and then standing upright. While lying flat, his heart rate and blood pressure were normal, and he felt fine. However, after standing upright for just three minutes, he began to feel lightheaded. His heart rate increased by 35 bpm with no significant drop in blood pressure. David had POTS.
        How is POTS treated?
        While some people with POTS will require medications, most will improve with three behavioral changes alone: higher sodium (salt) intake, compression garments, and gradual exercise.
        Add sodium to your diet
        One reason that people with POTS feel lightheaded upon standing is insufficient circulating blood volume. Drinking more fluids will help, but the key to keeping the fluids in circulation is sodium.
        For reasons not fully understood, many people who have POTS need up to three times more sodium than the standard limit recommended by the US Dietary Guidelines, which is 2,300 milligrams a day (roughly 1 teaspoon of salt). Some of my patients can consume this much sodium by eating salty foods such as tomato juice, broth, pickles, and olives. Others prefer to use high-sodium electrolyte drinks or take salt tablets.
        David opted to start with a glass of tomato juice every morning (roughly 500 mg of sodium) and a 1-gram salt tablet with lunch, in addition to adding salt to his meals. Even though David could easily meet his sodium needs by eating highly processed junk foods, I recommended he avoid these because of their low nutrient value.
        Wear compression garments
        Compression garments push blood into the deeper veins, preventing it from pooling in superficial veins of the lower legs. This is especially important during periods of standing, to help the body overcome the force of gravity.
        There are many types of compression garments, including knee-high socks or footless calf sleeves, leggings, and bike shorts. A recent study showed that wearing a girdlelike garment called an abdominal binder and knee-high compression socks provides the best results for people who have POTS. David opted for a pair of compression bike shorts and compression socks.
        Gradually step up exercise
        A cornerstone of POTS treatment is a slow, consistent, gradual return to exercise. Like many of my previously active patients, David became discouraged after experiencing worsening fatigue and dizziness when he attempted to return to normal exercise.
        What helped? Patience combined with a ""start low and go slow"" approach, starting with gentle floor exercises and slowly working toward upright activity such as walking. In David's case, I also recommended an additional 500 mg of sodium one hour before exercise. This helps compensate for increased blood volume diverted to the muscles and sodium lost in sweat.
        Are there other helpful strategies for POTS?
        Yes. Along with salt, compression, and exercise, I recommended that David try
        
          placing a small board under his mattress that raises the head of his bed by a few inches
          using a symptom-tracking smartphone app to help identify triggers for POTS symptoms
          avoiding identified triggers, such as skipping meals; insufficient sleep; alcoholic beverages; hot baths and saunas; and high-carbohydrate meals.
        
        When it's not possible to avoid triggers, it helps to learn to anticipate and manage symptoms. For example, in hot and humid weather, cooling vests or scarves can help reduce symptoms. Catching a cold or stomach bug can also cause symptoms to flare, and many women find that symptoms worsen in the days leading up to their menstrual periods. During these vulnerable times, a person may need to intensify salt and compression routines and, when necessary, take a day off from exercise.
        Are there any medicines that might help?
        Some people find that behavioral changes must be combined with medicines to properly treat their symptoms. Currently, no medications have been approved by the FDA to treat POTS. However, several medicines can be prescribed off-label when needed. Your doctor might suggest one or more of these:
        
          fludrocortisone (helps the kidneys retain sodium)
          midodrine (causes the blood vessels to tighten)
          beta blockers (slow down the heart rate)
          pyridostigmine (enhances neurotransmitter activity).
        
        Living with POTS
        By consistently paying attention to sodium and fluid intake, compression, and exercise, as well as the behavioral changes and medicines discussed above, many people who have POTS can successfully attend school and hold down jobs. However, symptoms may flare without warning. Arranging formal accommodations, such as frequent snack breaks and flexible hours, can help people thrive in an academic or work setting.
        Finally, it is crucial to recognize the emotional toll that chronic illness can take, particularly when it strikes young people in the prime of their lives. Seeking the support of friends and family, and assembling a healthcare team that understands POTS, are essential elements of a successful therapeutic plan.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/health-benefits-of-walnuts-2018081314526,Health benefits of walnuts,"For many, choosing a healthy diet is all about sacrifice: foregoing the appetizers, cutting back on carbs or saturated fat, giving up dessert. But what if there was something you really liked that turned out to be good for you? No, I'm not talking about chocolate (although in small quantities, chocolate may not be so bad!).
        This time it's nuts in the news. Previous studies have found that people with higher nut consumption have improved cardiovascular risk factors and lower rates of cardiovascular disease. For example, several trials have linked nut consumption with lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. And nuts are an important part of the Mediterranean diet, which has been found to be heart-healthy as well.
        Studies looking at health benefits of walnuts
        A 2018 study suggests that walnuts may be a particularly good choice. And this isn't the first time researchers have come to this conclusion. A previous analysis by the same researchers (including 365 study participants in 13 trials) found that diets enriched with walnuts led to lower total and LDL (""bad"") cholesterol when compared with other diets. Since then, more studies with far more study participants and longer follow-up have been published.
        This latest analysis combined data from 26 previous trials that included more than 1,000 people; compared with those on a regular diet, those consuming a walnut-enriched diet had:
        
          lower total cholesterol (by about 7 mg/dL, representing a 3% greater reduction)
          lower LDL cholesterol (by about 5.5 mg/dL, a 4% greater reduction)
          lower triglycerides (by about 4.7 mg/dL, a 5.5% greater reduction)
          lower apoprotein B (a protein linked to cardiovascular disease) by nearly 4 mg/dL
        
        While these improvements in blood lipids were rather small, larger improvements (for example, a 12 mg/dL drop in total cholesterol) were noted when the comparison diet was a typical US or western diet (that is, a diet high in red meats, high-fat dairy foods, and artificially sweetened foods).
        A diet rich in high-fat foods such as nuts always raises the concern about the potential for weight gain, but fortunately those on the high-walnut diet did not gain weight.
        Of note, more recent studies have also found evidence of health benefits of eating walnuts, including improved blood lipids and a possible protective effect on brain health.
        Why would walnuts be so good for you?
        While this research is intriguing, it also raises the question of whether walnuts are unique in some way. In fact, it may be the types of oils in walnuts that make them special when it comes to cardiovascular health. Walnuts contain a lot of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are healthier than saturated fats. In addition, walnuts have alpha-linolenic and linoleic acids, which may have anti-inflammatory effects that keep blood vessels healthy, in addition to having favorable effects on blood lipids.
        All nuts are not created equal. Many nuts (such as my favorites, almonds and cashews) are rich in monounsaturated fats, along with polyunsaturated fats. These are healthier types of fats than saturated and trans fats, but the specific combination of fats and polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in walnuts may be particularly good for cardiovascular health.
        Not so fast, walnut lovers
        Before you start loading up on walnuts, there are some important caveats to keep in mind:
        
          The improvements in blood lipids noted in these studies were small.
          These studies did not determine the ideal ""dose"" or duration of walnut consumption. In one of the best studies, a mix of about nine hazelnuts, 12 almonds, and six walnuts were consumed daily. That might be more than some people are willing to eat!
          Most studies of walnut consumption cannot prove that walnuts were the reason a person's cholesterol improved with a walnut-enriched diet. It's possible that those who like walnuts also tend to exercise more, smoke less, or have more favorable genes than those who don't eat walnuts.
          No single food in your diet can make you healthy. It's the big picture that matters most. A healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding excess weight, and not smoking are good starting points. And even with a healthy lifestyle, some people require medications or other treatments to reduce their risk of cardiovascular and other diseases.
        
        The bottom line
        Researchers analyzing past studies on the health benefits of walnuts have given us reason to make them a regular part of our diets and, perhaps, to choose them over other nuts. Hopefully, this type of research will lead to better food choices and better health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/weighing-in-on-weight-gain-from-antidepressants-202408023063,Weighing in on weight gain from antidepressants,"If you're struggling with depression, the most important question about taking an antidepressant is whether it will work. But another question on your mind may be whether it will fuel weight gain.
        A new study provides some context by suggesting how much weight, on average, people taking one of eight commonly used antidepressants might expect to gain. This insight is valuable, since people with depression often stop taking antidepressants because they don't like the effect on their weight, a Harvard expert says.
        ""It's important to acknowledge that weight gain is a key reason that some people decide to stop antidepressants, even if they're otherwise working well,"" says Dr. Roy Perlis, associate chief of psychiatric research at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""It's also a reason people may be reluctant to start them in the first place, even if they're quite depressed or anxious.""
        What did the study look at?
        Published July 2024 in Annals of Internal Medicine, the new study drew on data from more than 183,000 people between ages 20 and 80. Their average age was 48, and 65% were women. Most were overweight or obese at the study's start.
        The researchers analyzed participants' electronic health records and body mass index. They gauged weight gain or loss at regular intervals — six, 12, and 24 months — after people began taking an antidepressant for the first time.
        The study compared the weight-related effects of sertraline (Zoloft) to seven other antidepressant medications:
        
          escitalopram (Lexapro)
          paroxetine (Paxil)
          duloxetine (Cymbalta)
          citalopram (Celexa)
          fluoxetine (Prozac)
          venlafaxine (Effexor)
          bupropion (Wellbutrin).
        
        What did the research find?
        The antidepressants led to the following average weight gain:
        
          sertraline: Nearly 0.5 pounds at six months; 3.2 pounds at 24 months
          escitalopram: 1.4 pounds at six months; 3.6 pounds at 24 months
          paroxetine: 1.4 pounds at six months; 2.9 pounds at 24 months
          duloxetine: 1.2 pounds at six months; 1.7 pounds at 24 months.
        
        Citalopram, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine didn't confer lower or higher odds of weight gain than Zoloft, the study found. And only bupropion was associated with a small amount of weight loss — 0.25-pounds — at six months. But that trend reversed at 24 months, when bupropion led to an average weight gain of 1.2 pounds.
        What does the study tell us?
        ""Weight gain is common among antidepressant users, even if the amounts gained on average are modest,"" says Dr. Perlis, who was not involved in this new study. It underscores similar findings from other studies of antidepressants, including research he published with colleagues a decade ago.
        ""While differences in weight gain for specific antidepressants tend to be small, there are certainly some — like bupropion — that tend to cause less weight gain,"" he notes.
        It's crucial to keep in mind that the study points out average weight gain. Many people taking antidepressants won't gain any weight and others could gain more. ""Still, having average values to work with — and seeing that these averages line up well with prior studies — at least lets us give people a sense of what they might expect,"" he says.
        ""One caution is that some people lose weight as a result of depression, which can impact appetite,"" he adds, ""so some of what we're seeing may be people regaining weight they'd lost as their depression or anxiety improves.""
        What additional limitations did the study have?
        Other limitations may have shaped the findings. The study was observational, meaning it cannot prove that antidepressants cause weight changes, only that they were linked with them. It wasn't a randomized, controlled trial — considered the gold standard in research — and the participants taking antidepressants weren't compared to a control group not taking the medications.
        Additionally, only about one in three participants was still taking their initially prescribed medication six months after the study started. That makes it difficult to link any later weight changes with a specific medication.
        ""As with any study that's not randomized, we don't know if the differences between medicines could reflect other differences in who gets prescribed these medicines,"" Dr. Perlis says. ""But, for circumstances where a randomized trial is unrealistic, health records can be a helpful way of trying to study side effects and at least generate a partial answer to these important questions.""
        What else should you consider?
        Another thing to consider, if you're taking an antidepressant, is what types of side effects you're willing to tolerate in pursuit of its mood-smoothing benefits.
        ""The best way to manage side effects is to anticipate them — to have an open conversation with your doctor about the potential risks and how we'll manage them if they occur,"" Dr. Perlis says.
        What can you discuss with your doctor?
        If weight gain is a particular concern for you, you may also wish to consider nondrug treatments for depression. They include:
        
          Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy that teaches people to become aware of their thought patterns and adjust them during stressful moments to reframe their thinking.
          Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a brain stimulation therapy that is noninvasive. It uses an electromagnetic coil placed on the scalp to deliver magnetic pulses that stimulate nerve cells to brain regions involved in depression.
        
        ""We know that certain kinds of talk therapies, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, can be very effective for treating depression and anxiety disorders,"" Dr. Perlis says. ""Whether people choose talk therapy or antidepressant medications can depend on their preference. It's important to have multiple options.""",Maureen Salamon,"August 2, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/top-5-ways-to-reduce-crippling-hand-pain,Top 5 ways to reduce crippling hand pain,"Hand pain is more than just annoying. The stiffness and swelling that go along with hand pain can sap strength and diminish the ability to carry out routine functions, like buttoning clothes.
        One common cause of hand pain is osteoarthritis—when the shock-absorbing cartilage between bones in the finger joints and at the base of the thumb becomes worn or damaged. Hand pain can also result from nerve conditions, like the pain and tingling you feel when there is pressure on the median nerve in the wrist (the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome) or the ulnar nerve near the elbow. Sometimes hand pain results from tendinitis, an inflammation of the tissue that attaches muscles to the bones. Here are five methods to help manage hand pain, retain hand function, and avoid surgery.
        1. Splinting
        A splint stabilizes the position of your fingers, thumb, or wrist. You can wear a splint for a few weeks if arthritis flares, so the inflammation can settle down.
        2. Injections
        An injection of a corticosteroid into a joint can reduce inflammation. The relief it provides can last for many months. For some people the amount of relief diminishes with subsequent injections.
        3. NSAIDs
        A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) helps relieve hand pain by blocking enzymes that produce pain and swelling, but it's not effective for carpal tunnel syndrome. Long-term use of oral NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are linked to ulcers, stomach bleeding, liver damage, and increased risk of heart attacks. Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac (Voltaren), pose less risk.
        4. Heat and cold
        Heat can loosen hand stiffness. Even a hot shower will do the job. Cold is effective for hand pain that results from activity, such as playing golf. Apply it in the form of flexible gel pads you keep in the freezer, or even bags of frozen peas or corn, which conform well to the three-dimensional complexities of the hand.
        5. Exercises and stretches
        These focus on your hand's tendons and muscles. A physical therapist or occupational therapist can guide you through exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles, which can help absorb the stress on joints in the hand and reduce pain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/exercise-trend-alert-walking-soccer,Exercise trend alert: Walking soccer,"Soccer is one of those sports we sometimes have to give up when we get older. All the running, kicking, and pivoting place big demands on the body, especially our balance and joints. But a new trend is helping people get back onto the pitch (field) or, in some cases, start playing for the first time. It's called walking soccer.
        What is walking soccer?
        Walking soccer is played just like it sounds — players can only walk as they pass and kick the ball around the pitch and try to get it into the other team's goal, and they must always have at least one foot in contact with the ground.
        The walking soccer pitch is smaller than a standard-sized playing field, and the goals are shorter and smaller. Each team is smaller too, with seven people playing at a time instead of 11.
        The ball is also different: a size 4 ""futsal"" ball, which is smaller and less bouncy than regular soccer balls.
        Walking soccer benefits
        While walking soccer is a gentler form of the sport, it's still packed with health benefits. It's a great way to socialize, get your daily steps in, stay active, and exercise at a speed that's comfortable for your body. And playing reinforces essential skills.
        ""You get to practice your pivoting motion and anticipate and react to the ball's direction. This is very helpful for maintaining and improving your balance,"" says Kevin McEnroy, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Another plus: by kicking and passing the ball during the game, you maintain your ability to produce power. ""As we get older, if we aren't participating regularly in sports or doing resistance training, one of the biggest things we lose is the ability to produce hard or fast forces. We need that force to be able to do something like get out of a chair and stand up. The repetitive moves in walking soccer can likely help you preserve your abilities,"" McEnroy says.
        Staying active in a sport like walking soccer also helps protect cartilage cushions inside the knees called menisci (singular: meniscus), which are prone to tears after age 50. ""By staying active, you keep the menisci healthy and less likely to fray,"" McEnroy says.
        Walking soccer risks
        In regular soccer, the big risks are lower-limb injuries, particularly in the ankles and knees.
        McEnroy says we don't yet have statistics on the sorts of injuries people experience while playing walking soccer. His concerns for players include sprained ankles; aggravated meniscal tears; flare-ups of knee arthritis; and falls that result in wrist, arm, or elbow fractures.
        Prepare for the sport
        If you're interested in playing walking soccer, you'll need good balance, endurance, and strong leg and core muscles. If you haven't exercised in a while, get your doctor's okay, and then focus on the basics of fitness: go for daily walks and start a resistance training program.
        If you're already active, McEnroy recommends that you first practice walking and kicking a ball on terrain that might be similar to a soccer pitch, to be sure you're comfortable with it. And start paying extra attention to strengthening the quadriceps muscles in the thighs, the gluteus muscles in the buttocks, and the gastrocnemius muscles in the calves. ""Strong muscles are essential for injury prevention,"" McEnroy says. ""Start training for walking soccer at least six weeks before you plan to play.""
        Once you're playing the game regularly, warm up before each match. McEnroy suggests walking around the pitch and playing pass with a teammate to mimic the left-and-right movements you'll need in the game. Don't forget to stretch after a match, to keep your muscles long and supple.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tackling-the-top-stressors-for-dementia-caregivers,Tackling the top stressors for dementia caregivers,"Caregiving is a demanding job that you commit to out of love, loyalty, compassion, and often necessity. And when the person you're caring for has dementia, the job is especially difficult. It comes with a long list of physical, financial, logistical, and emotional challenges. Which are the most difficult, and how can you cope?
        Recent findings
        A 2024 Alzheimer's Association survey highlights the stressors caregivers say are most burdensome. The survey included more than 1,500 current or recent unpaid caregivers of adults ages 50 or older with cognitive problems. The top five stressors were costs, coordinating numerous doctor visits, securing doctor appointments, finding the right doctors, and getting help to take a break (respite care).
        Only half of the caregivers surveyed had ever spoken with health care professionals for guidance.
        Physical and emotional tolls
        Caring for a person with dementia is physically and emotionally demanding. For example, you might need to help a loved one with bathing, dressing, eating, and getting in and out of a car. It takes physical strength and stamina.
        Caregiving also puts you through an emotional wringer. It's common to feel frustration with the unpredictability of your loved one's behavior: one day they understand and recognize you, but the next day they don't. You might feel helpless if you don't know how to communicate with a loved one or how to cope with dementia-specific behaviors such as sundowning (meltdowns at the end of each day). You might feel anguish that they might not be getting adequate care. Above all, you probably feel grief at gradually losing the individual you once knew.
        ""Caregivers might also experience anger from the demands of nonstop caregiving. Then, recognizing their anger, caregivers might immediately feel guilty about resenting the loved one or having a desire to take time for themselves,"" says Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        The combination of stressors puts caregivers at high risk for burnout, high blood pressure, sleep problems, depression, isolation, weight changes, and even premature death.
        What you can do
        Resolving caregiving challenges is an ongoing process. Here are some ways to get started.
        For logistical challenges: Talk to your loved one's doctors about whether you can consolidate numerous appointments on the same days or do some visits as a video or phone call.
        For help finding services: Your local Area Agency on Aging can provide a free comprehensive list of services tailored to your loved one's needs and connect you to the people who provide them. The agency can also guide you to groups in your area that might help pay for services such as respite care or transportation.
        Alternatively, ask your local health care system if it has a comprehensive dementia care program that provides similar help. Many systems are ramping up dementia care navigation services as a result of a new initiative from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services called Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE). It pays providers to offer caregiver training, help lines, care navigators, and individual care plans.
        You can also turn to the ARCH National Respite Network and Resource Center, a national resource program to direct you to respite services in your area.
        For help coping emotionally: Join a free caregiver support group — either online, such as those offered by the Family Caregiver Alliance, or in person (if time permits) at a senior center or local hospital. Or work with a therapist online (it's covered by your own Medicare). ""For example, if you feel guilty about negative emotions, a therapist might acknowledge your struggle with guilt and help you understand that perfection is impossible. You'll be guided to establish realistic goals,"" Dr. Collier says.
        To avoid burnout: ""Caregiving often requires a team, so don't feel bad asking for help from friends and family or hiring health aides at home,"" Dr. Collier says. ""The assistance can give you a much-needed break. And taking time for yourself is not just okay, it's recommended. You need to exercise, get enough sleep, see your doctors, and take part in pleasurable activities, such as spending time with friends or reading a book. Caregiving is a marathon, with endless things to do, but you must set the priority to recharge regularly.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-i-use-a-continuous-glucose-monitor,Should I use a continuous glucose monitor?,"Q.  I'm overweight, but don't have diabetes yet. Should I use a continuous glucose monitor, like people with diabetes do?

A. Increasingly, new technologies are allowing us to monitor how our body is functioning. Smart watches and specialized rings monitor the number of steps we take and flights we climb, our heart and breathing rates, and our blood oxygen levels.

People with diabetes need to monitor their level of blood sugar, often multiple times a day, to make sure it doesn't get either too high or too low. When I was beginning my medical career, measuring blood sugar levels required a venipuncture (using a needle to take a blood sample). That was not something a patient could do, so instead we asked patients to collect several urine samples a day and use a kit to measure the level of sugar in it. That gave a crude indication of when blood sugars were too high, but didn't help determine when sugars were too low.

Then, new technology allowed people to prick a fingertip, collect a drop of blood on a special test strip, and use a machine to measure the blood sugar level. This was more accurate than the urine testing and much more feasible than multiple venipunctures each day, but people didn't much like pricking their fingertips. Neither did their fingers.

Then came continuous glucose monitoring technology. A small device sticks to the skin, and a tiny sensor on the underside of the device painlessly pushes into the skin. The sensor continuously monitors the level of sugar and sends that information wirelessly to another device (such as a smartphone) where a person can easily see their sugar level. With some devices, an alarm goes off when the sugar is too high or too low. Continuous glucose monitors can be expensive and are not always covered by insurance.

You ask if you should use a continuous glucose monitor, even though you do not have diabetes. There are relatively few studies of that question. At this time, there is no solid evidence of the value of these monitors in people who do not have diabetes.

What will future studies show? I'm much better at predicting the past than predicting the future, but here goes: my bet is that these devices will have no value in people who have no risk factors for diabetes. On the other hand, they may prove to have value in some people who have risk factors for diabetes — such as people who are overweight (like you), people with prediabetes whose blood sugar levels are somewhat high, and people for whom diabetes runs in the family. But this will need to be scientifically established before it's worth using such monitors. Or before insurance is likely to pay for them.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tips-to-change-your-night-owl-lifestyle,Tips to change your night-owl lifestyle,"Do you naturally stay up until the wee hours and sleep late in the morning? Do you feel more creative, productive, or focused in the afternoon or evening than you do in the morning? If so, you're probably a ""night owl."" That's the opposite of a ""morning lark,"" someone who wakes with the sun and goes to sleep early.
        For a long time, doctors believed there were no health differences between night owls and morning larks as long as you got the optimal seven to nine hours of sleep per night. But that thinking is changing. So it might be time to consider if you should try to shift your sleep pattern.
        Night owl risks
        A growing amount of evidence suggests that being a night owl may increase the risk of developing many health problems.
        For example, a 2023 Harvard-led study of about 64,000 healthy middle-aged women, followed for eight years, found that those who said they were night owls were 72% more likely to develop diabetes than morning larks. The night owls were also more likely than morning larks to be overweight and have an unhealthy life-style — drinking a lot of alcohol, smoking, eating a poor diet, and getting too little sleep. Even after scientists calculated the impact of those lifestyle factors on health, the night owls were still 19% more likely to develop diabetes than morning larks.
        In addition, a 2021 study of almost 137,000 middle-aged and older adults suggested that having a bedtime past 10 p.m. was tied to a 20% greater risk of having obesity or a dangerously large waistline (35 or more inches for women, 40 or more for men), compared with people who went to bed between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The risk for obesity was even higher (35% to 38%) among people who went to bed between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Night owls in this study also slept fewer hours (six or seven hours per night) than morning larks (eight or nine hours per night).
        The risks of little sleep
        The fact that night owls sometimes sleep less than morning larks only adds to the risk. Sleep is the time when the brain flushes out toxins and consolidates memories and new bits of information. It's when our muscles and cells rebuild.
        Getting an inadequate amount of good-quality sleep is linked to poor concentration; increased risks of falls, broken bones, and car crashes; a weakened immune system; and many diseases, such as dementia, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, stroke, obesity, and depression.
        The power of darkness
        The typical human sleep-wake cycle makes the desire for sleep strongest between midnight and dawn, when it's dark outside.
        ""We sleep best, with the highest-quality sleep, when the sun is down. That's just how we're wired,"" says Dr. Kenneth Sassower, a pediatric and adult sleep neurologist at Harvard-­affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""If you're a night owl and you don't go to sleep until the middle of the night, you're not maximizing the number of hours you can sleep in darkness. The sun comes up soon after your bedtime, which might lead to poor-quality or interrupted sleep.""
        
          
            
              
                Tips for success
                Give yourself the best chance of successfully shifting your sleep-wake cycle by following good sleep hygiene.
                
                  Exercise daily, but not too close to bedtime.
                  Avoid alcohol and spicy food close to bedtime.
                  Create a sleep ritual an hour before bed: turn down the lights, turn off the TV and computer screens, and do a quiet activity (like reading).
                  Sleep in a cool, dark room, and make sure your bed and bedding are comfortable.
                
              
            
          
        
        Changing your sleep schedule
        It's not that the evidence is so strong that night owls should definitely go to sleep and awaken earlier. But the evidence is convincing enough that it's worth a try, particularly if you're not sleeping long enough or if the bulk of your sleep isn't occurring when it's dark outside.
        Is it possible to shift your sleep-wake cycle, even if you're not wired to go to bed earlier? ""Yes, but it's a slow process,"" Dr. Sassower says. He recommends the following steps.
        Set a bedtime goal. Dr. Sassower suggests aiming for a bedtime between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., so you'll get at least five hours of sleep in darkness.
        Gradually go to bed earlier. ""You can't just start going to sleep hours earlier and expect to make a lasting change to your sleep-wake cycle. Your brain won't comply,"" Dr. Sassower says. He advises rolling back your bedtime by 20 minutes every five days, until you reach your desired bedtime.
        For example, if you currently go to sleep at 1 a.m. each night and would prefer a bedtime of about 11:30 p.m., go to sleep at
        12:40 a.m. for five nights
        then 12:20 a.m. for five nights
        then midnight for five nights
        then 11:40 p.m. for five nights
        then 11:20 p.m. indefinitely.
        Use medication. Until you reach your bedtime goal, it might help to take melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle. If you use an over-the-counter supplement, you should take it two hours before bedtime. It would be more effective, Dr. Sassower says, if you take a more potent prescription version of melatonin, a drug called ramelteon (Rozerem), at bedtime. You'll have to talk to your doctor about that.
        Set a wake time. ""Don't get up late,"" Dr. Sassower says. ""You need a consistent wake time to train the brain. Don't make it any later than 9 a.m.""
        Be patient. Once you've reached your bedtime goal, it will take about 90 days to officially establish the new sleep schedule and make it stick. ""I'm not saying it's easy,"" Dr. Sassower says, ""but it can be done. And you'll probably sleep better, feel the difference, and improve your health.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/rethinking-hdl-cholesterol,Rethinking HDL cholesterol,"Cholesterol, a waxy, pale yellow fat, travels through the bloodstream in tiny, protein-covered particles called lipoproteins that mix easily with blood. You need cholesterol to create cell membranes, make hormones, and synthesize vitamin D, among other things. But if you're trying to avoid heart disease, you should keep tabs on your blood cholesterol values — especially your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol. Too much LDL in the bloodstream helps to create artery-clogging plaque, raising your risk of a heart attack.
        Your cholesterol report (also called a lipid profile or lipid panel) also includes your high-density lipoprotein (HDL); see the table below for recommended values. HDL has long been referred to as ""good"" cholesterol, based on observational studies dating back decades showing that people with high HDL levels are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease.
        However, the scientific understanding of HDL has evolved in the ensuing years, and many cardiologists now believe that HDL may be more of a bystander rather than a ""good guy"" that helps lower heart disease risk. ""Higher HDL levels are closely linked with behaviors like eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise,"" says Dr. Stephen Wiviott, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Talking trash about HDL
        Researchers have also discovered that the way HDL functions and its role in the body are more complex that once believed. ""The analogy that's often used to describe HDL is a garbage truck, because it picks up extra cholesterol, or garbage, from the bloodstream and the arteries and then transports it to the liver, where it's recycled or disposed,"" says Dr. Wiviott. That was the rationale behind the creation of experimental drugs that raised HDL levels dramatically — between 60% and 100%.
        Over the past decade, large clinical trials tested five of these drugs (known as CEPT inhibitors) in people with low HDL levels. But while the drugs reliably raised HDL levels, they didn't achieve the most important goal: preventing heart attacks, strokes, and other complications from clogged arteries. Maybe, the thinking went, it wasn't the number of garbage trucks that mattered but how good they were at picking up trash. That is, maybe the drugs increased the wrong kind of HDL cholesterol.
        It turns out that HDL comes in different shapes and sizes. Some types are spherical, while others are doughnut-shaped. Some types of HDL are great at plucking excess cholesterol from LDL and artery walls (a process referred to as reverse cholesterol transport), while some are not.

        A better garbage truck?
        What if you had an HDL-based drug specifically designed to improve reverse cholesterol transport? Think of it as an empty garbage truck with a better trash compactor. But when investigators tested four weekly infusions of this type of experimental drug on more than 18,200 recent heart attack survivors, it was no better than a placebo in preventing heart attack, stroke, or death, as detailed in a study published May 2, 2024, in The New England Journal of Medicine. ""It's yet another point of reference to suggest that targeting HDL with medications may not be helpful,"" says Dr. Wiviott.
        But these findings shouldn't distract you from focusing on the factors you can control — namely, making sure your LDL is below 100 milligrams per deciliter, or even lower if you have heart disease (see advice about LDL-lowering strategies). That's true even if you have a high HDL level, which shouldn't be considered overly reassuring or a reason to ignore an elevated LDL value, says Dr. Wiviott.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-you-reduce-your-cholesterol-without-taking-a-drug,Can you reduce your cholesterol without taking a drug?,"It's one of the most common questions people ask their doctors: How do I lower my cholesterol? Many of them hope to avoid taking drugs, while others are interested in natural cholesterol-lowering medications, like the Heart Letter reader who wrote to us recently.
        She's an active, slender 76-year-old who follows a heart-friendly diet (mostly organic fruits and vegetables, grains, and lean meats, but no red meat and no alcohol). Her blood pressure and blood sugar levels are normal, but her LDL (""bad"") cholesterol is 157 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), which is considered borderline high.
        In general, there are three main ways to lower LDL to the recommended 100 mg/dL or lower: diet, a dietary supplement, or a prescription medication, such as a statin. Here's how Heart Letter editor in chief Dr. Christopher Cannon counsels patients on this topic.
        Dietary changes
        What many people don't realize is that only about 20% of the cholesterol in your bloodstream comes from your diet — your liver and intestines make the rest. For most people, the cholesterol present in food doesn't have that much of an effect. However, most of the cholesterol in the average person's diet comes from animal-based foods such as meat and dairy, which are also high in saturated fat. Saturated fat clearly raises LDL cholesterol and should be consumed in limited amounts.
        The rest of your diet matters, too. Swap saturated fat for unsaturated fats (such as those found in vegetable oils, avocados, and fatty fish). Eat plenty of plant foods (like vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains — especially oats) that are rich in fiber, which helps lower your cholesterol by making dietary cholesterol harder to absorb from your gut.
        If you eat cheeseburgers and ice cream regularly but then gradually transition to a healthier diet, you're likely to see your LDL level fall. If your diet is already quite healthy (like the reader described above), further tweaks might not make that much of a difference. ""I often tell patients that while some people see modest reductions in their LDL after changing their diet, some do not,"" says Dr. Cannon. Still, a healthy diet has other cardiovascular benefits, even if your LDL doesn't drop very much, he adds. For example, many of the compounds found in whole, unprocessed plant foods help dampen inflammation, discouraging plaque buildup.
        Supplements
        Many dietary supplements sold in the United States claim to benefit heart health. But only three may help drive down LDL cholesterol, and only by a modest amount.
        Psyllium husk. Derived from the seeds of the Plantago ovata plant, this fiber supplement is best known as a treatment for constipation (Metamucil is one familiar brand). The powder is mixed with a liquid to make a thick gel. Psyllium husk or powder is also available in wafers, bars, and capsules. It's thought to absorb bile acids and cholesterol, which are then eliminated from the body during bowel movements. The suggested daily dose is 5 to 10 grams. An April 2024 review article in the journal Nutrients found that taking psyllium daily for a month or two can lower LDL by about 6 points, on average.
        Plant sterols. Found naturally in the cell membranes of plants like nuts, soybeans, peas, and rapeseed (the source of canola oil), these compounds (also call phytosterols) have a structure similar to cholesterol. Eating them helps limit the amount of cholesterol your body can absorb. Manufacturers offer many types of foods with added plant sterols, including margarine (such as Benecol), mayonnaise, bread, breakfast and snack bars, milk, and juice. Phytosterols are also available in capsule form. Some studies show that consuming 2 grams of plant sterols per day for at least eight weeks can lower LDL by up to 10%. However, a recent, carefully controlled four-week trial — the Supplements, Placebo, or Rosuvastatin Trial, or SPORT —  found only a 4.4% LDL reduction from plant sterols.
        Red yeast rice. Made by steaming white rice with the yeast Monascus purpureus, this red-hued extract contains monacolin K, the same active ingredient in the prescription cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin. Some studies suggest that supplements containing 4 milligrams (mg) to 10 mg of monacolin K can lower LDL between 20% and 25%. But SPORT reported a mere 6.6% LDL reduction from red yeast rice.
        ""I have several patients who've been able to lower their LDL a little bit with psyllium, which is a safe, inexpensive product,"" says Dr. Cannon. The problem with the plant sterols and red yeast rice is the same as with all dietary supplements: the amount of active ingredient is not regulated and may vary from batch to batch. If you want to try these products, do so only under a doctor's supervision and use brands tested and vetted by ConsumerLab.com, an independent testing company.
        Statins
        Unlike dietary supplements, drugs in the class known as statins contain a known amount of the active ingredient — a compound that both decreases the amount of cholesterol the body makes and boosts the liver's ability to clear cholesterol from the blood. These drugs can lower LDL between 25% and 55%.
        Note that simply having elevated LDL cholesterol doesn't necessarily mean you should be taking a statin, Dr. Cannon notes. The ultimate goal is to lower your risk of heart disease, and other factors (like your age and other health conditions) affect your risk. He recommends using the American College of Cardiology's risk calculator. The calculator provides treatment advice about managing your LDL and other heart disease risk factors, which you can then discuss with your physician. For our reader, a moderate-intensity statin may be reasonable, according to the calculator's recommendation.
        When people are reluctant to start taking a statin, a coronary calcium score can help them make a more informed decision. Our reader's calcium score is 116, which suggests she has a small amount of plaque in her coronary arteries (see ""Should I get a calcium score?"" in the April 2023 Heart Letter for information about this test). ""But any number above zero means that the person has coronary artery disease,"" Dr. Cannon explains. Anyone with that diagnosis should get their LDL down to 70 or lower, which will prevent additional plaque buildup, he says. For someone with an LDL of 157, a statin is the most effective means to reach that goal.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/increasing-energy-levels-for-sex,Increasing energy levels for sex,"Men want plenty of energy to fully enjoy sex. Yet as men age, many factors can diminish their energy levels and lower their libido and sexual stamina. For instance, muscle mass naturally declines, and the body becomes less efficient at producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy-carrying molecules found in cells. Testosterone levels also diminish, and sleep problems are common, leading to fatigue.
        ""Addressing these issues also can increase energy levels and keep you more active and mentally alert,"" says Dr. Martin Kathrins, director of the Men's Health Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Here's a look at these energy blockers and how to overcome them.
        ATP and muscle mass
        The best ways to increase ATP and muscle mass are with diet and strength training. Foods that contain polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and protein can boost ATP. Favoring plant-based foods, as with the DASH or Mediterranean diet can increase your intake of foods rich in these fatty acids, like fatty fish (salmon), avocados, olive oil, and nuts (almonds, walnuts).
        High-quality protein sources include beans, nuts, soy (soy milk, tofu), and poultry. Another protein source is protein powder from plants (soybeans, peas, rice, or hemp) or milk (casein or whey protein). The powder can be added to a smoothie, stirred into oatmeal, or mixed with water or milk (regular, soy, or almond).
        Strength training helps build muscle mass, which spurs your body to produce more ATP. More muscle mass also increases your basal metabolic rate, the amount of energy your body uses at rest. Like other kinds of physical activity, strength training boosts levels of energy-promoting neurotransmitters in the brain.
        Low testosterone
        Fatigue is a common side effect of male hypogonadism, a condition in which the testicles don't produce enough testosterone, the male sex hormone. On average, testosterone levels drop about 1% each year beginning in a man's late 30s and could fall by as much as 50% by age 70. (A blood test from your doctor can determine if you have low testosterone.)
        Testosterone replacement therapy, which is given via absorbable pellet implants, topical gels, patches, or injections, can often help spark energy and improve libido in men with low levels. Speak with your doctor about whether you should get your testosterone level checked and whether testosterone therapy is appropriate.
        Sleep
        Sleep is divided into two phases: REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep. Non-REM sleep involves three stages. Sleep experts believe that the last non-REM stage (known as deep sleep) plays the greatest role in energy, as it helps the body make ATP.
        Older adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. However, many older adults have trouble falling or staying asleep, which means less time spent in deep sleep and leads to daytime fatigue. Poor sleep also can increase stress levels and interfere with how your body and brain store and use energy.
        Specific problems can interfere with sleep, such as insomnia, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and nocturia (the need to urinate during the night). ""If you have problems sleeping through the night, consult your doctor to determine if you have any of these conditions,"" says Dr. Kathrins.
        Otherwise, practicing good sleep hygiene can help you get a good night's rest. For example, go to bed and get up at the same time every day, including weekends, to keep your sleep/wake cycle synchronized with your circadian rhythms.
        Establish a bedtime ritual where you give yourself an hour before sleep to bathe, brush your teeth, and relax. Use the bed only for sleeping or sex (no TV or electronic devices), and keep your bedroom dark and cool. If you take afternoon naps, keep them under 20 minutes, and don't nap later in the afternoon or within several hours of your regular bedtime.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-vacation-habits-to-continue-all-year,Healthy vacation habits to continue all year,"Picnics, beach outings, dozing in the shade: there's a reason many of us feel our best during summer getaways. But we tend to snap back into our everyday, task-oriented mindset soon after — at the expense of our bodies and minds.
        What if we could keep the best parts of our vacation routines and use them to fuel better health all year long? There are solid reasons to embrace a shift. More than four in 10 cancers are linked to lifestyle choices we can change, such as poor diet and physical inactivity. These risk factors are also among the top contributors to heart disease.
        They're also habits we tend to improve when we're away from the grind, says Dr. Kathryn Corelli, a primary care doctor and women's health specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        ""Vacation is when people take a step back and really give themselves permission and time to focus on what's important to them,"" Dr. Corelli says. ""But when they come back, suddenly those habits sort of snap back too. You lose a lot of those gains, the reasons you felt good.""
        Habits to foster
        Healthy activities we embrace on vacation and neglect the rest of the year tend to fall into two camps — doing more of some things and less of others.
        More time outdoors. Mounting evidence suggests that spending time in nature can improve a wide range of health factors, including blood pressure, by lowering stress and promoting exercise, according to a March 2023 paper in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine. ""Many of my patients spend a lot of time indoors during the year and they feel cooped up, anxious, and stressed,"" Dr. Corelli says. ""When they get outside, they always benefit.""
        More movement. Speaking of exercise, walking, swimming, biking, and hiking can seem far less of a chore when you're doing it for fun. ""Continuing some of those habits — whether going on walks or parking farther away from your destination — can be really powerful in the long term,"" she says.
        Less time online. We gain perspective when we pull back from virtual pursuits, a shift that pays big dividends for mental health. ""We spend a lot of time on screens. But that time takes away from something else, such as sleep or connecting with our kids,"" she says. ""Also, there are a lot of data supporting the idea that comparing ourselves to people online can be bad for anxiety.""
        More varied diet. Vacation food is sometimes overly rich and caloric — think of cruise ship buffets — but can also deviate gloriously from the humdrum by incorporating a wider array of mouth-watering fruits and vegetables and fewer processed foods. ""There's no perfect way to eat,"" Dr. Corelli says, ""but try to eat relatively healthy, unprocessed foods 80% of the time.""
        More dining with others. It's easier to munch more mindfully — which also helps you avoid overeating — when you're enjoying leisurely meals with family and friends instead of dashing off to the next commitment. ""We connect as humans over food; that's been in our cultural DNA for a long time,"" she says. ""People feel closer to family and friends after vacation, and we know socializing can help prevent cognitive decline.""
        More sleep. A significant part of revitalizing simply comes from getting better shuteye, without alarms or insomnia-inducing deadlines. But while those stressors may return, we can be more diligent about practicing good sleep hygiene when vacation ends by avoiding screens for an hour before bed and keeping consistent bed and wake times. ""Those things are really important for continuing the relaxation you've fostered on vacation,"" Dr. Corelli says.
        Novel brain engagement. There's a reason booksellers hawk ""beach reads"" in the summer months: people typically spend more time reading on vacation. Or maybe you while away the afternoons playing board games or completing sudoku or crossword puzzles. ""Think of it like stretching your brain — it's not on autopilot,"" she says. ""Doing this can help protect us from dementia in the long run.""
        Adjustment advice
        Before you plunge back into your everyday routine, Dr. Corelli advocates doing a bit of reflection. This could include devising a list of pros and cons for the things you did on vacation that you'd like to continue.
        ""This can be motivating,"" she says. ""Finding your own reasons for continuing or not continuing a behavior and thinking them through can get lost during our fast-paced everyday life,"" she says.

Many blood pressure medications—especially the commonly prescribed class known as diuretics—can affect your potassium level. But while some diuretics tend to lower potassium levels, others have the opposite effect.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/recognizing-and-easing-the-physical-symptoms-of-anxiety,Recognizing and easing the physical symptoms of anxiety,"Simple strategies can reduce the headaches, upset stomach, and shortness of breath that may be triggered by emotional stress.
        
        
          
        
        You've had headaches on and off, or possibly nausea, or muscle pain. It could be emotions, rather than a physical illness, driving your symptoms.
        Blame your autonomic nervous system. This is a system in your body that you don't consciously control, but that regulates things like your heart rate, breathing, urination, and sexual function. It's also the system that reacts when you are under a physical threat. The autonomic nervous system produces your fight-or-flight response, which is designed to help you defend yourself or run away from danger.
        When you are under stress or anxious, this system kicks into action, and physical symptoms can appear — headaches, nausea, shortness of breath, shakiness, or stomach pain. Doctors see it all the time — patients with real pain or other symptoms, but nothing is physically wrong with them.
        In today's world, many people may be noticing new physical symptoms without realizing what's causing them. For some people, this situation is the start of a vicious cycle. Anxiety and stress themselves produce these physical symptoms, and on top of that your reaction to those symptoms can make them worse. The more you focus on them, the more alarmed you become, and the more intense your symptoms become. It can get really out of control and become so uncomfortable that you might not be able to do much more than sit and worry.
        Identifying and easing anxiety
        It's possible to become so fixated on the physical effects from your anxious state that you don't even realize you were anxious to begin with. So, how do you know if anxiety is causing your symptoms? And if it is, how can you feel better? Here are some tips to help you interrupt this cycle.
        Stop and assess. The first step is to pause for a second and observe what's going on with your body. Think about what you are experiencing and whether it relates to a feeling of emotional upset or a reaction to something alarming or stressful. If your symptoms followed a stressful event or period of time, it's possible these emotions triggered your symptoms. Also, be alert to signs that you are tensing your muscles, which can also indicate a stress reaction.
        Distract yourself. If you suspect anxiety is at the root of your physical symptoms, distraction can be a helpful tool. It's good to build a repertoire of things that can distract you from your focus on your body. Look at a photo album. Do the laundry. Even something as simple as watering the plants or putting together a jigsaw puzzle can help. This can fairly reliably get you out of a cycle of increased anxiety and increased physical symptoms. Very often, once you move on to another activity and take your mind off your symptoms, you'll start to feel better. Distractions are different for each person. Try different activities to figure out what takes your mind to a calm place.
        Relax your body — or work it. To relieve stress, try some deep breathing or relaxation exercises. There are numerous online resources and smartphone apps that can help guide you through relaxation techniques. Physical activity can also help you relieve tension. Try to squeeze in a daily walk or a run.
        Reassure yourself. If you believe your symptoms are being caused by anxiety, reassure yourself that what you are experiencing is not harmful or fatal. They're not serious, and they don't signal an impending medical disaster. The symptoms will pass when the anxiety eases.
        Get checked. There is a difference between anxiety that triggers physical symptoms and physical symptoms that trigger anxiety. For example, people who are having an asthma attack and therefore having trouble breathing will likely feel anxious. But anxiety is not causing their shortness of breath. If you have a physical problem that does not resolve with relaxation or other techniques, contact your doctor to have it checked out.
        Know when to seek help. Simple anxiety sometimes crosses the line and becomes an anxiety disorder. Signs that you might have a problem include shying away from activities because you are fearful, or being so preoccupied with worry that it affects your ability to function. If this sounds like you, it's time to seek some help. Anxiety disorders are very treatable using a variety of different approaches.

        Validation teaches your children that feeling and expressing their emotions is okay.
        ""When parents use validation, they are affirming to their child that it's fine to feel emotions and they should not be suppressed,"" says Dr. Chase Samsel with the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Harvard-affiliated Boston Children's Hospital. ""It shows them you understand their feelings and point of view, and it establishes trust. This, in turn, can help a child feel supported and open to discussing solutions.""
        Start with acknowledgement
        Acknowledge their emotions with comments like, ""It sounds like you are frustrated or angry,"" or ""I can see that you've had a tough day at school.""
        But which emotion — or emotions — is your child feeling? ""It can be difficult for parents to recognize the genuine emotion their child is battling,"" says Dr. Samsel. ""Many times, kids have an emotional reaction but can't explain what's going on, or don't want to, or express various emotions at once.""
        Other times, different emotions lie underneath the one being shown. This is especially common among teenagers where they display anger, but often the real emotion is fear, anxiety, or sadness. ""In these incidences, just recognizing they are going through something difficult is enough,"" says Dr. Samsel.
        Practice validation often
        A child may not respond to validation at first — they may not want to talk about their emotions or may ignore your interest. But consistent validation will eventually pay off.
        ""By repeating validation when emotional crises arise, the child soon will become more comfortable expressing their emotion,"" says Dr. Samsel. ""Once they recognize that their parents welcome this and will not be reprimanded, they will be open to sharing details.""
        Building a coping skills toolbox
        Coping skills are ways parents can teach their children to manage emotional problems when they arise.
        Try a breathing exercise together
        Breathing exercises are a popular strategy, as they are easy to learn and quick to use. Dr. Samsel recommends any of the following: three-part breathing, ujjayi breathing, and belly breathing.
        Other coping skills include guided meditation, visualization, squeezing a ball for stress relief, taking a walk or playing outside, and reading together (ideal for preschool and elementary-age children).
        ""Sometimes just giving children alone time in their room or ""taking space"" works well,"" says Dr. Samsel.
        Tap into coping skills yourself
        It's also vital for parents to adopt these strategies when dealing with their own emotions, says Dr. Samsel. Not only will this help you feel calmer, but it's a great way to model that coping skills help everyone — adults, too!
        For example, try telling your kids when you feel upset or frustrated about something that happens during your day. Announce that you plan to take a walk to de-stress or do a breathing exercise. Later, share your strategies for problem-solving.
        ""Kids watch what their parents do and will often mimic their behavior,"" says Dr. Samsel. ""If they see you constructively working through your emotions, they will be more open to doing the same.""
        Be flexible
        Never insist on having older kids use a coping mechanism, even when situations call for it. That could feel like punishment and trigger an automatic resistance.
        Instead, Dr. Samsel suggests parents expose their children to different types of coping skills and then let them decide which ones they want to try. ""They may need to experiment to find techniques they can easily follow and that work for them,"" says Dr. Samsel.",Matthew Solan,"July 24, 2024",1

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/9-ways-to-banish-dry-skin,9 ways to banish dry skin,"Simple and inexpensive ways to moisturize itchy, dry skin
        Dry skin occurs when skin doesn't retain sufficient moisture. This can happen as a result of frequent bathing, use of harsh soaps, aging, or certain medical conditions. And for those in colder climates, it can stem from cold, dry winter air.
        During winter months in the Northern Hemisphere, you may suffer from red, rough, raw, and itchy skin. This is because cold winter air means low humidity, both outdoors and indoors. The water content of the epidermis (the outermost layer of skin) tends to reflect the level of humidity around it. Fortunately, there are many simple and inexpensive things you can do to relieve winter dry skin, also known as winter itch or winter xerosis.
        Even if you live in a part of the world where cold winter air is not currently — or ever — a concern, most people will need to manage dry skin at some point. These tips for keeping skin soft and healthy can help all who battle dry skin, from chilly New England to balmy Hawaii and beyond.
        Keeping moisture in the skin
        Skin moisturizers, which rehydrate the top layer of skin cells and seal in the moisture, are the first step in combating dry skin. They contain three main types of ingredients. Humectants, which help attract moisture, include ceramides (pronounced ser-A-mids), glycerin, sorbitol, hyaluronic acid, and lecithin. Another set of ingredients — for example, petrolatum (petroleum jelly), silicone, lanolin, and mineral oil — helps seal that moisture within the skin. Emollients, such as linoleic, linolenic, and lauric acids, smooth skin by filling in the spaces between skin cells.
        In general, the thicker and greasier a moisturizer, the more effective it will be. Some of the most effective (and least expensive) are petroleum jelly and moisturizing oils (such as mineral oil). Because they contain no water, they're best used while the skin is still damp from bathing, to seal in the moisture. Other moisturizers contain water as well as oil, in varying proportions. These are less greasy and may be more cosmetically appealing than petroleum jelly or oils.
        What can you do about dry skin?
        Here are some ways to combat dry skin that are effective if practiced consistently:
        
          Use a humidifier in the winter. Set it to around 60%, a level that should be sufficient to replenish the top layer of the skin.
          Limit yourself to one 5- to 10-minute bath or shower daily. If you bathe more than that, you may strip away much of the skin's oily layer and cause it to lose moisture. Use lukewarm rather than hot water, which can wash away natural oils.
          Minimize your use of soaps; if necessary, choose moisturizing preparations such as Dove, Olay, and Basis, or consider soap-free cleansers like Cetaphil, Oilatum-AD, and Aquanil. Steer clear of deodorant soaps, perfumed soaps, and alcohol products, which can strip away natural oils.
          To avoid damaging the skin, stay away from bath sponges, scrub brushes, and washcloths. If you don't want to give them up altogether, be sure to use a light touch. For the same reason, pat or blot (don't rub) the skin when toweling dry.
          Apply moisturizer immediately after bathing or washing your hands. This helps plug the spaces between your skin cells and seal in moisture while your skin is still damp.
          To reduce the greasy feel of petroleum jelly and thick creams, rub a small amount into your hands and then rub it over the affected areas until neither your hands nor the affected areas feel greasy.
          Never, ever scratch. Most of the time, a moisturizer can control the itch. You can also use a cold pack or compress to relieve itchy spots.
          Use fragrance-free laundry detergents and avoid fabric softeners.
          Avoid wearing wool and other irritating garments next to your skin.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side,Blue light has a dark side,"What is blue light? The effect blue light has on your sleep and more.
        
          
        
        Although it is environmentally friendly, blue light can affect your sleep and potentially cause disease. Until the advent of artificial lighting, the sun was the major source of lighting, and people spent their evenings in (relative) darkness. Now, in much of the world, evenings are illuminated, and we take our easy access to all those lumens pretty much for granted.
        But we may be paying a price for basking in all that light. At night, light throws the body's biological clock—the circadian rhythm—out of whack. Sleep suffers. Worse, research shows that it may contribute to the causation of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.
        What is blue light?
        Not all colors of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths—which are beneficial during daylight hours because they boost attention, reaction times, and mood—seem to be the most disruptive at night. And the proliferation of electronics with screens, as well as energy-efficient lighting, is increasing our exposure to blue wavelengths, especially after sundown.
        Light and sleep
        Everyone has slightly different circadian rhythms, but the average length is 24 and one-quarter hours. The circadian rhythm of people who stay up late is slightly longer, while the rhythms of earlier birds fall short of 24 hours. Dr. Charles Czeisler of Harvard Medical School showed, in 1981, that daylight keeps a person's internal clock aligned with the environment.
        Is nighttime light exposure bad?
        Some studies suggest a link between exposure to light at night, such as working the night shift, to diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. That's not proof that nighttime light exposure causes these conditions; nor is it clear why it could be bad for us.
        Exposure to light suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences circadian rhythms. Even dim light can interfere with a person's circadian rhythm and melatonin secretion. A mere eight lux—a level of brightness exceeded by most table lamps and about twice that of a night light—has an effect. Light at night is part of the reason so many people don't get enough sleep, and researchers have linked short sleep to increased risk for depression, as well as diabetes and cardiovascular problems.
        Effects of blue light and sleep
        While light of any kind can suppress the secretion of melatonin, blue light at night does so more powerfully. Harvard researchers and their colleagues conducted an experiment comparing the effects of 6.5 hours of exposure to blue light to exposure to green light of comparable brightness. The blue light suppressed melatonin for about twice as long as the green light and shifted circadian rhythms by twice as much (3 hours vs. 1.5 hours).
        In another study of blue light, researchers at the University of Toronto compared the melatonin levels of people exposed to bright indoor light who were wearing blue-light–blocking goggles to people exposed to regular dim light without wearing goggles. The fact that the levels of the hormone were about the same in the two groups strengthens the hypothesis that blue light is a potent suppressor of melatonin. It also suggests that shift workers and night owls could perhaps protect themselves if they wore eyewear that blocks blue light. Inexpensive sunglasses with orange-tinted lenses block blue light, but they also block other colors, so they're not suitable for use indoors at night. Glasses that block out only blue light can cost up to $80.
        LED blue light exposure
        If blue light does have adverse health effects, then environmental concerns, and the quest for energy-efficient lighting, could be at odds with personal health. Those curlicue compact fluorescent lightbulbs and LED lights are much more energy-efficient than the old-fashioned incandescent lightbulbs we grew up with. But they also tend to produce more blue light.
        The physics of fluorescent lights can't be changed, but coatings inside the bulbs can be so they produce a warmer, less blue light. LED lights are more efficient than fluorescent lights, but they also produce a fair amount of light in the blue spectrum. Richard Hansler, a light researcher at John Carroll University in Cleveland, notes that ordinary incandescent lights also produce some blue light, although less than most fluorescent lightbulbs.
        Protect yourself from blue light at night
        
          Use dim red lights for night lights. Red light is less likely to shift circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin.
          Avoid looking at bright screens beginning two to three hours before bed.
          If you work a night shift or use a lot of electronic devices at night, consider wearing blue-blocking glasses or installing an app that filters the blue/green wavelength at night.
          Expose yourself to lots of bright light during the day, which will boost your ability to sleep at night, as well as your mood and alertness during daylight.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/does-exercising-at-night-affect-sleep,Does exercising at night affect sleep?,"On call
        
          
        
        
          Q.
          I have heard that you should not exercise at night because it can cause sleep problems. Is this true?
        
        A. Traditionally, experts have recommended not exercising at night as part of good sleep hygiene. However, a small study, published in Sports Medicine suggests that some people can exercise in the evening as long as they avoid vigorous activity for at least one hour before bedtime.
        The researchers examined 23 studies that evaluated sleep onset and quality in healthy adults who performed a single session of evening exercise compared with similar adults who did not. They found that not only did evening exercise not affect sleep, it seemed to help people fall asleep faster and spend more time in deep sleep. However, those who did high-intensity exercise — such as interval training — less than one hour before bedtime took longer to fall asleep and had poorer sleep quality.
        Despite the findings in this particular study, I generally recommend against strenuous physical activity for at least two hours before getting into bed.
        In addition to regular exercise, you can help achieving quality sleep by doing the following:
        
          
            Set a regular bedtime and adopt a relaxing bedtime routine.
          
          
            Turn off devices that give off light, such as the TV, computer, and phone, at least 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime.
          
          
            Be sure your bed is comfortable and your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.
          
          
            Don't take long naps during the day. If you need a nap, restrict it to 20 to 30 minutes in the early afternoon.
          
          
            If you can't fall asleep after 15 to 20 minutes, go to another room. Read quietly with a dim light until you feel sleepy.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fish-oil-friend-or-foe-201307126467,Fish oil: friend or foe?,"The answer is more friend than foe when the fish oil comes from food sources rather than supplements.
        
          Omega-3s in balance
        
        What's so special about fish oil? It's loaded with omega-3 fatty acids. These must come from food, since our bodies can't make them.
        The two-key omega-3 fatty acids are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are rich in these omega-3s. Some plants are rich in another type of omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid, which the body can convert to DHA and EPA. Good sources of these are flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and canola oil.
        Omega-3 fatty acids play important roles in brain function, normal growth and development, and inflammation. Deficiencies have been linked to a variety of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, some cancers, mood disorders, arthritis, and more. But that doesn't mean taking high doses translates to better health and disease prevention.
        Fish oil supplements have been promoted as easy way to protect the heart, ease inflammation, improve mental health, and lengthen life. Such claims are one reason why Americans spend more than $1 billion a year on over-the-counter fish oil. And food companies are adding it to milk, yogurt, cereal, chocolate, cookies, juice, and hundreds of other foods.
        But the evidence for improving heart health is mixed. In November 2018, a study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine found that omega-3 fatty acid supplements did nothing to reduce heart attacks, strokes, or deaths from heart disease in middle-age men and women without any known risk factors for heart disease. Earlier research reported in the same journal in 2013 also reported no benefit in people with risk factors for heart disease.
        However, when researchers looked at subgroups of people who don't eat any fish, the results suggested they may reduce their cardiovascular risk by taking a fish oil supplement.
        Evidence linking fish oil and cancer has been all over the map. Most research, including the 2018 study cited above, has not shown any decreased risk of cancer. However, some earlier research suggested diets high in fatty fish or fish oil supplements might reduce the risk of certain cancers.
        
          Take home message
        
        How food, and its component molecules, affect the body is largely a mystery. That makes the use of supplements for anything other than treating a deficiency questionable.
        Despite this one study, you should still consider eating fish and other seafood as a healthy strategy. If we could absolutely, positively say that the benefits of eating seafood comes entirely from omega-3 fats, then downing fish oil pills would be an alternative to eating fish. But it's more than likely that you need the entire orchestra of fish fats, vitamins, minerals, and supporting molecules, rather than the lone notes of EPA and DHA.
        The same holds true of other foods. Taking even a handful of supplements is no substitute for wealth of nutrients you get from eating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
        What should you do if you currently take fish oil? If your doctor prescribed them—they are an approved and effective treatment for people with high blood triglyceride levels—follow his or her instructions until you can have a conversation about fish oil.
        If you are taking them on your own because you believe they are good for you, it's time to rethink that strategy. If you don't eat fish or other seafood, you might benefit from a fish oil supplement. Also, you can get omega-3s from ground flaxseed or flaxseed oil, chia seeds, walnuts, canola oil, and soy oil. One to two servings per day can help you avoid a deficiency of omega-3s.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-metabolism,The truth about metabolism,"You no doubt have heard of metabolism and may even have a vague idea of what it is. But there are a lot of myths related to the impact metabolism has on your health, especially in terms of weight loss.
        In simple terms, metabolism is the internal process by which your body expends energy and burns calories. It runs 24/7 to keep your body moving, even when you're resting or sleeping, by converting the food and nutrients you consume into the energy your body needs in order to breathe, circulate blood, grow and repair cells, and everything else it does to survive.
        This process works at different intensities in different people. How fast your metabolism works is determined mostly by your genes.
        People might have fast, slow, or average metabolism, regardless of their body size and composition.
        Age also affects metabolism, as it can slow over the years, even if you start out with a fast metabolism. Differences in metabolism speed are evident in how easy or hard it is for people to gain or lose weight. A slow metabolism burns fewer calories, which means more get stored as fat in the body; that's why some people have difficulty losing weight by just cutting calories. A fast metabolism burns calories at a quicker rate, which explains why some people can eat a lot and not gain extra pounds.
        But you can't entirely blame a sluggish metabolism for weight gain. The reality is that metabolism often plays a minor role. The greatest factors as you age are often poor diet and inactivity.
        Rev up your engine
        Is it possible to speed up a naturally slow metabolism, or rev up one that has become sluggish over time? You can manipulate your metabolism to a degree. It is often a small change that may help you burn more calories. That, along with adopting a healthier diet and making sure you get enough exercise, may give people the extra push they need to lose and maintain weight. For example:
        Pick up the pace. Add some high-intensity interval training to your regular routine. After a period of interval training, your metabolism can stay revved up for as much as a full day. For example, when you're walking or jogging on a treadmill or outside, speed up for 30 to 60 seconds, and then slow to your usual pace; repeat the cycle for eight to 12 minutes.
        Eat protein and do weight training. Your metabolism increases whenever you eat, digest, and store food, a process called thermic effect of food. Protein has a higher thermic effect compared with fats and carbohydrates because it takes longer for your body to burn protein and absorb it.
        It's not clear how much of an effect protein has on metabolism, but studies suggest the best approach is to combine adequate protein intake with weight training, which increases muscle mass — and that also can boost metabolism. Use this online calculator to determine your exact daily amount of protein: /dri.
        Drink green tea. Studies have found green tea contains a compound called epigallocatechin gallate, which may increase the calories and fat you burn. A meta-analysis published in Obesity Reviews found that consuming about 250 milligrams of epigallocatechin gallate (the amount in about three cups of green tea) helped boost metabolism enough to burn an average of 100 extra calories a day.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/becoming-a-vegetarian,Becoming a vegetarian,"People become vegetarians for many reasons, including health, religious convictions, concerns about animal welfare or the use of antibiotics and hormones in livestock, or a desire to eat in a way that avoids excessive use of environmental resources. Some people follow a largely vegetarian diet because they can't afford to eat meat. Becoming a vegetarian has become more appealing and accessible, thanks to the year-round availability of fresh produce, more vegetarian dining options, and the growing culinary influence of cultures with largely plant-based diets.
        Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating. Nowadays, plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses. According to the American Dietetic Association, ""appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.""
        ""Appropriately planned"" is the operative term. Unless you follow recommended guidelines on nutrition, fat consumption, and weight control, becoming a vegetarian won't necessarily be good for you. A diet of soda, cheese pizza, and candy, after all, is technically ""vegetarian."" For health, it's important to make sure that you eat a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It's also vital to replace saturated and trans fats with good fats, such as those found in nuts, olive oil, and canola oil. And always keep in mind that if you eat too many calories, even from nutritious, low-fat, plant-based foods, you'll gain weight. So it's also important to practice portion control, read food labels, and engage in regular physical activity.
        You can get many of the health benefits of being vegetarian without going all the way. For example, a Mediterranean eating pattern — known to be associated with longer life and reduced risk of several chronic illnesses — features an emphasis on plant foods with a sparing use of meat. Even if you don't want to become a complete vegetarian, you can steer your diet in that direction with a few simple substitutions, such as plant-based sources of protein — beans or tofu, for example — or fish instead of meat a couple of times a week.
        Only you can decide whether a vegetarian diet is right for you. If better health is your goal, here are some things to consider.
        
          
            
              
                Varieties of vegetarians
                Strictly speaking, vegetarians are people who don't eat meat, poultry, or seafood. But people with many different dietary patterns call themselves vegetarians, including the following:
                Vegans (total vegetarians): Do not eat meat, poultry, fish, or any products derived from animals, including eggs, dairy products, and gelatin.
                Lacto-ovo vegetarians: Do not eat meat, poultry, or fish, but do eat eggs and dairy products.
                Lacto vegetarians: Eat no meat, poultry, fish, or eggs, but do consume dairy products.
                Ovo vegetarians: Eat no meat, poultry, fish, or dairy products, but do eat eggs.
                Partial vegetarians: Avoid meat but may eat fish (pesco-vegetarian, pescatarian) or poultry (pollo-vegetarian).
              
            
          
        
        Can becoming a vegetarian protect you against major diseases?
        Maybe. Compared with meat eaters, vegetarians tend to consume less saturated fat and cholesterol and more vitamins C and E, dietary fiber, folic acid, potassium, magnesium, and phytochemicals (plant chemicals), such as carotenoids and flavonoids. As a result, they're likely to have lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and lower body mass index (BMI), all of which are associated with longevity and a reduced risk for many chronic diseases.
        But there still aren't enough data to say exactly how a vegetarian diet influences long-term health. It's difficult to tease out the influence of vegetarianism from other practices that vegetarians are more likely to follow, such as not smoking, not drinking excessively, and getting adequate exercise. But here's what some of the research has shown so far:
        Heart disease. There's some evidence that vegetarians have a lower risk for cardiac events (such as a heart attack) and death from cardiac causes. In one of the largest studies — a combined analysis of data from five prospective studies involving more than 76,000 participants published several years ago — vegetarians were, on average, 25% less likely to die of heart disease. This result confirmed earlier findings from studies comparing vegetarian and nonvegetarian Seventh-day Adventists (members of this religious group avoid caffeine and don't drink or smoke; about 40% are vegetarians). In another study involving 65,000 people in the Oxford cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Oxford), researchers found a 19% lower risk of death from heart disease among vegetarians. However, there were few deaths in either group, so the observed differences may have been due to chance.
        For heart protection, it's best to choose high-fiber whole grains and legumes, which are digested slowly and have a low glycemic index — that is, they help keep blood sugar levels steady. Soluble fiber also helps reduce cholesterol levels. Refined carbohydrates and starches like potatoes, white rice, and white-flour products cause a rapid rise in blood sugar, which increases the risk of heart attack and diabetes (a risk factor for heart disease).
        Nuts are also heart-protective. They have a low glycemic index and contain many antioxidants, vegetable protein, fiber, minerals, and healthy fatty acids. The downside: nuts pack a lot of calories, so restrict your daily intake to a small handful (about an ounce). The upside: because of their fat content, even a small amount of nuts can satisfy the appetite.
        Walnuts, in particular, are a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have many health benefits. Even so, fish are the best source of omega-3s.
        Cancer. Many studies suggest that eating lots of fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of developing certain cancers, and there's evidence that vegetarians have a lower incidence of cancer than nonvegetarians do. But the differences aren't large. A vegetarian diet can make it easier to get the recommended minimum of five daily servings of fruits and vegetables, but a purely vegetarian diet is not necessarily better than a plant-based diet that also includes fish or poultry.
        If you stop eating red meat (whether or not you become a vegetarian), you'll eliminate a potential risk factor for colon cancer. It's not clear whether avoiding all animal products reduces the risk further. Vegetarians usually have lower levels of potentially carcinogenic substances in their colons, but studies comparing cancer rates in vegetarians and nonvegetarians have shown inconsistent results.
        Type 2 diabetes. Research suggests that a predominantly plant-based diet can reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes. In studies of Seventh-day Adventists, vegetarians' risk of developing diabetes was half that of nonvegetarians, even after taking BMI into account. The Harvard-based Women's Health Study found a similar correlation between eating red meat (especially processed meats, such as bacon and hot dogs) and diabetes risk, after adjusting for BMI, total calorie intake, and exercise.
        What about bone health?
        Some women are reluctant to try a vegetarian diet — especially one that doesn't include calcium-rich dairy products — because they're concerned about osteoporosis. Lacto-ovo vegetarians (see ""Varieties of vegetarians"") consume at least as much calcium as meat-eaters, but vegans typically consume less. In the EPIC-Oxford study, 75% of vegans got less than the recommended daily amount of calcium. But vegans who consumed at least 525 milligrams of calcium per day were not especially vulnerable to fractures.
        Certain vegetables can supply calcium, including bok choy, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, collards, and kale. (Spinach and Swiss chard, which also contain calcium, are not such good choices, because along with the calcium they have oxalates, which make it harder for the body to absorb calcium.) Moreover, the high potassium and magnesium content of fruits and vegetables reduces blood acidity, lowering the urinary excretion of calcium.
        People who follow a vegetarian diet and especially a vegan diet may be at risk of getting insufficient vitamin D and vitamin K, both needed for bone health. Green leafy vegetables contain some vitamin K. To boost vitamin D intake, vegans may also need to rely on fortified foods, including some types of soy milk, rice milk, organic orange juice, and breakfast cereals. They may also want to consider taking a vitamin D supplement.
        What about the health risks of being vegetarian?
        Concerns about vegetarian diets have focused mainly on the following nutrients:
        Protein. Research shows that lacto-ovo vegetarians generally get the recommended daily amount of protein, which is easily obtained from dairy products and eggs. (Women need about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. Because the protein in vegetables is somewhat different from animal protein, vegans may need 0.45 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day.) There are many plant sources that can help vegans meet their protein needs, including peas, beans, lentils, chickpeas, seeds, nuts, soy products, and whole grains (for example, wheat, oats, barley, and brown rice).
        Vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is found only in animal products, but those products include dairy foods and eggs, so most vegetarians get all they need. If you avoid animal products altogether, you should eat foods fortified with vitamin B12 (certain soy and rice beverages and breakfast cereals) or take a vitamin B12 supplement to avoid a deficiency, which can cause neurological problems and pernicious anemia.
        Iron. Studies show that in Western countries, vegetarians tend to get the same amount of iron as meat eaters. But the iron in meat (especially red meat) is more readily absorbed than the kind found in plant foods, known as non-heme iron. The absorption of non-heme iron is enhanced by vitamin C and other acids found in fruits and vegetables, but it may be inhibited by the phytic acid in whole grains, beans, lentils, seeds, and nuts.
        Zinc. Phytic acid in whole grains, seeds, beans, and legumes also reduces zinc absorption, but vegetarians in Western countries do not appear to be zinc-deficient.
        Omega-3 fatty acids. Diets that include no fish or eggs are low in EPA and DHA. Our bodies can convert ALA in plant foods to EPA and DHA, but not very efficiently. Vegans can get DHA from algae supplements, which increase blood levels of DHA as well as EPA (by a process called retroversion). DHA-fortified breakfast bars and soy milk are also available. Good ALA sources include flaxseed, walnuts, canola oil, and soy.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/is-extra-virgin-olive-oil-extra-healthy,Is extra-virgin olive oil extra healthy?,"Q.
          I know olive oil is part of a heart-healthy diet, but is extra-virgin olive oil healthier than regular olive oil?
        
        A. Many studies continue to confirm the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, which cuts the risk of heart disease and stroke. The diet's nutritional benefits probably come from various sources, but the generous use of olive oil appears to be a key contributor.
        Regardless of the type, olive oil is high in monounsaturated fatty acids, containing about 75% by volume. When substituted for saturated fat, monounsaturated fats help lower your ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. The health benefits of olive oil have been attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In fact, observational studies have shown a link between lower risks of cardiovascular disease, some cancers, and even dementia in people who consume higher amounts of olive oil than those who use little or none.
        Still, extra-virgin olive oil does offer something extra that regular olive oil does not. Extra-virgin olive oil is pressed mechanically from ripe olives and processed without high heat or chemical solvents. This protects chemicals in the oil called phenols. In contrast, regular, highly processed olive oils lose these chemicals. Small laboratory-based experiments suggest that higher concentrations of phenols may provide extra antioxidant effects. Even so, there are no definitive studies that show extra-virgin olive oil has a greater ability than refined oil to prevent heart problems, cancer or other diseases.
        Keep in mind that olive oil is not the sole healthy ingredient in a Mediterranean diet. Think of it as just one aspect of the Mediterranean style of eating, which includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and nuts; whole grains; and limited amounts of red meat.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/do-tattoos-cause-lymphoma-202407193059,Do tattoos cause lymphoma?,"Not so long ago, a friend texted me from a coffee shop. He said, ""I can't believe it. I'm the only one here without a tattoo!"" That might not seem surprising: a quick glance around practically anywhere people gather shows that tattoos are widely popular.

Nearly one-third of adults in the US have a tattoo, according to a Pew Research Center survey, including more than half of women ages 18 to 49. These numbers have increased dramatically over the last 20 years: around 21% of US adults in 2012 and 16% of adults in 2003 reported having at least one tattoo.

If you're among them, some recent headlines may have you worried:

              Study Finds That Tattoos Can Increase Your Risk of Lymphoma (OnlyMyHealth)

              Getting a Tattoo Puts You At Higher Risk of Cancer, Claims Study (NDTV)

              Inky waters: Tattoos increase risk of lymphoma by over 20%, study says (Local12.com)

              Shocking study reveals tattoos may increase risk of lymphoma by 20% (Fox News)

What study are they talking about? And how concerned should you be? Let's go through it together. One thing is clear: there's much more to this story than the headlines.

Why are researchers studying a possible link between tattoos and lymphoma?

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system, a network of vessels and lymph nodes that twines throughout the body. With about 90,000 newly diagnosed cases a year, lymphoma is one of the most common types of cancer.

Risk factors for it include:


	advancing age
	certain infections (such as Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, and hepatitis C)
	exposure to certain chemicals (such as benzene, or possibly pesticides)
	family history of lymphoma
	exposure to radiation (such as nuclear reactor accidents or after radiation therapy)
	having an impaired immune system
	certain immune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's disease, or celiac disease).


Tattoos are not known to be a cause or risk factor for lymphoma. But there are several reasons to wonder if there might be a connection:


	Ink injected under the skin to create a tattoo contains several chemicals classified as carcinogenic (cancer causing).
	Pigment from tattoo ink can be found in enlarged lymph nodes within weeks of getting a tattoo.
	Immune cells in the skin can react to the chemicals in tattoo ink and travel to nearby lymph nodes, triggering a bodywide immune reaction.
	Other triggers of lymphoma, such as pesticides, have a similar effect on immune cells in lymph nodes.


Is there a connection between tattoos and lymphoma?

Any potential connection between tattoos and lymphoma has not been well studied. I could find only two published studies exploring the possibility, and neither found evidence of a compelling link.

The first study compared 737 people with the most common type of lymphoma (called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) with otherwise similar people who did not have lymphoma. The researchers found no significant difference in the frequency of tattoos between the two groups.

A study published in May 2024 — the one that triggered the scary headlines above — was larger. It compared 1,398 people ages 20 to 60 who had lymphoma with 4,193 people who did not have lymphoma but who were otherwise similar. The study found that


	lymphoma was 21% more common among those with tattoos
	lymphoma risk varied depending on how much time had passed since getting the tattoo:
	
		within two years, lymphoma risk was 81% higher
		between three and 10 years, no definite increased lymphoma risk was detected
		11 or more years after getting a tattoo, lymphoma risk was 19%
	
	


There was no correlation between the size or number of tattoos and lymphoma risk.

What else should you know about the study?

Importantly, nearly all of the differences in rates of lymphoma between people with and without tattoos were not statistically significant. That means the reported link between lymphoma and tattoos is questionable — and quite possibly observed by chance. In fact, some of the other findings argue against a connection, such as the lack of a link between size or number of tattoos and lymphoma risk.

In addition, if tattoos significantly increase a person's risk of developing lymphoma, we might expect lymphoma rates in the US to be rising along with the popularity of tattoos. Yet that's not the case.

Finally, a study like this one (called an association study) cannot prove that a potential trigger of disease (in this case, tattoos) actually caused the disease (lymphoma). There may be other factors (called confounders) that are more common among people who have tattoos, and those factors might account for the higher lymphoma risk.

Do tattoos come with other health risks?

While complication rates from reputable and appropriately certified tattooists are low, there are health risks associated with tattoos:


	infection, including bacterial skin infections or viral hepatitis
	allergic reactions to the ink
	scarring
	rarely, skin cancer (melanoma and other types of skin cancer).


The bottom line

Despite headlines suggesting a link between tattoos and the risk of lymphoma, there's no convincing evidence it's true. We'll need significantly more research to say much more than that. In the meantime, there are more important health concerns to worry about and much better ways for all of us to reduce cancer risk.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","July 19, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/exposure-therapy-what-is-it-and-how-can-it-help,Exposure therapy: What is it and how can it help?,"Exposure therapy is a way to help people conquer their fears, stress, or anxiety. Exposure therapy has been scientifically proven to be a safe and effective treatment for a variety of psychological issues.
        What is exposure therapy?
        Exposure therapy is a type of psychological therapy used to help people overcome problems such as phobias, panic attacks, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It involves exposing a person, in a safe environment, to the object, activity, or situation that they fear or struggle with.
        When people are afraid of something, they tend to avoid it. While this may work in the short term, over time the fear may become worse and negatively impact a person's life.
        Exposure therapy is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. It can help break the cycle of avoidance and fear.
        Who might benefit from exposure therapy?
        Exposure therapy has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for people of all ages, including children and teenagers, in helping them overcome their fears.
        Examples of people who may benefit from exposure therapy are veterans with combat-related PTSD, adults with anxiety disorders including specific phobias, and children who have experienced traumatic events.
        What to expect from exposure therapy
        Exposure therapy starts with a provider learning more about you and what you are afraid of. You'll typically meet with the therapist once a week for several weeks to a few months, usually averaging between eight and 12 sessions.
        There are several different types of exposure therapy that can be used, based on your need and circumstances.
        Real exposure involves directly facing the object, situation, or activity that you are afraid of. The exposure starts gradually and is slowly increased. For example, someone with a fear of spiders may be shown a live spider across the room, then asked to observe it up close, and eventually may be encouraged to handle it.
        Imagined exposure involves imagining the object, situation, or activity that you fear. For example, a veteran may be asked to remember and describe the sights and sounds of being in combat.
        Simulation exposure involves using virtual reality technology to simulate what you are afraid of. It's used when real exposure is not possible, such as for people with a fear of flying on planes.
        Sensation awareness, also called interoceptive exposure, involves creating physical sensations that are harmless but feared. For example, the provider may ask someone who gets panic attacks to run on a treadmill to make their heart rate go up, to show them that this sensation is not dangerous.
        Prolonged exposure is therapy that is provided more slowly, over a period of several months, so that a person has time to accept the exposure and sufficiently process the experience. This type of exposure therapy is often used to treat PTSD. It is not typically used for other anxiety disorders.
        Exposure therapy is sometimes combined with relaxation exercises, to help associate a feared object or situation with relaxation.
        Benefits of exposure therapy
        Untreated fear, stress, or anxiety can have a profound impact on your quality of life.
        Exposure therapy can help in several ways. Over time, it can help weaken the negative association you previously had with something you feared.
        Exposure therapy can also show that you are capable of confronting your fears and managing your anxiety. It can restore a feeling of power and control that comes from facing and overcoming your fears or negative circumstances.
        Exposure therapy can result in significant symptom reduction, with benefits continuing for years after treatment.
        Which mental health professionals practice exposure therapy?
        Not all therapists or counselors are trained in, or provide, exposure therapy. Licensed psychologists (PhD or PsyD), licensed professional counselors (LPC), or licensed clinical social workers (LCSW) can all deliver exposure therapy.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","July 15, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/what-is-malaise,What is malaise?,"Have you ever felt a vague sense of discomfort or unease without being able to pinpoint exactly why? That feeling is known as malaise. It's a general term used to describe feeling tired, weak, or generally unwell.

What is malaise?

Malaise is a French word that translates to ""discomfort"" or ""unease."" In medical terms, it refers to a feeling of overall weakness or discomfort.

According to Dr. Robert Shmerling, Senior Faculty Editor at Harvard Health Publishing and former Clinical Chief of the Division of Rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, malaise can be difficult to describe because the symptoms are nonspecific.

""I define malaise as a sense of feeling generally unwell. People with malaise often find it hard to put into words. They may describe a vague sick feeling, or a sense that they're 'coming down with something.' It's often accompanied by feeling tired, but not always,"" Dr. Shmerling explains.

Malaise can vary in intensity. For some it might be a mild sense of tiredness, while for others it can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities. It is not a disease or condition in and of itself, but rather a symptom that something else is going on in the body. Because it is so general, it can be challenging to diagnose the exact cause of malaise without further medical investigation.

Common causes of malaise

Malaise is often one of the first signs that something is wrong in the body, even if other specific symptoms have not yet appeared. ""I would never start out assuming it's 'nothing' or 'imagined' or 'just stress' or 'just getting older.' The symptom should be taken as seriously as any other and evaluated appropriately,"" says Dr. Shmerling.

Malaise can result from a wide range of causes, from infections to chronic diseases and even lifestyle factors. Here are some common causes:

Infections. Viral and bacterial infections, such as colds and flu and COVID-19, can cause malaise. It is often the body's initial response to fighting off an infection.

Chronic diseases. Conditions such as diabetes, anemia, and heart disease can lead to feelings of malaise due to the ongoing stress they place on the body.

Mental health issues. Depression, anxiety, and stress can contribute to malaise. These conditions can drain your energy and make you feel generally unwell.

Medications. Some medications have side effects that can include malaise. If you start feeling unwell after beginning a new medication, tell your doctor.

Nutritional deficiencies. Not consuming enough of essential nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, can cause malaise. For example, deficiencies in vitamin D or iron are well-known causes of fatigue and general weakness.

Sleep disorders. Conditions like insomnia or sleep apnea can prevent you from getting enough restorative sleep, leading to feelings of malaise.

Lifestyle factors. Poor diet, lack of exercise, and inadequate sleep can all contribute to feeling unwell, which can worsen malaise. Our bodies need balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, proper hydration, and adequate sleep to function properly.

How is malaise managed?

Managing malaise involves a two-pronged approach of identifying and treating the underlying cause and addressing symptoms.

Addressing the underlying cause of malaise

The first step in managing malaise is to determine its root cause. This often requires one or more visits to a health care provider who can carefully review your symptoms, examine you, and perform various tests if needed.

Your doctor will likely ask you detailed questions about your medical history and symptoms to start to narrow things down. For example:


	How long have you been feeling this way? How would you rate the severity of your symptoms on a scale of 1 to 10?
	What makes your symptoms better or worse? Do they come and go or stay constant? Do they go away or improve if you are distracted or on vacation?
	Do you have any prior experience with, or episodes of, malaise?
	Are there any other symptoms such as cough, chest pain, fever, fatigue, pain, weight change, bleeding, changes in your stool or urine, rash, or loss of appetite?
	Do you take any medications or supplements? Are any of these new?
	Do you have a history of thyroid problems?
	Have you been feeling depressed or have any new stressors in your life?
	Have you traveled recently?
	Describe your sleep patterns, exercise, and dietary habits.


Your doctor will also perform a thorough physical examination and may order certain laboratory tests.

Treatment will depend on the underlying cause. If an infection is causing your malaise, antibiotics or antiviral medications may be prescribed. For chronic diseases such as high blood pressure or diabetes, managing the condition through medication, lifestyle changes, and ongoing medical care is essential.

In cases where mental health issues may factor into the malaise, talk therapy and sometimes medication can help alleviate the feelings of malaise. If a medication you are taking is causing the problem, your doctor might adjust the dosage or switch you to a different drug.

Lifestyle changes to manage symptoms

Regardless of the underlying cause, certain lifestyle changes may help manage and reduce malaise by improving your overall health and well-being. But according to Dr. Shmerling, you should be cautious about making drastic changes prior to getting your symptoms sorted out by a doctor.

""Sometimes, a lifestyle suggestion is premature. For example: exercise might be great for someone who is deconditioned and otherwise healthy; but it might be impossible or even make things worse (at least in the short run) if the person turns out to have new, untreated heart disease,"" says Dr. Shmerling. ""That said, I would encourage other standard recommendations for a healthy lifestyle, which include a healthy diet, adequate sleep, and stress management, while the work-up is ongoing.""

Healthy lifestyle changes you can discuss with your doctor include:

Improving your diet. Ensure you are eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Sometimes, supplements might be necessary if you have specific deficiencies.

Staying hydrated. Drinking enough water throughout the day is crucial. Dehydration can lead to feelings of fatigue.

Regular exercise. Incorporating regular physical activity into your routine can boost your energy levels and improve overall well-being. Even light exercises like walking can make a difference.

Prioritizing sleep. Good sleep hygiene is essential. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, create a relaxing bedtime routine, and ensure your sleeping environment is comfortable.

Managing stress. Techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga, and deep-breathing exercises can help reduce stress levels and improve your sense of well-being.

Avoiding alcohol and smoking. Both can contribute to feelings of malaise. Cutting down or quitting can improve your overall health.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","July 10, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/monosodium-glutamate-msg-what-it-is-and-why-you-might-consider-avoiding-foods-that-contain-it,"Monosodium glutamate (MSG): What it is, and why you might consider avoiding foods that contain it","Monosodium glutamate (MSG) may be most commonly associated with Chinese food, but this odorless, crystalline additive is used throughout the restaurant industry, and is even added to many packaged foods you may be eating. But what exactly is MSG? And why might you consider avoiding foods that contain it?
        What is MSG?
        MSG is a flavor enhancer that's frequently added to canned vegetables, soups, deli meats, and restaurant foods to lend a savory, rich flavor. It's made from sodium and L-glutamic acid, a nonessential amino acid that occurs naturally in umami-rich foods like tomatoes, anchovies, mushrooms, and Parmesan cheese.
        A Japanese chemist named Kikunae Ikeda extracted glutamate from an umami-rich seaweed broth to produce the first man-made MSG in 1908. Today, MSG is made by fermenting starch, sugar beets, sugar cane, or molasses into an odorless white powder that can be sprinkled into your food like table salt. And while MSG is frequently associated with Southeast Asian cooking, it's an ingredient that's used in various types of cooking around the world.
        Why is MSG added to certain foods?
        MSG intensifies and enhances umami flavors in soups, sauces, broths, and other foods. On its own MSG doesn't taste like anything, but it lends a savory, meaty flavor to foods it's added to, making it a popular additive for both restaurant and home chefs.
        While the FDA considers the addition of MSG to foods to be ""generally recognized as safe,"" it still requires food manufacturers to list MSG on the ingredient panel. You'll see it listed as monosodium glutamate. And if a food includes any ingredient that contains naturally occurring MSG (such as yeast extract, hydrolyzed yeast, or protein isolate) it cannot claim ""no MSG"" or ""no added MSG"" on its packaging.
        What foods are more likely to contain MSG?
        Although Chinese dishes are often associated with MSG, many non-ethnic restaurants (and fast-food joints) also use MSG to flavor their food. MSG is also found in many processed and packaged foods, and in many hot dogs and lunch meats. Condiments like salad dressing, mayonnaise, ketchup, and barbecue sauce also frequently contain MSG, as do packaged seasoning blends, frozen pizzas, and instant noodles.
        Is MSG bad for you?
        In the 1990s, the FDA asked the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) to look into the safety of MSG. FASEB concluded that MSG is safe. They noted that any ill effects were mild and short-lived, and were typically associated with large doses (more than 3 grams) of MSG that were consumed without food.
        Most people don't ingest MSG on its own, and since most recipes call for a scant amount — 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon per pound of meat (enough to feed four to six people) — it's unlikely you'd consume it in high enough quantities to be affected.
        Who is at increased risk for having an adverse reaction to MSG?
        While most people can eat a meal with MSG without issue, a small subset — less than 1% of the general population — may be particularly sensitive to MSG. Symptoms typically appear in the first two hours after consuming foods with MSG, and can include headache, skin flushing, sweating, nausea, numbness, and fatigue. An even smaller subset of people have a serious allergic reaction.
        Why to consider limiting foods with MSG
        While MSG itself likely doesn't deserve its reputation as a toxic ingredient, there are reasons to avoid eating foods with MSG. Foods that contain MSG are often highly processed convenience foods that contain high amounts of sodium, fat, and other refined ingredients that aren't good for us. Seeing monosodium glutamate on an ingredients list should prompt you to look at the other ingredients included — and to consider trying to make that food at home, or to seek out a healthier alternative instead.
        How much sodium does MSG contain?
        While it may be best to avoid or reduce packaged foods containing MSG, the flavor booster could actually help you reduce the amount of sodium you consume when cooking at home. Despite having ""sodium"" in its name, monosodium glutamate contains only 12.28 grams of sodium per 100 grams. That's about one-third of the sodium found in table salt (39.34 grams/100 grams).
        If you replace 1/2 teaspoon of table salt with the same amount of MSG, you'll reduce the sodium content in your food by about 37%, without losing much flavor. As a home cook, that means using MSG could help enhance the perception of saltiness while reducing the actual sodium content in your food.
        Bottom line: Take the claims around MSG with a grain of salt
        Is MSG bad for you? Eaten in small amounts and as part of a meal, MSG likely won't have a negative effect, so long as you're not one of the small subset of people who are sensitive to it. But since it's often used in conjunction with other, less-healthy or highly processed ingredients, you may want to limit your consumption of it and skip the ultra-processed foods where it's often found.",Lindsay Warner,"July 2, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/can-you-increase-your-metabolism,Can you increase your metabolism?,"Your genetic makeup is the greatest determinant of your metabolism. But don't let that deter you from making lifestyle changes if you want to lose weight. There are a few ways to give your metabolism a boost.
        What is metabolism?
        Metabolism is the process through which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy. This complex process powers everything you do, from breathing, to growing, to providing your brain with the energy to think.
        The body burns calories (a measure of energy) all the time, whether your body is active or at rest:
        
          Basic body functions: Even when you're resting or sleeping, your body needs energy to keep vital functions going, like breathing, circulating blood, and repairing cells. This energy use is called your basal metabolic rate (BMR).
          Daily activities: Moving around, walking, talking, and doing everyday tasks also burn calories.
          Exercise: Physical activities like running, swimming, or lifting weights increase the number of calories your body uses.
        
        Metabolism is largely influenced by genetics. But there are some lifestyle modifications you can make that may help increase your metabolism.
        A key reason someone may want to boost their metabolism is because of the role metabolism plays in weight loss. Weight loss occurs when the body burns more calories than it consumes. Someone with a higher metabolic rate will burn more calories both at rest and during activity than someone with a lower (or slower) metabolic rate.
        Diet and metabolism
        Many people diet or follow restrictive diets to lose weight. But restrictive diets can sometimes backfire by slowing down your metabolism. That's because your body slows down your BMR, burning fewer calories over time, when it interprets reduced calorie intake as a threat of starvation. This is one reason why losing weight can often be difficult.
        So how can you choose foods that will boost, rather than slow, your metabolism? Research has found that certain foods can affect diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), which may boost resting metabolic rate. Foods that may have this effect include:
        
          Protein. Healthy sources of protein include lean chicken, fish, beans, Greek yogurt, edamame, nuts, chia seeds, and low-fat cottage cheese.
          Unrefined carbohydrates. Fiber-rich foods that aren't highly processed can increase energy expenditure because they take longer to digest. Examples include vegetables, fruits, whole-grain breads, brown rice, and legumes.
          Caffeine. An 8-ounce cup of coffee contains about 100 milligrams (mg) of caffeine, while an 8-ounce cup of black tea contains about 50 mg.
          Green tea. Green tea contains about 25 mg of caffeine per each 8-ounce cup. Drinking about three cups of green tea a day can help you burn around 100 extra calories daily.
        
        DIT is higher in the morning and lower in the evening. Eating larger meals earlier in the day might help you burn more calories.
        While losing weight requires burning more calories than you consume, your body still needs sufficient fuel and nutrients to function properly. Instead of simply eating less, it's better to focus on consuming nutritious foods and increasing your physical activity.
        Should you build more muscle to enhance metabolism?
        Strength training exercises can boost metabolism by building muscle tissue. Muscle burns more calories than fat. And unlike fat, muscle burns calories even at rest. This means that the more muscle mass you have, the higher your BMR will be. In fact, total muscle mass along with your genetic makeup are the strongest determinants of BMR.
        In addition, strength training has a post-exercise calorie-burning effect known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). After intense workouts, the body requires more oxygen to restore its resting state, resulting in additional calories burned post-exercise.
        Research suggests that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) may also elevate metabolism for some time after a workout. HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief periods of rest or low-intensity activity.",Jenette Restivo,"July 1, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/improving-your-mobility,Improving your mobility,"It can't be emphasized enough: engaging in physical activity is the single most important thing you can do to maintain mobility and independence, no matter your age or your health status.
        Health benefits of exercise
        Being physically active can help you control your weight, keep your muscles and bones strong, your joints working properly, your heart healthy, your mood lifted, and your metabolism revved. The more you move, the better your strength and balance will be, and the less likely you will be to fall or lose the ability to perform basic daily functions. In addition, you reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.
        How much exercise do you need?
        For healthy adults, the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommend 150 to 300 minutes of moderate exercise a week, with activity every day. The guidelines also recommend twice-weekly strength training sessions, and balance exercises for older adults at risk of falling.
        Besides targeted exercises for muscle strength and flexibility, joint health, and balance, you should strive to increase routine daily physical activities that aren't formal exercises, such as climbing stairs.
        Exercising with a chronic condition
        The guidelines state: ""When older adults cannot do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week because of chronic conditions, they should be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow."" Even modest efforts count. ""Move more and sit less throughout the day,"" the guidelines advise. ""Some activity is better than none.""
        The key is finding activities you can do and enjoy. If your joints are the problem, don't try to ""pace"" your joints — let your joints pace you. For example, don't make yourself go jogging. Instead, pick low-impact activities such as swimming or water aerobics. Try cycling on a stationary bike at the gym or at home. Yoga, tai chi, and qigong are other good alternatives. Even a gentle walking program that ramps up slowly will help.
        In other words, there's a lot of flexibility in the kinds of activities you do and when. Don't feel guilty if you can't do the same kinds of activities you used to. The important thing is not to let joint pain keep you from being physically active.
        If you're in pain, all this activity may seem impossible. But in many cases, exercise actually helps reduce the pain. If you have osteoarthritis, for example, regular exercise not only helps maintain joint function, but also helps relieve stiffness and diminishes pain and fatigue. Maintaining muscle strength can also help dampen stresses on joints.
        Be sure to talk to your doctor about whether it's safe to exercise if any of the following apply:
        
          You've had hip or knee surgery.
          You've been experiencing pain in your hip, knee, foot and ankle, or back.
          You have a chronic or unstable health condition such as heart disease, or you have a respiratory ailment, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, diabetes, or several risk factors for heart disease.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/dreaming-of-a-good-nights-rest,Dreaming of a good night's rest,"Sleep problems are an all-too-common reality for most older adults. Maybe they have trouble falling asleep, or wake up several times during the night, or have to take naps during the day to fight fatigue.
        Some of these sleep issues are age-related. For example, older adults often sleep less deeply than younger people and are more easily awakened. They also may take specific medication that have sleep-disrupting side effects.
        Older adults also are more likely to suffer from conditions that affect sleep, like sleep apnea (where you experience short pauses in your breathing many times during the night) and restless legs syndrome (an uncontrollable urge to move the legs).
        Rest and renew
        Proper sleep is as important as diet and exercise for optimal health. When you sleep, your body's cells repair and recharge themselves, so you feel energized the next day. Sleep also clears toxins from the brain, which keeps your brain sharp.
        The amount of sleep people need does not change as they age, according to Dr. Salma Batool-Anwar, who specializes in sleep disorders at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Older adults still require seven to nine hours of sleep per night, just like when they were younger,"" he says.
        Healthy sleep also means uninterrupted sleep. A good night's rest consists of completing four to five continuous sleep cycles. Each cycle includes periods of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, when you dream, and non-REM sleep, when you have deep, dreamless slumber.
        ""If your sleep gets disrupted or becomes fragmented, you could lose a chunk of either non-REM or REM sleep,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar.
        
          
            
              
                Healthy sleep leads to a healthier brain
                Fragmented sleep can lead to a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. A study published by Current Biology measured sleep quality of adults in their 60s and 70s in a lab over an eight-hour night of sleep and periodically measured beta-amyloid protein in their brains with a PET scan over several years. (Beta-amyloid buildup is linked with Alzheimer's disease.) People with poor sleep quality also had higher amounts of beta-amyloid. Those with more restorative sleep had lower levels.
              
            
          
        
        Pillow talk
        See your doctor if you feel you suffer from a sleep-related disorder. Otherwise, the following strategies can help keep your sleep cycle running smoothly.
        Review your medications. Diuretics (water pills) used to control blood pressure can make you wake up to use the bathroom. Some antidepressants cause daytime drowsiness and make it hard to fall asleep at night. ""Consult your doctor about possibly changing medication, lowering the dose, or taking it at different times, like at night rather than in the morning,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar.
        Watch your naps. Regular naps reduce fatigue and increase alertness and mood. But they also can interfere with your sleep cycle if you take them later in the day. ""Schedule them during a specific time of day, like in the early to late afternoon,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Keep naps to 15 to 20 minutes (set a timer to make sure you don't oversleep). Sleeping longer can make you feel groggy.
        Set stimuli cutoffs. For example, don't watch TV or use a computer at least an hour before bedtime. If your bladder often wakes you up, don't drink any liquids at least two hours beforehand. Also, avoid caffeine at least three hours before bedtime; caffeine reaches a peak level in your body within an hour after consumption, but it takes three to five hours for half of it to be eliminated. While regular exercise can help with sleep quality, working out within three hours of bedtime may lead to fragmented sleep.
        Create a sleep routine. Go to bed around the same time, and give yourself about an hour beforehand for bedtime rituals like bathing, brushing your teeth, and putting on comfortable pajamas. ""The structure teaches your body and mind how to properly wind down, which makes falling and staying asleep easier,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar.
        Prepare a soothing sleep setting. Make sure the bedroom is dark and cool. Listen to a relaxing sound machine. Or wear eyeshades or earplugs if you are sensitive to light or noise. Buy new sheets and pillows. Also, don't keep any stimulating electronics in the bedroom like a TV, computer, or phone.
        Establish a time limit. If you don't fall asleep within about 20 minutes, don't lie in bed awake. ""This can make insomnia even worse,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. Go to another room and read or listen to soothing music. ""But don't watch TV or a computer or anything stimulating,"" says Dr. Batool-Anwar. When you feel relaxed, try to sleep again.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/motivate-yourself-to-walk-more,Motivate yourself to walk more,"Need a little oomph to boost your daily step count? Try reminders or incentives, suggests a randomized controlled trial published online April 7, 2024, by Circulation. Researchers asked more than a thousand people (average age 67) to wear activity trackers, walk every day, and set step goals. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of four groups offering various nudges to exercise: the chance to win game points, the chance to earn money, the chance to get both money and game points, or a daily text message noting the previous day's step count. After one year, people in all of the groups had added another 1,500 steps or more to their daily step totals. But compared to the message-only group, those in the money or game groups walked about 500 more steps per day, and those in the combined incentives group walked almost 900 more steps per day. Want to try it at home? Set an exercise reminder on your phone, and use a walking app that offers game points and rewards.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/can-your-blood-tests-predict-your-future-risk-of-stress-anxiety-or-depression,"Can your blood tests predict your future risk of stress, anxiety, or depression?","When the doctor says your blood sugar or cholesterol levels are off, you might worry about diabetes or heart disease. But a large study published online April 2, 2024, by JAMA Network Open suggests that abnormal levels of those biomarkers might also signal a risk for developing chronic stress, anxiety, or depression years later. Researchers at facilities around the world, including Harvard, analyzed the health information of more than 211,000 people in Sweden. At the start of the study, participants were middle-aged (42 on average) and free of chronic stress or mood disorders. Each person was tested for levels of blood sugar and fats, such as triglycerides and HDL (good) cholesterol. After 21 years, people who'd had high blood sugar and high triglycerides at the start of the study were more likely to have developed chronic stress or mood disorders by age 60, compared with people who'd had low or normal blood sugar levels and triglycerides. On the flip side, people who'd had high levels of HDL were less likely to develop chronic stress or mood disorders compared with people who'd had low levels of HDL. This study doesn't answer the question of whether abnormal levels of sugar and fats lead to chronic stress, anxiety, or depression, or if the connection is more complicated or involves other factors. However, we know for sure that it's important to keep levels of sugar and fats normal to reduce the risk for many diseases.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/does-exercise-protect-against-covid-19,Does exercise protect against COVID-19?,"Q. 
          My friend, a fitness nut, tells me that regular exercise protects me against COVID and other illnesses. Since I'm terrified of infections, that might just finally get me to exercise regularly. Is she right?
        
        A. Well, get yourself some gym clothes and walking shoes, because your friend almost surely is right. There have not been a lot of studies conducted to see if exercise protects against infections, but there have been a few, and they all point in the same direction.
        The largest study, which was conducted here at Harvard Medical School, was published in JAMA Network Open in February 2024. The study included nearly 62,000 people ages 45 or older. They were followed from before the start of the COVID pandemic (in early 2020) through the end of 2022. Information was collected about many factors that could affect a person's vulnerability to infection, such as chronic illnesses, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle factors. The study also tracked whether the people got COVID and how seriously ill they were with COVID.
        Finally, the study determined how physically active people were: 69% were ""sufficiently active,"" meaning their weekly activity level was in the healthy range — at least 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity. As for the rest, 11% were ""insufficiently active,"" and 20% were inactive.
        The study showed conclusively that compared to the people who were inactive, those who were sufficiently active were 10% less likely to develop COVID and 27% less likely to be hospitalized for COVID. This was particularly noticeable among women. Unfortunately, people who were insufficiently active did not do much better than those who were completely inactive: you really need a ""healthy"" amount of physical activity each week to be protected against COVID. (Not surprisingly, the study also showed that people who got a COVID vaccine were much less likely to get COVID and to be hospitalized.)
        Other studies have shown that regular exercise protects against other infections, like influenza, so the results of this study are not really surprising. And, as we often report, regular exercise also protects you against heart disease, cancer, dementia, depression, and other major illnesses.
        How does regular exercise achieve these healthy benefits? Science is just beginning to learn the answer. Exercise enhances the ability of several types of white blood cells to fight infection. It stimulates the body to produce antibodies in the lining of the nose, throat, breathing tubes, and lungs, which fights infection. At the same time, regular exercise keeps the immune system from overreacting to infections and waging a battle that injures not just the invading germ but also the body itself.
        You've heard it before in these pages: no pill ever invented protects your health as much as does regular exercise.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-intermittent-fasting-improve-heart-health,Can intermittent fasting improve heart health?,"Fasting — or purposely not eating food — dates back to ancient times when people fasted in hopes of curing a disease or for religious reasons. Today, different forms of fasting remain popular for their possible health benefits, including weight loss and improvements in heart-related risks. A recent review article suggests some potential benefits (see ""Intermittent fasting: The latest evidence""). But timing isn't everything — you still need to pay attention to the overall quality and quantity of the food you eat.
        Intermittent fasting includes a range of strategies to limit the timing and frequency of meals. One variation, time-restricted eating, involves eating only during a certain time window (usually eight hours) over a single day. For example, you would have food only during the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and then eat nothing during the other 16 hours.
        Another approach, alternate-day fasting, involves fasting or significantly limiting calories for a full day. You choose certain days during the week when you eat nothing or limit yourself to just 400 to 600 calories per day. On the other days of the week, you follow your normal eating pattern. In one popular version, the 5:2 diet, you eat normally on five days, but restrict your calories on two nonconsecutive days. With alternate-day fasting, you eat a calorie-restricted diet every other day.
        
          
            
              
                Intermittent fasting: The latest evidence
                One way to assess the effect of a diet or other therapy is to pool the results from many different randomized trials, creating what's known as a meta-analysis. Another version — called an umbrella review — goes one step further by combining results from many different meta-analyses and other review articles.
                That's what a team of researchers did with intermittent fasting. Their umbrella review, in the April 2024 issue of eClinical Medicine, combined results from 23 meta-analyses and reviews of intermittent fasting studies, which included mostly people classed as overweight or obese and also some with diabetes or metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that raise the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes). The control groups varied but included people on calorie-restricted diets, typical diets for specific cultures, and habitual diets (what participants normally ate).
                Researchers found good evidence that intermittent fasting can lower
                
                  waist circumference
                  fat mass
                  triglycerides
                  LDL and total cholesterol
                  fasting insulin (the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels)
                  systolic blood pressure (the first number in a blood pressure reading).
                
              
            
          
        
        Pros and cons for fasting
        ""Generally speaking, intermittent fasting has a good safety profile,"" says Dr. Armen Yerevanian, an endocrinologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. People with diabetes who rely on insulin and certain medications to lower their blood sugar levels need to be cautious, however. For them, fasting isn't dangerous, but it requires careful planning with their doctor to minimize the risk of low blood sugar.
        Intermittent fasting probably helps improve cholesterol levels and other heart risk factors because the practice promotes weight loss. Because of the time restrictions, you naturally tend to eat fewer calories, especially if you shut down a habit of late-night binge eating. Plus, when you don't eat for extended periods of time, your body switches fuels away from carbohydrates and starts burning stored fat.
        Challenging to maintain
        ""The biggest issue with intermittent fasting is that it can be challenging to maintain over the long run,"" says Dr. Yerevanian. Most studies of the practice have lasted just 12 to 16 weeks, although some have gone up to six months. It's easier to stick to a diet when you're being closely watched as part of a study, he says. But in the real world, it's often hard to follow a strict eating schedule when you're also juggling various work, family, and social commitments.
        ""The times that I've seen time-restricted eating be most successful is when people are ready to make a broad set of lifestyle changes to improve their health,"" says Dr. Yerevanian. Rather than relying solely on intermittent fasting, they use it as a tool to change other aspects of their lifestyle that are affecting their weight and heart risks. Combined with a healthy, plant-focused diet, along with regular aerobic and strength-building exercise and routine preventive care, intermittent fasting can be a safe and effective tool to improve your cardiovascular health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/incentives-help-people-become-more-active,Incentives help people become more active,"A study published online April 7, 2024, by Circulation found that adults can benefit from receiving incentives to become more active. Researchers recruited more than 1,000 adults who were at an elevated risk for a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years. Participants used a fitness tracker for two weeks to establish a baseline number of daily steps. Everyone then set a goal to increase their average daily steps by 33%, 40%, 50%, or any number greater than 1,500 steps.
        After setting their goals, participants were randomly divided into four groups. Three groups were offered incentives to reach their goals. One received game-like rewards, another financial rewards, and the third a combination of both. A control group wore fitness trackers but didn't receive incentives. The game and financial rewards consisted of people earning or losing points or money depending on whether they met their daily step goal. The control group received a daily text telling them if they met their goal.
        Over a year, participants in the fitness tracker control group increased their daily step count by an average of 1,500 steps. In contrast, people in all the incentive groups improved their daily steps by 2,000 to 2,400 steps. This amount of increase would be expected to correlate with a 10% reduced risk of death from heart attack or stroke. The study highlighted how discovering your own ways to reward yourself might lead to increases in daily physical activity.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/reaching-the-climax,Reaching the climax,"Regular orgasms offer numerous health benefits for men, such as lowering stress, boosting mood, and improving sleep quality. Some research has suggested that they may help reduce the risk of heart disease and prostate cancer.
        However, as they age, men can face obstacles to achieving orgasms. They may be unable to have an orgasm during sex (a condition known as anorgasmia), or it may take a frustratingly long time to climax (what's called delayed orgasm). Men also may have trouble maintaining an erection long enough to have sex. Sometimes, lack of arousal can prevent them from reaching an orgasm.
        ""Men don't have to achieve an orgasm every time during sex to have a satisfying experience with their partner,"" says Dr. Sharon Bober, director of the Sexual Health Program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""But if men are unable to have regular orgasms during sex, there are ways to help.""
        Many issues can contribute to problems having orgasm, such as low testosterone levels, medication side effects, and psychological problems like anxiety and stress, so first check with your doctor. Still, sometimes men only need extra stimulation or sexual excitement to reach orgasm. Or they may require help maintaining an erection (and don't want to rely on erectile dysfunction medication). In these cases, Dr. Bober suggests trying the following strategies.
        Masturbate more
        Masturbating alongside your partner or enlisting their help can increase excitement. ""Masturbation helps reduce the stress of performance or climaxing within a certain period, since you can take your time and go at your own pace,"" says Dr. Bober.
        Men also may benefit from frequent solo masturbation. ""Men know what arouses them, and masturbating more by themselves can help them focus on their own pleasure,"" says Dr. Bober. ""This may help lower expectations with partner sex because they don't have to view having an orgasm as the ultimate goal of their satisfaction. Instead, they can focus on the experience of connecting with their partner, which can increase arousal.""
        Get erotic
        Reading erotic literature together can stimulate sexual desire through storytelling, imagery, fantasy, and language. ""Reading and listening stimulate your largest sexual organ: your brain,"" says Dr. Bober.
        There are now many erotic novels and short story anthologies that cater specifically to older adults. (You can find a wide selection with an Internet search and via websites for publishing houses and booksellers.)
        Play with toys
        Many kinds of sex toys and devices help increase stimulation and help maintain erections. For instance, the penile vibratory device is placed around the penis and vibrates to stimulate the nerves in the base of the penis to encourage an orgasm. It's used before sex and can be incorporated into foreplay. To help maintain an erection, men could try a penile band, also known as an ED ring. It fastens around the base of an erect penis to keep blood from escaping. Bands are made of rubber, plastic, or silicone and can be bought online.
        Another helpful device is a vacuum pump. You place your penis into an airtight plastic cylinder that's attached to a handheld pump. Air is pumped out of the cylinder to create a vacuum, which increases blood flow to the penis. It takes about five minutes to get an erection. You then remove your penis from the cylinder and fit a penile band around its base to prevent blood from draining.
        The erection lasts until the band is removed. Some pumps are manual, while others operate on a battery. You can find them in many pharmacies and online.
        Go exploring
        Devote more time to the excitement of hugging, kissing, and exploring each other's bodies, and experiment with different foreplay like giving each other a massage or giving and receiving oral sex. Also, talk with your partner about what they are interested in trying. This could include fantasies, role playing, or different sexual positions.
        ""Many times, just having the conversation can boost arousal for both people,"" says Dr. Bober.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/taking-the-presidential-physical-fitness-test,Taking the Presidential Physical Fitness Test,"President Dwight D. Eisenhower initiated the Presidential Physical Fitness Test in 1956. The test was adjusted over the decades, but the version that most people are familiar with consisted of five parts: a one-mile run, pull-ups or push-ups, sit-ups, shuttle run, and sit-and-reach. The aim was to assess cardiovascular fitness, upper-body and core strength, endurance, flexibility, and agility.
        ""While the test was designed for young people and has changed over the years, older adults can still benefit from taking it,"" says Patricia Cordeiro, a certified athletic trainer with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Brigham. ""With some modifications, the test can be a valuable tool to assess their current fitness and identify where they need to improve.""
        Here's a breakdown of the original test, what you can learn from it, and how to take it.
        One-mile run
        The one-mile run measured cardiovascular fitness based on speed. But older adults should instead use it to measure intensity, according to Cordeiro. National guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, with moderate intensity defined as 50% to 70% of one's maximum heart rate. A commonly used formula to estimate maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age.
        ""A one-mile run or power walk using a heart rate monitor can help you maintain proper intensity and track your progress,"" says Cordeiro. ""Ideally, most men want to be in the moderate-intensity range for most of their workout.""
        Run or power walk for one mile at your usual pace and record your average heart rate. In subsequent mile workouts, take note of your perceived effort as well as your heart rate. At first, try increasing your pace, which probably will raise your average heart rate. However, as you become more fit you might find that your heart rate slows a bit, even as you put in more effort. The test also works using a stationary bike.
        Sit-ups
        The original test measured how many sit-ups you could complete in a minute as a way to gauge core strength. The core consists of muscles in the abdomen, back, hips, pelvis, and buttocks. A strong core helps you avoid pain in the neck, shoulder, and lower back, and even sore knees and hips.
        ""However, timed sit-ups are not the best way to measure core strength, nor are sit-ups considered the best exercise for improving core muscles,"" says Cordeiro. A better move, she says, is the plank pose, as it engages all the core muscles (unlike sit-ups) and places less stress on the back.
        Time how long you can hold a plank pose while maintaining good form. ""If you can only hold it a few seconds, it's a sign of a weak core,"" says Cordeiro. ""But your duration will increase as your core strength improves."" Here's how to perform a plank:
        
          Lie facedown with your forearms on the floor, legs extended, and feet together. To make this more comfortable, you can use a mat or towel under your arms.
          Push into your forearms as you raise your body to form a straight line from your head and neck to your feet. (Do not let your hips rise or sag.)
          Keep your gaze down and hold this position as you engage your abdominal muscles. Take steady, even breaths.
        
        Try to hold the position for up to 30 seconds, then lower your body and rest. Repeat two to three times. Eventually aim toward increasing the time to one to two minutes. If resting on your forearms is uncomfortable, do the plank from a push-up position, with your arms fully extended. If you have back pain or other back issues do the plank on your knees.
        Push-ups
        While the original test offered a choice between push-ups or pull-ups, Cordeiro recommends push-ups, as they are easier to do with more modification options. ""Push-ups help improve upper-body strength — chest, shoulders, arms, and back,"" she says.
        The push-up test was based on how many a person could do. Cordeiro says the focus should always be on maintaining good form. ""A properly executed push-up means going low enough to fully engage your muscles,"" she says. ""Doing five good push-ups is better than doing 10 poor ones.""
        To do a proper push-up, begin in a full plank position with your arms extended, palms flat and just below shoulder level, feet together or about 12 inches apart. Keep your back straight and your weight evenly distributed. Look down, lower your body until your elbows are at a 90° angle, and then push back up to complete one rep.
        One way to ensure you go low enough is to roll up a towel to about the height of your fist and place it on the ground under your forehead. Lower into the push-up until your forehead touches the towel. Another option is to have your chest touch the floor and then push back up. Perform as many push-ups as possible while keeping good form. If this is too difficult, do a modified version from a hands-and-knees position.
        Sit-and-reach
        This move measured flexibility in the hamstrings (the muscles in the back of the thighs) and lower back. Tight-ness in these areas increases the risk of pain and injury and makes bending over difficult. The original test used a sit-and-reach ruler box to measure flexibility, but you can replicate it like this:
        
          Sit on the floor with your knees locked and your legs straight out.
          Lean forward from the hips, keep your knees locked, and extend your outstretched hands down your legs as far as comfortable without rounding your back. Note where your fingertips reached. Repeat for accuracy.
        
        ""The shorter distance you can reach, the greater the tightness in the low back and hamstrings,"" says Cordeiro. Adopting a daily stretching routine or doing yoga can help increase flexibility. Return to the test periodically to gauge your progress. ""Choose certain spots on your legs as goals,"" says Cordeiro. ""Aim to reach your kneecaps, then the middle of your shins, the top of your socks, and eventually, even your toes.""
        Shuttle run
        This test involves moving back and forth as fast as possible between two points. It measures balance, agility, and the ability to change speed and direction — skills older adults need to prevent falls.
        Here's a version of the test. Place two books or yoga blocks on the floor 20 feet apart. Starting at one end, run or briskly walk to the other side. Bend over, pick up the object, and run or walk to the starting spot. Place the object on the ground. Pick up the other object, run or walk to the other side, and place it on the ground. Go back and forth until you complete four trips.
        Adopting certain activities can help improve your performance, such as jumping rope, stair climbing, tai chi, and pickleball. ""Periodically repeat the test to assess your progress,"" says Cordeiro. ""As you improve, you should move quicker between the two points and can do more back-and-forth trips or even increase the distance.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-you-missing-this-simple-treatment-for-restless-legs,Are you missing this simple treatment for restless legs?,"Image: © AlexRaths/Getty Images
        People with restless legs syndrome (RLS) experience an overwhelming need to move the legs, particularly at night or as they fall asleep. But a simple treatment that may help reduce RLS symptoms is often overlooked as a potential first line of defense.
        The concern is that people are being started on medications first when iron might be a valuable treatment. It's simple, with relatively few side effects.
        Understanding RLS
        An estimated 2.5% of Americans — more women than men — have frequent and bothersome RLS. Symptoms include tingling, crawling, aching, pulling, or painful sensations that can be relieved only by moving the leg (or, sometimes, arm) in which it occurs. Some people have RLS symptoms only when immobile on long plane or car rides.
        Four out of five people who have RLS also have another condition called periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), which causes involuntary jerking or twitching movements in the legs during sleep.
        Movements occur every 20 to 40 seconds for a few minutes or a few hours at a time, leading to disrupted sleep, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue for both the person who has PLMS and his or her bed partner.
        RLS causes
        The exact cause of RLS is unclear. People with iron deficiency (see ""The importance of iron"") are much more likely to experience the disorder, but might not be tested for it. This is particularly in men, in whom iron deficiency is uncommon.
        The link between RLS and iron does not just depend on low blood iron levels. Instead, RLS may be caused by low levels of iron in the brain. It's possible to have a low brain level of iron but a normal blood level of iron. The two levels can be different.
        Diagnosing low brain iron
        Brain iron deficiency should be one of the first considerations when looking for a cause of RLS. But diagnosing low brain iron is tricky.
        Doctors don't have a way of assessing brain iron outside of specialized brain imaging. So doctors need to infer it from blood levels. A low blood iron level and symptoms of RLS make it very likely that the person has low brain iron levels as well.
        Doctors use several tests to measure iron in the blood. One test measures iron levels directly. But the best way to diagnose iron deficiency is a blood test measuring ferritin, the primary form of stored iron in the body. The ferritin level also provides guidance as to which type of iron therapy should be recommended.
        Treating RLS with food
        Dietary iron may sometimes be enough to treat RLS if your ferritin level is at or below 50 micrograms per liter (mcg/L). Red meat is really the best way.
        However, consuming excessive amounts of red meat, especially cured meats like ham or salami, is associated with an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, diverticulitis, and some types of cancer. Legumes are a healthier iron source, but absorption of iron from them is less efficient.
        
          
            
              
                The importance of iron
                Iron is an essential mineral that we get from our diet, in foods such as red meat, cooked soybeans, cooked lentils, ground turkey, and fortified bread and breakfast cereals.
                We need only a small amount of dietary iron each day: 8 milligrams per day for adult men and for women starting at age 50 (or whenever menstruation ends).
                You may have low iron levels if your diet does not include iron-rich foods or if you have an underlying condition — such as cancer of the stomach, colon, bladder, or kidney — that causes blood to be lost from the body. Women who are menstruating often have low iron levels.
                The vast majority of dietary iron we absorb helps us make hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying chemical in the body's red blood cells). Iron is also essential for making myoglobin (a protein in muscle cells); activating certain enzymes; and making amino acids, collagen, neurotransmitters, and hormones.
                Low iron levels can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. In this condition, there are too few red blood cells, and the red blood cells are too small. The low levels of hemoglobin make it harder for the blood to carry oxygen to organs.
                In menstruating women, iron deficiency is most often due to menstrual blood loss. In men and in women who are not menstruating, it's important to find out what may be causing low iron levels and treat potential causes.
              
            
          
        
        Treating RLS with oral iron
        The more reliable treatment is oral iron. Experts recommend treating RLS with a pill form of iron when the ferritin level is 50 mcg/L or lower. It relieves RLS symptoms substantially in about half of the cases in people with ferritin at these levels.
        The dose: The usual starting dose is one tablet of 325 milligrams of ferrous sulfate once per day. It's best absorbed when your stomach is acidic, so take it on an empty stomach or take it with vitamin C. Oral iron can cause stomach upset and constipation. Taking one tablet every other day rather than daily can often be enough to replete iron stores and reduce RLS symptoms.
        Treating RLS with IV iron infusion
        Absorbing iron orally may not be possible if blood iron levels are not low. Sometimes the gut absorbs iron poorly. In those cases, and in cases in which people are unable to tolerate the digestive effects of oral iron, doctors bypass the gut and prescribe an intravenous (IV) infusion of iron to treat RLS. 
        How often would you need an infusion to treat RLS? That depends on how your ferritin level is to start, why you're losing iron and how quickly your levels are dropping over time.
        Other strategies
        It may take a month before iron levels increase and RLS symptoms decline. During that period, if RLS is intolerable, your doctor can prescribe the usual drugs to treat it.
        Medication may also be recommended for RLS if you are not deficient in iron. Some drugs for RLS, like pramipexole (Mirapex) and ropinirole (Requip), are also used to treat Parkinson's disease but the doses used for RLS are lower. Other options are gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), or gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant), which are also used to treat nerve pain.
        Pill-free strategies may help ease RLS, too: massage or stretch the legs before bed, exercise daily, and avoid alcohol. Like taking iron, pill-free approaches offer a simple way to help relieve RLS and shouldn't be overlooked.",Unknown,"July 1, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/what-are-the-differences-between-popular-low-carb-diets,What are the differences between popular low-carb diets?,"Q. 
          If a person wants to try a very low-carb diet, what's the difference between a carnivore diet, a keto diet, and a paleo diet?
        
        A. While all three diets are low in carbohydrates, there are significant differences in what each contains.
        Ketogenic (keto) diet. A ""true"" keto diet does not provide enough calories from sources of glucose and other forms of sugar and causes the body to burn fat to create energy. When fat is broken down, ketones are released by fat cells into the bloodstream. The increase in blood ketones lowers the normal acid-base balance in blood to make it more acidic, a state known as ketosis. In a typical keto diet plan, approximately 70% to 75% of daily calories come from fat, 20% from protein, and no more than 10% from carbohydrates. The food and beverage choices to provide this caloric mix can vary.
        Carnivore diet. A carnivore diet is the most ketogenic because its carb content is extremely low, which is why it's sometimes called the ""zero carb"" diet. You only eat meat, poultry, eggs, fish, and dairy. The long list of foods not allowed includes all vegetables, fruit, grains, legumes, seeds, and nuts.
        Paleo diet. The paleo approach centers on the unprocessed, truly natural foods humans consumed through hunting and gathering in the Paleolithic era, which ended about 10,000 years ago. The food choices can come from meat, fish, poultry, eggs, vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Any refined or artificial products (including healthy oils like olive oil), dairy, grains, legumes, and potatoes are excluded because they appeared after the agricultural revolution that followed the Paleolithic era. A paleo diet can be ketogenic if simple carbs are limited enough. Still, you can go paleo and not be in ketosis by eating more fruits, especially berries.
        So, which of these three approaches, if any, might you consider trying? The pros and cons of a keto diet depend on your goal. If you want to jump-start a weight-loss program, a keto diet can help you lose five to 10 pounds or more. The downside, even for the short term, is a potential rise in LDL (bad) cholesterol. Personally, I have concerns about staying in ketosis for more than four to six weeks. Longer-term use of a keto diet is linked to a higher risk of kidney stones, osteoporosis, and gout.
        With the paleo diet, you have flexibility regarding being in and out of ketosis. However, because grains are not allowed, you would need to find ways to supplement your fiber intake. And you can miss some essential micronutrients.
        Finally, given the overwhelming evidence supporting the benefits of a plant-based diet, I would never recommend a carnivore diet.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-pleasure-dome,The pleasure dome,"For many men, there comes a time when they're ready to join the ranks of Stanley Tucci, Patrick Stewart, and Samuel L. Jackson and shave their heads. A head shave done by a barber is an easy way to maintain a shaved head. To do it yourself, follow these tips from dermatologist Dr. Mathew Avram with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        1. Get a stubble
        First cut your hair to stubble length using an electric hair trimmer. This will make your hair easier to shave. Use a zero setting on the trimmer and cut with the grain (the direction your hair grows). Make several passes to make sure you don't miss any spots.
        2. Choose your razor or shaver
        Razors come in two types: blade razors and electric shavers.
        Blade razors include disposable cartridge razors and safety razors. Cartridge razors have three to five blades and flexible heads. Safety razors are a single double-edge blade mounted in a metal or plastic shell attached atop a handle.
        Electric shavers include rotary and foil styles. Electric rotary shavers use circular blades (three, four, or five) that rotate behind metal guards. Electric foil shavers use oscillating blades that move sideways at high speed underneath one or more horizontal protective screens.
        For some men, an electric shaver is sufficient. But for a smoother feel — or if you don't want to use an electric shaver — use a cartridge or safety razor. ""Your choice depends on personal preference,"" says Dr. Avram.
        3. Prep your scalp
        Rinse your head with warm water or take a warm shower to open up the pores, which minimizes irritation. Pat your head dry. Apply a thin layer of shaving oil, gel, or foam over your entire head.
        4. Shave
        Begin at the back of the head and shave with the grain of your hair. Move from the back of the head to the sides, then the crown, and finally the front.
        Electric shave: With a rotary shaver, use slow, circular motions. With a foil razor, use steady downward strokes.
        Blade shave: Take slow, short, gliding strokes. Rinse the razor after each stroke. For a safety razor, maintain about a 30° angle when shaving to ensure a consistent shave, and avoid pressing too hard, which can cause cuts.
        Rub your fingertips over your head to feel for missed areas and go over them again, reapplying oil, gel, or foam as needed. For difficult spots like around the ears and at the back of the neck, use your free hand to pull the skin up to get a closer shave. ""You may have to shave against the grain for tough-to-shave spots, but keep this to a minimum to avoid skin irritation,"" says Dr. Avram.
        5. After care
        When you've finished shaving, rinse your head with cold water and apply an alcohol-free balm or cream to rehydrate your skin. Wash your scalp daily as you would your face to eliminate oil and sweat.
        6. Maintain your look
        How often you shave your head is an individual choice, says Dr. Avram. ""Once you have a clean shave, it's quick and easy to do a daily touch-up,"" he says. ""Or you could do it every two or three days to reduce the daily maintenance."" Keep in mind that if you let your hair grow back too much, you may have to cut it to a stubble again before shaving.
        
          
            
              
                Watch your head
                A newly shaved head needs extra care to keep it healthy. For instance, men should be diligent about protecting their heads from sun damage. ""You no longer have hair to protect against the sun's harmful rays, so your scalp can get full exposure every time you are outside, even if you are walking from your front door to your car,"" says dermatologist Dr. Mathew Avram with Massachusetts General Hospital. He recommends a daily application of sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Cover your entire head, neck, and ears, and reapply every two hours when outside. Also, wear a wide-brimmed hat whenever possible. Shaving your head also may reveal spots, growths, or moles, so it's a good idea to see your dermatologist to examine your scalp and look at anything new you've discovered.

        Published online April 8, 2024, by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, the study included 1,196 adults who used the app, which is based on current guidelines for statin use. Their average LDL (bad) cholesterol level was about 140 mg/dL. In general, LDL levels should be 100 or lower and even less (below 70 or even 55) for people with heart disease.
        Nearly 91% of the participants correctly determined whether they should or shouldn't take a statin, as compared with a doctor's assessment. Most continued on to the six-month treatment phase, and 98% correctly used the recommended drug (a 5-milligram dose of rosuvastatin [Crestor]), achieving a 35% drop in their LDL levels.
        The app is being developed by the drug's maker, AstraZeneca, based on FDA guidance, but it still requires regulatory approval. The goal is to enable people to assess their need for a statin and start the drug without a physician's prescription.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/meditation-a-heartfelt-habit,Meditation: A heartfelt habit?,"Meditating sounds so simple: Just sit comfortably and quiet your mind. Yet even seasoned practitioners will tell you that settling into a meditative state isn't easy, especially when you're anxious, worried, or stressed. But meditation may benefit people prone to cardiovascular disease, so it's worth giving this mind-calming technique a try (see ""How meditation may help your heart"").
        ""When you start any new activity, coaching or guidance can really help, and that's also true when learning to meditate,"" says Dr. Darshan Mehta, medical director of the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Many communities have meditation centers where you can take classes in person. But online courses, which are more convenient and accessible, can be just as effective, he says. Another option is to try a smartphone app that offers guided meditations; popular ones include Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer, and 10% Happier.
        
          
            
              
                How meditation may help your heart
                An article published Feb. 15, 2024, in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews looked at the potential cardiovascular benefits from two forms of meditation: mindfulness-based practices and Transcendental Meditation. The authors analyzed 81 randomized controlled trials involving a total of nearly 7,000 people.
                Over all, the findings were mixed, which may reflect some of the inherent challenges of studying meditation. For one thing, creating an appropriate placebo or control group for meditation is tricky. Often, the controls are either people on a waiting list to receive meditation training (inactive controls) or those who do crossword puzzles or attend education sessions (active controls). For another, the people most likely to volunteer for a meditation study are often already sold on meditation's benefits and may differ from those who aren't interested in the practice.
                Still, the review found that mindfulness-based interventions probably reduce stress and may also lower anxiety, depression, and blood pressure. Transcendental meditation may also reduce blood pressure. According to the authors, some of meditation's effect may be indirect: when people feel calmer, that may help them avoid unhealthy ways of coping with stress, such as drinking alcohol or making poor food choices.
              
            
          
        
        Attention and awareness
        Meditative practices fall into two broad categories: focused attention and open monitoring. With focused attention, you concentrate on one thing: counting, a mantra (a word or phrase such as ""peace"" or ""may I be well""), or an object (a candle, a tree, or prayer beads, for example). One well-known form, Transcendental Meditation, uses mantras. With open monitoring, you open your awareness to everything you're experiencing, including thoughts, feelings, sounds, and bodily sensations.
        Mindfulness meditation, which has become popular in recent decades, incorporates both attention and awareness. Other forms of meditation include samatha (calming and concentration) meditation, vipassana (insight) meditation, and metta (loving-kindness) meditation.
        Cultivating a meditation practice
        These tips may help you foster a regular meditation practice:
        Practice when it's practical. For some people, mornings are most convenient. Others prefer to meditate at the end of the day.
        Stick with it. Make it a habit once you've found your ideal time of day to meditate.
        Don't have high expectations. You won't emerge from your first session as a changed human being. Meditation is a process. Give it time, and you'll see improvements gradually.
        Take your practice with you. Meditate wherever you can find quiet moments alone — in your bedroom, at work, or while walking in the park.
        Accessorize. To focus your mind, use something meaningful to you, such as a candle, a piece of art, or a photo of a loved one.
        Be prepared to be uncomfortable. Stilling your thoughts is harder than it sounds. It could take a while for you to feel comfortable in the practice.
        Don't fight the feeling. Relax into the practice. Let your thoughts drift away. Ease into your breath. Even if you feel slightly uncomfortable, try to give in to the feeling and not push back against it.
        Be kind to yourself. If you don't get the hang of meditation right away, forgive yourself and try again. You will eventually get it.
        Check in with yourself. After each session, pause and take stock of your feelings. Have you let go of any tension or anxiety you were carrying? If not, do you need to relax for a few minutes more?

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/dizziness-demystified,Dizziness demystified,"""Like a whirlpool, it never ends."" This apt description of vertigo from Tommy Roe's 1969 hit ""Dizzy"" was fun to listen to when we were kids, but not so amusing decades later if you've endured the room-spinning sensation.
        Originating from the Latin word vertere, meaning ""to turn,"" vertigo can also make you feel unsteady on your feet, lightheaded, faint, or like you're in motion when you're not. Some people who have it also become nauseated and vomit. But whether it lasts for a few seconds or a few days, the highly common problem is rarely dangerous — though it can provoke falls, a leading cause of deaths from injuries in adults 65 and older.
        Either way, it's vital to know that vertigo is a symptom, not a condition in itself. This makes it a starting point for seeking a diagnosis, not something to leave unquestioned, says James Naples, an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's Dizziness Clinic.
        ""Telling your doctor you have vertigo is like saying you have a stomachache,"" Dr. Naples says. ""It doesn't mean you have a solution — it means you have to look for a cause.""
        Common culprits
        Vertigo is an equal-opportunity affliction, so there's no ""typical"" patient with it, Dr. Naples says. Many cases originate from the inner ear, the headquarters of our body's vestibular system, which regulates our sense of balance and spatial orientation. A smaller subset arises from problems with the way the brain interprets motion.
        Minor — and quickly passing — triggers include dehydration, alcohol use, hormone shifts during perimenopause, certain foods or ingredients, stress or anxiety, and excessive tiredness.
        These are the most common conditions causing dizziness:
        Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Especially prevalent in older adults, BPPV occurs when tiny crystals in the inner ear (called canaliths) shift out of place. Certain head movements — such as turning over in bed — trigger intense symptoms.
        Vestibular migraines. A variant of conventional migraines, this form doesn't always involve a headache but produces vertigo and other balance-related symptoms.
        Vestibular neuritis. Typically caused by a viral infection, this condition (also called acute labyrinthitis) is an inflammation of the balance apparatus of the inner ear.
        M'nière's disease. Often marked by ear-ringing and progressive, low-frequency hearing loss, this condition is prompted by a change in the inner ear's fluid volume stemming from a variety of possible reasons.
        Treatment strategies
        If dizziness is accompanied by other symptoms such as sudden changes in vision, hearing, or speech or numbness or tingling on one side of the body or face, seek emergency medical attention. ""We'd want to make sure you aren't having a stroke or have another neurological condition,"" Dr. Naples says.
        Regardless, your first vertigo attack should compel you to make a doctor's appointment, since there's no way of knowing whether the cause is minor or serious. ""No exceptions,"" he says.
        As part of your evaluation, your doctor will look for involuntary, jerking eye movements called nystagmus, as well as determine whether additional testing such as a hearing test or brain imaging is needed.
        Depending on the cause, vertigo treatment can include one or more of these therapies:
        
          Medications to dampen the sensitivity of the inner ear, reducing dizziness and the nausea that comes with it. But drug treatment isn't a long-term solution. ""Most medications only treat the symptoms without addressing the underlying cause of your vertigo,"" Dr. Naples says.
          A canalith repositioning procedure, also known as the Epley maneuver, which involves moving your head through a series of positions to shift inner-ear crystals to other areas that won't trigger dizziness.
          Vestibular therapy, or balance rehabilitation, in which you learn exercises to help you manage dizziness and balance problems. ""No matter what type or degree of dizziness you have, this type of physical therapy is helpful in most cases,"" he says.
          Cognitive behavioral therapy, which addresses vertigo's sometimes-extreme emotional toll. ""I think we get so caught up trying to treat the condition that we ignore treating the individual,"" Dr. Naples says.
        
        Whether your vertigo is chronic, episodic, short, or long, resist the urge to stay sedentary when dizziness subsides. ""It causes more harm than good to sit and wait for the next vertigo episode,"" he says. ""Simply staying active is going to help.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/feeding-your-fitness,Feeding your fitness,"Diligently training for a marathon, Barbara alternated hard runs lasting an hour or two with easier jogs meant to give her muscles a break. But the 40-something woman couldn't figure out why those short bursts proved just as taxing as the longer treks, leaving her sore and wiped out.
        The pieces came together when Barbara met with Mary Ellen Kelly, a registered dietitian at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. To promote fat loss, Barbara confessed, she usually didn't eat after her workouts. But the zero-refueling strategy meant she was sacrificing the strength and endurance she needed to train effectively.
        ""Those long runs took so much out of her that the shorter runs became incredibly hard, because she was functioning at such an energy and protein deficit,"" Kelly recounts.
        Barbara's example highlights a dramatic distinction between the sexes: after exercise, our bodies require an entirely different approach to replace what's been lost and promote muscle recovery and growth. Optimally, women should refuel within 30 to 45 minutes after a workout, while men have up to three hours to accomplish the same task. Continually ignoring this need can lead to symptoms of low energy availability, such as fatigue and soreness.
        As Barbara learned, ""it's really hard for the body to optimize recovery if we're chronically under-fueled,"" Kelly says.
        Hormonal drivers
        For both women and men, exercise is the best kind of stress, increasing our heart rate and making muscles work harder. But it does require us to nourish ourselves properly to overcome that stress.
        That's where the similarities end, however. Why is a woman's refueling window so much shorter? Hormonal variations between the sexes underlie this difference, says Dr. Beth Frates, director of lifestyle medicine and wellness in the Department of Surgery at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Progesterone is a primary driver, exacerbating women's post-exercise muscle breakdown. This outcome is magnified for women who are peri- or postmenopausal. If they allow their muscles to remain in a breakdown state without replenishing with protein — and if they consume protein only at the beginning and end of the day — they're more likely to feel sluggish, sore, and unable to exercise at their peak.
        ""Women need to refuel with protein more quickly to oppose this breakdown,"" Dr. Frates says.
        During the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle — the week or so before a period arrives — women may also crave more carbohydrates and want to eat more.
        ""If you feel a little hungrier, it's not in your head — your body actually needs that,"" Kelly says. ""Being mindful of your cycle, listening to your hunger cues, and eating that little extra could support your training.""
        Protein-packing strategies
        Aim to consume at least 70 grams of protein throughout the day so that you begin any workout well-fueled. ""That means your muscles have been topped off and hydrated and they're ready to tap into for exercise,"" Kelly says.
        After exercise, you'll want ingest about 20 grams of protein within 45 minutes, and pair it with carbohydrates if you don't plan to eat again within the next hour or two.
        Protein-rich food choices include
        
          a cup of Greek yogurt
          3 ounces of chicken, turkey, salmon, or steak
          a scoop of whey protein powder
          a ready-to-drink protein shake.
        
        Even a big glass of chocolate milk can provide an adequate mix of the protein, carbohydrates, and electrolytes muscles should ideally receive after exercise, Kelly says.
        If, like Barbara, you're aiming for workout-driven fat loss, you can still meet your goal and refuel properly afterward. Just be strategic so you don't sacrifice muscle strength in the process, Kelly says. How? Aim for a calorie deficit at other points in the day, not after your workout time. Kelly suggests monitoring portions and limiting alcoholic drinks.
        ""If someone is doing a light workout, such as a walk or 20 or 30 minutes on an elliptical machine, the principles of intentional refueling probably don't need to be applied,"" she says. ""But if your workout is intense and your ultimate goal is weight loss, pay attention to your overall fueling patterns.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-is-leaky-gut-syndrome,What is leaky gut syndrome?,"Q.
          I've been gassy and bloated in recent months, and my sister suggested that I may have leaky gut syndrome. What's that?
        
        A. For starters, anyone who's been dealing with chronic intestinal symptoms like yours should see a doctor. There are many reasons for gas and bloating to persist, and a medical evaluation will help get to the bottom of things.
        Beyond that, while leaky gut syndrome isn't a clinical diagnosis, it may be one possible contributor to your symptoms. A ""leaky gut"" happens when the barrier between the gut and bloodstream breaks down due to inflammation in the small intestine. The resulting bacteria and toxins that seep through the gut lining can trigger a variety of intestinal problems, including bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or gastroparesis (which prevents proper stomach emptying).
        To determine what's causing your distress, your doctor will likely ask what foods, supplements, and medications you consume. She may also perform blood tests or endoscopic exams of the digestive tract to detect any infections or structural reasons for your symptoms. Sometimes, a simple change of diet — such as cutting out certain foods or adding others — does the trick. But getting properly assessed is your next step.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/guidelines-for-healthy-eating-with-diabetes,Guidelines for healthy eating with diabetes,"""What can I eat?"" is one of the most common questions that people with diabetes ask. The American Diabetes Association no longer makes specific recommendations about proportions of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Instead, its guidelines focus on developing healthy eating patterns, with the help of your doctor and a registered dietitian who has experience working with people who have diabetes.
        The guidelines include the following recommendations:
        
          Reduce overall carbohydrates. When you do eat carbs, they should come from nutrient-rich sources, such as vegetables (particularly non-starchy ones), whole grains, fruits, legumes, and dairy products, rather than from processed foods with added fat, sugar, and sodium.
          Limit your intake of saturated fat (found mainly in animal products).Even good fats such as olive oil should be eaten in moderation.
          Replace sugar-sweetened beverages (including those sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup or sucrose) with water.
          Reduce sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day, or lower if you have high blood pressure.
          Drink alcohol in moderation only if you can account for the calories in your daily meal plan. Moderate drinking is defined as one standard drink a day for women and up to two a day for men. You must be cautious, however. Alcohol can worsen low blood sugar reactions in people who take insulin or certain other diabetes medications. And because some effects of alcohol (such as drowsiness or slurred speech) resemble those of hypoglycemia, it can be hard to recognize a true diabetic emergency if you have one.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/exercise-can-ease-rheumatoid-arthritis-pain,Exercise can ease rheumatoid arthritis pain,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can cause pain and stiffness that makes moving the last thing you want to do. But staying active is important. Not only is it beneficial for your general health — it's also a way to strengthen the muscles around your joints, improve your range of motion, and give you the opportunity to take part in the activities you enjoy.
        For people with RA, it's best to take a cautious and strategic approach when starting an exercise program. An individualized program — ideally developed with the help of a physical therapist — can help you protect vulnerable joints while strengthening surrounding muscles. A well-rounded exercise program should include each of these elements:
        Aerobic conditioning. Exercise that increases your heart rate and breathing rate has many benefits, including lowering your chances of developing conditions such as diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. When choosing aerobic activities, people with RA should consider low-impact exercises such as swimming, bicycle riding, and walking.
        Resistance training. Weak muscles, whether related to inactivity or side effects of medications like steroids, can diminish your stamina and leave joints less stable. Isometric exercises — exercises that involve muscle contractions with no movement, such as clasping your hands and pressing your arms together — can be a great way to start resistance training. When pain is under control, free weights or weight machines are good options for building muscle and increasing strength.
        Stretching and flexibility exercises. Joints damaged by RA don't move with the same ease or to the same degree (also called range of motion) as healthy joints. That makes activities that lengthen and strengthen the muscles surrounding your joints, such as stretching exercises, tai chi, and yoga, especially important for people with RA.
        Balance exercises. Having RA can cause problems with gait and balance, leaving you more vulnerable to stumbles and falls. A physical therapist can recommend individualized balance-training exercises. These may include practicing standing on one leg or exercises to strengthen core muscles.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/4-ways-to-eat-your-way-to-lower-cholesterol,4 ways to eat your way to lower cholesterol,"Many people can lower their cholesterol levels simply by changing what they eat. For example, eating less meat (and leaner cuts) and more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains can potentially lower your total cholesterol by 25% or more.
        Here are four steps for lowering your cholesterol through diet.
        
          Stick with unsaturated fats and avoid saturated and trans fats. Most vegetable fats (oils) are made up of ""healthy"" unsaturated fats that are good for your heart. Foods that contain healthy fats include oily fish, nuts, seeds, and some vegetables. At the same time, try to limit your intake of foods high in saturated fat, such as many meat and dairy products. 
          Get more soluble fiber. Eating more soluble fiber, such as that found in oatmeal and fruits, can lower blood cholesterol levels when eaten as part of a healthy-fat diet.
          Include plant sterols and stanols in your diet. These naturally occurring plant compounds are similar in structure to cholesterol, so when you eat them, they help limit the amount of cholesterol your body can absorb. Plant sterols and stanols are found in an increasing number of food products such as spreads, juices, and yogurts.
          Find a diet that works for you. When a friend or relative tells you how much his or her cholesterol level dropped after trying a particular diet, you may be tempted to try it yourself. If you do, and after a few months you discover that you're not getting the same benefits, you may need to chalk it up to genetic and physiological differences. There is no one-size-fits-all diet for cholesterol control. You may need to try several approaches to find one that works for you.
        
        Although diet can be a simple and powerful way to improve cholesterol levels, it plays a bigger role for some people than for others. Don't be discouraged if you have followed a diet but haven't reached your goal blood level. Keep it up. Even if you do end up needing medication to keep your cholesterol in check, you likely will need less than if you didn't make any dietary changes.
        For more on lowering cholesterol, read Managing Your Cholesterol, a Special Health Report from Harvard Medical School.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/the-advantages-of-body-weight-exercise,The advantages of body-weight exercise,"All exercise is beneficial. But even stacked up against other types of workouts, body-weight exercise has a lot to offer. Not only does it provide an excellent workout, but it can also help you overcome some common excuses for avoiding exercise, like ""I don't have time to go to the gym"" and ""I don't have space for a stationary bike at home."" All you have to do is move your body.
        Here's a closer look at some of the pluses:
        It couldn't be more convenient.
        No matter where you are, you've got your body, so you can start exercising anywhere, anytime — in your bedroom when you wake up, in the kitchen while you're waiting for water to boil, in your hotel room when traveling. That makes it easy to find the time.
        The price is right.
        With body-weight exercise, there's nothing to buy other than a pair of shoes. You don't need stylish clothing. You don't even need a yoga mat, much less an expensive gym membership, although you can certainly do these workouts at the gym, too. You might want a few props, such as a chair, bench, or counter to modify some moves, but these are all items that you have on hand.
        The intimidation factor is low.
        You can do these exercises solo. You don't have to walk into a gym full of buff exercisers and complicated-looking weight machines that require adjustments and may still not fit you properly.
        It's effective.
        Research published in the journal Physiology and Behavior found that, as a form of resistance training, body-weight exercise helps build muscle ""independent of an external load."" But it does more than that. When researchers looked at the effects of 10 weeks of body-weight exercises on various physical fitness parameters in a small group of young women, they found improvements in seven out of nine of the parameters. The biggest gains were in aerobic capacity, with a 33% improvement. Muscle endurance, particularly in the core, increased by 11%, while lower-body power posted a 6% gain. Even flexibility was better after the training.
        You don't necessarily have to do a lot of it.
        While it's good to meet the Physical Activity Guidelines, smaller amounts of body-weight exercise can also deliver results. In a small study of active people in their 60s, Japanese researchers found that a workout consisting of eight simple lower-body exercises increased the participants' muscle strength and power by about 15% after 10 months. That may not sound like much, but during this stage of life, strength and power are often declining. What's more, the participants achieved these gains by doing only six workouts a month.
        It provides functional exercise.
        Most body-weight exercises work multiple muscles at once rather than training an isolated muscle or muscle group, as many exercise machines and dumbbell exercises do. Therefore, body-weight exercises are considered more functional, using more muscles and joints at a time, engaging balance, and mimicking everyday activities.
        It can be adjusted to your fitness level.
        It may not be obvious how to do this at first. When you're using your body as the weight, you can't just remove 10 or 20 pounds as you can with machines or dumbbells. But there are ways to modify moves to decrease or increase the resistance. You can adjust your body position — for example, doing push-ups against a wall rather than the floor — or you can change the number of times you repeat an exercise or modify the pace you're working at.
        It's good for your health.
        Literally thousands of studies have shown that the more you move, the lower your risks for heart disease, diabetes, obesity, multiple types of cancer, joint pain, and Alzheimer's disease. Exercise can also lift your mood, reduce your stress level, and improve your sleep. Body-weight exercise is no exception.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-your-face-ages-and-what-you-can-do,Why your face ages and what you can do,"Along with the wisdom, experience, and accomplishments that come with getting older, there are changes that occur in our outward appearance. Age affects every nook and cranny of the body. But changes in our faces are at the forefront.
        How the face ages
        Dozens of changes take place as the years add up, some of them obvious and familiar:
        
          foreheads expand as hairlines retreat
          ears often get a bit longer because the cartilage in them grows
          tips of noses may droop because connective tissue supporting nasal cartilage weakens.
        
        There are also structural rearrangements going on behind the scenes. When we're young, fat in the face is evenly distributed, with some pockets here and there that plump up the forehead, temples, cheeks, and areas around the eyes and mouth.
        With age, that fat loses volume, clumps up, and shifts downward, so features that were formerly round may sink, and skin that was smooth and tight gets loose and sags. Meanwhile other parts of the face gain fat, particularly the lower half, so we tend to get baggy around the chin and jowly in the neck.
        And, of course, there are the wrinkles. Those deep ones in the forehead and between the eyebrows are called expression, or animation, lines. They're the result of facial muscles continually tugging on, and eventually creasing, the skin.
        Other folds may get deeper because of the way fat decreases and moves around. Finer wrinkles are due to sun damage, smoking, and natural degeneration of elements of the skin that keep it thick and supple.
        What can I do about my aging face?
        While a gracefully aging face is a beautiful thing, there are changes that occur with age that we might like to slow down.
        One approach is to simply celebrate our age and appearance for what they are. Age-related changes in our facial appearance reflect our joys and challenges in life. But not everyone is comfortable with that, and some might like to postpone embracing those changes.
        The age-defying facelift, which surgically removes excess tissue and lifts sagging skin in the lower part of the face, is one way to try to stem the tides of time. Facelifts have improved, so the results tend to look more natural. But the surgery is expensive, and other procedures may be needed to achieve the desired results.
        Nonsurgical alternatives
        The facelift procedure is just one of the more popular cosmetic procedures. There are plenty of alternatives for altering the aging face, including rejuvenating treatments. Although most rejuvenating procedures are nonsurgical, they're not inexpensive — especially when you factor in the need for repeat treatments.
        Here is just a sample of some of the things that you can do — or get done — to give your face a more youthful appearance:
        Sun protection. Protecting your face from the sun is the single best way of keeping it youthful. You need to regularly use sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB light, with an SPF of at least 30. Wearing a wide-brimmed hat is also a good idea.
        Creams and lotions. Moisturizers soothe dry skin and may temporarily make wrinkles less noticeable. Moisturizers for the face contain water to make them less greasy, and many have substances — glycerin, for example — that may help bind water to the skin. Exfoliant creams can improve the appearance of older skin by getting rid of dead skin cells that don't slough off as readily as they did when we were young.
        Several prescription creams (Avita, Avage, Renova, Retin-A) have been shown to reduce wrinkles and so-called liver spots caused by sun exposure. These FDA-approved creams contain retinoids, compounds related to vitamin A that seem to work by inducing collagen production in the dermis and altering melanin, the pigment that causes liver spots. There are several varieties of retinoids. Tazarotene and tretinoin are two of the ones used in the FDA-approved products.
        Botulinum toxin injections. These injections are used to treat the expression lines of the forehead and between the brows. They work by partially immobilizing the muscles that form expression lines so the skin smooths out, although some deep expression lines may not go away. Botox is the familiar brand name. Other FDA-approved botulinum toxins are Myobloc and Dysport.
        Dermal fillers. Dermal fillers are used to treat lines created by lost collagen and fat. After botulinum toxin injections, dermal filler injections are the most common cosmetic procedure performed in the United States. Prime locations for the injections are two sets of parentheses: the pair of lines that extend down from the nose to the corners of the mouth, known as the nasolabial folds, and another pair that extends down from the corners of the mouth to the chin, known as marionette lines.
        Many different materials are used as dermal filler. Collagen has fallen out of favor. Currently, the most popular one is hyaluronic acid, a complex sugar found naturally in many tissues. Hyaluronic acid is more expensive than collagen but lasts longer — up to six months in the nasolabial folds. Like botulinum toxin injections, the effect of the dermal filler shots wears off after several months. How long it lasts depends on the injection site — but with repeat injections it seems to last a little longer.
        Laser treatments. Lasers can be used on certain pigments: brown, if the goal is to get rid of freckles and liver spots, red if the target is broken capillaries. They're also used for wholesale resurfacing of facial skin. The uppermost layers are stripped away, and with them, wrinkles from sun damage and scars from acne. The energy from some non-ablative resurfacing lasers passes through the outer layer of the skin to work at a deeper level, in the dermis, to stimulate inflammation, which leads to collagen formation.
        Skin needs time to recover after most laser treatments. It can take a couple of weeks to heal, depending on the type and extent of the treatment. The non-ablative treatments tend to heal a bit faster.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/one-surprising-effect-of-wildfires-itchy-irritated-skin-202406243052,"One surprising effect of wildfires: Itchy, irritated skin","Are you finding yourself with itchy, irritated skin that you can't stop scratching? Or have you wondered why your child's eczema is suddenly worse and so hard to control? Mounting evidence suggests that wildfires, which are increasing in intensity and frequency, contribute to skin problems, including eczema flares.
        What is eczema?
        Eczema is a common chronic skin condition that affects about one in 10 people in the US. Its hallmarks are inflamed and dry, itchy patches of skin.
        Atopic dermatitis is the most common type of eczema. It can run in families, often beginning in childhood. Typically, in the northern hemisphere, it grows worse during the winter season when the weather is cold and drying. Now some experts are seeing that pattern change. At Massachusetts General Hospital, for example, one dermatologist noted an unusual spike last summer in patients with flare-ups of eczema.
        Why is eczema getting worse during summer?
        In 2023, Canada experienced more than 6,000 wildfires that burned over 16 million hectares of land — an area larger than the entire state of Georgia. While far away from the devastation, the smoke reached across the US and more than 2,000 miles to Europe. Poor air quality from these distant wildfires caused eye and throat irritation and difficulty breathing.
        In Boston, Dr. Arianne Shadi Kourosh, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, also began to notice skin symptoms. Normally the dermatology clinics would see fewer than 20 people during a summer month for eczema, including atopic dermatitis. Suddenly that jumped to 160.
        Looking back at summer month records from the last four years, her research showed that the number of visits for these skin complaints tracked with the severity of air pollution. These findings are consistent with other research noting an uptick in eczema flares and psoriasis flares associated with wildfire pollution. But why?
        Researchers theorize that airborne pollutants might set off a cascade of effects within the body by activating an oxidative stress pathway. This damages the skin barrier and prompts an inflammatory response. This cascade also may play a role in the development of eczema.
        What can you do to protect your skin?
        Air pollutants in wildfire smoke may harm multiple organs — not just your heart and lungs, but also our skin, it seems. So, when outdoor air quality is bad due to wildfires, limiting your exposure can help reduce health risks. While we can say the same for industrial air pollution, wildfire pollution is likely worse due to its additional toxic particles.
        
          Seek help if you're itching. Check with a dermatologist or your health team if you think wildfire smoke or other forms of air pollution might be affecting your skin.
          Check local air quality.AirNow.gov shares local, real-time air quality information and activity guidance. When recommended, stay indoors if possible. Shut doors, windows, and any outdoor air intake vents.
          Protect your skin. When you're outdoors, wear a mineral-based sunscreen containing zinc or titanium. While most other sunscreens work through a chemical reaction to absorb the ultraviolet (UV) rays that damage skin, zinc and titanium sunscreens help by forming a barrier over skin that reflects off UV rays. The barrier also reduces the amount of pollutant particles getting to the skin to set off the inflammatory cascade. Wearing sunscreen protects against skin cancer, as well.
          Wash up. After coming back inside, cleansing your skin and applying a hypoallergenic moisturizer will help keep it healthy. If you do have eczema, choose cleansers and moisturizing products recommended by your dermatologist or health care provider.","Wynne Armand, MD","June 24, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-cicadas-are-here-hows-your-appetite-202406143048,The cicadas are here: How's your appetite?,"You've probably heard the news: Cicadas are coming. Or — wait — they're already here.
        And are they ever! Due to an unusual overlap of the lifecycles of two types (or broods) of cicadas, trillions of cicadas are expected to emerge in the US by the end of June, especially in the Midwest.
        If you'd like to see where they've already arrived, track them here. And if you're wondering if this cicada-palooza could help with grocery bills, read on to decide for yourself how appealing and how safe snacking on cicadas is for you. The pros and cons could change your outlook on the impending swarm.
        What to know about cicadas
        Don't worry, cicadas are largely harmless to humans. In fact, their appearance is welcome in places where people routinely snack on them as a low-cost source of calories and protein.
        Estimates suggest up to two billion people regularly eat insects, especially in South and Central America, Asia, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Cicadas, when available, are among the most popular. And if you thought no one in the US eats cicadas, check out this video from a May 2024 baseball game.
        Are you tempted to eat cicadas?
        For plenty of people, cicadas aren't the food of choice. Some people can't get past the idea of eating insects as food. That's understandable: after all, the culture in which we are raised has a powerful influence on what we consider acceptable in our diets. Something some Americans might find off-putting (such as eating snakes) is common in China and Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, people outside the US find aspects of the typical Western diet unappealing (such as root beer, peanut butter and jelly, and processed cheese).
        But some people shouldn't eat cicadas because it could be dangerous for them.
        Why you should — or shouldn't — eat cicadas
        Eating cicadas is common in many parts of the world because they are
        
          nutritious: cicadas are low in fat and high in protein, including multiple essential amino acids
          inexpensive or free
          tasty (or so I'm told): descriptions of their flavor vary from nutty to citrusy to smoky and slightly crunchy.
        
        In years when cicadas emerge, recipes for dishes containing cicadas emerge as well.
        Then again, there are several good reasons to avoid making cicadas a part of your diet, including these:
        
          You just can't get past the ""ick"" factor. Adventurous eaters may be willing to try or even embrace consuming cicadas, while others will be unable to view the idea as anything other than horrifying.
          You find the taste or consistency unappealing.
          You're ""cicada intolerant."" Some people get stomach upset, nausea, or diarrhea if they eat too many cicadas.
          You're pregnant or breastfeeding, or are a young child. Concerns about even low levels of pesticides or other toxins in cicadas have led to recommendations that these groups not eat them. Doesn't this suggest the rest of us should also steer clear? Well, thus far, at least, there's no evidence that toxins in cicadas are causing health problems.
        
        But there is one more very important entry on this list: people with a shellfish allergy should not eat cicadas. Odd, right?
        The shellfish-cicada connection
        Cicadas are biologically related to lobsters, shrimp, crabs, and other shellfish. So if you're allergic to shellfish, you might also be allergic to cicadas. A particular protein called tropomyosin is responsible for the allergy. It's found in shellfish as well as in many insects, including cicadas.
        The allergic reaction occurs after eating the cicada. Just being around them or handling them won't trigger a reaction.
        Among people with a shellfish allergy, developing a reaction after eating cicadas could be a bigger problem than it seems: up to 10% of people have shellfish allergies and, as noted, insect consumption is common worldwide.
        Is it okay for your dog or cat to eat cicadas?
        Walking your dog after the emergence of cicadas can be a new and exciting experience for you and your pet! Dogs may chase after cicadas and eat them. Cats might, too, if given the chance. That can be a problem if your pet eats too many, as some will experience stomach upset or other digestive problems.
        While the insects are considered harmless to dogs, the American Kennel Club says it's best to steer them away from cicadas once they've eaten a few.
        Which other insects trigger allergies?
        While insect-related allergic reactions (think bee stings) and infections (like Lyme disease) are well known, the insect-food-allergy connection is a more recent discovery.
        One recently recognized condition is the alpha-gal syndrome, in which a person bitten by certain ticks develops an allergy to meat. The name comes from a sugar called galactose-α-1,3-galactose (or alpha-gal) found in many types of meat including beef, lamb, pork, and rabbit. According to the CDC, up to 450,000 people in the US may have developed this condition since 2010.
        There aren't many rigorous studies of the overlap of insects and food allergies, so there are probably others awaiting discovery.
        The bottom line
        When it comes to eating cicadas, I'll pass. It's not because of the risks. I've never had a problem with shellfish, and for most people the health risks of eating cicadas seem quite small. It's just unappealing to me, and I'm not a particularly adventurous eater.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/omega-3-foods-incorporating-healthy-fats-into-your-diet,Omega-3 foods: Incorporating healthy fats into your diet,"Found in foods such as fish and nuts, omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat that your body can't make on its own. Learn why these healthy fats are important to your health, and how to get them.

Health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids

Don't let the name ""fatty acid"" fool you. Omega-3 fatty acids are good for your body. These healthy fats may help keep your heart healthy, protect against stroke, and offer other benefits for your health.

In fact, the American Heart Association (AHA) has recommended omega-3s from fish and fish oil for the past 20 years to reduce cardiovascular events, such as heart attack or stroke, in people who already have cardiovascular disease.

Research shows that omega-3s are good for your health in several ways.


	Heart health. Omega-3s benefit the heart and blood vessels by reducing triglycerides, lowering the risk of arrhythmias, slowing plaque buildup in arteries, and slightly lowering blood pressure.
	Arthritis. Omega-3s may help alleviate symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
	Brain and eye development. Research shows that omega-3 fatty acids, particularly a type of omega-3 known as DHA, are important for the development of brain and visual functions.
	Disease prevention. Studies suggest that people who consume more omega-3s may have a lower risk of developing age-related macular degeneration. Research has been mixed on whether omega-3s reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.


Increase your omega-3 intake through diet

You can get omega-3s from the foods you eat, especially fatty fish and some plant foods.

The three forms of omega-3s are:


	alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)
	eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
	docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).


ALA is found mainly in plant oils such as canola oil and flaxseed oil, while seafood is the best source of EPA and DHA. Some foods, such as eggs, yogurt, and milk, may be fortified with omega-3s. Your body can convert small amounts of ALA into EPA and DHA, but not enough to support your body's needs.

The best approach to getting omega-3s in your diet is to include nuts, seeds, and healthy oils in your diet, along with fish and other omega-3 fortified foods. This approach can help you get a variety of healthy fats.

Fatty fish: The ultimate source of omega-3s

EPA- and DHA-rich fatty fish is an excellent source of omega-3s. The AHA advises eating at least two servings of fatty fish, or fish rich in omega-3s, per week. Each serving should be about 3 ounces.

Examples of fatty fish include:


	salmon
	mackerel
	trout
	sardines
	sea bass.


Plant-based omega-3 foods

ALA-rich foods include plant-based oils, seeds, and nuts such as:


	flaxseeds and flaxseed oil
	chia seeds
	walnuts
	canola oil
	soybean oil.


Among plant-based foods, ground flaxseeds and flaxseed oil have the highest amounts of ALA. An easy way to boost your intake of ALA-rich foods is to sprinkle ground flaxseeds on granola, snack on nuts during the day, or try chia pudding as a snack.

Omega-3 supplements: What to consider

Omega-3 supplements may be derived from:


	fish oil
	fish liver oil (such as cod liver oil)
	algal oils (vegetarian).


Side effects of omega-3 supplements are typically mild but may include unpleasant breath, bad-smelling sweat, headache, heartburn, nausea, and diarrhea. The FDA recommends limiting total EPA and DHA from supplements to no more than 5 grams per day.

Omega-3 supplements can have an anticoagulant effect, which means they decrease the ability of your blood to clot. This effect can compound the effect of an anticoagulant medication like warfarin (Coumadin) or apixaban (Eliquis). Anyone taking an anticoagulant medication should check with their doctor first before taking an omega-3 supplement.

Most health experts agree whole foods, which contain a range of nutrients, are the best source of omega-3s.",Jenette Restivo,"June 14, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-rid-of-bloating-tips-for-relief,How to get rid of bloating: Tips for relief,"Why am I so bloated? Chances are, you've thought this at some point. Bloating is very common: nearly one in seven Americans reported experiencing it over the course of a week, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology.
        That tight, full feeling of bloating can be uncomfortable. And it's often accompanied by distension, in which the abdomen swells in size. The good news is there's a lot you can do with lifestyle, including diet and exercise, to relieve symptoms.
        Understanding bloating: Causes and triggers
        Bloating results when too much gas builds up in the abdomen. Here's a quick look at some of the most common reasons for excess gas buildup and bloating.
        Swallowing too much air. You swallow air every time you eat or drink. But if you consume food or fluid very quickly, you may gulp down extra air every time you swallow.
        Certain foods. Fruits, veggies, whole grains, and beans are all good for you, but they are harder for your gastrointestinal (GI) tract to digest. Vegetables like cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli, for example, all contain the carbohydrate raffinose. Your body can't break this substance down until it reaches your colon, where the bacteria who devour it release gas.
        Food intolerance. Some people are lactose intolerant, which means they have trouble digesting the milk sugar lactose. As a result, they may notice bloating after they eat or drink dairy products. Others have fructose intolerance, which means they develop GI symptoms after they eat foods high in fructose, a sugar naturally found in fruits and honey as well as table sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup.
        A slowing system. As you get older, your digestive system tends to slow down. This can cause gas to build up in your GI tract and trigger bloating.
        SIBO. Some people have too many bacteria in their small intestine, a condition known as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO can lead to an imbalance of bacteria that support digestion, leading to symptoms like bloating as well as constipation and diarrhea.
        Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Bloating is a common symptoms of IBS, a condition characterized by chronic belly pain and altered bowel habits.
        Most people get bloated occasionally. But if it happens a lot, or if you have other symptoms like stomach pain, unexplained weight loss, or bloody stools, see your doctor. They'll want to check for a more serious condition like inflammatory bowel disease or even colon cancer.
        Dietary changes to reduce bloating
        The following dietary tweaks can help to reduce bloating.
        Keep a diary. For a few weeks, note what you ate, when you ate, and when you felt especially bloated. This may help you and your doctor identify foods that are problematic.
        Remove or decrease quantities of key culprits. Some of the top offenders for bloating include:
        
          carbonated beverages like soda and beer
          dairy products: you can switch to lactose-free milks (Lactaid, others) or plant-based milks like almond milk instead
          sugar-free gum and candies — they contain artificial sweeteners that can cause bloating
          beans
          fruits high in fructose such as apples, apricots, bananas, peaches, pears, and dried fruit
          cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower.
        
        Consider a low-FODMAP diet. If the above steps don't help, you may want to consider this eating pattern, which avoids certain types of carbohydrates that are hard to digest. Since this diet can be very restrictive, it's best to do it under the guidance of a nutritionist.
        Mindful eating practices to prevent bloating
        If you gobble down your meals, you may find that you're bloated afterwards. When you eat fast, you swallow air. You may also overeat. Both contribute to bloating.
        One way to help prevent this is to practice mindful eating. That means you focus on your food rather than your phone, TV, or another distraction. Some ways to eat mindfully include:
        
          Eat with chopsticks, or with your non-dominant hand (so if you're a righty, eat with your left hand).
          Chew your food 30 times per bite.
          Eat in a screen-free zone — that means no smartphone, computer, or TV.
          Plate your food rather than eating it straight from a container or serving dish.
          Eat sitting down.
          Make your meal last at least 20 minutes.
        
        Physical activities to keep bloating at bay
        Staying active is good for your brain, heart, and even your gut. According to a 2023 review published in the Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine, exercise — whether it's walking, running, biking, swimming, or doing yoga — appears to help relieve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, which include bloating. It may also help relieve stress, which has also been linked to worsening of bloating.
        If you can't fit in a regular workout, at least try to take a stroll after meals. People who took a 10-to-15-minute walk after they ate reported less bloating, according to a 2021 study.
        Home remedies for bloating relief
        There are a lot of products out there claiming to cure bloating. While there's no magic way to instantly relieve gas, here are a few things you can try at home.
        Cook with anise. This herb has also been shown to reduce bloating in people with IBS and dyspepsia.
        Try over-the-counter medications. The most popular one is simethicone, found in products like Gas-X or Maalox Anti-Gas. Simethicone helps to break up gas bubbles. Other products, like CharcoCaps, contain activated charcoal. These products may help with occasional bloating, but there's no good evidence any work.
        Consider alpha-d-galactosidase. Also known as Beano, this over-the-counter product helps to break down certain difficult-to-digest carbohydrates found in beans and some vegetables.",Hallie Levine,"June 11, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/power-your-paddle-sports-with-three-great-exercises-202204192726,Power your paddle sports with three great exercises,"On the Gulf Coast of Florida where I live, the telltale sign of summer is not an influx of beachcombers, afternoon storms that arrive exactly at 2 p.m., or the first hurricane warning, but the appearance of hundreds of paddleboarders dotting the inlet waters.
        From afar, paddleboarding looks almost spiritual — people standing on nearly invisible boards and gliding across the surface as if walking on water.
        But this popular water sport offers a serious workout, just as kayaking and canoeing do. While floating along and casually dipping a paddle in the water may look effortless, much goes on beneath the surface, so to speak.
        As warm weather beckons and paddle season arrives, it pays to get key muscles in shape before heading out on the water.
        Tuning up muscles: Focus on core, back, arms, and shoulders
        ""Paddling a kayak, canoe, or paddleboard relies on muscles that we likely haven't used much during winter,"" says Kathleen Salas, a physical therapist with Spaulding Adaptive Sports Centers at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Network. ""Even if you regularly weight train, the continuous and repetitive motions involved in paddling require endurance and control of specific muscles that need to be properly stretched and strengthened.""
        While paddling can be a whole-body effort (even your legs contribute), three areas do the most work and thus need the most conditioning: the core, back, and arms and shoulders.
        
          Core. Your core comprises several muscles, but the main ones for paddling include the rectus abdominis (that famed ""six-pack"") and the obliques, located on the side and front of your abdomen. The core acts as the epicenter around which every movement revolves — from twisting to bending to stabilizing your trunk to generate power.
          Back: Paddling engages most of the back muscles, but the ones that carry the most load are the latissimus dorsi muscles, also known as the lats, and the erector spinae. The lats are the large V-shaped muscles that connect your arms to your vertebral column. They help protect and stabilize your spine while providing shoulder and back strength. The erector spinae, a group of muscles that runs the length of the spine on the left and right, helps with rotation.
          Arms and shoulders: Every paddle stroke engages the muscles in your arms (biceps) and the top of your shoulder (deltoids).
        
        Many exercises specifically target these muscles, but here are three that can work multiple paddling muscles in one move. Add them to your workouts to help you get ready for paddling season. If you haven't done these exercises before, try the first two without weights until you can do the movement smoothly and with good form.
        Three great exercises to prep for paddling
        Wood chop
        
          
          
        
        Muscles worked: Deltoids, obliques, rectus abdominis, erector spinae
Reps: 8–12 on each side
Sets: 1–3
Rest: 30–90 seconds between sets
        Starting position: Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell with both hands. Hinge forward at your hips and bend your knees to sit back into a slight squat. Rotate your torso to the right and extend your arms to hold the dumbbell on the outside of your right knee.
        Movement: Straighten your legs to stand up as you rotate your torso to the left and raise the weight diagonally across your body and up to the left, above your shoulder, while keeping your arms extended. In a chopping motion, slowly bring the dumbbell down and across your body toward the outside of your right knee. This is one rep. Finish all reps, then repeat on the other side. This completes one set.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Keep your spine neutral and your shoulders down and back
          Reach only as far as is comfortable.
          Keep your knees no farther forward than your toes when you squat.
        
        Make it easier: Do the exercise without a dumbbell.
        Make it harder: Use a heavier dumbbell.

Reps: 8–12
Sets: 1–3
Rest: 30–90 seconds between sets
        Starting position: Stand with a weight in your left hand and a bench or sturdy chair on your right side. Place your right hand and knee on the bench or chair seat. Let your left arm hang directly under your left shoulder, fully extended toward the floor. Your spine should be neutral, and your shoulders and hips squared.
        Movement: Squeeze your shoulder blades together, then bend your elbow to slowly lift the weight toward your ribs. Return to the starting position. Finish all reps, then repeat with the opposite arm. This completes one set.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Keep your shoulders squared throughout.
          Keep your elbow close to your side as you lift the weight.
          Keep your head in line with your spine.
        
        Make it easier: Use a lighter weight.
        Make it harder: Use a heavier weight.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/mushroom-coffee-worth-a-taste,Mushroom coffee: Worth a taste?,"Prized for adding a rich, brothy flavor known as umami to savory dishes, and rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, mushrooms are delicious, and good for you, too. But until recently, you probably never considered adding them to your coffee.
        However, mushroom coffee is enjoying a moment in the spotlight, with fans of this fungi-infused brew claiming that mushroom coffee's health benefits include better sleep, more energy, improved focus, immune-boosting benefits, and reduced inflammation.
        Here's a look at whether mushroom coffee's health benefits stack up to the hype.
        What is mushroom coffee?
        Mushroom coffee is typically made from medicinal mushrooms, rather than the culinary mushrooms you buy at the grocery store. Common varieties used in mushroom coffee mixes include chaga, lion's mane, reishi, cordyceps, king trumpet, and turkey tail, all chosen for their real (or perceived) health benefits.
        By the time they're harvested, dried, and processed, the mushrooms in this eponymous brew are barely noticeable, particularly when they're blended with coffee beans, cacao, or tea blends like matcha or chai. Most people report a ""nutty"" or ""earthy"" taste — or they don't notice any flavor at all.
        What are the potential health benefits of mushroom coffee?
        The idea behind mushroom coffee is simple: to harness the health benefits of medicinal mushrooms in a convenient and (hopefully) tasty coffee drink.
        Mushroom coffee brands often cite the medicinal use of mushrooms dating back thousands of years to traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic practices. These coffee brands claim that mushroom coffee's benefits include improved mental and physical performance, better immunity, and more restful sleep. Some brands even claim that mushroom coffee may help with weight loss by boosting your metabolism and promoting fat burning.
        However, there is very little research on medicinal mushrooms that includes humans. So while studies conducted in test tubes or animals do show some compelling health benefits associated with consuming medicinal mushrooms, the same benefits may not apply to humans.
        The bottom line: Is mushroom coffee worth a try?
        Maybe. There are many health benefits associated with mushrooms. According to a recent review published in the journal Molecules, medicinal mushrooms popular in many fungi-infused coffee blends do have immune-boosting properties and may help regulate metabolism. And, thanks to high antioxidant activity, medicinal mushrooms may also help slow down the aging process.
        But again, well-designed clinical trials on humans are lacking. And none of that research was conducted on mushroom coffee, so there's no guarantee that any health benefits will be retained after the mushrooms are processed and blended into coffee drinks.
        So while you probably won't do any harm by swapping your normal cup of joe for a mug of mushroom coffee (and you don't mind paying extra for it), you'd be better off serving a side of shiitakes alongside your morning eggs and cup of java. They have fiber and are low in calories and fat — and they're delicious, to boot.",Lindsay Warner,"June 4, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/want-a-stronger-core-skip-the-sit-ups,Want a stronger core? Skip the sit-ups,"Sit-ups once ruled as the way to tighter abs and a slimmer waistline. Now plank exercises, in which you assume a position and hold it, are the gold standard for working your core, while classic sit-ups and crunches have fallen out of favor.
        Why planks over sit-ups?
        One reason is that sit-ups are hard on your back. They push your curved spine against the floor and work your hip flexors, the muscles that run from the thighs to the lumbar vertebrae in the lower back. When the hip flexors are too strong or too tight, they tug on the lower spine, which can create lower back discomfort.
        In addition, plank exercises recruit a better balance of muscles on the front, sides, and back of the body than sit-ups, which target just a few muscles.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/are-you-getting-essential-nutrients-from-your-diet,Probiotics and prebiotics: what's really important,"Probiotics and prebiotics are a hot topic these days. You've likely seen many ads on television and online for supplements and foods that promise to deliver helpful bacteria and their benefits. Here's what you need to know before purchasing these products.
        Your large intestine contains 100 trillion ""good"" bacteria that are essential to health. Called the microbiome, these beneficial microbes help maintain healthy bowel function, and may even help with conditions like inflammatory bowel disease. Research suggests they may even play a role in regulating weight and mood.
        Everyone starts with their own unique microbiome at birth. We add to these through the foods we eat.
        Here are some of the best ways to add healthful bacteria to your microbiome:
        
          Yogurt and kefir. Be sure to look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label to make sure you are getting live cultures.
          Fermented foods. Beneficial microbes are the ""cooks"" for some familiar foods. For example, they turn cabbage into sauerkraut, cucumbers into sour pickles, soybeans into miso, and sweetened tea into kombucha. When the products have been pasteurized — as most packaged fermented foods are — the microbes will be dead. The best solution is to buy from delis where they do the pickling themselves, or natural food stores that carry fermented foods. Or make your own; you can find clear and easy instructions in books and online.
        
        There are also probiotic supplements on the market, of course. But none have proven medical indications. It's best to stick with dietary sources rich in pre- and probiotics. 
        You can help your body produce healthy gut bacteria. Here's how:
        
          Include plenty of foods rich in insoluble fiber, which tend to contain the most prebiotics. You'll find them whole-grain products such as oatmeal and whole-grain breads, as well as in vegetables like asparagus, leeks, onions, and garlic, and starchy vegetables like sweet potatoes and corn. Beans, lentils, and peas are also good sources.
          Limit sugar, saturated fat, and processed foods. These can deplete the good bacteria in the gut. As always, try to stick with whole, unprocessed foods.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/how-to-silence-snoring,How to silence snoring,"Snoring is generally harmless, but it can be annoying, especially for your bed partner. Fortunately, you can take steps to alleviate the problem. Start by making lifestyle changes and trying simple home remedies. You can also try one of the many products marketed as stop-snoring aids.
        But if you snore and you also wake up gasping for air or frequently feel sleepy or tired during the day, you likely have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea can cause hypertension and more serious medical problems. Consult a doctor if your snoring affects the quality of your sleep.
        
          Lifestyle changes and home remedies
        
        You can try these do-it-yourself suggestions to help keep your airway open during sleep:
        Avoid alcohol — or don't drink alcohol within three hours of bedtime. This will help prevent your airway muscles from becoming slack while you sleep.
        Lose weight if you are overweight or obese. Extra fat tissue in the neck and throat can narrow the airways. Losing some weight could help to open the airways for someone who is overweight or obese, although many people who are lean also snore.
        Try home remedies for nasal obstruction issues. If your nose is stuffy due to mucus, try rinsing your sinuses with saline. If you have allergies, reduce dust mites and pet dander in your bedroom or use an allergy medication. If swollen nasal tissues are the problem, a humidifier or medication may reduce swelling.
        If you smoke, quit. In addition to smoking's many other negative health effects, people who smoke are also more likely to snore. Possible reasons include nightly nicotine withdrawal, which can disrupt sleep, as well as increased swelling and irritation in the upper airway. In fact, even secondhand smoke from another member of your household may increase your risk of snoring.
        Sleep on your side or elevate your head. When you sleep flat on your back, your tongue falls back and presses against the top of your airway, so sleeping on your side may help. To help you stay on your side, try pressing a long, oversized body pillow against your back. You can also wear a small fanny pack filled with tennis balls, or tape a tennis ball or rolled-up pair of socks to the back of your pajamas. This makes lying on your back uncomfortable.
        Or you can try elevating your head by using an extra pillow or a wedge pillow, or by propping up the head of your bed using blocks of wood under the top of the bed frame.
        These lifestyle changes and home remedies may help with simple snoring. However, if you have periods of gasping during sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness as well as snoring, it could be sleep apnea and let your doctor know.

The average brain declines in volume and weight by about 5% per decade after age 40, with a steeper decline after age 70. Brain shrinkage particularly affects the brain regions involved with learning and memory, like the frontal lobe and hippocampus. A smaller brain volume is also linked to less robust communication between brain regions, which leads to slower processing speed and can impair other cognitive functions.

""These usual age-related brain changes can affect thinking and make it harder to recall words and names, focus on tasks, and process new information,"" says Dr. Daneshvar.

The brains of super-agers, however, shrink at about half the average rate, and their memory and cognitive skills stay on par with younger brains. What goes on inside super-ager brains that accounts for this? Harvard investigators, publishing in the November 2021 issue of Cerebral Cortex, offer a clue.

They recruited 40 older adults who were identified as super-agers. The super-agers took a memory test while their brains were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which shows the activity of different brain areas. For comparison, the researchers also carried out the memory test and fMRI scan on 41 young adults (average age 25). The super-agers performed similarly to the younger people on the memory tests. The fMRI also showed that activity in the super-agers' visual cortex, the brain area that processes visual input, was similar to that in the younger brains.

What's super about super-agers?

Studies have found that genetics is the greatest component in the state of aging brains.

""Science has identified about 100 genes common among super-agers, although it's unclear which ones in particular are linked with neurological benefits,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. ""If you win the lottery and are born with those genes, you have a good chance of becoming a super-ager."" But what if your genetic scratch-off is a bust? Can you still be a winner with super-aging?

""Super-agers also tend to follow a healthy lifestyle, and many reach their 90s free of problems like heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Here's a look at the healthy daily habits of many super-agers and how they may help protect your brain.

Eat more ""superfoods."" Many super-agers follow diets rich in foods high in antioxidants, polyphenols, and omega-3 fatty acids. These nutrients have been shown to fight inflammation and help protect the body from disease-causing cell damage. Examples include berries, whole grains (oatmeal, quinoa), fatty fish (salmon, trout), nuts (walnuts, almonds), olive oil, cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower), avocados, and green tea.

Unsurprisingly, these foods are staples in many plant-based diets associated with brain and heart health, like the MIND, DASH, and Mediterranean diets. It's not certain which of the foods or amounts are ideal, so focus on meals that contain a variety of them.

Be more active. Super-agers tend to engage in more physical activity. Regular exercise has been found to help maintain brain volume and cognitive function, even if you begin later in life. Exercise sparks physiological changes in the body, such as the production of growth factors — chemicals that enhance brain cell function and survival and can actually stimulate formation of new brain cells. Many studies have suggested that the parts of the brain that control thinking and memory are larger in volume in people who exercise than in people who don't.

It doesn't matter what type of exercise you do. Research has found that walking, swimming, other aerobic activity (especially high-intensity interval training, or HIIT), strength training, tai chi, and yoga are all associated with improved memory. But consistency is key. ""Being active on a regular basis leads to greater brain benefits,"" says Dr. Daneshvar.

Be more social. Super-agers tend to have more social interactions. Studies have shown that regular social engagement is associated with healthier brains. The opposite is also true: social isolation is linked to lower volume of gray matter in brain regions related to cognition.

Challenge yourself. Super-agers challenge their brains, and studies have shown that learning new things as you age aids memory. For instance, study a second language, learn a musical instrument, or adopt a new hobby.

Get good sleep. Super-agers also prioritize sleep. (Guidelines suggest seven to nine hours nightly.) ""During sleep, the brain clears away metabolic waste that builds up early in the development of Alzheimer's disease,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. A study in the November 2022 issue of the journal Sleep found that trouble falling or staying asleep three or more nights per week for three months boosted the risk for worsening memory in older adults.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/try-this-get-low-with-deep-squats,Try this: Get low with deep squats,"In many Asian countries, the deep squat is learned at an early age — knees fully bent, hips flexed, heels down, with the buttocks low to the ground. The posture is used for eating, reading, socializing, relaxing, and some household chores. It's also a sign of fitness as it requires flexibility and mobility at the hips, knees, and ankles, and lower-back strength, to drop into the squat, hold it, and rise.
        Most people find a deep squat challenging at first. But with practice, one can enjoy the many benefits of ""going low."" (Check with your doctor first if you have any knee, ankle, or hip issues.)
        1. Position yourself within easy reach of a sturdy waist-high stabilizer, such as a table or chair back.
        2. Plant your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider with your toes pointed slightly outward.
        3. Holding on to the support, slowly lower your weight until you're in a traditional sitting position. Find your balance, and then squat as low as comfortable while still holding the support. Your heels may come off the floor at first, but as you progress, strive to keep your feet flat.
        4. Try to hold this position for 10 to 20 seconds and then use the support, if needed, to stand. Rest for a minute and repeat two to three more times, resting in between.
        As you progress, try to go deeper into the squat, hold each squat longer, and eventually avoid using any support.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/3-kettlebell-moves,3 kettlebell moves,"There are many ways to exercise at home using only your body weight, but investing in kettlebells can expand your workout repertoire.
        ""Kettlebells don't take up much room, as you can easily store them under the bed, and you can use them to do virtually any type of movement for an all-around workout that hits the major muscles,"" says Nadia Havens, a strength and conditioning specialist with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Kettlebells look like balls or bells with handles on top. They range in weight from five to 30 pounds and higher. Unlike a dumbbell, the kettlebell's weight is offset from the handle. This can make for a more challenging workout, as you need a combination of muscle strength, balance, core stability, flexibility, and coordination to control the kettlebell weight. ""Also, for some people, kettlebells are more comfortable to hold and move in your hand, so people of any age can use them with greater confidence,"" says Havens.
        Begin with a moderately challenging kettlebell weight — one that lets you do five to 10 good repetitions of an exercise. ""If you are not fatigued by the end, it's too light,"" says Havens. As you progress, invest in a few heavier kettlebells, or alter the tempo so that the exercise movement is slower.
        Here are three kettlebell moves to get you going. Depending on your overall health and medical history, it may be a good idea to check with your doctor before trying kettlebell exercises, especially if you have osteoporosis or problems with balance.
        Swings
        Swings target the buttocks, hips, backs of the thighs, and lower back. They also can improve your posture, since you engage your back and core muscles during the movement. The swing is a simple three-step exercise:
        1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. Hold a kettlebell with both hands using an overhand grip, arms extended down in front of you, so the kettlebell hangs between your legs.
        2. Bend your knees further and push your hips back until the kettlebell is between and behind your legs. Then straighten up as you swing the kettlebell up to the level of your chest or eyes.
        3. Let the weight swing back down between your legs as you bend at your hips and slightly bend your knees again. This returns you to the starting position. Swing up again and continue to repeat this back-and-forth swinging motion.
        Begin with a light weight to get a feel for the swinging movement. Also, use a kettlebell with a handle wide enough to grip with two hands, and consider wearing weight-lifting gloves, as some kettlebell handles can be slippery.
        Do up to 10 swings, or as many as possible while keeping good form. Rest and repeat the sequence up to two more times. Another approach is to do intervals, where you swing for 30 seconds followed by a 30-second rest period and repeat the cycle three to five times.
        Havens recommends having a trainer show you how to execute a proper swing before trying it on your own. ""Many people squat during swings to help propel the weight up, but you want to thrust your hips forward during the upward swing,"" she says. ""This is a more explosive movement than rising from a regular squat, and it works the buttock and thigh muscles more.""
        Halos
        This movement works the abdomen, back, and shoulders.
        1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. With both hands, hold a kettlebell over and behind your head.
        2. Keeping your lower body stationary and your abdominal muscles tight, circle the kettlebell clockwise over your head four or five times. Then circle counterclockwise four or five times. This completes one set. Rest and repeat twice.
        To make it easier, make smaller circles or use a lighter kettlebell. For a challenge, do up to 10 circles each way, make larger circles, or use a heavier kettlebell.
        Farmer's walk
        This exercise works your arms, shoulders, and upper back.
        1. Hold a kettlebell in each hand, like you're carrying buckets, with your head up and shoulders back.
        2. Take 20 steps and then turn around and walk back to the starting point to complete one rep. Repeat three to five times.
        Another option is to hold a kettlebell only in one hand and walk the same distance. (Make sure you don't lean to the side as you walk.) Repeat while holding the kettlebell in the other hand. These movements strengthen your core and buttock muscles and help you carry everyday objects with better control.
        A variation to the farmer's walk is the goblet carry. Grab a kettlebell by the handle with two hands and hold it in front of your face as if you're about to take a sip from the handle. Then walk 20 steps out and then turn around and walk back. Repeat three to five times.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-low-should-ldl-cholesterol-go,How low should LDL cholesterol go?,"When it comes to reducing ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, how low should you go? ""People who are at high risk for cardiovascular diseases can benefit from driving LDL levels as low as possible to help reduce their risk for heart attacks and strokes,"" says cardiologist Dr. Christopher Cannon, editor in chief of the Harvard Heart Letter. ""Across many large clinical trials, for LDL, the lower the better.""
        The good and the bad
        Cholesterol is a fatty substance that occurs naturally in the body. The body uses it to make cell membranes and certain hormones. The fat you consume from food is absorbed in the intestine and transported to the liver, which converts it into cholesterol and then releases it into the bloodstream.
        Eating high-cholesterol foods often has only a modest impact on cholesterol in the blood, but many such foods are also high in saturated fats, which have a greater effect on cholesterol levels. ""Most of your cholesterol level is determined genetically,"" says Dr. Cannon.
        There are two main types of cholesterol: LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).  LDL is called ""bad"" because excess amounts in the bloodstream can lodge inside artery walls. These deposits, called plaques, can rupture and trigger clotting that blocks blood flow to the heart or brain, causing a heart attack or stroke.
        By comparison, HDL has in the past been considered ""good"" because some forms of HDL collect excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and artery walls. Still, notes Dr. Cannon, ""many clinical trials have found that raising blood levels of HDL does not lower the risk of heart attack or stroke, so the focus is on lowering LDL.""
        By the numbers
        Current guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology set optimal LDL levels for the general population at below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL); 100 to 159 mg/dL is deemed high, and 160 mg/dL and higher is considered dangerous.
        People with known cardiovascular disease should aim for LDL levels below 70 mg/dL. ""Thus, across the spectrum of patients, the higher risk ones have a lower goal for LDL,"" says Dr. Cannon.
        Besides high LDL levels, having one or more other factors also can contribute to your cardiovascular risk, such as
        
          a family history of premature heart disease (a father or brother who was diagnosed at 55 or younger, or a mother or sister diagnosed before age 65)
          smoking
          obesity
          diabetes
          high blood pressure
          low levels of HDL (below 40 mg/dL).
        
        Why the focus on 70 mg/dL? ""Studies have shown that when LDL falls below this number, plaques in arteries get smaller and they stabilize, which lowers the risk for heart attacks and stroke,"" says Dr. Cannon.
        But how far below 70 mg/dL should you go? Clinical trials have shown and European guidelines recommend that people with cardiovascular disease at the highest risk should aim for LDL levels below 55 mg/dL. Dr. Cannon notes that the U.S. guidelines have not been updated since 2018, and believes they will eventually follow Europe's lead and make 55 mg/dL the new target for high-risk individuals.
        What about people who are not at high risk? In most people in this group, LDL levels between 100 and 130 mg/dL may be acceptable. ""However, we still generally aim for LDL levels below 100, since benefits have been seen in trials that look at ways to prevent cardiovascular disease,"" says Dr. Cannon. ""Ultimately, your doctor can suggest the ideal target LDL based on your cardiac risk factors and history.""
        Lifestyle and medications
        The first step to lowering high LDL levels is making dietary changes — cutting down on saturated fat by adopting a heart-healthy diet like the Mediterranean, DASH, or other similar plant-based diets — losing weight, and increasing exercise.
        But often medication is needed to help drive down very high LDL levels and keep them low. This usually begins with a type of drug called a statin.
        Statins work to lower LDL by blocking an enzyme in the liver that helps make cholesterol. The drugs also have anti-inflammatory properties, and inflammation is a known contributor to plaque buildup. Another benefit: statins help prevent plaques from breaking open and releasing chemicals that stimulate blood clot formation, which leads to heart artery blockage and a heart attack. Depending on your LDL level, your doctor will recommend the best statin and dosage for your situation.
        The downside to statins is the possible side effects. The most common are achy muscles. If this happens to you, your doctor can temporarily lower the dose or switch to a different statin.
        While statins are the first-line drug choice, three other classes of medications also can help reduce LDL — ezetimibe (Zetia), bempedoic acid (Nexletol), and PCSK9 inhibitors (Repatha, Praluent, or Leqvio). ""Any of the three can be added to or substituted for statin therapy if people have not reached their LDL goal, or if they cannot tolerate statin side effects,"" says Dr. Cannon.
        Ezetimibe blocks cholesterol absorption in the intestine. Bempedoic acid and PCSK9 inhibitors work on liver cell receptors to increase the uptake and destruction of LDL cholesterol, thereby lowering LDL blood levels.
        Can your LDL be too low? Not really, says Dr. Cannon. ""Driving down LDL to really low levels might increase the risk of medication side effects, but there are no problems directly related to very low LDL levels.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/want-better-sleep-aim-for-at-least-an-hour-of-exercise-per-week,Want better sleep? Aim for at least an hour of exercise per week,"Regular exercise promotes better sleep quality and reduces the risk for insomnia. But how much exercise does it take to get sleep benefits? A study published online March 26, 2024, by BMJ Open suggests an answer. Researchers evaluated the sleep questionnaire responses of about 4,400 people (ages 39 to 67) in Europe. Participants reported on their overall health and various aspects of their physical activity and sleep habits (including how long they usually slept each night and any insomnia symptoms they had, such as difficulty falling asleep, nighttime awakenings, or daytime sleepiness). Answers were collected at two points in time, 10 years apart. People who said that they exercised at least twice a week (for a total of at least an hour a week) for the entire 10 years were much less likely to report sleeping difficulties compared with people who reported that they were either inactive or less active during the study period. The study is observational and can't prove conclusively that exercising an hour or more per week will improve sleep. But we know that any amount of exercise is beneficial for health. This study provides an additional incentive to get more active.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/what-you-need-to-know-about-electric-bicycles,What you need to know about electric bicycles,"Bicycle riders are abuzz with the latest advances in pedal power, called electric bicycles or e-bikes. Sales have been brisk, with the number of e-bikes sold annually in the United States quadrupling between 2018 and 2022 (to 1.1 million), and still climbing.
        What's the big deal? The two-wheelers operate on pedal power and an electric motor, making them handy on hilly terrain and helpful for people with physical limitations. But e-bikes have certain risks. Here's what you need to know about the souped-up cycles.
        
          
            
              
                Get the right bike fit
                Whether you want to ride an electric bike or a conventional one, try to get a professional bike fitting.
                ""You'll need easy access to the brakes and shifters, which may require handlebar adjustments. And you'll need the right saddle [seat] height, width, and adjustment. This will help accommodate body limitations you have, such as limited knee range of motion or arthritis in the spine. Ask a bike shop where you can find a certified fitter,"" suggests Karen Zunti, a physical therapist with the Cycling Medicine Program at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Network.
              
            
          
        
        How does it work?
        An e-bike looks like a regular bicycle. It has a built-in electric motor powered by a lithium-ion battery.
        When the motor is off, the bike functions like a regular bicycle. When the motor kicks on—which can occur when you reach a certain speed or when you flip a switch—pedaling becomes easier. ""Riding an e-bike feels like you're using an easier gear when you're really using a harder one. It puts less compression on your joints than a conventional bike, so it takes less effort to go at any given speed. That's helpful if you have joint pain or diminished strength or endurance. And if you want to ride with your friends or grandkids, you can keep up with them,"" says Karen Zunti, a physical therapist with the Cycling Medicine Program at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Network.
        And even though the workout is less intense, you might be able to ride an e-bike for a longer period of time than a conventional bike, so you can still get the exercise benefits.
        E-bike speeds
        The speed of your e-bike depends on its particular class. The lowest class (Class 1) has a motor that works only as you pedal and won't help once you reach 20 mph. The highest class (Class 3) works the same way, but the motor will boost you until you reach 28 mph.
        Class 2 e-bikes also can assist you as you pedal, up to 20 mph, but unlike the others, they work if you want to ride without pedaling: there's a throttle on the handlebars that provides direct power to the motor (like a motorized scooter).
        Zipping along at 20 mph or more can be risky if you haven't ridden a bike since you were a kid. ""If you aren't used to riding at 10 or 12 mph — which is probably the speed you'd use for cruising around your neighborhood — you won't be able to handle it at 20 mph, and you probably won't have the skills to stop, turn, or navigate around something quickly,"" Zunti says. ""That's often when accidents happen.""
        Note: E-bike regulations (registration, insurance requirements, and helmet laws) vary from state to state.
        Other e-bike drawbacks
        In addition to speeds you might not be used to, e-bikes have a few other drawbacks to consider.
        Price. E-bikes are expensive, ranging from about $400 to $6,000 or more. Good ones average about $1,500 to $2,000. Some states offer rebates for up to 30% of the cost.
        Weight. Because e-bikes have motors and batteries, the average weight is about 50 pounds, compared to about 20 pounds for a conventional bicycle. If you need to lift a heavy e-bike onto a bike rack, you might injure your back, shoulder, wrist, or elbow.
        Batteries. You must keep an e-bike motor charged. If the battery runs out while you're on the road, you'll be stuck with a heavy bike you have to pedal home or back to your car. Plus, e-bike battery safety isn't yet regulated everywhere (though that's in the works). Reports of battery fires have prompted some cities to enact safety laws and offer free battery swaps.
        Should you try riding one?
        To ride an e-bike, you need to be able to balance on a bike, turn your head, and see on either side of you (that is, you need good peripheral vision). So e-bikes probably aren't right for people with severe vision or balance problems.
        It's also very important for you to wear a helmet, follow traffic laws, and use hand signals. If you can check all of those boxes, riding an e-bike might be a way to keep you in the saddle long after you thought your pedaling days might be behind you.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/more-evidence-that-ultra-processed-foods-harm-health,More evidence that ultra-processed foods harm health,"Need more reasons to stop eating ultra-processed food? How about 32 of them? That's the number of health problems noted in the largest-ever review of studies about the dangers of diets high in ultra-processed foods. The findings, published online Feb. 28, 2024, by The BMJ, come from a review of 45 analyses published in the last three years, involving about 10 million people in total. When scientists graded the evidence, they found the most convincing or highly suggestive evidence linked diets rich in ultra-processed foods with increased risks for premature death, cardiovascular disease, mental health disorders, diabetes, obesity, and sleep problems. Associations between ultra-processed foods and asthma, gastrointestinal disease, some cancers, and other health issues were limited, the authors say, and need further investigation. What, exactly, are ultra-processed foods? They're ready-to-eat products such as deli meat, microwaveable dinners, or chips. They typically have long ingredients lists, with lots of additives such as preservatives, oil, sugar, salt, coloring, and flavoring. You'll do yourself a favor if you can cut them out of your diet as much as possible and replace them with less-processed options or (best of all) whole foods.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/is-niacin-safe-for-the-heart,Is niacin safe for the heart?,"Q. 
          I've been taking a product called Niagen (nicotinamide riboside) as an anti-aging supplement. But I recently read that niacin may increase the risk of heart disease. Could that be a concern with Niagen as well?
        
        A. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is a water-soluble vitamin that helps your body convert food into energy. Niacin is the generic name for nicotinic acid and nicotinamide (also called niacinamide) and related derivatives such as nicotinamide riboside, the product you take.
        Niacin occurs naturally in many foods, including poultry, nuts, beans, and grains. It's also found in multivitamin supplements, B complex supplements, and supplements containing only niacin. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are the two main forms found in supplements. High-dose nicotinic acid is also available as a prescription medication for improving blood lipid levels.
        Niacin can lower triglycerides and raise high-density lipoprotein levels, usually requiring 1,500 to 2,000 milligrams (mg) a day to achieve this. However, prescription niacin has not been shown to lower the risk of death, heart attack, or stroke. A large study of more than 25,000 patients tested niacin in combination with cholesterol-lowering statin drugs found little additional benefit when compared with statins alone. What's more, high-dose niacin was associated with many worrisome side effects, including a higher risk of new-onset diabetes, worsening control of diabetes in those already had it, and a higher risk of serious gastrointestinal symptoms requiring hospitalization.
        As a result, in 2016, the FDA withdrew its approval of niacin for use in combination with statins or other lipid-lowering agents. Since then, niacin use in people with heart disease has fallen.
        The recent news about niacin you're referring to comes from a study of about 1,100 people with heart disease who were followed for three years. Researchers found that higher blood levels of two breakdown products of excess niacin were linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. However, they had no information about the participant's dietary niacin intake, and because this wasn't a clinical trial, the results cannot prove that niacin is to blame for this observation.
        In addition, we know that the amount of niacin found in multivitamins is not harmful. According to the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, the daily upper limit (the largest daily intake of a nutrient considered safe for most people) for niacin from dietary supplements is 35 mg for adults. Nicotinamide has fewer side effects than nicotinic acid. But at high doses — 500 mg per day or more — nicotinamide can cause diarrhea and easy bruising and can increase bleeding from wounds. So that's something to keep in mind when taking nicotinamide supplements. Also, based on the scientific evidence to date, this supplement appears to have little benefit for people.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/interval-training-a-shorter-more-enjoyable-workout,"Interval training: A shorter, more enjoyable workout?","As one of the most popular exercise trends for more than a decade, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) clearly provides some perks. These workouts aren't just a time-efficient way to boost your fitness. Research shows that HIIT can improve key measures of cardiovascular health for all sorts of people, including those recovering from heart attacks or heart surgery. Another advantage: high-intensity effort, even for just brief bursts, may trigger the release of mood-boosting brain chemicals.
        As its name implies, HIIT features high-intensity (vigorous) activity done in intervals (short time periods) with brief periods of either rest or lower-intensity activity in between. During the bursts of vigorous exercise, your heart rate rises higher, and then it remains higher than it would normally be in between those high-intensity bouts. Compared to 20 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, a 20-minute HIIT session will burn more calories, strengthen your heart more, and help your body use oxygen more efficiently.
        ""If your goal is to improve your fitness, doing moderate-intensity exercise certainly works. But HIIT workouts may raise your fitness level faster in a shorter period of time,"" says Dr. Sawalla Guseh, director of the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. As he points out, if you do mostly vigorous exercise, you can meet the federal exercise guidelines in just 75 minutes per week, where-as doing mostly moderate exercise takes twice as long (150 minutes per week).
        Happier with HIIT?
        If long sessions of vigorous exercise feel too challenging, adding some HIIT workouts to your exercise regimen can be a happy medium. Even short stints of high-intensity exercise appear to trigger the release of endorphins — the brain's ""feel good"" chemicals. ""In our clinic, we certainly see patients who say that HIIT workouts bring them the most joy,"" Dr. Guseh says. In addition, endorphins can counteract pain, which may mitigate some of the discomfort that can occur during HIIT workouts, so people perceive them as more pleasant than expected.
        Still, the most important thing is to find a form of exercise that you enjoy and can do consistently over the long haul, Dr. Guseh says. Steady, moderate-intensity exercise is also a great way to keep your cardiovascular system healthy.
        Getting started with HIIT
        If you have heart disease or are at increased risk for it, be sure to check with your doctor before adding high-intensity effort to your routine. People at increased risk include those with two or more of the following: diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or a family history of heart disease.
        Reaching the right intensity
        Traditionally, HIIT features 30 to 90 seconds of high-intensity effort followed by an equal or longer period of lower-intensity activity or rest. High-intensity is often defined as reaching 85% of your maximum heart rate (see ""All about your heart rate"" in the June 2023 Heart Letter). A simpler option is to aim for an ""8"" on your personal perceived exertion scale (where 1 is very easy and 10 is as hard as you can possibly go).
        When you're first starting out, alternate a few short intervals of high-intensity exercise with longer periods of moderate or easy exercise. Say you usually walk for 30 minutes at a stretch. Start by walking for five minutes. Then walk as fast as you can, or jog, for one minute. Go back to your usual pace, or even a bit slower, for three minutes. Repeat the fast walking–slower walking cycle five more times. Once you become more fit (or if you are in fairly good shape), you can spend more time walking faster or jogging and less time ambling or resting.
        You can turn any cardio workout — cycling, swimming, elliptical, stationary bike, treadmill, stair climber, rowing machine, and even dancing — into an interval session. The easiest way is to simply speed up and slow down. Outdoors, add hills to a running or cycling route to create greater intensity. Indoors, you might add some stair climbing or jumping. For variety, try other HIIT variations (see ""Internationally inspired interval training""). Harvard Health Publishing's report Interval Trainingfeatures five sample workouts, including warmups and stretches.
        
          
            
              
                Internationally inspired interval training
                Try one of these HIIT variations to add fun and challenge to your workout.
                Fartlek. Swedish for ""speed play,"" fartlek is a more relaxed, fun way of doing intervals. You don't have to worry about distance, time, or heart rate. Instead, you push yourself as long as you can based on how you're feeling or until you reach a target like a tree, light pole, house, or someone ahead of you. Then you recover for as long you need. Your intervals don't have to be identical. When you feel ready, pick another target and go. While the intervals are informal, they can still be challenging.
                Tabata. Named after the Japanese researcher who created it, Tabata workouts feature 20-second work intervals and 10-second recovery intervals that are done eight times in a four-minute series. Try it with any type of aerobic exercise, like walking, running, or cycling. Tabata classes often include multiple rounds of different exercises, such as jumping jacks, knee pulls, or mountain climbers, designed to work all the major muscle groups. Instructors combine different variations of the four-minute series to create workouts that last a half-hour to an hour.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/salmonella-is-sneaky-watch-out-202405293044,Salmonella is sneaky: Watch out,"Pop quiz: what is Salmonella? If you've ever had a run-in with this bacteria, you know it can cause a food-borne illness called salmonellosis, a form of food poisoning. But you may not know that Salmonella bacteria sicken an estimated 1.35 million people and hospitalize 26,500 every year in the United States. What's more, it kills more total people than any other type of food poisoning.
        And Salmonella bacteria can be sneaky — not only by triggering unusual complications, but infecting people in startling ways, says Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital. One patient she treated showed up with an abdominal aortic aneurysm — a dangerous bulge in the lower section of the body's largest artery — that looked infected. Testing revealed a culprit some would find surprising: Salmonella.
        ""It's just an interesting organism and it can be kind of scary,"" she says.
        How do people get infected by Salmonella?
        Many of the foods Salmonella bacteria lurk in are raw or undercooked. Breaded raw chicken products like nuggets and chicken Kiev are one way it may reach your table. But a variety of foods have been implicated — including organic basil, cantaloupes, ground beef, nut butters, raw cookie dough, eggs, raw or unpasteurized milk, and flour.
        Even small pets such as turtles and frogs, along with dog food, have contributed to Salmonella outbreaks in recent years.
        You can also become infected by handling contaminated food and spreading the bacteria from your hands to your mouth. Additionally, you can spread it to others on your hands or even on your clothes without becoming sick yourself.
        ""It's a bug that's carried in stool and animal feces and is also present in the environment,"" Dr. Hohmann says. ""So it can set up shop in lots of different inanimate objects, soils, and machinery, especially in moist environments.""
        What symptoms can Salmonella cause?
        Most of the time, Salmonella infection leads to gastroenteritis, usually causing just an upset stomach, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. These symptoms can start as soon as six hours after ingesting the bacteria. Typically, symptoms resolve on their own within two to three days.
        Some people have such mild symptoms they're barely noticeable. ""The classic case might be a college student who eats a burrito from a sketchy place, gets sick for a couple of days, gets better, and doesn't think anything of it,"" says Dr. Hohmann.
        Sometimes symptoms are more serious, such as severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea, or unexplained high fever and marked fatigue. These symptoms require a call to your doctor.
        How is salmonellosis treated?
        Most people will get better on their own without any medicines. Replacing lost fluids by sipping water or electrolyte drinks to avoid dehydration will help.
        Call a doctor if you have
        
          diarrhea and a fever higher than 102° F
          diarrhea that doesn't improve after three days
          bloody stools
          vomiting so severe it prevents you from keeping liquids down.
        
        Treating the infection with medicine comes with an annoying paradox, Dr. Hohmann says. If doctors decide to prescribe antibiotics, the person taking the medicine may shed the organism for longer than if they were never treated. ""Then that person may have the opportunity — either through poor personal hygiene, sex, or working as a food worker — to spread it to others,"" she explains. ""It's challenging.""
        What complications can Salmonella lead to?
        Some people get sicker with salmonellosis than others, with seemingly no rhyme or reason. But certain folks are especially vulnerable to serious infection, including:
        
          adults 65 and older
          pregnant women
          children under 5
          people whose immune systems are weakened by diseases (such as cancer) or treatments (such as immunosuppressing drugs).
        
        A small percentage of those infected can have Salmonella in their blood, which can spread the infection to other parts of the body such as the urinary tract, bones, joints, or central nervous system (brain and spinal fluid).
        And, like Dr. Hohmann's patient with the abdominal aortic aneurysm, on rare occasions Salmonella can lead to unusual blood vessel complications in people who already have atherosclerosis, blockage of the arteries caused by plaque buildup.
        ""It's not that common,"" she says. ""Many physicians are aware of it, so they take special care if Salmonella is found in a person with vascular disease.""
        What steps can you take to avoid Salmonella?
        While new USDA rules that take effect in 2025 may help fuel recalls of certain foods, we all can take steps to avoid the food poisoning, illness, and hospitalizations that Salmonella exposure can cause.
        Dr. Hohmann and the CDC suggest these strategies:
        
          Using hot water and soap, wash cutting boards or plates on which you cut into raw foods — including vegetables and fruit — before using those surfaces for other purposes. If possible, use separate cutting boards for produce, meat, and fish.
          Refrigerate or freeze foods that are perishable, prepared, or left over within two hours to thwart salmonella growth.
          Always wash hands well with soap and water before preparing food and after contact with animals, using the toilet, or changing diapers.
          If you have a sick pet, take extra care handling its feces and wash your hands thoroughly afterward.
        
        Take additional steps to help more vulnerable people stay healthy:
        
          Don't let young children touch high-risk animals, such as turtles, frogs, chickens, or ducks. ""And if you're taking young children to a petting zoo, they should not be petting animals unless you can disinfect their hands immediately afterward,"" she says.
          Older adults and those with compromised immune systems should take extra care to wash and cook foods thoroughly.
          People who have had a transplant (such as a kidney transplant) should not keep reptiles or amphibians as pets.
        
        ""You hate to make people paranoid, so that we're washing our lettuce leaves with soap, but it's worth thinking about these things, particularly if you have people in your household who are susceptible — which is an increasing number of people,"" Dr. Hohmann says.",Maureen Salamon,"May 29, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/everyday-arm-exercises-functional-benefits,Everyday arm exercises: Functional benefits,"Strong arms aren't just for the weight room crowd. Arm strength is important for many of the everyday tasks or functional activities we perform such as carrying groceries, lifting children, hanging curtains, or opening doors.
        It takes effort to maintain arm strength, especially as we age. Beginning at around age 35, arm strength and overall muscle mass start to decline by 1% each year. After age 60, we can lose up to 3% of our muscle mass each year. This muscle loss can lead to reduced strength, a more limited range of motion, and a greater risk of injuries.
        Incorporating arm exercises into your fitness routine is essential for maintaining your strength. But it's also important for healthy movement, stronger bones, better balance, and keeping injuries at bay.
        Tailoring arm workouts for specific functional goals
        When it comes to arm muscles, the triceps and the biceps are important for performing everyday, functional activities.

                Pushing, lifting, throwing.
              
            
          
        
        Biceps curls and triceps extensions are two classic exercises that help build arm strength. These exercises are effective, but they target individual muscles.
        To build the functional strength needed for everyday activities that require upper body strength, it's best to include functional exercises that target multiple muscle groups. For example, functional arm exercises target not only the arm muscles, but other muscle groups such as the shoulders, rotator cuff, back, and chest muscles.
        Think about the action of lifting a heavy bag of groceries out of your car's trunk. Completing this action requires a strong back as well as strong arm muscles. A bent-over row is an example of a functional exercise that targets all of the muscles needed to complete this everyday activity.
        Functional exercises can reduce your risk of injury and help to increase your quality of life by allowing you to continue performing everyday activities.
        Sample arm exercises
        The exercises below can help strengthen your arm muscles or other muscles of the upper body.
        When you are training for strength, aim for eight to 12 repetitions, or reps, of each exercise. If you cannot do all the reps at first, just do what you can, and then gradually increase reps as you improve.
        Beginners can start with one set of reps (one set on each side in the case of wood chops), working up to three sets as you get stronger. Rest 30 to 90 seconds between sets.
        If the exercise requires equipment, you can use light weights — 2 to 5 pounds each. As you get stronger, switch to heavier weights. If you don't have weights, you can use water bottles or cans. You can also do the exercise without weights.
        Biceps curl
        
          
        
        
          Stand tall with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Keep your chest lifted and your back straight. Hold your shoulders back and down. Keep your abs tight.
          With your arms down at your sides, hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing forward.
          Slowly bend your elbows, lifting the dumbbells toward your shoulders.
          Pause briefly.
          Lower the dumbbells slowly, straightening your arms back to the starting position.
        
        Overhead press
        
          
        
        
          Stand tall with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Keep your chest lifted and your back straight. Hold your shoulders back and down. Keep your abs tight.
          Hold a dumbbell in each hand at the shoulders with an overhand grip (your palms facing forward). Your elbows should be pointing out to the sides.
          In a controlled motion, slowly raise the weights straight up overhead until your arms are fully extended.
          Pause briefly.
          Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.
        
        Triceps dip
        
          
        
        
          Place a sturdy chair against a wall so it doesn't move. Or use one that is too heavy to be moved.
          Sit on the edge of the chair with your legs bent. Only your heels should touch the floor.
          Place your hands on the chair next to your hips and grasp the edge.
          Pushing down on your hands, raise your buttocks and shift them forward to clear the edge of the chair.
          Bending your elbows back, lower your hips toward the floor. Lower no farther than the point where your elbows are bent at 90 degrees. Keep your shoulders away from your ears and your back close to the chair.
          Pause briefly.
          Slowly straighten your arms to return to the starting position. Exhale as you straighten your arms.
        
        Bent-over row
        
          
        
        
          Stand with a weight in your right hand and a bench or sturdy chair at your left side.
          Place your left hand and knee on the bench or chair seat.
          Let your right hand hang directly under your right shoulder, fully extended downward. Your spine should be neutral and your shoulders and hips squared.
          Squeeze your shoulder blades together, then bend your elbow to slowly lift the weight toward your ribs. Keep your elbow close to your side as you lift the weight. Exhale as you lift.
          Return to the starting position.
          Repeat on other side for one complete set.

          Kneel on all fours with your hands shoulder-width apart. Tighten your abs. Keep your head in line with your spine.
          Walk your hands forward and lower your hips so your body is at a 45-degree angle to the floor and forms a straight line from head to knees. Be careful not to bend at the hips.
          Bending your elbows out to the sides, slowly lower your upper body toward the floor until your elbows are bent about 90 degrees.
          Pause briefly.
          Pressing against the floor, straighten your arms as you slowly return to the starting position.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/easy-upper-body-boosters,Easy upper-body boosters,"When your upper-body strength dwindles, you risk more than the loss of power to open a car door or lift a bag of groceries. It's not just a strength problem; it may also be a length problem. Shorter muscles reduce your range of motion. And if you do any reaching activities without adequate range of motion or muscle strength, like hanging curtains or putting dishes in an upper cabinet, you can get a small tear in a muscle or rotator cuff or tendinitis in the shoulder.
        The oomph in the upper body
        A number of major muscles and muscle groups enable us to use our arms and shoulders throughout the day.
        
          The deltoid muscle moves your entire arm at the shoulder joint and helps you wave your arm overhead.
          The biceps muscle on the top of your upper arm helps bend your arm at the elbow joint, making it possible to raise a glass to drink.
          The triceps muscle on the underside of your upper arm straightens your arm at the elbow joint, so you can push a window up.
          The pectoralis muscles in the chest allow you to move your arms up, down, in, and out, so you can push something away from you or lift something up.
          The trapezius muscle in your upper back moves your shoulder and shoulder blade, so you can shrug.
          The rhomboid muscles, under the trapezius, move your shoulder blade back and forth (think of starting a lawnmower).
          The latissimus dorsi muscle at the side of your mid-to-lower back pulls your arm down, so you can pull a window down.
        
        Also crucial to upper-body strength is the rotator cuff in each shoulder: the group of tendons and muscles that helps you raise and rotate your arm.
        Why do muscles change?
        At around age 35, we start losing muscle mass at a rate of  about 1% per year. After age 60, muscle loss can accelerate to as much as 3% per year. This deterioration is called sarcopenia.
        Your muscle cells tend to shrink, and you also lose some of the speed at which the motor neurons fire messages from the brain to the muscle. So you become slower, and you lose muscle mass, bulk, and power.
        By staying physically active, you help offset these muscle changes and slow the pace of sarcopenia.

        Get your power back
        The great news is that you can improve muscle size and strength. Consider working with a physical therapist to get back on track.
        The therapist can evaluate the strength and length of your muscles and the range of motion of your joints, and then design a program to fit your particular needs.
        A program typically involves gentle stretching to keep muscles supple, plus strengthening exercises like triceps curls, with low amounts of weight (just a few pounds) and a high number of repetitions. That's because you don't need to bulk up; you need to condition your muscles and increase their stability and endurance.
        Just remember that once physical therapy is over, it will be up to you to keep your muscles strong, either by going to a gym or maintaining your own home workout two or three times per week.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/strong-legs-help-power-summer-activities-hiking-biking-swimming-and-more-202205122743,"Strong legs help power summer activities: Hiking, biking, swimming, and more","My favorite summer activities officially kick in when the calendar flips to May. It's prime time for open water swimming, running, cycling, hiking, and anything else that gets me outside and moving. Yet, my first step is to get my legs in shape.
        ""Legs are the foundation for most activities,"" says Vijay Daryanani, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. ""They're home to some of the body's largest muscles, and building healthy legs can improve one's performance, reduce injury, and increase endurance.""
        Four leg muscle groups to build for summer activities
        Four muscles do the most leg work: quadriceps, gluteus maximus (glutes), hamstrings, and calves. Here is a look at each.
        Quadriceps (quads). Also known as the thigh muscles, the quads are a group of four muscles (hence the prefix ""quad'). They extend your leg at the knee and power every leg action: stand, walk, run, kick, and climb.
        Glutes. The body's largest muscles, the glutes (your buttock muscles) keep you upright and help the hips and thighs propel your body forward.
        Hamstrings. The hamstrings are a group of three muscles that run along the back of your thighs from the hip to just below the knee. They allow you to extend your leg straight behind your body and support hip and knee movements.
        Calves. Three muscles make up the calf, which sits in the back of the lower leg, beginning below the knee and extending to the ankle. They work together to move your foot and lower leg and push you forward when you walk or run.
        Spotlight muscle strength and length
        Strength and length are the most important focus for building summer-ready legs, says Daryanani. ""Strengthening leg muscles increases power and endurance, and lengthening them improves flexibility to protect against injury.""
        If you are new to exercise or returning to it after time off, first get your legs accustomed to daily movement. ""Start simply by walking around your home nonstop for several minutes each day, or climbing up and down stairs,"" says Daryanani.
        After that, adopt a walking routine. Every day, walk at a moderate pace for 20 to 30 minutes. You can focus on covering a specific distance (like one or two miles) or taking a certain number of steps by tracking them on your smartphone or fitness tracker. You won't just build leg strength — you'll reap a wide range of health benefits.
        There are many different leg muscle-building exercises, some focused on specific activities or sports. Below is a three-move routine that targets the four key leg muscles. Add them to your regular workout or do them as a leg-only routine several times a week. (If you have any mobility issues, especially knee or ankle problems, check with your doctor before starting.)
        To help lengthen your leg muscles and increase flexibility, try this daily stretching routine that includes several lower-body stretches.
        Dumbbell squats
        Muscles worked: glutes and quads
        Reps: 8-12
        Sets: 1-2
        Rest: 30-90 seconds between sets
        Starting position: Stand with your feet apart. Hold a weight in each hand with your arms at your sides and palms facing inward.
        Movement: Slowly bend your hips and knees, leaning forward no more than 45 degrees and lowering your buttocks down and back about eight inches. Pause. Slowly rise to an upright position.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Don't round or excessively arch your back
        
        Make it easier: Do the move without holding weights.
        Make it harder: Lower yourself at a normal pace. Hold briefly. Stand up quickly.
        Reverse lunge
        Muscles worked: quads, glutes, hamstrings
        Reps: 8-12
        Sets: 1-3
        Rest: 30-90 seconds between sets
        Starting position: Stand straight with your feet together and your arms at your sides, holding dumbbells.
        Movement: Step back onto the ball of your left foot, bend your knees, and lower into a lunge. Your right knee should align over your right ankle, and your left knee should point toward (but not touch) the floor. Push off your left foot to stand and return to the starting position. Repeat, stepping back with your right foot to do the lunge on the opposite side. This is one rep.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Keep your spine neutral when lowering into the lunge.
          Don't lean forward or back.
          As you bend your knees, lower the back knee directly down toward the floor with the thigh perpendicular to the floor.
        
        Make it easier: Do lunges without weights.
        Make it harder: Step forward into the lunges, or use heavier weights.
        Calf raises
        Muscles worked: calves
        Reps: 8-12
        Sets: 1-2
        Rest: 30 seconds between sets
        Starting position: Stand with your feet flat on the floor. Hold on to the back of a chair for balance.
        Movement: Raise yourself up on the balls of your feet as high as possible. Hold briefly, then lower yourself.
        Make it easier: Lift your heels less high off the floor.
        Make it harder: Do one-leg calf raises. Tuck one foot behind the other calf before rising on the ball of your foot; do sets for each leg. Or try doing calf raises without holding on to a chair.",Matthew Solan,"May 21, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/have-you-exfoliated-lately-202405203042,Have you exfoliated lately?,"Social media has a way of making the ho-hum seem fresh and novel. Case in point: exfoliation, the process of removing dead cells from the skin's outer layer. Anyone scrolling through TikTok lately might be convinced this longtime skin care approach can transform something old — let's say our aging epidermis — into like-new skin.
        But a Harvard dermatologist says that's asking too much.
        ""I don't think exfoliation is going to fix anybody's wrinkles,"" says Rachel Reynolds, MD, interim chair of dermatology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. While exfoliation offers definite benefits, it can also irritate and inflame the skin if you don't do it carefully, or use tools or chemicals your skin doesn't tolerate.
        How is exfoliation done?
        There are two main ways to exfoliate: mechanical and chemical. Each boasts specific advantages.
        
          Mechanical (or physical) exfoliation uses a tool such as a brush or loofah sponge, or a scrub containing abrasive particles, to physically remove dead skin cells. ""Mechanical exfoliation can improve skin luster by taking off a dead layer of skin that can make it look dull,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""And it can help unclog pores a bit, which can reduce some types of acne.""
          Chemical exfoliation uses chemicals — often alpha and beta hydroxy acids or salicylic acid — to liquify dead skin cells. ""Chemical exfoliants work on a more micro-level to help dissolve excess skin cells and reduce uneven pigmentation sitting at the surface of the skin,"" she explains. ""They also restore skin glow, improve acne, and give the skin a little more shine.""
        
        Why do skin care products so often promote exfoliation?
        Perhaps hundreds of commercially available skin care products — from body washes to cleansers to face masks — are labeled as exfoliating, Dr. Reynolds notes. But she's skeptical about why such a wide array of items plug this feature so prominently.
        ""It's advantageous for a cosmetics company to sell consumers more products in a skin care line,"" she says. ""But it's buyer beware, because this is a completely unregulated market, and cosmetic companies can make claims that don't have to be substantiated in actual clinical trials.""
        Do we need to exfoliate our skin?
        No. ""Nothing happens if you don't exfoliate — you just walk around with bumpy or slightly dry skin, which is inconsequential except for cosmetic reasons,"" Dr. Reynolds says.
        ""No one has to exfoliate, but it can be helpful to exfoliate the arms and legs,"" she adds. ""As we age, these areas get more dry than other parts of the body, and people notice they build up a lot more flaking skin and an almost fish-scale appearance.""
        That phenomenon may or may not be a sign of keratosis pilaris, a common but harmless skin condition characterized by rough, bumpy ""chicken skin"" on the upper arms and thighs. Physical exfoliators are a good first choice because keratosis pilaris covers areas that have tougher skin than the face, she says. But it's fine to use a cleanser or lotion containing a chemical exfoliant instead. Either type can improve skin texture and the skin's appearance.
        Can exfoliation harm our skin?
        Yes. Both physical and chemical exfoliation techniques can do more harm than good, depending on several factors. Sensitive skin is more likely to become irritated or inflamed by any exfoliant. And overdoing it — whether by rubbing too hard or using a product with higher concentrations of acid — can trigger irritant contact dermatitis, which can look red, angry, and chapped.
        ""Physical exfoliation that's done too harshly can also aggravate inflammatory acne, making it worse,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""Also, exfoliating can make you more prone to sunburn.""
        What are the safest ways to exfoliate?
        Dr. Reynolds recommends chemical exfoliants over physical versions. ""Sometimes the abrasives in those apricot scrubs, for example, can go too far, aggravating the skin and creating inflammation,"" she says.
        She offers these additional tips to exfoliate safely:
        
          If you haven't exfoliated before, start with a simple washcloth to determine how well your skin responds to mild attempts at physical exfoliation.
          Then try gentler chemical exfoliants, such as lower concentrations of hydroxy acids or salicylic acid. Work your way up to stronger concentrations only if needed.
          If you're hoping to eradicate stubborn skin problems such as melasma (brown facial patches) or comedonal acne (small, skin-colored bumps often on the forehead or chin), consider undergoing a chemical peel at a dermatologist's office.
        
        Don't exfoliate every day. ""At most, do it two or three times a week,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""Your skin needs to repair itself in between exfoliation episodes.""",Maureen Salamon,"May 20, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/prebiotics-understanding-their-role-in-gut-health,Prebiotics: Understanding their role in gut health,"Our gastrointestinal tracts contain about 100 trillion microorganisms, mainly bacteria. These organisms are collectively known as the gut microbiome.
        The vast majority of bacteria in our microbiome are good. Good bacteria's primary role is to counterbalance the bad kind to keep your gut healthy. They offer other health benefits as well.
        But sometimes the balance between good and bad bacteria gets disturbed. That's where probiotics come in. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts. They replenish your gut with more good bacteria to restore the balance between good and bad bacteria.
        Lesser known, but also important to maintaining a balanced microbiome, are prebiotics.
        What are prebiotics?
        Prebiotics are ingredients in certain foods that your intestines can't fully digest. Examples of prebiotics include some starches, oligosaccharides, inulin, and pectin. They tend to be most plentiful in high-fiber foods.
        Prebiotics work in tandem with probiotics. Probiotics are live microorganisms that maintain or improve the balance of good to bad bacteria in your digestive system. Some examples of foods that contain probiotcs are yogurt, kimchi, many cheeses, pickles, kombucha, and sauerkraut.
        Prebiotics, on the other hand, act as nutrition for gut bacteria, helping them to flourish. When bacteria are fed what they need to stay healthy, they keep our bodies healthy in return.
        Potential health benefits of prebiotics
        Prebiotic foods can improve your gut microbiome and enhance your health. Experts are still learning more about the benefits of prebiotics. But research has found a link between higher prebiotic intake and
        
          improved intestinal absorption of dietary calcium
          better blood sugar control
          a well-functioning immune system
          a reduce risk of colorectal cancer.
        
        The role of prebiotics may extend beyond being a food source within your microbiome, too. One recent study showed that people who consumed 30 grams daily for two weeks of foods high in a plant-based prebiotic called inulin were more likely to select medium- to low-calorie foods over high-calorie ones.
        Furthermore, their MRIs showed less activation in their brain's reward network when shown high-calorie foods. The study suggests that eating prebiotic foods might help people make healthier dietary choices.
        Prebiotic foods to add to your diet
        Prebiotics are found in a variety of high-fiber grains, vegetables, and fruits. Some of the best prebiotic foods include:
        
          garlic
          onions
          bananas
          Jerusalem artichokes
          soybeans
          asparagus
          wheat and whole-grain products such as cereals and breads.
        
        Eating more prebiotic food is not a good idea for everyone. For example, some people with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may find a diet heavy in prebiotics worsens their symptoms. On the other hand, people who struggle with constipation may find improved bowel function with prebiotics.
        Finding the right balance of prebiotic food that works for you is key. Starting slowly and gradually increasing prebiotic foods can help avoid possible digestive discomfort.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","May 15, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/what-is-the-carnivore-diet,What is the carnivore diet?,"Question:
          What is the carnivore diet, and is it safe?
        
        Answer: The carnivore diet meal plan only allows consumption of meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, fish, some dairy products, and water. You need to exclude all vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, seeds, and nuts. That's why it is sometimes referred to as the ""zero carb"" diet.
        The carnivore diet is a type of ""keto,"" or ketogenic, diet. Keto diets work like this: The contents of a keto diet do not provide enough calories from glucose and other forms of sugar. To compensate, the body burns fat that creates ketones as an energy source. Ketones are released into the bloodstream, which lowers the normal acid-base balance in blood to make it more acidic, a state known as ketosis.
        A typical keto diet plan suggests approximately 70% to 75% of daily calories come from fat, 20% from protein, and no more than 10% from carbohydrates.
        A carnivore diet is the most ketogenic diet because it allows for almost no carbs. Fat content is not specified; it's whatever fat is contained in or consumed along with the meat, fish, poultry, and dairy.
        What are the risks of a carnivore diet?
        While some keto diets can emphasize the intake of healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, that's not the case with carnivore diets. Animal fat is mostly saturated fat, which is the unhealthiest type of fat because it raises levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol.
        The disadvantage of all keto diets is they tend to raise LDL cholesterol levels in both the short and long term. Other longer-term concerns about keto diets, especially the carnivore diet, include the increased risk of kidney stones, gout, and osteoporosis. Also, the very high protein intake associated with the carnivore diet can lead to impaired kidney function.
        Because keto diets induce the body to burn fat, all keto diets can jump-start a weight-loss program. But I would never recommend a carnivore diet for this purpose.","Howard E. LeWine, MD","May 8, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/give-spinning-a-whirl,Spin class: Incorporating indoor cycling into your fitness routine,"Spinning classes — indoor cycling to the beat of motivating music — are more popular than ever. They're staples at most gyms, and there are even entire fitness centers devoted to nothing but spinning. Some even offer senior-only classes.
        If you haven't tried this type of workout, you should give it a whirl, as it offers a wide range of benefits.
        What is a spin class?
        Spinning is a great cardiovascular workout and can help build lower-body muscle strength.
        It's also perfect for people who don't enjoy, or have difficulty doing, higher-impact cardio activities like running or even speed walking. Spinning is a low-impact exercise that places less stress on your joints, which makes it ideal for anyone with knee or hip issues or those recovering from orthopedic injuries.
        In some ways, spinning can offer more sweat equity than regular cardio. A study in the Journal of Fitness Research compared the effects of two 30-minute spinning sessions with an hour of moderate-intensity exercise among 36 middle-aged people. After six weeks, the people in the spinning group showed more improvement in fitness, leg strength, blood pressure, total cholesterol level, and fat mass compared with the other group.
        Group indoor exercise classes also provide an opportunity for socialization, which is linked to maintaining cognitive health and may even lower dementia risk. Surveys taken by spinners prior to and immediately after classes not surprisingly have shown a significant improvement in positive feelings.
        Health benefits of indoor cycling
        A spinning class is often 45 minutes to an hour long and is led by an instructor who guides the group through a series of heart-pumping workouts. For instance, you might do speed work, where you pedal fast for brief periods followed by periods of rest and recovery. You also may do incline workouts, where you increase the bike's resistance so it feels like you are cycling uphill.
        In some ways, spinning can offer more sweat equity than regular cardio. A study in the April 2016 Journal of Fitness Research compared the effects of two 30-minute spinning sessions with an hour of moderate-intensity exercise among 36 middle-aged people. After six weeks, the people in the spinning group showed more improvement in fitness, leg strength, blood pressure, total cholesterol level, and fat mass compared with the other group.
        Class rules
        Spinning classes are safe for most people. But get your doctor's okay if you have a heart problem or are recovering from an injury or surgery. Once you are more comfortable on the bike, you easily can do your own workouts. But it's best to experience several classes to get a feel for everything before going solo.
        To get the most out of spinning and ensure proper safety, follow these guidelines:
        Look for proper credentials. Most spinning instructors are certified to teach spinning, often through the same organizations required for personal training certification. ""Ask about your instructor's credentials, and look for certifications like Mad Dogg Spinning Instructor Certification, AFAA [Aerobics and Fitness Association of America] Indoor Cycling Certification, or Schwinn Indoor Cycling Certification,"" says Robidoux.
        Get fitted. Spinning bikes vary depending on the manufacturer. Most are designed for the average person but can be individually adjusted. Arrange a separate meeting with an instructor to show you how to adjust handlebar and seat height and position to ensure proper alignment, so you don't put too much strain on your low back and knees. ""Also, practice before class to get a feel for the spinning movement,"" says Robidoux. ""Your legs should move in a circle with no jackhammer-like bouncing.""
        Take it easy at first. People are more likely to injure themselves when they push too hard too soon. Only pedal at a pace that allows you to stay stable in the saddle, and never feel you have to do what everyone else is doing, says Robidoux. ""Go at a lower intensity if needed, stay in your comfort zone, and progress at your own pace. It is perfectly fine to skip a workout, recover, and jump back in when you are ready, or do your own thing and just pedal.""
        Keep it short. Most classes last up to an hour, but it's okay to stay for 20 or 30 minutes until you are more comfortable and your endurance increases.
        Don't forget a towel and water. You are going to sweat, so have a towel handy to wipe your brow and a water bottle to stay hydrated. Also, invest in a pair of cycling shorts, which can make sitting on the saddle more comfortable.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/sleeping-apart-good-for-your-sex-life,Sleeping apart: Good for your sex life?,"A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that one-third of respondents reported occasionally or regularly sleeping in separate rooms to accommodate a bed partner.

This may seem like a sign of a troubled relationship, but the practice is quite common and can lead to couples being happier and closer, according to Sharon Bober, associate professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and founding director of the Sexual Health Program at Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""Just because you don't always sleep in the same bed doesn't mean that you feel separated as a couple,"" she says.

Contributing issues

The main motivation behind separate sleeping is not about lack of physical desire or emotional intimacy, but simply the need for both people to get a good night's rest.

""Sharing a bed means you share the other person's sleep behavior,"" says Bober. ""If a person snores, grinds their teeth, thrashes and twitches, or gets up repeatedly at night, this can disrupt their partner's sleep, making partners more tired and irritable, which can strain the relationship.""

Other issues that could contribute to sleeping apart include environmental factors (one partner needs the bedroom to be cooler or warmer) and sleeping schedules (one might like to stay up later reading or watching TV, or might need to get up early).

""Getting restful sleep is essential for good health and a good sex life,"" says Bober. ""Sometimes sleeping in separate rooms, both people can sleep better and feel rested. Instead of resulting in something negative, this might allow for both partners to have more energy, better mood, and consequently more desire for sex.""

Pillow talk

Sometimes just one person expresses the desire to sleep separately, which can make their partner feel rejected and worry about their relationship.

""If either partner feels concerned about not sleeping in the same bed, the couple needs to talk about what might feel worrisome,"" says Bober. ""The conversation might reveal an issue not related to intimacy that has been lingering for a while.""

Before sleeping apart, another option may be to consider compromises that address the issues of disrupted sleep and are acceptable to both people.

For example, if your partner's snoring wakes you up, wear earplugs, use a bedside sound machine, or wear earbuds and listen to a podcast as you fall asleep. The snoring partner could try sleeping on their side or see a doctor to find out whether there's an underlying health problem, like sleep apnea.

Even when a couple agrees to a new sleeping arrangement, Bober suggests several strategies to enhance and maintain connection while also making the transition smoother for both partners:

Set a schedule. At first, agree to sleep apart during the week or on specific days when partners need the most rest, but choose to sleep together on the weekends and make adjustments as needed.

Make both sleeping spaces cozy. ""You both need a comfortable sleeping environment,"" says Bober. ""Make sure both people are happy with their sleeping space.""

Have a snuggle time. Before bedtime, spend time together in bed to snuggle, talk, read together, or have some romantic time; then, when it's time for sleep, move to your separate beds. You can also do the reverse: get in bed together in the morning and connect with coffee and conversation. ""This kind of flexibility can help couples continue to associate the bed with closeness, pleasure, and intimacy,"" says Bober.

Make a date for sex. Not sleeping together can interfere with spontaneous sex. If you and your partner are concerned about a declining sex life, schedule time for intimacy. ""This can create a sense of excitement and allow for anticipation,"" says Bober. To enhance the experience, tie your get-together to a date night or a romantic evening at home.

Nap together. Another idea is napping together during the day. ""Even a short nap together can help maintain the bedroom bonding and is something couples can do either on occasion or more regularly,"" says Bober.

Assess the arrangement regularly. Check in with each other every day to see what's working and what isn't. It's not good enough if sleeping separately feels helpful only for one person in the relationship. You can always go back to the drawing board and come up with a revised plan. Sleeping apart, either once in a while or more regularly, can be beneficial, if both partners are happy with the setup, sleep well, and continue to feel connected as a couple.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/take-a-nordic-walk,Take a Nordic walk,"Are you looking to ramp up your fitness walking routine or get back into exercise in a fun and safe way? Then pick up some poles and try Nordic walking.
        Nordic walking mimics the motion of cross-country skiing by using poles to push yourself as you walk along. It originated in Finland in the early 20th century as a summer training routine for cross-country skiers. However, it is now a popular way to enjoy the benefits of walking while getting a full-body workout.
        ""With regular walking, you use about 50% to 70% of your muscles, but with Nordic, you use up to 80% to 90% by further engaging your arms, shoulders, back, and core,"" says Andrea Christoforou, a physical therapist and advanced clinician with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Outpatient Center Cambridge.
        Nordic walking can offer a higher-intensity workout than walking since you pump your arms using the poles. ""The poles also help to propel you forward as you walk, which can increase walking speed and intensity,"" says Christoforou.
        Multiple benefits
        Nordic walking offers other benefits. Studies have shown that Nordic walking burns more calories than regular walking — estimates range from an increase of 18% to 67% — and may help lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol levels.
        A study published online on June 14, 2022, by the Canadian Journal of Cardiology found that people with heart disease who did Nordic walking two or three times a week for 12 weeks increased their endurance (as measured by a six-minute walking speed test) and reported greater quality of life and fewer depression symptoms than before they started the program.
        Nordic walking is ideal for older adults as it can help improve mobility and balance. Using the poles forces you to take longer steps. This helps improve your walking stride and avoid a shuffling gait that can increase the risk of falls. Poles also help protect your lower-body joints. ""When you walk with poles, the force of each stride is distributed through the poles — and less through the legs — which reduces the stress on your hips, knees, and feet,"" says Christoforou.
        Picking poles
        Unlike trekking or hiking poles, which have loose straps for your wrists, most Nordic poles come with a special glove-like system attached to each pole. You slide your hand into it and use your palm rather than your fingers to transmit power to the poles as you move forward.
        You can find Nordic poles in sporting goods stores, outdoor stores, and online. The poles are available in lightweight aluminum or carbon material, with pointed tips for trails and rubber tips for sidewalks. The height of the poles can be adjusted. Ideally, a proper pole height is when your palm can cover the top of the pole when your forearm is held out at a 90° angle to your body. Christoforou suggests that you start by walking on level surfaces like your neighborhood sidewalks or walking paths. ""As you become more experienced, venture onto nature trails with varying surfaces and inclines for more of a challenge.""
        
          
            
              
                Join the club
                While you can enjoy the benefits of Nordic walking alone, it's sometimes fun to do it as a group activity. Check out local walking clubs and senior centers for group Nordic walking events. (For more information on Nordic walking and to view instructional videos, visit the American Nordic Walking Association website.)
              
            
          
        
        Walking workouts
        There are two main Nordic walking techniques: single poling and double poling. Single poling mimics what your feet are doing, with just one pole in front of you for each stride. Do this either with the same-side arm and leg together or with the opposite arm and leg together. Double poling involves planting both poles symmetrically in front of you and pulling yourself forward as you walk three steps and then repeat.
        If you are new to Nordic walking, you have any serious health issues, or you have recently recovered from an injury or surgery, get the okay from your doctor first. Christoforou suggests easing into Nordic walking workouts.
        ""If you normally do 20- to 30-minute walks, begin by using the poles only about 25% of the time,"" she says. ""As you get comfortable with the walking rhythm, gradually increase the time you use the poles. Work up to two to three walking workouts a week, for 30 minutes to an hour each or longer if you are already used to walking more.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/10-habits-for-good-health,10 habits for good health,"The foundation of a healthy lifestyle consists of lasting habits like eating right, watching your weight, exercising regularly, managing your mental health, and getting routine medical exams. But even daily, small steps toward these goals also can have a significant impact.
        Here are some practices that can help support your ongoing health journey. While you might find it unrealistic to follow them all the time, try to include them in your daily life as much as possible.
        1. Do a morning stretch
        Stretching before getting out of bed wakes up the body, improves circulation, and promotes relaxation, helping to set the day's tone. While you're still lying in bed, move the covers aside, then flex and release your lower limbs several times. Bend your knees and lift your legs into the air. With your legs still elevated, flex your feet up and down and rotate them side to side. Next, sit up and slowly look left and then right. Roll your shoulders several times. Flex your wrists up and down, and open and close your hands repeatedly.
        2. Stay hydrated
        Proper hydration supports digestion, improves brain performance, and increases energy, among other health benefits. Drink a big glass of water after you wake up and a glass with every meal.
        3. Floss
        Maintaining good oral health includes daily flossing, but make sure you do it right. First, wrap the floss around your middle fingers, which helps you reach the back teeth. Then loop the floss around one side of a tooth, so it makes a C shape. Beginning at the gum line, slide it up and down the tooth several times. (Don't move the floss back and forth in a sawing motion. You miss cleaning the entire tooth, and the friction can irritate the gum.) Repeat on the other side of the tooth, and then the other teeth.
        4. Apply sunscreen
        Sunscreen is the best defense against skin-damaging rays. After washing your face in the morning, apply a facial moisturizer that contains sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Or blend equal parts sunscreen and a regular moisturizer. Use one or two nickel-sized dollops to cover your entire face, neck, ears, and any bald or thinning spots on your head.
        5. Go nuts
        When you crave a snack, reach for unsalted nuts and seeds like almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and cashews. They contain many beneficial nutrients and help prevent cravings for highly processed foods. Nuts are high in calories, so keep to a palm-sized portion.
        6. Nap
        Afternoon naps can recharge a weary body and may boost cognitive function. A study published online on Jan. 25, 2021, by General Psychiatry found that nappers scored higher on cognitive tests than non-nappers. The researchers found that shorter and less frequent naps — lasting less than 30 minutes, no more than four times a week — were associated with the most benefit. Schedule naps for the early afternoon, and use a timer so you don't oversleep.
        7. Bust some moves
        Break up bouts of sitting with small bursts of movement. For example, dance across a room instead of walking. When you brush your teeth, suck in your lower gut for 30 seconds, which activates your abdominal muscles. Do 10 air squats or push-ups (on the ground or against the kitchen counter). Make it a habit to stand up ""twice"" each time you stand up — that is, get up, sit back down, and then get back up.
        8. Take a breather
        Alternate-nostril breathing, in which you breathe through one nostril at a time, is believed to help reduce stress by slowing your breathing rhythm and forcing you to take deep, full breaths. Using a finger or thumb, close one nostril and slowly breathe in and out through the open nostril. After about five to 10 breaths, switch and close the other nostril and repeat the breathing pattern. For a variation, try inhaling through one nostril with the other closed, changing finger/thumb positions, and exhaling through the previously closed nostril. Then, inhale through that one, close it, and exhale through the other nostril. Go back and forth like this for a few minutes.
        9. Enjoy a hobby
        A study published online Sept. 11, 2023, by Nature Medicine suggests that having a hobby is good for people's overall health and mood. Hobbies involve creativity, sensory engagement, self-expression, relaxation, and cognitive stimulation. One way to pick up a new hobby is with a project kit designed to teach you a skill like gardening, building a model, carving wood, or making beer, soap, hot sauce, or jewelry. The kits come with instructions and all the materials you need to start. You can find kits at local bookstores or hobby stores, or go online: just type ""how-to kits"" or ""project kits"" into a search engine.
        10. Be social
        Social interactions can stave off loneliness and protect against depression and cognitive decline. Strive to have some kind of social engagement every day: make a phone call, send an email, or chat with a neighbor. Another option is to create your own social pod — a small, intimate group that you interact with regularly, like meeting for coffee or conversing over a Zoom call. Casual conversations are also helpful; for example, chat with a grocery store employee or interact with a stranger on the street.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/keto-diet-is-not-healthy-and-may-harm-the-heart,Keto diet is not healthy and may harm the heart,"The ketogenic (keto) diet — which is high in fat and protein and low in carbohydrates — doesn't meet standards for a healthy diet and may not be safe for some people with heart disease, according to a review in the March 2024 issue of Current Problems in Cardiology.
        The review summarized the current evidence on how keto diets may raise heart disease risk. While the diet may dramatically reduce fat mass and weight over the short term, there is scarce evidence for any long-term benefit. Ketogenic diets appear to lower blood levels of triglycerides but raise levels of artery-clogging LDL cholesterol. With respect to lowering blood sugar and blood pressure, the observed short-term benefits fade over time.
        The diet's extreme carbohydrate restrictions may lead people to shun most vegetables and fruits and consume large amounts of leafy greens. But the vitamin K in these foods may interfere with the anti-clotting drug warfarin taken by some heart patients. And drugs known as SGLT-2 inhibitors, which are used to treat diabetes and heart failure, may be incompatible with a keto diet, according to the review.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/yoga-skepticism,Yoga skepticism,"Yoga pants. Yoga mats. Yoga bolsters, blocks, and straps. You'd be forgiven if the first things you think of when contemplating yoga are the accessories it seems to require — or pervasive images suggesting people devoted to the ancient practice are all slender, flexible, and preternaturally zen.
        None of it is imperative, however — neither the equipment nor the image. So if you've held back from trying yoga for these reasons, you may want to reconsider, says Dr. Darshan Mehta, medical director of the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        ""People think they have to be super-flexible and thin to do it, and that's just not true,"" Dr. Mehta says. ""I also don't think people realize how many varieties of yoga can be adapted to the individual."" (See ""Which yoga style suits you?"")
        
          
            
              
                Which yoga style suits you?
                Yoga isn't a monolith. Indeed, the practice is as flexible as we try to become when practicing its poses, or asanas. Some yoga approaches are more soothing and others more physically demanding. Here are basics on six of the most common yoga styles:
                Ashtanga requires strength and endurance, making it ideal for experienced yoga fans.
                Bikram is ideal for building flexibility. It's often called ""hot yoga"" because it's practiced in heated, humid studios. But the high temperature may be dangerous for people with certain conditions or taking certain medications, so check with your doctor before taking a Bikram class.
                Hatha combines basic poses with simple breathing techniques and is considered more relaxing.
                Iyengar often integrates props such as blocks or straps to help you get into poses. The precision focus helps to strengthen key muscles that support joints, making it a good choice if you have injuries or pain issues
                Kundalini offers a more spiritual experience, emphasizing chanting and breathing.
                Vinyasa is more fast-paced and requires continuous movement. It's a good option if you hope to gain cardio benefits from yoga.
              
            
          
        
        Women-dominated pursuit
        More than 300 million people worldwide practice yoga, which originated in India more than 5,000 years ago. In the United States, the number reached 38 million in 2022 — 1.7 million more than just six years earlier — and 74% are women, according to a 2022 global survey by the nonprofit Yoga Alliance.
        But despite its growing popularity, a slice of humanity remains yoga skeptics. What stops people from trying it? Yoga seems too ""touchy-feely"" for certain folks, Dr. Mehta says, while others may erroneously believe its spiritual origins conflict with their own religion or faith tradition. Yet more feel it's too costly, once classes and gear are factored in.
        But the pluses outweigh any perceived drawbacks, Dr. Mehta says. Scads of recent studies indicate yoga is a boon for physical and mental health, easing depression, boosting sleep quality, improving chronic pain, and reducing cardiovascular disease risks by lowering blood pressure and blood sugar levels. As they reap these advantages, some practitioners are also motivated to reach for other wellness goals such as drinking less alcohol, eating more fruits and vegetables, and quitting smoking, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.
        ""Well into the thousands of studies support yoga's benefits,"" Dr. Mehta says. ""There's a whole host of medical conditions where yoga has been shown to be helpful.""
        Plunging in
        If you're still reluctant to try yoga, Dr. Mehta offers several suggestions to overcome any misgivings:
        Join a class. It shouldn't be difficult to find one, since essentially ""every single fitness studio or gym has yoga classes now,"" he says. In-person is preferable to online formats so the teacher can guide you through your first poses. ""Just like any activity, if you don't have proper guidance, you can get hurt,"" he says.
        Take a friend along. It will be easier to dip your toe in if you do your first yoga postures alongside a buddy. Plus, ""people like being in community with others,"" Dr. Mehta says. ""There's a group effect.""
        Ask for modifications. If you have physical limitations such as pain or joint problems, ask your teacher to help you modify poses to accommodate them. You may also want to try what's often called chair yoga, in which you stay seated or use a chair for balance.
        Be patient with yourself. It's okay if your poses don't immediately resemble those done by longtime practitioners. ""One of the things that's so beautiful about yoga,"" Dr. Mehta says, ""is it allows you to understand the edges of yourself — how you can gently push yourself but not overdo it.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/caregiving-crisis,Caregiving crisis,"If a traditional caregiving scenario were captured on time-lapse video, Katherine Lyman contends that early scenes would depict an adult daughter accompanying her aging parent to a doctor's appointment looking ""put together"" and on top of things. Just a few years later, however, the daughter would appear drastically different — ""really disheveled, because she isn't taking care of herself.""
        ""I cannot tell you how many times I've leaned forward, looked the daughter in the eyes, and asked, 'How are you coping with all of this? What are you doing to let off steam? It's great that you're keeping all these plates spinning, but it comes at a cost,'"" recounts Lyman, a geriatric nurse practitioner at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Increasingly, that cost is caregivers' own health and well-being. Indeed, the story of caregiving in the United States is becoming something of a cautionary tale as troubling forces collide.
        More caregivers are on tap than ever, with 43 million Americans providing unpaid assistance to a family member or another loved one. Nearly three-quarters are 50 or older themselves, while more than 75% are women, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance. Meanwhile, an estimated 73 million Americans will be 65 or older by 2030, potentially fueling the need for additional caregivers.
        Longevity is perhaps the biggest contributor to the brewing storm, Harvard experts say. ""A lot of us are living into our late years and living very well and independently, but not all of us,"" Lyman says. ""Those years may come with increased infirmity or cognitive impairment, or both.""
        Spectrum of responsibilities
        As people age, several core issues tend to prompt the need for spouses, adult children, or others to step in to help. Let's dub the problem areas the three M's: mobility, memory, and medications. Yet caregiving is far from a one-size-fits-all proposition, with duties falling on a spectrum from occasional to relentless and minor to suffocating.
        ""It runs the gamut from actually living with the person to living in a different state and putting cameras in different rooms to check on them,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, clinical chief of gerontology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""Some caregivers come periodically, fill pill boxes, take people to doctor's appointments, or take them shopping. But caregiving can also be financial: paying the bills, organizing the taxes, or taking over as power of attorney.""
        Whether they're popping in a few times a week or handling daily bathing, dressing, and toileting — or something in between — caregivers often wear many hats, Lyman notes. ""You become not just their caregiver, but their confidante, psychiatrist, chef, grocery shopper, laundress, chauffeur, and pharmacist,"" she says.
        Health fallout
        Such comprehensive responsibilities can exact an underappreciated physical and mental toll — especially if your loved one's deterioration is prolonged — and create a downward spiral that affects both caregiver and recipient. Six in 10 caregivers work part or full-time, spreading themselves even thinner.
        Copious research has focused on the mental health fallout. Between 40% and 70% of caregivers deal with significant symptoms of depression. And those who are women fare worse than men who take on such duties, reporting higher levels of depression and anxiety.
        Similarly, a wide range of studies point to caregiving's physical consequences, especially pain. Caregivers are prone to headaches and often suffer back injuries or cope with arthritis, Dr. Salamon says.
        A Sept. 1, 2023, study published by The Gerontologist that gathered data from nearly 2,000 caregivers (average age 62) showed just over half suffered pain of some kind. About 30% said their pain limited the ways they could provide care.
        Caregivers also face an increased risk of heart disease, and women caring for a spouse are more likely to report having high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance.
        ""Many caregivers in their 50s, 60s, and 70s have their own health issues,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""It gets more stressful as time goes on and the patient and caregiver both get older.""
        About 10% of caregivers acknowledge their own health has suffered as a result of their responsibilities. But that doesn't mean they're vigilantly attending to it. Nearly three-quarters reported not having gone to a doctor as often as they should, while more than half had missed medical appointments, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance.
        ""People start losing weight, not eating properly, and not paying attention to themselves,"" Lyman says. ""Their health takes a back seat, and so do their interests.""
        
          
            
              
                How to rally the troops
                Even in large families, the lion's share of caregiving responsibilities often falls to one sibling when Mom or Dad is declining. But family members should recognize that the caregiver isn't a hero—and shouldn't be expected to perform like one.
                ""I don't think a lot of family members realize how stressful caregiving is, and they don't offer to help,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, clinical chief of gerontology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""They leave it to the caregiver to ask them, and that's not right. They need to wholeheartedly offer.""
                To smooth that process—and the sometimes-fraught dynamic between caregiver and other relatives—Harvard experts offer these tips:
                Call a family meeting. This can be held in person or over Zoom, ideally including the patient's doctor or a geriatric care manager. The best result: everyone gets on the same page about day-to-day problems and caregiving responsibilities that require attention.
                Create a schedule. This might include setting up a shared online calendar for family members to sign up for tasks and time periods to chip in.
                Rotate care. ""Set up a schedule so every day 'belongs' to a different child,"" Dr. Salamon suggests.
                Match people's tasks to their abilities. If your sister is a finance whiz, she's probably the right one to handle Dad's taxes. Your brother is a lawyer? Ask him to sort out the legal nuances of Mom's property sale.
                Be specific. If you're the caregiver, you may want two hours to go to a social event or appointment. Say so. ""It's very important to make your requests concrete, tell others exactly what you need, and do it in spite of any guilt,"" Dr. Salamon says.
                Ask how you can help. If you're not the main caregiver, can you take over one evening each week or stay for a weekend? Or perhaps you can coordinate services such as housecleaning, yard work, or transportation to medical appointments. Be explicit about what you can provide. ""Say, 'I can take Mom to the hairdresser on Wednesday afternoon,' or, 'I'm coming on Wednesday for two hours—why don't you take some time off?'"" Dr. Salamon says.
              
            
          
        
        Finding help
        Even as they feel the strain, caregivers are often loath to seek support. ""They're good at giving help, but lousy at asking for it,"" Lyman says.
        Still, it's crucial to make that leap. Harvard experts offer these strategies for caregivers to preserve body and soul:
        Look into respite care. Some assisted living or nursing facilities provide temporary care so family members can take a vacation. Adult day programs can provide a daily break. ""Sometimes they only run from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., but that can be huge,"" Lyman says. ""And some provide transportation.""
        Call your local Agency on Aging. Some offer housekeeping services to eligible older adults, while others coordinate volunteers who can pinch-hit and ""stay for a few hours so the caregiver can get out and be free for a little while,"" Dr. Salamon says.
        Sniff out informal help. ""Ask friends who drive if they can pick Mom up and bring her to the senior center or to her hair appointment,"" Lyman suggests.
        Explore houses of worship. Local religious groups may have cadres of helpers. ""Some have volunteers who pick up people who want to go to their service and take them home afterward,"" Lyman says.
        Consider therapy. Nearly four in 10 caregivers describe their responsibilities as emotionally stressful. Talking to a therapist can bring relief.
        Tap into telehealth. Schedule virtual visits with doctors or therapists to get the care you need. ""You don't have to leave Mom unattended,"" Lyman says. ""You can go into the next room and shut the door for a half-hour or hour.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-berberine-help-me-lose-weight,Can berberine help me lose weight?,"Q.
          I saw on social media that a supplement called berberine produces the same weight-loss benefits as medications like Wegovy. Is that true?
        
        A. No, it's not. And this is yet another example why we should be skeptical when social media platforms dispense so-called health advice, since taking berberine can cause unpleasant and even harmful side effects.
        Here's the dynamic at play: the incredible demand for semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for obesity) and similar weight-loss drugs — which dampen appetite and help people feel full — has stirred renewed interest in berberine. Long touted for calming gastrointestinal nuisances, the plant extract has also been linked to reduced blood sugar levels. Some people say it suppresses appetite and promotes weight loss, but there's no rigorous scientific evidence to support that claim.
        It's important to know that berberine can alter how quickly the liver breaks down medications — including anti-clotting drugs and immunosuppressants — and change their effectiveness. It also has side effects such as diarrhea, constipation, gas, and upset stomach. Since the FDA doesn't regulate dietary supplements, there's no guarantee how much berberine is contained in a product. Talk to your doctor if you want to explore it further — but don't buy into social media claims that berberine is ""nature's Ozempic.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-the-difference-between-age-spots-and-sun-spots,What's the difference between age spots and sun spots?,"Q.
          I have a couple of brown skin patches that look like age spots. But my friend says they might be sun spots, which can develop into skin cancer. How can I tell the difference?
        
        A. It's an important question, since distinguishing sun spots from age spots — or ""liver"" spots, as our grandmothers called them — can help us determine when to seek a doctor's evaluation. Both spots tend to appear on areas that get a lot of sun exposure, such as the face, hands, arms, and shoulders.
        The color of age spots ranges from pink to tan to brown. They're bigger than freckles and usually oval-shaped. They're often found in clusters. Age spots can be unsightly, but they are harmless.
        Sun spots, known medically as actinic keratoses, come in a variety of colors. The biggest difference between harmless age spots and sun spots (actinic keratoses) is the texture. Age spots are smooth and flat, but potentially dangerous actinic keratoses usually feel rough and scaly. Actinic keratoses can develop into skin cancer, so it's vital that you show any such spots to your doctor. And if you're in doubt about any type of skin changes, it's also wise to point those out.

Bands also can train your muscles to contract faster during everyday movements like stretching, bending, lifting, or rising from a chair.
        There are several types of resistance bands. The most common is a single length of stretchy material. Another kind is an enclosed loop that resembles a giant rubber band. A third type is a thin rubber tube with handles.
        With a plain band, you increase the resistance by wrapping the ends around your hands and adjusting your hand position to shorten or increase the length. The looped type works the same way — you hold the ends and move your hand positions to make the stretched length shorter or longer. For the band with handles, you change the resistance by how close or far apart you place your feet when standing on the tube.
        Ready to join the band? Here is an exercise to get you started:
        Chest punches. Place the exercise band around your back and under your armpits. Hold an end in each hand by your shoulders. With control, punch your right arm out in front of you on a slight diagonal across your body. Repeat with the left arm. That's one rep. Complete eight to 12 reps.

But a small randomized trial published online Feb. 9, 2024, by JAMA Network Open found that tai chi was better at lowering blood pressure than aerobic activity (the kind that works your heart and lungs). Researchers divided about 340 people with elevated blood pressure — a precursor stage to high blood pressure — into two groups. One group practiced tai chi for an hour four times a week. The other group did an hour of aerobic exercise (stair climbing, jogging, brisk walking, or cycling) four times a week. After one year, systolic blood pressure (the top number in a measurement) had dropped by an average of seven points for people in the tai chi group, compared with about four points in the aerobics group. The researchers speculate that tai chi might have the edge because it triggers the body's relaxation response, which helps lower blood pressure. But don't give up aerobic exercise; it's still crucial for many aspects of health. Just think of tai chi as another helpful tool.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/surprising-symptoms-of-chronic-heartburn,Surprising symptoms of chronic heartburn,"With a name like heartburn, it's easy to assume that the condition always shows up as a fiery feeling in your chest or stomach. While that's certainly the classic symptom, chronic heartburn can also make its presence known in other ways, such as a tingling feeling in the nose, chest pressure, a bitter or metallic taste, a hoarse voice, tooth damage, or a dry cough.
        What's the link between these symptoms and that spicy spaghetti you had for dinner? Stomach acid. It can leak up into the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. Chronic leakage is a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is responsible for symptoms that you might mistake for other conditions.
        Heart symptoms
        Sometimes acid reflux irritates the upper part of the stomach or the esophagus, which can cause chest pain or pressure, mimicking pain from a partial blockage in a heart artery or even a heart attack.
        What you should do. If you're worried about sudden pain in your chest, don't try to figure out if it's heartburn. ""This is especially true for people with heart disease risk factors,"" says Dr. Christopher Cannon, a cardiologist and editor in chief of the Harvard Heart Letter.
        But discerning the difference between heartburn and heart problems is complicated, and it's best to talk to a doctor about it.
        ""Chest pain can come from many causes, like acid reflux, but also stress, lung irritation, or muscle aches,"" Dr. Cannon says. ""We have to consider your heart disease risk factors. For example, do you have high blood pressure or diabetes? Does the pain come with exercise? Those could all point to heart trouble, and we might order tests. If the pain comes when you lie down after eating a heavy meal, and taking an antacid makes it better, then it's likely heartburn.""
        
          
            
              
                Lifestyle strategies to combat heartburn
                Lifestyle habits are an important part of thwarting heartburn. Try as many of the following as possible:
                
                  Avoid foods and drinks that seem to trigger heartburn symptoms, such as anything spicy, fatty, fried, greasy, or acidic (like tomato sauces or citrus); foods with onions or garlic; alcohol; soda; and anything with caffeine, such as coffee, tea, or chocolate.
                  Eat smaller meals.
                  Stay upright for at least two hours after meals.
                  Avoid late-night eating or drinking (especially alcohol).
                  Sleep on a wedge pillow.
                  Quit smoking.
                  Lose weight if you need to.
                
              
            
          
        
        Nose or throat symptoms
        In GERD, stomach acid can get up high in the throat and even the area behind the nose, triggering a number of potential symptoms.
        ""The upper airway isn't built to have the same protections as the stomach or esophagus, so when reflux comes up, it causes injury, almost like a low-level chemical burn. It can cause a dry cough, a sore throat, a hoarse voice, a feeling like there's a lump or mucus plug in the back of the throat, or a tingling feeling in the nose,"" says Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya, an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ENT) at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        Because these symptoms overlap with many other conditions, such as a cold or allergies, it can be a long time before you recognize that you have GERD.
        What you should do: If you suspect GERD might be causing your symptoms, talk to your primary care provider or an ENT. ""We usually recommend that someone go on a four-week trial of heartburn medications, such as over-the-counter omeprazole, and make temporary lifestyle changes to avoid heartburn triggers,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. (See ""Lifestyle strategies to combat heartburn."")
        ""If symptoms improve after four weeks, it's a good indicator that you probably have reflux disease,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says.
        Mouth or dental symptoms
        For some people, GERD symptoms might seem more like mouth or dental problems.
        ""If the acid reaches your mouth, you might develop mouth sores or ulcers, erosion or wear on your teeth, or cavities. The cavities could be due to the acid, sugary heartburn medications, your diet, poor oral hygiene, or a combination of those factors,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, a prosthodontist in the Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Acid reflux can also create a bitter or metallic taste in the mouth.
        What you should do. If you suspect that acid reflux is reaching your mouth, rinse frequently with water to neutralize it and protect your gums, soft tissues, and teeth. ""Wait 30 minutes after meals or after detecting reflux to brush your teeth. This allows your saliva — and water that you rinse with or drink — to neutralize the mouth's acidity,"" Dr. Jiang says. ""Just before brushing, rinse with water to eliminate the acid first, so you don't accidentally brush the acid against your teeth and cause more extensive wear. And get your teeth cleaned at least twice a year.""

Until recently, you would have had to go to a sleep lab, get hooked up to dozens of sensors, and spend the night. Now, thanks to the miniaturization of sophisticated technology, you can conduct a basic sleep test in your own bed. ""Home sleep tests are often the preferred approach to detect sleep apnea, not just by doctors, but also by insurance companies. Many are no longer covering in-lab studies, which cost thousands of dollars. A home sleep test costs a few hundred dollars, and it's usually covered,"" says Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        However, she cautions that you can't always rely on results from a home test.
        What's involved?
        You need a prescription for a home sleep test. You can talk to your primary care physician or a sleep specialist about it. Or you can order a home sleep test online from any number of companies. You visit a company's website, purchase the test, and talk to a company-affiliated doctor via telemedicine. The doctor can prescribe the test if it's right for you.

Dr. Javaheri has reservations about arranging a test online. ""You won't know if it's the best-quality sleep test or the best interpretation of the results. A lot of those companies just send a standardized blurb about the results,"" she says.
        Taking the test
        Either you will pick up your test from your doctor's office or the test will be delivered to you. It involves wearing a few small sensors overnight, typically
        
          a nasal cannula, a loop of thin tubing worn under the nose to measure your breathing patterns
          a pulse oximeter, a small gadget placed on the finger to measure oxygen levels in your blood
          a chest strap, an adjustable belt that measures the effort or movement your body is making to breathe.
          Each of those sensors plugs into a small data monitor, which is worn on the chest strap.
        
        A newer type of home sleep test has even less equipment. The data recorder is worn on the wrist, like a watch. It connects to a pulse oximeter and a small chest sensor. The chest sensor measures breathing effort and snoring sounds.
        Test results
        While it's not as detailed or as accurate as an in-lab sleep study, a high-quality home sleep test yields fairly reliable results. ""You have an 80% chance that the test will be right,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""But we compare the results with your symptoms to help make sure the results are accurate and to determine the best treatment options.""
        If the test results don't match your symptoms—for example, if you have sleep apnea symptoms and a negative test result — your doctor will have to investigate further. ""We'll look at the context of the results and the circumstances of the test. It could be that you had nasal congestion on the night of the test, you were breathing through your mouth, and the nasal sensor didn't pick that up,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""If we have strong suspicions that you have sleep apnea, we'll need to schedule an in-lab study.""
        
          
            
              
                What is obstructive sleep apnea?
                
                  
                
                Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition marked by 10- to 30-second pauses in breathing during sleep. Those pauses are called apneas and can occur hundreds of times per night. The breathing disruptions occur when the airway in your nose or throat becomes partially or completely blocked by large tonsils, a large tongue, or too much tissue in the airway. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, daytime sleepiness, and car accidents.

        Should you consider a home test?
        The tests aren't for everyone. People with a serious chronic condition, such as heart failure or a breathing disorder, may need additional data from an in-lab study to help determine treatment. For people who don't have serious chronic conditions, a home sleep test can be a game changer.
        ""If you have a straightforward case, it's the best way to go,"" Dr. Javaheri says. ""It's cost-effective, and it's more comfortable than an in-lab study. And since you are doing the test at home, it is more likely to capture your natural sleep habits.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/protect-yourself-from-falls-outside-the-home,Protect yourself from falls outside the home,"Even if you've fall-proofed your home, the outside world is full of hazards that might lead to dangerous trips and tumbles. And since falls are a major cause of broken bones, head injuries, and injury-related deaths, especially as we get older, it's essential to know how to stay safe once you step outside your door. Here are tips to avoid falls in a variety of public areas.
        Stores
        Stores often have smooth floors that can be slippery or even wet. When you're going shopping, make sure you're wearing shoes with nonslip treads. If you suspect that you have a balance problem, plan on using something for support during your shopping trip. ""That could be a shopping cart that you lean on or a store's electric scooter. Or use a rollator, a type of walker with four wheels, hand brakes, a basket, and a built-in seat. It keeps you stable and gives you a chance to sit down and take a break anywhere,"" says Barbara Ranucci, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        She also advises being extra careful when reaching for items. ""If they're above your shoulders, you might lose your balance and fall backward,"" Ranucci says. ""When reaching, stand with one foot forward and one foot back for stability, or just ask for assistance.""
        Crowded venues
        Busy airports, shopping malls, concert halls, or theaters can land you in the middle of crowds, with lots of people who might bump into you, causing a fall. To guard yourself, hold on to a partner as you walk, or use a rollator for stability. ""The rollator will also act as a red flag to others to use caution around you and give you space,"" Ranucci says.
        Parks and playgrounds
        Are you going for a walk, jog, or hike in a park? Are you taking your grandkids to a playground? Keep an eye out for uneven terrain, which increases your fall risk. Red-flag areas include the spots where two types of terrain meet, such as a parking lot and a mulchy playground. Make sure you wear the proper footwear, such as sneakers with deep (not flat) treads or hiking boots.
        Public staircases
        If you feel unstable on stairs, it's best to avoid them and take an elevator. If you don't have that option, use extra caution on stairs. They might not be the same depth or width as the stairs you're used to at home. Above all, hold the handrail. Wear glasses if you need them. Go slowly. And if the stairway is dark, keep one hand on the railing and the other on a small portable flashlight (or your smartphone, with a flashlight app) to light the way.
        Public bathrooms
        Bathrooms are notorious for having wet, slippery floors that cause falls. And public bathrooms often have the added hazards of poor lighting and low toilets.
        Go into the bathroom with caution. Ranucci advises that you always have your phone with you, in case you can't get up from a low toilet seat and need to call for assistance.
        You might also need your phone's flashlight if the bathroom lighting is low. If possible, use the handicap stall, which has grab bars and a higher toilet.
        If you have to cross a wet floor, walk slowly, with your feet pointed slightly outward for more stability.
        Parking lots or garages
        While it's good exercise to park far from a store and walk a longer distance, avoid doing this if you have endurance issues or joint pain that increases your fall risk. Park closer to your destination, and don't be reluctant to ask your doctor to approve a handicap placard if you need one.
        Also: avoid parking too close to another vehicle and assuming you can squeeze between your car and the other. Ranucci says that makes it difficult to exit a vehicle safely, especially if you use an assistive walking device. And if you have to do any turning or sidestepping to move between vehicles, you might increase the risk of losing your footing and falling.
        When possible, give yourself plenty of space to get out of your vehicle and move freely. If you have a handicap placard, use the space if it's available.
        Office buildings
        Office buildings are filled with the same types of hazards found at home, such as stairs, slippery floors, floor clutter, poor lighting, and loose rugs. Plus, they can have escalators, ladders, scaffolding, industrial equipment, and construction areas — which all increase the risk for falls.
        Remove what you can from your work space, such as floor clutter and long electrical cords, and report fall hazards to management.
        And if you're visiting an office building — say, for an appointment with your doctor — try not to rush as you walk; move deliberately. Scour the environment as if you're conducting an inspection for potential fall hazards, and avoid them.
        
          
            
              
                Consider how the weather affects your fall risk
                Preparing for the weather before going out is an important part of the plan to maintain balance and avoid a fall.
                If it's hot and sunny, dehydration can make you feel overheated or woozy, which can cause a fall. Wear a hat, bring a water bottle, stay hydrated, and head for the shade or airconditioned spaces when possible.
                If it's rainy or icy, the risk of slipping increases. Wear the right gear, including nonslip shoes. ""You need supportive shoes that fit well and have good anti-slip treads. We recommend wearing rubber or spiked shoe covers that you pull on over the sole of your sneaker or boot,"" says Barbara Ranucci, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
              
            
          
        
        A final word
        No matter where you go, balance training will help you do a better job of navigating fall hazards.
        ""Leg and core strength are among the most important components for balance,"" Ranucci says. ""Your vision, inner ear health, and sensitivity in your feet and joints are also essential components of balance."" She advises seeking physical therapy if you suspect you have balance issues.
        If you're generally healthy, make sure your regular exercise routine includes leg and core strengtheners such as sit-to-stands (standing in front of a chair, sitting down, then standing again, five to 10 times in a row), lunges, and leg lifts. And try balance exercises, such as standing on one leg for 30 seconds at a time or walking across a room as if you're walking on a tightrope.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/taming-high-triglycerides,Taming high triglycerides,"When you get a cholesterol test (also known as a lipid panel or lipid profile), the most important value is your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, sometimes called ""bad"" cholesterol. High LDL levels track closely with the artery-clogging process at the root of most heart disease. But a lipid panel also reveals your blood level of triglycerides, which are the most common form of fat both in food and in your bloodstream. Because levels rise after you eat, triglycerides need to be measured after at least eight hours of fasting to get an accurate reading for treatment decisions. When and why should you pay attention to your triglyceride value?
        For healthy adults, a normal level is less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), but 25% to 30% of Americans have values that exceed that level. Values of 151 to 200 mg/dL are borderline high; those 201 to 499 are high, and those 500 and higher are very high.
        When does risk start to rise?
        Many studies have linked high triglycerides to a heightened risk of heart disease. ""But when you adjust for having related problems, such as obesity or type 2 diabetes, the association isn't quite as strong,"" says Dr. Nicholas Marston, a preventive cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Still, a recent study found that the risk of heart-related problems starts to rise at triglyceride levels greater than 89 mg/dL — far lower than the 150 mg/dL value long considered to be normal. The study, published Feb. 6, 2024, in the Journal of the American Heart Association, included more than 14,000 Italian adults who were followed for an average of just over 11 years.
        How to lower triglycerides
        The good news is that lifestyle changes can have a big impact on triglyceride levels.

""If people with high triglycerides eat a healthier diet, exercise regularly, and lose weight, they can lower their levels by more than 50%,"" says Dr. Marston. These tips can help:
        Choose carbs wisely. Cut back on easily digested carbohydrates like white bread, white rice, chips, sugar-laden breakfast cereals, and anything else — including beverages — with a lot of added sugar.
        Watch fats. Cut back on saturated fats from meat and butter, which can elevate triglycerides. Try to eat more unsaturated fats from plants, oils, and fish, which bring down triglycerides.
        Avoid excess alcohol. Moderate drinking (one drink per day for women, two for men) may be reasonable. But less is better if your triglycerides are high.
        Get moving. Regular exercise lowers triglycerides.

                    The numbers are shocking. Just three out of 10 American adults are active enough to stay healthy and fit, and nearly four out of 10 admit they aren’t active at all, despite reams of research proving that exercise is a powerful preventive, and sometimes an antidote, for disability and illness. Which side of this divide are you standing on — and why? Maybe you’re not sure what blend of exercise is best. Or perhaps you know exactly what you need to do, but your workouts have become so humdrum that it’s harder than ever to dig up the energy to do them. Do you want to jump-start your sputtering exercise program? Or are you stuck on a plateau and wishing you could kick it up to the next level?

Aim for a healthy weight. If you qualify as obese or overweight, reaching a healthy body weight can drive your triglycerides down to a normal range. Dropping even just 5% to 10% of your weight can help.
        Medication for high triglycerides
        Anyone with a triglyceride level of 150 to 499 should be checked and treated for any underlying health problems that might be to blame, including diabetes, obesity, a low thyroid level (hypothyroidism), and liver or kidney disease. But when triglycerides remain high after addressing these issues and making lifestyle changes, medication may be a good idea, especially for people at risk for cardiovascular disease.
        Many people in this category are already taking a cholesterol-lowering statin, which lowers triglycerides by about 30%. Drugs known as fibrates, including fenofibrate (Antara, TriCor, others) and gemfibrozil (Lopid) lower triglyceride levels by about 50%, but they do not lower the risk of heart attack or stroke when added to a statin. Icosapent ethyl (Vascepa), which contains a highly purified form of a specific fat in fish oil, lowers triglycerides by about 30%. And when people with diabetes or heart disease take icosapent ethyl with a statin, it lowers their risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from cardiac causes by about 25%.
        On the horizon
        Very high triglyceride levels (500 mg/dL and above) sometimes have a genetic component. An extreme example is familial hyperchylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), which affects just one to two in a million people. These people — whose blood appears milky from the high fat levels — are prone to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Serious cases can be life-threatening. Two investigational drugs, plozasiran and olezarsen, are RNA-targeted therapies that put the brakes on a protein that controls triglyceride metabolism. Both drugs lower triglyceride levels dramatically and eliminate the risk of pancreatitis, says Dr. Marston. These drugs may also prove helpful for treating people with moderately elevated triglycerides levels, he adds.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sleep-and-brain-health-whats-the-connection,Sleep and brain health: What's the connection?,"Asleep shortfall doesn't just make you feel groggy and grumpy the next day. Over time, insufficient sleep can harm your cardiovascular health. The evidence is so compelling that the American Heart Association (AHA) added healthy sleep duration to its ""Life's Essential 8"" recommendations to lower heart attack and stroke risk.
        Adults should strive for seven to nine hours of sleep each night. But the quality of your sleep is also important, says Dr. Susan Redline, the Peter C. Farrell professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School. Various sleep problems can cause disrupted or fragmented sleep (see ""What's sabotaging your sleep?"").
        ""Even if you sleep for at least seven hours, sleep disruptions can prevent you from getting enough deep sleep and may also cause unhealthy blood pressure surges,"" says Dr. Redline. Those problems may increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease and cognitive issues, according to a scientific statement by the AHA published in the March 2024 issue of the journal Stroke. Cerebro­vascular disease includes conditions that affect the brain's blood vessels, including ""silent"" strokes, which go unrecognized.
        
          
            
              
                What's sabotaging your sleep?
                These disorders can affect not only the duration but also the depth and continuity of sleep.
                Insomnia refers to the inability to fall or stay asleep, which is commonly linked to stress or anxiety. Other possible sleep disrupters include painful medical conditions; caffeine or alcohol use; and environmental factors such as light, noise, an uncomfortable bed, or a room that's too hot or cold.
                Obstructive sleep apnea is marked by repeated pauses in breathing caused by narrowing of the throat during sleep, which can lead to drops in oxygen levels and to multiple awakenings throughout the night.
                Periodic limb movement disorder is characterized by involuntary jerking or twitching movements in the legs during sleep.
                For more information, see Harvard Health Publishing's Special Health Report Improving Sleep.
              
            
          
        
        Why deep sleep is vital
        Over the course of the night, people cycle through different phases of sleep, spending about a quarter of the time in deep (slow-wave) sleep — a phase that's vital to restoring energy and supporting memory, says Dr. Redline, who co-authored the AHA statement. Blood pressure and heart rate are at their lowest point during deep sleep. Meanwhile, the brain's housekeeping system — a series of channels called the glymphatic system, which drains cerebrospinal fluid — flushes away toxins, including beta-amyloid and other proteins linked to Alzheimer's disease.
        When people don't get sufficient amounts of deep sleep, blood pressure may not decline as it should. This can trigger activity in cells in blood vessel walls and activate damaging inflammation. The glymphatic system, whose function depends on healthy brain blood vessels, may falter.
        Foiled by fragmented sleep?
        Brief awakenings during the night, especially those caused by sleep apnea, can cause surges in the hormone epinephrine and raise blood pressure, a problem known as nocturnal hypertension. ""These blood pressure elevations can leave people at risk for cerebrovascular problems,"" says Dr. Redline. Small blood vessels deep in the brain may be damaged by tiny clots or microbleeds, causing so-called silent strokes, which cause no noticeable symptoms. But a series of such strokes over time can lead to a condition known as multi-infarct dementia.
        What you can do
        If you don't feel rested and refreshed when you wake up in the morning despite getting at least seven hours of sleep, you might have a sleep disorder. Talk to your doctor for help identifying and addressing the problem, Dr. Redline advises. If your bed partner or family member says you snore loudly, see ""Should you be tested for sleep apnea?"" in the May 2023 Heart Letter.
        Even if you don't think you have insomnia, you might be experiencing frequent, brief awakenings without noticing them. Wearable devices (monitors worn on the wrist or finger) feature apps that measure sleep efficiency. The data may provide clues about brief awakenings as well as limb movements during sleep, says Dr. Redline.
        Make an effort to follow all the steps in Life's Essential 8, which are closely interrelated. ""Think of sleep as one of the vital habits that helps reinforce all the other healthy practices,"" says Dr. Redline.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/losing-weight-can-help-you-lose-the-pain-too,"Losing weight can help you lose the pain, too","If you experience knee or foot pain, extra weight may be adding more stress to your joints — and more pain. Fortunately, losing weight often helps to relieve some kinds of pain.
        Finding an eating plan that is healthful and enjoyable will help you stick with your weight loss goals for the long term and maintain any weight loss you manage to achieve.
        To help manage your weight, consider these approaches to cut back on calories:
        
          Keep track of how much you eat. It may seem simple, butkeeping a food diary can provide you with valuable feedback on your eating habits.
          Make small changes. Change your diet slowly to ensure you will be able to stick with it. Abruptly reducing the amount and type of foods you eat will likely backfire, causing you to go back to overeating.
          Use mindfulness techniques. Be mindful of when, where, and how much you're eating and when you begin to feel full. One tip is to take 20 minutes to finish a meal. That's the amount of time it takes your stomach to signal your brain that you are full. While eating, focus on your food rather than reading or watching TV. Put your fork down between bites and chew your food slowly and well. Observe the texture, taste, and aroma of the food you're eating. Bringing all of your senses into play can heighten your desire for fresh, healthy foods and help break the cycle of stress-related eating.
          Keep highly caloric food out of sight. Foods such as a candy bar, that contain a lot of calories but do not fill you up, will contribute to weight gain. Instead, put out apples or bananas, which are very filling and contain relatively few calories.
          Use smaller serving sizes and plates. Smaller portions equal fewer calories. Take advantage of 100-calorie snack packs or serve your food on smaller plates.
          Be self-compassionate. When you overeat, don't punish yourself. It won't motivate you to get back on track. Psychologists now believe that gentle self-compassion is far more effective for dealing with life's challenges, including weight loss.
        
        As for physical activity, many forms of exercise are more difficult for people with hip or knee pain. Exercises that are easy on the joints include swimming and water aerobics. Talk with your doctor or physical therapist, who can recommend other ways to incorporate physical activity without making your joint pain worse.
        There is no magic answer to how much weight you need to lose in order to make a difference regarding your joint pain. As few as 10 pounds or 10% of your overall weight might help, but this can vary from one individual to another.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-and-why-to-fit-more-fiber-and-fermented-food-into-your-meals-202404263036,How — and why — to fit more fiber and fermented food into your meals,"An F may mean failure in school, but the letter earns high marks in your diet. The two biggest dietary Fs — fiber and fermented foods — are top priorities to help maintain healthy digestion, and they potentially offer much more. How can you fit these nutrients into meals? Can this help your overall health as well as gut health?
        Fiber, fermented foods, and the gut microbiome
        The gut microbiome is a composed of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms living in the colon (large intestine). What you eat, the air you breathe, where you live, and many other factors affect the makeup of the gut microbiome. Some experts think of it as a hidden organ because it has a role in many important functions of the body — for example, helping the immune system function optimally, reducing chronic inflammation, keeping intestinal cells healthy, and providing some essential micronutrients that may not be included in a regular diet.
        Your gut communicates with your brain through pathways in the gut-brain axis. Changes in the gut microbiome have been linked with mood and mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. However, it's not yet clear that these changes directly cause these types of problems.
        We do know that a healthy diet low in processed foods is key to a healthy gut microbiome. And increasing evidence suggests that fiber and fermented foods can play important parts here.
        Fiber 101
        Fiber's main job is to make digestion smoother by softening and adding bulk to stool, making it pass quickly through the intestines.
        But fiber has other benefits for your microbiome and overall health. A high-fiber diet helps keep body weight under control and lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Research has found that eating enough fiber reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.
        What to know about fiber
        There are two types of fiber: insoluble (which helps you feel full and encourages regular bowel movements) and soluble (which helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar). However, recent research suggests people should focus on the total amount of fiber in their diet, rather than type of fiber.
        If you're trying to add more foods with fiber to your diet, make sure you ease into new fiber-rich habits and drink plenty of water. Your digestive system must adapt slowly to avoid gas, bloating, diarrhea, and stomach cramps caused by eating too much too soon. Your body will gradually adjust to increasing fiber after a week or so.
        How much fiber do you need?
        The fiber formula is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories consumed. Your specific calorie intake can vary depending on your activity levels.
        ""But instead of tracking daily fiber, focus on adding more servings of fiber-rich foods to your diet,"" says Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        Which foods are high in fiber?
        Fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are all high in fiber. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans has a comprehensive list of fiber-rich foods and their calorie counts.
        What about over-the-counter fiber supplements that come in capsules, powders that you mix with water, and chewable tablets? ""If you have trouble eating enough fiber-rich foods, then these occasionally can be used, and there is no evidence they are harmful,"" says Rimm. ""But they should not serve as your primary source of dietary fiber.""
        Fermented foods 101
        Fermented foods contain both prebiotics — ingredients that create healthy changes in the microbiome — and beneficial live bacteria called probiotics. Both prebiotics and probiotics help maintain a healthy gut microbiome.
        What to know about fermented foods
        Besides helping with digestion and absorbing vital nutrients from food, a healthy gut supports your immune system to help fight infections and protect against inflammation. Some research suggests that certain probiotics help relieve symptoms of gut-related conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, though not all experts agree with this.
        Many foods that are fermented undergo lacto-fermentation, in which natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food, creating lactic acid. Not only does this process remove simple sugars, it creates various species of good bacteria, such as Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium. (Keep in mind that some foods undergo steps that remove probiotics and other healthful microbes, as with beer or wine, or make them inactive, like baking and canning.)
        The exact amounts and specific strains of bacteria in fermented foods vary depending on how they are made. In addition to probiotics, fermented foods may contain other valuable nutrients like enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids.
        How often should you eat fermented foods?
        There is no recommended daily allowance for prebiotics or probiotics, so it is impossible to know precisely which fermented foods or quantities are best. The general guideline is to add more to your daily diet.
        Which fermented foods should you choose?
        Fermented foods have a range of tastes and textures because of the particular bacteria they produce during fermentation or that are added to foods. Yogurt is one of the most popular fermented foods (look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label). Still, many options are available if you are not a yogurt fan or want to expand your fermented choices. Kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, and pickles are a few examples.
        As with fiber, probiotics are also marketed as over-the-counter supplements. However, like all dietary supplements, they do not require FDA approval, so there is no guarantee that the types of bacteria listed on a label can provide the promised benefits — or are even in the bottle. ""Therefore, it is best to get your probiotics from fermented foods,"" says Rimm.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-blood-sugar-monitoring-without-diabetes-worthwhile-202106112473,Is blood sugar monitoring without diabetes worthwhile?,"Here's an ad you haven't seen, but it could be coming soon: A man jogs along a dirt path meandering through idyllic countryside. He pauses at an overlook and glances down at his cellphone. The phone screen flashes a number, telling him his blood sugar is normal. He smiles and resumes his run.
        What's different about this ad, you wonder? The jogger doesn't have diabetes. So, how does his phone know his blood sugar? And why, in the middle of a run, does he want to know the result? Read on.
        If you don't have diabetes, should you monitor your blood sugar?
        Several companies are working hard to make this sort of ad a reality, as they begin marketing implantable blood sugar measuring devices to people without diabetes. Called continuous glucose monitoring systems, or CGMs, they are often used by people with diabetes. These companies could reap enormous profits by convincing healthy people without diabetes (or other blood sugar problems) to start monitoring blood sugar.
        CGMs use tiny sensor wires, or filaments, that pierce the skin to frequently and easily assess blood sugar levels. The filaments remain in place, usually on the upper arm or abdomen, protected by an adhesive patch. Results are displayed on a receiver or transmitted to the user's phone.
        While CGMs have required a prescription in the past, recent FDA clearance of over-the-counter CGMs may tempt healthy people to begin using these systems without a specific medical reason to do so.
        Where's the health benefit in this?
        Already, many of us monitor our weight, heart rate, or steps per day — so why not monitor blood sugar? And, is there any evidence of benefit for healthy people without diabetes to continuously monitor their blood sugar levels with CGMs? There's little published research to help answer these questions.
        The best study I could find found nothing particularly surprising: among 153 people who didn't have diabetes, about 96% of the time blood sugar levels were normal or nearly so. In fact, many of the abnormal levels were considered implausible or a mistake. Another small study looked at sedentary individuals without diabetes who were overweight or obese. Participants completed a counseling session about the effects of physical activity on blood sugar and used a CGM device and an activity tracker for 10 days. Afterward, they reported feeling more motivated to exercise. Yet another analysis of CGM use for rare conditions causing low blood sugar among children found no evidence of health benefit.
        But I could find no published study suggesting that monitoring translates into improved health for healthy people without diabetes or other blood sugar problems.
        So, until more studies prove the value of CGM for people without diabetes, we won't know whether the cost and time it takes to implant one of these systems is accomplishing anything or is just the latest health monitoring fad wasting effort and money.
        Speaking of cost, CGMs aren't cheap: they can cost several thousand dollars a year. And it's unlikely that health insurers will cover CGMs for people without diabetes, at least until there is compelling evidence that they're actually helpful.
        Blood sugar monitoring for people with diabetes offers undeniable health benefits
        For people with diabetes, a major goal of therapy is to keep the blood sugar close to the normal range. This helps to prevent symptoms and complications, prolong life, and improve quality of life.
        The development of CGM devices that can frequently and easily monitor blood sugar levels without finger sticks has revolutionized care for millions of people with diabetes. Besides providing results of blood sugar levels, some devices have alarm settings that alert the user, or other people, if blood sugar becomes dangerously low or high. And some systems can transmit results directly to the user's doctor, if desired.
        If knowledge is power, why not monitor your blood sugar?
        So, why would a person who doesn't have diabetes want to monitor their blood sugar? Possible reasons include
        
          Detecting prediabetes. In prediabetes blood sugar is slightly high, but not high enough to meet the definition of diabetes. For healthy people, blood sugar testing is typically recommended every three years or so; if prediabetes is diagnosed, repeat testing is recommended more often, at least yearly. CGM might allow earlier diagnosis of prediabetes or diabetes. This could be particularly helpful for people at higher risk for diabetes due to family history or other factors, and people taking medicines that can raise blood sugar.
          The notion of ""optimizing"" blood sugar for peak mental or physical performance. Not surprisingly, some CGM makers suggest knowing your blood sugar can help you make changes to keep it in an ""ideal range"" that will help you perform your best, prevent diabetes, or improve health in some other way. For example, you might change what or when you eat. None of these marketing notions has been proven, or even well studied. And guess what — even the ideal blood sugar range for a person who isn't diabetic is uncertain.
          A sense of control. Having more information about your body may provide you with a feeling of control over your health, even if you take no immediate action.
          Curiosity. Let's face it, it's tempting to gather information about our bodies that might be interesting (even when we're not sure what to do with it).
        
        But truly, knowledge that is useless, redundant, or inaccurate doesn't make you powerful! It may even be harmful. For example, if biologically insignificant drops in blood sugar lead you to snack more (""to avoid hypoglycemia""), you could gain weight and actually increase your risk of developing diabetes. If the monitoring system sometimes provides inaccurate information or false alarms, unnecessary anxiety, calls or visits to the doctor, visits to an emergency room, and even inappropriate treatment may follow.
        The bottom line
        Unfortunately, some makers of CGM systems aren't waiting for solid research results to market these devices to healthy people. So, consumers and marketing professionals — not researchers or doctors — may wind up driving demand for the product.
        For any new technology there's a scientific learning curve to figure out when to use it. In my view, we're at the very beginning of the learning curve for home monitoring of blood sugar in people without diabetes. Before buying into what may be the next fad in health monitoring, I think we need to learn a lot more.
        There is wisdom in the teachings of one of my favorite professors in medical school: ""Just because you can measure something doesn't mean you should.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/vitamins-minerals-and-hair-loss-is-there-a-connection,"Vitamins, minerals, and hair loss: Is there a connection?","Your dietary habits can significantly impact your hair health, and addressing nutrient deficiencies may help you treat and prevent hair loss. However, not all vitamin and mineral supplements may be helpful for hair loss, and when taken in excess, some can be harmful.
        Understanding hair loss: Common causes and contributors
        Hair loss, also called alopecia, is a common condition that can cause emotional distress. Hair loss can be a normal part of the aging process. But it can also result from a range of other causes and contributors. These include:
        
          inherited genetic disorders and inflammatory diseases
          cancer and cancer treatments
          hormonal fluctuations
          stress
          pregnancy
          vitamin and mineral deficiencies
          certain medications
          substantial weight loss over a short period of time
          recent surgery or illness.
        
        The most common type of hair loss affecting both males and females is androgenetic alopecia, also called male or female pattern hair loss. Androgenetic alopecia is an inherited condition in which the hair gradually starts to thin at some time after puberty. The hair loss typically follows a specific pattern, such as a receding hairline and baldness on the crown of the scalp in males and thinning at the part line in females.
        Telogen effluvium (TE) and alopecia areata (AA) are two other common types of hair loss. With TE, sudden and drastic hair shedding occurs one to six months after a major stressor. Stressors can include psychological stress, severe illness, crash diets, major surgery, or pregnancy. AA is an autoimmune condition that causes round patches of hair loss that appear suddenly. The cause of AA is unknown, but is more common in people with thyroid disorders.
        Androgenetic alopecia, telogen effluvium, and alopecia areata are types of nonscarring hair loss, meaning when the hair falls out there is no damage to the hair follicle or scalp itself (no ""scarring""). Hair regrowth is possible with time and appropriate treatment. Approximately 73% of all hair loss falls into this category.
        The role of vitamins and minerals in hair health: Essential nutrients for strong and healthy hair
        A variety of vitamins and minerals play a role in new hair growth. They also strengthen your immune system, which is necessary for healthy hair. Specific vitamins and minerals that can contribute to hair health include:
        
          vitamin A
          vitamin B2 (riboflavin)
          vitamin B3 (niacin)
          vitamin B7 (biotin)
          vitamin B9 (folate)
          vitamin B12
          vitamin C
          vitamin D
          vitamin E
          iron
          selenium
          zinc.
        
        Addressing shortfalls through diet and supplements: Does it help hair growth?
        Consuming adequate vitamins and minerals is important to preventing and managing hair loss. Most people can cover all their nutritional needs through a healthy, balanced diet.
        However, if blood tests show that you have certain vitamin or mineral deficiencies, your doctor may recommend supplements. For example:
        
          Vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for creating the cells that develop into hair follicles. It also supports healthy bones and your immune system. If you have hair loss and low vitamin D levels, your doctor may recommend vitamin D supplements.
          Iron. Iron is responsible for carrying oxygen to your hair follicles so your hair can grow. Iron supplements may be recommended if you have hair loss as well as iron deficiency that is confirmed by laboratory tests. Too much iron can be toxic, so supplements should be taken exactly as prescribed by your doctor.
          Vitamin C. Vitamin C is necessary to absorb iron from your diet. If you have both hair loss and iron deficiency, vitamin C supplements can help.
        
        There is conflicting scientific evidence supporting the benefit of vitamin A, vitamin E, zinc, selenium, vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (folate), vitamin B7 (biotin), and vitamin B12 for hair loss. Your doctor can make recommendations tailored to your needs based on laboratory test results.
        It is also important to understand that supplementing with too much of certain vitamins or minerals can be harmful. Excessive intake of vitamin A and selenium, for example, can lead to increased hair loss. And consuming too much vitamin A or iron is toxic. Too much biotin (vitamin B7), a popular vitamin found in skin, hair, and nail supplements, can interfere with lab tests, including assessment of thyroid function and certain hormone levels.
        The link between vitamin and mineral deficiencies and hair loss
        You may experience hair loss if you are deficient in any of the vitamins and minerals that are essential for healthy hair. As discussed, your doctor can test for some vitamin and mineral deficiencies using blood tests, and can make recommendations based on these findings. Addressing any deficiencies through diet and supplementation may prevent hair loss and support hair growth.
        However, shortfalls in these micronutrients are rarely the only cause of hair loss. If your hair loss is caused by another underlying medical condition, or a particular stressor, then diet and supplementation may not provide a noticeable benefit.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","April 22, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/high-protein-snacks-to-build-muscle-and-keep-hunger-at-bay,High-protein snacks to build muscle and keep hunger at bay,"Getting enough protein in your diet is essential for building bones, muscles, and skin, and for proper functioning of all our body's organs.
        
          In our youth we need it for growth and development, and throughout life to repair cells and tissues.
          As we grow older, adequate protein and regular exercise are the key ingredients that help offset sarcopenia, the natural age-related tendency to lose muscle mass and power.
          Dietary protein also can aid in weight control by helping you feel fuller for longer.
        
        How much protein do you need?
        The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (that's 0.36 grams per pound). To determine your RDA for protein, multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36, or use the USDA's online tool to calculate your needs. Note that your individual protein needs may vary based on your age, activity levels, and other factors such as whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
        Research suggests that our bodies can only process about 20 to 40 grams of protein at a time. That means you shouldn't plan on getting a day's worth of protein in one or two meals. Rather, try to get some protein at every meal. And supplement with healthy snacks that contain at least five grams of protein. Focus on getting protein from high-quality food sources like lean meats, fish, dairy, soy, legumes, nuts, and whole grains.
        What can high-protein snacks do for you?
        Muscles need protein in order to increase and maintain muscle mass. If you're trying to maximize muscle growth and boost muscle recovery, eat a high-protein snack within 30 to 60 minutes of a strength-training session.
        If you're trying to lose or maintain weight, a low-calorie, high-protein snack can help slow digestion and stabilize blood sugar, making you feel fuller for longer — and preventing you from overeating at your next meal.
        These 12 snacks are high in protein and easy to pack to help power you through your day.
        Savory high-protein snacks
        Chickpeas
        Also known as garbanzo beans, chickpeas provide 7 grams of protein per 1/2-cup serving.
        
          Toss chickpeas with cucumber, tomato, red onion, feta, olives, and Greek dressing to make a hearty chopped salad.
          Dry rinsed chickpeas before tossing with extra virgin olive oil, a pinch of salt, and your favorite spices. Roast at 350° for about 45 minutes.
        
        Jerky
        Beef jerky provides 10 grams of protein per ounce. While beef jerky is the easiest to find at grocery stores and gas stations, salmon jerky provides even more protein per ounce — 12 grams — while chicken jerky has 10 grams per ounce. Just keep an eye on sodium levels.
        Cheese
        Cheese sticks are a lunchbox staple — and they're also a convenient way to get 5 to 7 grams of protein per one-ounce stick.
        
          If you don't have pre-packaged cheese sticks on hand, an ounce of cheddar cheese is about the size of two standard six-sided dice.
        
        Nuts
        All nuts contain protein, but peanuts, almonds, and pistachios have the most. An ounce of shelled peanuts (that's about a handful) provides 7 grams of protein, while almonds and pistachios both provide 6 grams of protein per ounce.
        
          Eat nuts out of hand or mix them into a trail mix with other seeds, nuts, or dried fruit.
          Sprinkle sliced nuts over Greek yogurt and berries.
        
        Edamame
        A popular appetizer at sushi restaurants, 1 cup of edamame provides 18 grams of protein. And, unlike many plant-based sources of protein, edamame provides all the essential amino acids your body needs.
        
          Steam or boil fresh or frozen edamame for five to 10 minutes, then season with sea salt and red pepper flakes to taste.
        
        Tuna
        Three ounces (about half a can) of tuna provides 25.5 grams of protein.
        
          Swap out mayonnaise for the same amount of plain Greek yogurt in your tuna salad and you'll add a few more grams of protein to your snack. Combine tuna, yogurt, diced celery, chopped chives, a little extra virgin olive oil, and a dash of lemon and Dijon mustard to make a spread for crackers or a dip for vegetables.
        
        Eggs
        One large hardboiled egg provides 6.3 grams of protein.
        
          Eat your eggs with a yogurt curry dip for an extra boost of protein. To make the dip, combine 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt with 1 teaspoon curry powder, a sprinkle of lemon juice, and a small squeeze of honey.
        
        Sweet high-protein snacks
        Greek yogurt
        A 3/4-cup serving of Greek yogurt provides 17 grams of protein — more than twice the amount of protein found in regular yogurt.
        
          Make a packable parfait by layering plain Greek yogurt, berries, and a nut-filled granola in a mason jar with a lid. Add a drizzle of honey or maple syrup if desired.
        
        Cottage cheese
        A 3/4-cup serving of cottage cheese has 12 grams of protein.
        
          You can turn cottage cheese into a sweet and packable snack by mixing it with honey and frozen or fresh raspberries, then topping it with toasted almonds. Add chia seeds for more protein and a little extra crunch.
        
        Chia seeds
        Chia seeds contain all nine essential amino acids. Two tablespoons of chia seeds provide 5 grams of protein.
        
          To make chia pudding, combine 2 tablespoons chia seeds with 1/2 cup of milk in a mason jar. Close the lid tightly and shake. After 10 minutes, shake again to dissolve any clumps. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes (or overnight) to allow the pudding to thicken. Add fresh or frozen berries, nuts, cinnamon, and a touch of maple or honey.
        
        Peanut butter
        Two tablespoons of peanut butter provide 7 grams of protein (but also fat and calories, so go easy on serving sizes).
        
          Spread peanut butter on toast and top with thin slices of apple and a sprinkling of cinnamon.
        
        Pumpkin seeds
        An ounce of shelled pumpkin seeds (also known as pepitas) provide 8 grams of protein.
        
          Add toasted and salted pepitas to salads or butternut squash soup.
          Toss raw pumpkin seeds with oil, salt, and pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon. Preheat oven to 325° and bake on a parchment paper-lined cookie sheet for 20 to 30 minutes.",Lindsay Warner,"April 18, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-importance-of-stretching,The importance of stretching,"You may think of stretching as something performed only by runners or gymnasts. But we all need to stretch in order to protect our mobility and independence. A lot of people don't understand that stretching has to happen on a regular basis. Ideally, it should be daily.
        Why stretching is important
        Stretching keeps the muscles flexible and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion in the joints. Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight. Then, when you call on the muscles for activity, they are unable to extend all the way. That puts you at risk for joint pain, strains, and muscle damage.
        For example, sitting in a chair all day results in tight hamstrings in the back of the thigh. That can make it harder to extend your leg or straighten your knee all the way, which inhibits walking. Likewise, when tight muscles are suddenly called on for a strenuous activity that stretches them, such as playing tennis, they may become damaged from suddenly being stretched. Injured muscles may not be strong enough to support the joints, which can lead to joint injury.
        Regular stretching keeps muscles long, lean, and flexible, and this means that exertion won't put too much force on the muscle itself. Healthy muscles also help a person with balance problems avoid falls.
        Where to start
        With a body full of muscles, the idea of daily stretching may seem overwhelming. It's most important to focus on the body areas needed for critical for mobility: your lower extremities: your calves, your hamstrings, your hip flexors in the pelvis and quadriceps in the front of the thigh. Stretching your shoulders, neck, and lower back is also beneficial. Aim for a program of daily stretches, or at least three or four times per week.
        Find a physical therapist (your local Y is a good place to start) who can assess your muscle strength and tailor a stretching program to fit your needs.
        Proper execution
        Stretching the muscles before they're warmed up can actually hurt them. When everything is cold, the fibers aren't prepared and may be damaged. If you exercise first, you'll get blood flow to the area, and that makes the tissue more pliable and amenable to change. All it takes to warm up the muscles before stretching is five to 10 minutes of light activity, such as a quick walk. You can also stretch after an aerobic or weight-training workout.
        Hold a stretch for 30 seconds. Don't bounce, which can cause injury. You'll feel tension during a stretch, but you should not feel pain. If you do, there may be an injury or damage in the tissue. Stop stretching that muscle and talk to your doctor.
        Try a hamstring stretch
        A hamstring stretch will keep the muscles in the back of your thigh flexible. Sit on the floor with your legs in front of you. Slide your hands down your legs until you feel a burning sensation. Hold for 30 seconds, then slowly return to a sitting position.
        The cumulative effect of stretching
        Stretching once today won't magically give you perfect flexibility. You'll need to do it over time and remain committed to the process. It may have taken you many months to get tight muscles, so you're not going to be perfectly flexible after only a few sessions. It takes weeks to months to get flexible, and you'll have to continue working on it to maintain it.

        In the past, it seemed logical to think eggs would be bad for your heart health. We knew that the cholesterol in eggs came from the egg yolks, and we knew that high levels of cholesterol, especially LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood increased the risk of cardiovascular disease. So, it seemed logical that avoiding cholesterol in the diet made sense.
        Since then, however, research has shown that most of the cholesterol in our body is made by our liver — it doesn't come from cholesterol we eat. The liver is stimulated to make cholesterol primarily by saturated fat and trans fat in our diet, not dietary cholesterol. But a large egg contains little saturated fat — about 1.5 grams (g). And research has confirmed that eggs also contain many healthy nutrients: lutein and zeaxanthin, which are good for the eyes; choline, which is good for the brain and nerves; and various vitamins (A, B, and D). In fact, just one large egg contains 270 international units (IU) of vitamin A and 41 IU of vitamin D. One large egg also contains about 6 g of protein and 72 calories.
        The evidence that cholesterol in one egg a day is safe for most people comes from huge studies — many conducted here at Harvard Medical School — that have followed hundreds of thousands of people over decades. They regularly report what they eat and all of the medical conditions that they develop. It is those studies that do not find higher rates of heart attacks, strokes, or other cardiovascular diseases in people who eat up to one egg per day.
        Of course, it matters greatly what you eat with your eggs. The saturated fat in butter, cheese, bacon, sausage, muffins, or scones, for example, raises your blood cholesterol much more than the cholesterol in your egg. And the highly refined ""bad carbs"" in white toast, pastries, home fries, and hash browns may also increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/concussion-in-children-what-to-know-and-do-202404123032,Concussion in children: What to know and do,"Concussion is one of the most common injuries to the brain, affecting about two million children and teens every year. It is a particular kind of injury that happens when a blow to the head or somewhere else on the body makes the brain move back and forth within the skull.
        It's possible to get a concussion after what might seem like a minor injury, like a forceful push from behind, or a collision between two players in a football or soccer game.
        What are the signs and symptoms of concussion?
        Because the injury may not seem that significant from the outside, it's important to know the symptoms of a concussion. There are many different possible symptoms, including
        
          passing out (this could be a sign of a more serious brain injury)
          headache
          dizziness
          changes in vision
          feeling bothered by light or noise
          confusion or feeling disoriented
          memory problems (such as difficulty remembering details of the injury) or difficulty concentrating
          balance or coordination problems
          mood changes.
        
        Some of these are visible to others and some are felt by the person with the concussion. That's why it's important to know the signs and to ask all the right questions of a child who has had an injury.
        Sometimes the symptoms might not be apparent right away, but show up in the days following the injury. The CDC's Heads Up website has lots of great information about how to recognize a concussion.
        How can further harm to the brain be avoided?
        The main reason it's important to recognize a possible concussion early is that the worst thing you can do after getting a concussion is get another one. The brain is vulnerable after a concussion; if it is injured again, the symptoms can be longer lasting — or even permanent, as in cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a condition that has been seen in football players and others who have repeated head injuries.
        If there is a chance that a child has had a concussion during a sports competition, they must stop playing — and get medical attention. It's important to get medical attention any time there is concern about a possible concussion, both to be sure there isn't a more serious brain injury, and to do a good assessment of the symptoms, so that they can be monitored over time. There are some screening questionnaires that are used by doctors that can be used again in the days and weeks after the concussion to see how the child is improving.
        What helps children recover after a concussion?
        Experts have struggled with figuring out how to protect the brain after a concussion. For a long time, the recommendation was to rest and do very little at all. This meant not doing any exercise, not going to school, not even reading or watching television. As symptoms improved, the restrictions were lifted gradually.
        Over time, though, research showed that not only was this much rest not necessary, it was counterproductive. It turns out that getting kids back into their daily lives, and back into being active, is safe and leads to quicker recovery. Experts still recommend rest and then moving gradually back into activities, but the guidelines are no longer as strict as they once were.
        One important note: A medical professional should guide decisions to move from rest to light activity, and then gradually from there to moderate and then regular activities based on how the child is doing. This step-by-step process may extend for days, weeks, or longer, depending on what the child needs. Parents, coaches, and schools can help support a child or teen as they return to school and return to activities and sports.
        Some children will be able to get back into regular activities quickly. But for others it can take weeks or even months. Schools and sports trainers should work with children to support them in their recovery. Some children develop post-concussive syndromes with headache, fatigue, and other symptoms. This is rare but can be very disabling.
        How can parents help prevent concussions?
        It's not always possible to prevent concussions, but there are things that parents can do:
        
          Be sure that children use seat belts and other appropriate restraints in the car.
          Have clear safety rules and supervise children when they are playing, especially if they are riding bikes or climbing in trees or on play structures.
          Since at least half of concussions happen during sports, it's important that teams and coaches follow safety rules. Coaches should teach techniques and skills to avoid dangerous collisions and other injuries. Talk to your child's coaches about what they are doing to keep players safe. While helmets can prevent many head injuries, they don't prevent concussions.","Claire McCarthy, MD","April 12, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-to-identify-scabies-a-contagious-and-uncomfortable-skin-condition-caused-by-mites,How to identify scabies — a contagious and uncomfortable skin condition caused by mites,"Scabies is a skin condition characterized by a rash and intense itching. It is caused by mites getting under the skin's outer layer. The mites themselves are very small and cannot be seen with the naked eye.
        How do I know if I have scabies?
        Since you cannot see the mites, the rash and itching are the key features.
        Scabies rash
        The scabies rash typically affects the following skin surfaces: the hands, especially webbed skin between the fingers; skin folds at the wrists, knees, elbows, underarms, waist, or buttocks; the genitalia; the breasts, especially the dark area around the nipple; and the shoulder blades.
        In adults and older children, the scabies rash often looks like tiny red bumps that are similar to small insect bites. In infants, the rash can appear as tiny fluid-filled blisters. The rash can extend to the neck, head, palms, and soles of the feet in babies who are younger than 2 years old.
        
          
        
        In some cases, a person with scabies develops itchy skin nodules rather than a rash. These nodules can be up to 5 millimeters (1/4-inch) wide. They usually occur on skin that is covered by clothing, such as the trunk and upper legs.
        Intense itching
        Itching from scabies is often worse at night. It can involve any part of the skin, not just areas that have a rash or nodules.
        Symptoms of scabies are part of the immune system's reaction to the scabies parasite and its waste products. This reaction usually takes a few weeks to develop in people who have never had scabies before. For this reason, people with their first episode of scabies may not develop an itchy rash until two to six weeks after the mites first burrow into the skin. However, in people who have had previous episodes of scabies, itching and rash often begin within one to four days.
        Can scabies spread from person to person?
        Scabies mites can be transmitted by direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, or by using clothing, blankets, sheets, towels, or furniture that has touched an infected person's skin. Scabies easily spreads during the close physical contact of sexual activity.
        Scabies also can be passed from person to person in settings in which people live in close quarters, including hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, day-care centers, and homes. Anyone can catch scabies, including doctors, nurses, teachers, toddlers, and elderly people in wheelchairs. Having scabies is not a sign that someone is dirty, careless, or sexually promiscuous.
        When a person catches scabies, pregnant female mites dig burrows in the skin and lay eggs along the way. After three to eight days, the eggs hatch and the young mites travel up the tunnels to the skin surface. There they grow to adulthood and mate, after which the females become pregnant and continue the skin infestation. Mite tunnels may be visible in the skin of a person who has scabies, although intense scratching often distorts their appearance.
        Groups that are especially vulnerable to catching scabies include:
        
          people who have multiple sex partners
          anyone who lives in crowded conditions
          patients and health care workers in hospitals
          residents and caregivers in nursing homes
          students, teachers, and other caregivers in day-care centers
          people who live or work in institutions or prisons.
        
        Diagnosing scabies
        Scabies is a very contagious illness that can spread to members of your family and other people who have close physical contact with you. For this reason you should not try to self-diagnose this condition. You need to be examined by a professional.
        After reviewing your symptoms and your risk factors (sexual contact, crowded living conditions, high-risk work environment), your doctor will examine your skin. Most often, the diagnosis is made based on skin findings and known exposure or possible exposure to scabies. The doctor looks for bumps between the fingers and toes and for burrows. The doctor also may scrape an area of rash gently to look for the mites or their eggs.
        Treating scabies
        Only prescription medications have been tested and approved to treat scabies in people. Topical permethrin cream applied to the skin is the usual first choice for treatment. Permethrin is a scabicide — an insecticide that kills scabies mites and eggs. Other medications are available, and your doctor may prescribe something other than topical permethrin depending on your age, medical history, coexisting skin conditions, and whether you are pregnant.
        Scabies medications usually are applied from neck to toe after bathing, left on the skin for eight to 14 hours, and then washed off. In some cases, you may need to apply the medication a second time, depending on the type of medication used and your symptoms.
        Ivermectin is an oral medication that also treats scabies effectively. It is taken as a single oral dose followed by a repeat dose two weeks later.
        To help control itching, simple topical agents such as calamine lotion can be applied. If the itching keeps you awake, your doctor may suggest diphenhydramine (Benadryl) taken by mouth.
        All sex partners, family members, and close contacts of someone with scabies should be treated for the infestation, even if they have no symptoms.
        When will I get better from scabies?
        With proper treatment, the rash and intense itching of scabies usually begin to subside within one to two days, although some milder itching can persist for a few weeks. In most cases, you stop being contagious within 24 hours.
        Without treatment, scabies can be a long-term infestation that can spread to other people.
        During the course of the illness, persistent scratching can lead to chronic crusting of the skin, or to painful secondary skin infections caused by bacteria.
        Preventing scabies
        To help prevent scabies:
        
          Avoid sharing clothing and towels.
          If your child goes to sleepover parties, provide a sleeping bag, pillow, and blanket from home.
          If someone in your household has been diagnosed with scabies, wash his or her clothing, bedding, and towels in hot water and dry these items in a hot dryer. This should kill all scabies mites and eggs. Clothing that cannot be washed should be sealed and stored for approximately one week, because scabies mites die within one to four days if not in contact with human skin.","Howard E.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/what-does-a-cavity-look-like,What does a cavity look like?,"Cavities, also known as tooth decay or dental caries, are a widespread oral health problem: about 90% of adults have had at least one cavity. Left untreated, cavities can lead to toothaches and other dental problems.
        Being familiar with the signs and symptoms of cavities and making regular visits to the dentist can help spot and treat cavities before they cause pain, affect your daily life, and (in severe cases) contribute to more serious health problems.
        Good dental health and dietary habits can also help prevent cavities from forming in the first place.
        What is a cavity?
        When you eat, a sticky film called plaque forms along your gums and on your teeth. If not brushed away, the bacteria that form in the plaque will produce acids when your mouth encounters sugars and starches from the foods you eat or beverages you drink. It's these acids that break down the enamel, or outer layer of your teeth. Over time, a small hole, or cavity, can form.
        What do cavities look like?
        In early stages, tooth decay can appear as white, brown, or black spots on the tooth. In more advanced stages, tooth decay leads to holes forming in the tooth, or the cavity. If left untreated, more extensive decay can progress toward the center of the tooth where the nerve is. This can lead to pain, infections, fractures in the tooth, or even tooth loss.
        Your dentist will look for visual signs of cavities such as discoloration or holes in your teeth. They will check your teeth for soft or sticky areas, which can also indicate cavities. In addition, they may take x-rays, which can reveal cavities and decay in between teeth or under the gums.
        Symptoms that might mean you have a cavity
        There are usually no symptoms in the early stages of tooth decay. But as tooth decay progresses, forming cavities, you may experience the following:
        
          toothache, or tooth pain
          tooth sensitivity to eating or drinking something that is sweet, hot, or cold
          visible spots or holes on your tooth or teeth
          bad breath.
        
        How your dentist will treat a cavity
        The treatment will depend on the stage of tooth decay. If a cavity has not yet formed, the enamel may be able to repair itself. To help your teeth remineralize (or replace the minerals lost through acid attack), your dentist may apply a fluoride treatment to your tooth or teeth, in addition to prescribing you a fluoride toothpaste for use at home.
        If the tooth decay has progressed to a cavity, it can still be fixed. In this case, your dentist will likely do a dental procedure in which the decayed material is removed and then the hole in the tooth is filled with a tooth-colored (composite) or silver-colored (amalgam) filling. If you have extensive decay, your dentist may recommend a range of treatments such as crowns, root canals, or tooth extractions.
        Your dentist may also discuss dietary and dental hygiene habits with you to prevent further tooth decay.
        Preventing cavities
        These eating and drinking habits should reduce your chances of developing cavities:
        
          Try not to snack between meals, as this limits the acid attacks on your teeth.
          Avoid eating candy, cookies, and other sweets.
          Limit sticky and starchy food as well, not just sweets.
          Limit or avoid sugary drinks such as soda or fruit drinks.
          Don't eat after brushing your teeth at night; saliva production slows during sleep, so it's less likely to fight off acids.
          If you don't have time to brush after eating or drinking, rinse your mouth with water and/or chew sugar-free gum to stimulate your saliva.
        
        Good dental hygiene also helps prevent cavities. Be sure to:
        
          Brush your teeth at least twice a day for two minutes each time with a fluoride toothpaste.
          Floss between teeth daily with floss or an interdental cleaner/brush.
          Use a fluoride rinse after brushing.
        
        Finally, visit your dentist for regular cleanings and dental check-ups. They may recommend a personalized home hygiene regimen depending on your overall health, cavity risk, and dental status.",Jenette Restivo,"April 9, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/proton-pump-inhibitors,Proton-pump inhibitors: What you need to know,"Stomach acid is natural, a valuable chemical contributor to orderly digestion. But in excess or in the wrong place, it's a menace, inflaming and irritating the esophagus, typically causing heartburn and sometimes contributing to the development of ulcers in the stomach and the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.
        People have dealt with stomach acid–related woes in a variety of ways, proven and otherwise, for eons, but it wasn't until the mid-1970s and the introduction of cimetidine (Tagamet) that a treatment targeted the production of stomach acid itself. Cimetidine was a huge commercial success; by some accounts, it was the first blockbuster drug. Other drugs in the same class, known as H2 blockers, quickly followed suit.
        Now the proton-pump inhibitor drugs (PPIs) have eclipsed the H2 blockers as the most commonly prescribed agents to reduce stomach acid. Examples of PPIs include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (AcipHex), and esomeprazole (Nexium). They are prescribed to both prevent and treat ulcers in the duodenum (where most ulcers develop) and the stomach. They also counter the various problems that occur when stomach acid escapes into the esophagus, which — if it happens on a regular basis — is a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In most head-to-head trials, the PPIs have proved to be superior to the H2 blockers.
        Reducing stomach acid levels isn't one of medicine's glamour jobs, but it's yeoman's work, so PPIs are generally considered quite a success story: safe (more on that just below), effective medications that target the source of a lot of gastrointestinal distress.
        
          
            
              
                What is a PPI?
                
                  
                
                Many people take PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). By lowering stomach acid levels, they reduce acid reflux into the esophagus and the resulting heartburn symptoms.
              
            
          
        
        Appropriate use of proton pump inhibitors
        Taking a PPI makes sense if you have a chronic problem with stomach acid or the prospect of one developing. But the occasional case of mild heartburn does not need to be treated with a PPI. For that kind of spot duty, the old standbys of antacid medicine like Tums, Rolaids, and Maalox will most likely work just as well, as will any of the H2 blockers. In fact, it takes several days for PPIs to have their full effect on acid secretion, so an H2 blocker may be more effective for a mild, short-term problem with stomach acid. Yet people often take PPIs under the mistaken assumption that they are the better medication in all circumstances.
        If heartburn is the problem, there are also changes you can make that may help that don't involve taking anything. The commercials are right: gobbling down a large meal can give you heartburn, so eating smaller meals can help tame the problem. And if you're heavy, GERD and heartburn are on that very long list of problems that ease up and may even go away if you lose some weight.
        PPIs are the most potent inhibitors of stomach acid available, and they're a welcome addition to the medical armamentarium. But every pill — indeed, every medical intervention — is a risk-benefit balancing act. You don't need to take a PPI for the incidental case of heartburn. If you have a prescription, the reasons for it should be reviewed periodically to make sure they're still valid; it's common for people to take medications far longer than is necessary, and that is particularly true of the PPIs.
        For most people who need to take a PPI, it should be for the lowest dose and shortest amount of time as possible. However, there are conditions that indicate long-term and sometimes indefinite use of a PPI, such as in people with esophagitis due to GERD.
        There are differences in the chemical properties of the different PPIs and how they are metabolized. But comparative studies haven't yielded any clear-cut winners, so the less expensive PPIs are the best choice for most people.
        Side effects
        Initially, there was some worry that PPIs might increase the risk of developing stomach cancer. Those concerns were unfounded, but others have taken their place, partly because people often take PPIs on a daily basis for years, so the total exposure to the drug ends up being quite significant. Here's a rundown of the some of the side effects that are causing concern:
        Fracture risk. Some studies have shown an association between PPIs and the risk of fracture — particularly hip fracture — while others have not. Calcium is absorbed in the small intestine, not the stomach. But low stomach acid levels can have downstream effects, especially in the duodenum, and some research shows that one of them could be reduced absorption of calcium, which could lead to osteoporosis, weaker bones, and, consequently, a greater chance of breaking a bone. The fracture risk is probably pretty small, but it's another reason for not taking a PPI unless necessary.
        Pneumonia risk. Several studies have shown that people taking PPIs seem to be more likely to get pneumonia than those who aren't. The association has been documented among people living in the community and hospital patients alike. Normally, stomach acid creates a fairly inhospitable environment for bacteria, but if acid levels are reduced by PPIs, the bacteria count can go up. The thinking is that in people with GERD who take PPIs, bacteria-laden stomach contents may travel up the esophagus and then get inhaled into the windpipe and lungs, where the bacteria cause pneumonia.
        C. difficile risk. People typically develop Clostridium difficile infections in the hospital after taking antibiotics that have disrupted the natural bacterial ecology of the large intestine. The infections cause diarrhea but can also become a lot more serious, even life-threatening. Studies have shown a fairly strong statistical correlation between PPI use and C. difficile infection, although it's still just a correlation and not proof of direct cause and effect. Some experimental evidence suggests that PPIs may change conditions in the gut to be more favorable to C. difficile bacteria.
        Iron and B12 deficiency. Stomach acid helps render the iron and vitamin B12 from food into forms that are readily absorbed. So, there is worry that an unintended consequence of long-term use of PPIs might cause deficiencies of this vitamin and mineral because of lower stomach acid levels. Your doctor can periodically blood tests to make sure B12 and iron levels are in the normal range.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cannabidiol-cbd-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-2018082414476,Cannabidiol (CBD): What we know and what we don't,"Cannabidiol (CBD) is often covered in the media, and you may see it touted as an add-in booster to your post-workout smoothie or morning coffee. You can even buy a CBD-infused sports bra. But what exactly is CBD? And why is it so popular?
        How is cannabidiol different from marijuana, cannabis, and hemp?
        CBD, or cannabidiol, is the second most prevalent active ingredient in cannabis (marijuana). While CBD is an essential component of medical marijuana, it is derived directly from the hemp plant, a cousin of marijuana, or manufactured in a laboratory. One of hundreds of components in marijuana, CBD does not cause a high by itself.
        According to a report from the World Health Organization, ""In humans, CBD exhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or dependence potential…. To date, there is no evidence of public health related problems associated with the use of pure CBD."" A recent study in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology concluded that ""acute CBD alone is unlikely to significantly impair daily functioning or workplace performance.""
        Is cannabidiol legal?
        CBD is readily obtainable in most parts of the United States, though its exact legal status has been in flux. All 50 states have laws legalizing CBD with varying degrees of restriction. In December 2015, the FDA eased the regulatory requirements to allow researchers to conduct CBD trials. In 2018, the Farm Bill made hemp legal in the United States, making it virtually impossible to keep CBD illegal — that would be like making oranges legal, but keeping orange juice illegal.
        The Farm Bill removed all hemp-derived products, including CBD, from the Controlled Substances Act, which criminalizes the possession of drugs. In essence, this means that CBD is legal if it comes from hemp, but not if it comes from cannabis (marijuana) — even though it is the exact same molecule. Currently, many people obtain CBD online without a medical marijuana license, which is legal in most states.
        The evidence for cannabidiol health benefits
        CBD has been touted for a wide variety of health issues, but the strongest scientific evidence is for its effectiveness in treating some of the cruelest childhood epilepsy syndromes, such as Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), which typically don't respond well to antiseizure medications. In numerous studies, CBD was able to reduce the number of seizures, and, in some cases, stop them altogether. Epidiolex, which primarily consists of CBD, is the first cannabis-derived medicine approved by the FDA for these conditions.
        Animal studies, and self-reports or research in humans, suggest CBD may also help with:
        
          Anxiety: Studies and clinical trials are exploring the common report that CBD can reduce anxiety.
          Insomnia: Studies suggest that CBD may help with both falling asleep and staying asleep, in part by helping address chronic pain and anxiety.
          Chronic pain: Increasingly, human studies are substantiating the claims that CBD helps control pain. One animal study from the European Journal of Pain suggests CBD could help lower pain and inflammation due to arthritis when applied to skin. Other research identifies how CBD may inhibit inflammatory and neuropathic pain, which are difficult to treat.
          Addiction: CBD can help lower cravings for tobacco and heroin under certain conditions, according to some research in humans. Animal models of addiction suggest it may also help lessen cravings for other addictive substances such as alcohol, cannabis, opiates, and stimulants.
        
        Is CBD safe?
        Side effects of CBD could include nausea, fatigue, and irritability. CBD can increase the level of blood thinning and other medicines in your blood by competing for the liver enzymes that break down these drugs. Grapefruit has a similar effect with certain medicines. This interaction is particularly important if you are taking a blood thinner, an anti-epileptic, or an immunosuppressant medication, all of which need to have stable levels in your blood.
        People taking high doses of CBD may show abnormalities in liver-related blood tests. Many nonprescription drugs, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), have this same effect. You should let your doctor know if you are regularly using CBD so that he or she can check your liver enzymes periodically.
        A significant safety concern with CBD is that it is primarily marketed and sold as a supplement, not a medication. Currently, the FDA does not regulate the safety and purity of dietary supplements, and no one, really, is regulating the CBD market. So you cannot be sure that the product you buy has active ingredients at the dose listed on the label.
        In addition, the product may contain other unknown elements. If you buy CBD, it is safest to make sure that there is independent laboratory testing as attested to by a COA (certificate of analysis) that should accompany every CBD product.
        How can CBD be taken?
        CBD comes in many forms, including oils, tinctures, capsules, patches, vapes, and topical preparations for use on skin. If you're hoping to reduce inflammation and relieve muscle and joint pain, a topical CBD-infused oil, lotion or cream — or even a bath bomb — may be the best option. Alternatively, a CBC patch or a tincture or spray designed to be placed under the tongue allows CBD to directly enter the bloodstream. Dcotors don't recommend smoking anything, including CBD.
        Outside of the US, the prescription drug Sativex, which uses CBD as an active ingredient, is approved for muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis and for cancer pain. Within the US, Epidiolex is approved for certain types of epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis.
        The bottom line on cannabidiol
        Some CBD manufacturers have come under government scrutiny for wild, indefensible claims, such that CBD is a cure-all for cancer or COVID-19, which it is not. We need more research, but CBD is proving to be a helpful, relatively non-toxic option for managing anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain. Without sufficient high-quality evidence in human studies, we can't pinpoint effective doses, and because CBD currently is typically available as an unregulated supplement, it can be difficult to know exactly what you are getting, or to conduct studies.
        If you decide to try CBD, make sure you are getting it from a reputable source. Again, please discuss your use of CBD or any other supplements with your doctor to make sure that it won't affect any other medicines you take.","Peter Grinspoon, MD","April 4, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/9-tips-to-boost-your-energy-naturally,9 tips to boost your energy — naturally,"Most of us feel we need more energy. In fact, 14% of Americans said they did not have the energy they needed to get things done in one Gallup survey. Fortunately, there are things you can do to enhance your own natural energy levels. Here are nine tips:
        1. Control stress
        Stress-induced emotions consume huge amounts of energy. Talking with a friend or relative, joining a support group, or seeing a psychotherapist can all help diffuse stress. Relaxation therapies like meditation, self-hypnosis, yoga, and tai chi are also effective tools for reducing stress.
        2. Lighten your load
        One of the main reasons for fatigue is overwork. Overwork can include professional, family, and social obligations. Try to streamline your list of ""must-do"" activities. Set your priorities in terms of the most important tasks. Pare down those that are less important. Consider asking for extra help at work, if necessary.
        3. Exercise
        Exercise almost guarantees that you'll sleep more soundly. It also gives your cells more energy to burn and circulates oxygen. And exercising can lead to higher brain dopamine levels, which helps elevate mood. When walking, pick up the pace periodically to get extra health benefits.
        4. Avoid smoking
        Smoking siphons off your energy by causing insomnia. The nicotine in tobacco is a stimulant, so it speeds the heart rate, raises blood pressure, and stimulates brain-wave activity associated with wakefulness, making it harder to fall asleep. And once you do fall asleep, its addictive power can kick in and awaken you with cravings.
        5. Restrict your sleep
        If you think you may be sleep-deprived, try getting less sleep. This advice may sound odd but determining how much sleep you actually need can reduce the time you spend in bed not sleeping. This process makes it easier to fall asleep and promotes more restful sleep in the long run. Here's how to do it:
        
          Avoid napping during the day.
          The first night, go to bed later than normal and get just four hours of sleep.
          If you feel that you slept well during that four-hour period, add another 15–30 minutes of sleep the next night.
          As long as you're sleeping soundly the entire time you're in bed, slowly keep adding sleep on successive nights.
        
        6. Eat for energy
        Eating foods with a low glycemic index — whose sugars are absorbed slowly — may help you avoid the lag in energy that typically occurs after eating quickly absorbed sugars or refined starches. Foods with a low glycemic index include whole grains, high-fiber vegetables, nuts, and healthy oils such as olive oil. In general, high-carbohydrate foods have the highest glycemic indexes. Proteins and fats have glycemic indexes that are close to zero.
        7. Use caffeine to your advantage
        Caffeine does help increase alertness, so having a cup of coffee can help sharpen your mind. But to get the energizing effects of caffeine, you have to use it judiciously. It can cause insomnia, especially when consumed in large amounts or after 2 p.m.
        8. Limit alcohol
        One of the best hedges against the midafternoon slump is to avoid drinking alcohol at lunch. The sedative effect of alcohol is especially strong at midday. Similarly, avoid a five o'clock cocktail if you want to have energy in the evening. If you're going to drink, do so in moderation at a time when you don't mind having your energy wind down.
        9. Drink water
        What's the only nutrient that has been shown to enhance performance for all but the most demanding endurance activities? It's not some pricey sports drink. It's water. If your body is short of fluids, one of the first signs is a feeling of fatigue.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/what-do-head-lice-look-like-and-what-should-you-do-if-you-find-them,What do head lice look like and what should you do if you find them?,"Head lice are not dangerous, but they can be uncomfortable and distressing. It's helpful to know what these unwelcome visitors look like, and what to do if you find them in your hair.
        What are head lice?
        Head lice are insects that live in human hair, close to the scalp, and sometimes in the eyebrows and eyelashes too. They are tiny, no bigger than a sesame seed.
        Lice are parasites that bite the scalp every few hours to feed on blood. The bites from lice can make your scalp itchy. Itching is the most common symptom of a head lice infestation. You also may feel like something is moving in your hair.
        Head lice are found all over the world. Contrary to popular belief, they have nothing to do with personal hygiene or cleanliness, and they do not carry diseases.
        Lice can spread from person to person from head-to-head contact.
        What do lice look like?
        There are three life stages of head lice: nits (eggs), nymphs, and adults.
        Nits are the eggs laid by an adult female. Eggs attach firmly to the hair shaft, very close to the scalp. The eggs are shaped like tiny ovals and are usually yellow or white. Nits usually take about a week to hatch.
        Nymphs are young lice. They resemble an adult but are smaller. Nymphs develop into adults about a week and a half after hatching from nits.
        Adult lice are fully grown. They hold tightly to hair with hooklike claws on each of their six legs. They are tan, gray, or white. They live about a month on a person's head and will die within a day or two if they fall off. Adult females can lay about six eggs a day.
        Is it lice or dandruff?
        It's easy to confuse nits and lice with dandruff. You can tell the difference if you try to brush or shake them off. Dandruff doesn't stick to hair, but nits do.
        One way to check is to use a fine-tooth comb or a lice comb on wet hair. Part the hair in small sections to look for nits or lice. A magnifying glass and bright light can help.
        How do lice spread from person to person?
        Head lice can't fly or hop. They move by crawling and spread through head-to head contact with a person who has them. This is especially common among young children at play or through sports activities.
        They can also spread if loose strands of hair with lice or nits on them come into contact with someone else's hair by:
        
          sharing clothing such as hats, scarves, and coats
          sharing personal items such as combs, brushes, and hair ribbons
          lying on a bed, pillow, sofa, or carpet that had recently been in contact with someone who had head lice.
        
        You can't get head lice from dogs, cats, or other pets, and you can't give them to pets, either.
        How to treat lice at home
        You can treat head lice at home with a lice comb and a medicated shampoo or lotion, available over the counter. The active ingredient in these products is either pyrethrins, approved for ages 2 years and older, or permethrin lotion, approved for ages 2 months and older.
        After applying and rinsing the head lice shampoo according to directions on the product, divide hair into small sections and comb through each section using the comb and your fingers to remove lice and eggs. Experts suggest combing the hair with a lice comb every few days for at least two weeks to look for any remaining lice or nits. After each treatment, do not wash hair with regular shampoo for two days.
        Lice shampoos kill live lice but not eggs, so you'll likely need more than one treatment to kill lice that hatch after the first treatment. Some lice shampoos recommend two treatments regardless of whether you see lice or eggs, while others recommend a second treatment only if you see crawling lice after a week. Because head lice are so contagious, experts suggest treating the whole family, even if no lice are seen.
        Lice don't survive for more than a day or two if they fall off a person, so deep home cleaning usually isn't necessary. Wash bedding and towels in hot water, or seal them in a plastic bag for two weeks if they can't be washed. Vacuum floors, and soak combs and brushes in very hot water for at least 10 minutes.
        When to see a doctor
        See a doctor if home treatment doesn't work. You may need a stronger prescription medicated lotion. If the lice still don't go away, you may need to take a medication by mouth.
        Scratching your head a lot in response to the itching can lead to a rash or infection. See a doctor if you have signs of an infection, such as skin on your scalp that is tender, crusting, or oozing.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","April 4, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/calorie-counting-made-easy,Calorie counting made easy,"Eat less, exercise more. If only it were that simple! While calorie counting has fallen out of favor, some people still find it to be a useful tool to manage their weight. 
        Start by determining how many calories you should consume each day. To do so, you need to know how many calories you need to maintain your current weight. Doing this requires a few simple calculations.
        First, multiply your current weight by 15 — that's roughly the number of calories per pound of body weight needed to maintain your current weight if you are moderately active. Moderately active means getting at least 30 minutes of physical activity a day in the form of exercise (walking at a brisk pace, climbing stairs, or active gardening). Let's say you're a woman who is 5 feet, 4 inches tall and weighs 155 pounds, and you need to lose about 15 pounds to put you in a healthy weight range. If you multiply 155 by 15, you will get 2,325, which is the number of calories per day that you need in order to maintain your current weight (weight-maintenance calories). To lose weight, you will need to get below that total.
        For example, to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week — a rate that experts consider safe — your food consumption should provide 500 to 1,000 calories less than your total weight-maintenance calories. If you need 2,325 calories a day to maintain your current weight, reduce your daily calories to between 1,325 and 1,825. If you are sedentary, you will also need to build more activity into your day. In order to lose at least a pound a week, try to do at least 30 minutes of physical activity on most days, and reduce your daily calorie intake by at least 500 calories. However, calorie intake should not fall below 1,200 a day in women or 1,500 a day in men, except under the supervision of a health professional. Eating too few calories can endanger your health by depriving you of needed nutrients.
        Meeting your calorie target
        How can you meet your daily calorie target? One approach is to add up the number of calories per serving of all the foods that you eat, and then plan your menus accordingly. The nutrition labels on all packaged foods and beverages provide calories per serving information. Make a point of reading the labels of the foods and drinks you use, noting the number of calories and the serving sizes. Many recipes published online, in cookbooks, newspapers, and magazines provide similar information.
        If you hate counting calories, a different approach is to restrict how much and how often you eat, and to eat meals that are low in calories. Dietary guidelines issued by the American Heart Association stress common sense in choosing your foods rather than focusing strictly on numbers, such as total calories or calories from fat. Whichever method you choose, research shows that a regular eating schedule — with meals and snacks planned for certain times each day — makes for the most successful approach. The same applies after you have lost weight and want to keep it off. Sticking with an eating schedule increases your chance of maintaining your new weight.
        Some people focus on reducing the fat in their eating plan because, at 9 calories per gram, fat by weight contains more than twice as many calories as carbohydrates or proteins (4 calories per gram). However, many people mistakenly think that cutting fat always means cutting calories. Some fat-free foods actually contain more calories than the regular versions because manufacturers use extra sugar to make up for the flavor lost in removing the fat. Moreover, low-fat or nonfat foods are not low-calorie if you consume them in large quantities.
        For more on weight loss strategies, including best foods to eat and avoid, read Lose Weight and Keep it Off, a Special Health Report from Harvard Medical School.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heart-rate-variability-new-way-track-well-2017112212789,Heart rate variability: How it might indicate well-being,"When it comes to your health, it is now easy to measure and track all kinds of information. In the comfort of our homes, we can check our weight, blood pressure, number of steps, calories, heart rate, and blood sugar. Researchers have been exploring another data point called heart rate variability (HRV) as a possible marker of resilience and behavioral flexibility.
        What is HRV?
        HRV is simply a measure of the variation in time between each heartbeat. This variation is controlled by a primitive part of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system (ANS). It works behind the scenes, automatically regulating our heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and digestion among other key tasks. The ANS is subdivided into two large components: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system, also known as the fight-or-flight mechanism and the relaxation response.
        The brain is constantly processing information in a region called the hypothalamus. The ANS provides signals to the hypothalamus, which then instructs the rest of the body either to stimulate or to relax different functions. It responds not only to a poor night of sleep, or that sour interaction with your boss, but also to the exciting news that you got engaged, or to that delicious healthy meal you had for lunch. Our body handles all kinds of stimuli and life goes on. However, if we have persistent instigators such as stress, poor sleep, unhealthy diet, dysfunctional relationships, isolation or solitude, and lack of exercise, this balance may be disrupted, and your fight-or-flight response can shift into overdrive.
        Check heart rate variability
        The gold standard is to analyze a long strip of an electrocardiogram done in the doctor's office. But in recent years, companies have launched apps and wearable heart rate monitors that do something similar. The accuracy of these methods is still under scrutiny, but the technology is improving. If you do wish to give it a try, chest strap monitors tend to provide a more accurate measure of HRV than wrist devices.
        HRV may offer a noninvasive way to signal imbalances in the autonomic nervous system. Based on data gathered from many people, if the system is in more of a fight-or-flight mode, the variation between subsequent heartbeats tends to be lower. If the system is in more relaxed state, the variation between beats may be higher.
        This suggests some interesting possibilities. People who have a high HRV may have greater cardiovascular fitness and may be more resilient to stress. HRV may also provide personal feedback about your lifestyle and help motivate those who are considering taking steps toward a healthier life. You might see a connection to HRV changes as you incorporate more mindfulness, meditation, sleep, and especially physical activity into your life. For those who love data and numbers, this could be a way to track how your nervous system is reacting not only to the environment, but also to your emotions, thoughts, and feelings.
        The bottom line
        There are questions about the accuracy, reliability and overall usefulness of tracking HRV. While HRV has been linked to overall physical fitness, the correlation between changes in HRV and how your autonomic nervous system is functioning will require much more research. Still, if you decide to use HRV as another piece of health data, do not get too confident if you have a high HRV, or too worried if your HRV is low. Think of HRV as another way you might tap into your body and mind are responding to what your daily experiences.
        
          Adapted from a Harvard Health Blog post by Marcelo Campos, MD",Unknown,"April 3, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response,Understanding the stress response,"A stressful situation — whether something environmental, such as a looming work deadline, or psychological, such as persistent worry about losing a job — can trigger a cascade of stress hormones that produce well-orchestrated physiological changes. A stressful incident can make the heart pound and breathing quicken. Muscles tense and beads of sweat appear.
        This combination of reactions to stress is also known as the ""fight-or-flight"" response because it evolved as a survival mechanism, enabling people and other mammals to react quickly to life-threatening situations. The carefully orchestrated yet near-instantaneous sequence of hormonal changes and physiological responses helps someone to fight the threat off or flee to safety. Unfortunately, the body can also overreact to stressors that are not life-threatening, such as traffic jams, work pressure, and family difficulties.
        Over the years, researchers have learned not only how and why these reactions occur, but have also gained insight into the long-term effects chronic stress has on physical and psychological health. Over time, repeated activation of the stress response takes a toll on the body. Research suggests that chronic stress contributes to high blood pressure, promotes the formation of artery-clogging deposits, and causes brain changes that may contribute to anxiety, depression, and addiction. More preliminary research suggests that chronic stress may also contribute to obesity, both through direct mechanisms (causing people to eat more) or indirectly (decreasing sleep and exercise).
        Sounding the alarm
        The stress response begins in the brain (see illustration). When someone confronts an oncoming car or other danger, the eyes or ears (or both) send the information to the amygdala, an area of the brain that contributes to emotional processing. The amygdala interprets the images and sounds. When it perceives danger, it instantly sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus.
        
          
            
              
                Command center
                
                  
                
                When someone experiences a stressful event, the amygdala, an area of the brain that contributes to emotional processing, sends a distress signal to the hypothalamus. This area of the brain functions like a command center, communicating with the rest of the body through the nervous system so that the person has the energy to fight or flee.
              
            
          
        
        The hypothalamus is a bit like a command center. This area of the brain communicates with the rest of the body through the autonomic nervous system, which controls such involuntary body functions as breathing, blood pressure, heartbeat, and the dilation or constriction of key blood vessels and small airways in the lungs called bronchioles. The autonomic nervous system has two components, the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system functions like a gas pedal in a car. It triggers the fight-or-flight response, providing the body with a burst of energy so that it can respond to perceived dangers. The parasympathetic nervous system acts like a brake. It promotes the ""rest and digest"" response that calms the body down after the danger has passed.
        After the amygdala sends a distress signal, the hypothalamus activates the sympathetic nervous system by sending signals through the autonomic nerves to the adrenal glands. These glands respond by pumping the hormone epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) into the bloodstream. As epinephrine circulates through the body, it brings on a number of physiological changes. The heart beats faster than normal, pushing blood to the muscles, heart, and other vital organs. Pulse rate and blood pressure go up. The person undergoing these changes also starts to breathe more rapidly. Small airways in the lungs open wide. This way, the lungs can take in as much oxygen as possible with each breath. Extra oxygen is sent to the brain, increasing alertness. Sight, hearing, and other senses become sharper. Meanwhile, epinephrine triggers the release of blood sugar (glucose) and fats from temporary storage sites in the body. These nutrients flood into the bloodstream, supplying energy to all parts of the body.
        All of these changes happen so quickly that people aren't aware of them. In fact, the wiring is so efficient that the amygdala and hypothalamus start this cascade even before the brain's visual centers have had a chance to fully process what is happening. That's why people are able to jump out of the path of an oncoming car even before they think about what they are doing.
        As the initial surge of epinephrine subsides, the hypothalamus activates the second component of the stress response system — known as the HPA axis. This network consists of the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the adrenal glands.
        The HPA axis relies on a series of hormonal signals to keep the sympathetic nervous system — the ""gas pedal"" — pressed down. If the brain continues to perceive something as dangerous, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which travels to the pituitary gland, triggering the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This hormone travels to the adrenal glands, prompting them to release cortisol. The body thus stays revved up and on high alert. When the threat passes, cortisol levels fall. The parasympathetic nervous system — the ""brake"" — then dampens the stress response.
        Techniques to counter chronic stress
        Many people are unable to find a way to put the brakes on stress. Chronic low-level stress keeps the HPA axis activated, much like a motor that is idling too high for too long. After a while, this has an effect on the body that contributes to the health problems associated with chronic stress.
        Persistent epinephrine surges can damage blood vessels and arteries, increasing blood pressure and raising risk of heart attacks or strokes. Elevated cortisol levels create physiological changes that help to replenish the body's energy stores that are depleted during the stress response. But they inadvertently contribute to the buildup of fat tissue and to weight gain. For example, cortisol increases appetite, so that people will want to eat more to obtain extra energy. It also increases storage of unused nutrients as fat.
        Fortunately, people can learn techniques to counter the stress response.
        Relaxation response. At the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital people learn how to counter the stress response by using a combination of approaches that elicit the relaxation response. These include deep abdominal breathing, focus on a soothing word (such as peace or calm), visualization of tranquil scenes, repetitive prayer, yoga, and tai chi.
        Most of the early research evaluated how effective the relaxation response is at countering chronic stress in people with hypertension and other forms of cardiovascular disease. Those results suggest the technique may be worth trying — although for most people it is not a cure-all. For example, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 122 patients with hypertension, ages 55 and older, in which half were assigned to relaxation response training and the other half to a control group that received information about blood pressure control. After eight weeks, 34 of the people who practiced the relaxation response — a little more than half — had achieved a systolic blood pressure reduction of more than 5 mm Hg, and were therefore eligible for the next phase of the study, in which they could reduce levels of blood pressure medication they were taking. 
        Physical activity. People can use exercise to stifle the buildup of stress in several ways. Exercise, such as taking a brisk walk shortly after feeling stressed, not only deepens breathing but also helps relieve muscle tension. Movement therapies such as yoga, tai chi, and qi gong combine fluid movements with deep breathing and mental focus, all of which can induce calm.
        Social support. Confidants, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, relatives, spouses, and companions all provide a life-enhancing social net — and may increase longevity. It's not clear why, but the buffering theory holds that people who enjoy close relationships with family and friends receive emotional support that indirectly helps to sustain them at times of chronic stress and crisis.",Unknown,"April 3, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/weighing-the-dangers-of-extra-weight,Weighing the dangers of extra weight,"An estimated 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI), a calculation that takes into account both height and weight.
        Standard definitions consider a healthy BMI as between 18.5 and 24.9, overweight as 25 to 29.9, and obese as 30 and higher. (Calculate your BMI using this online tool.)
        While far from perfect, BMI offers a simple gauge of whether someone's weight might pose a problem. Studies have found that a BMI higher than 25 increases your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and some types of cancer.
        But what if you have put on only a little extra weight in recent years — say, five pounds or so — and your BMI doesn't fall into the category of overweight? Is that still cause for concern?
        ""Any excess weight can pose a health risk and affect one's daily life,"" says Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""When you carry extra pounds, you also are more susceptible to joint pain, low energy, and problems sleeping.""
        Yet the greatest threat is the potential for gaining even more weight. ""It's easy for five pounds to quickly turn into 10 pounds and then 15 pounds, and as the weight increases, so do the health risks,"" says Dr. Willett.
        Why do you gain weight?
        It's common for men to gain some weight with age. Metabolism naturally slows, and lean muscle mass steadily declines, both of which cause the body to burn calories at a slower rate. In addition, most men consume more daily calories than they need."" When you take in extra calories and don't burn them off, they will be stored as fat,"" says Dr. Willett.
        But where you accumulate that extra fat is the real issue with weight gain.
        Based on its location, fat can be described as either subcutaneous or visceral. Subcutaneous fat is located just under the skin. Visceral fat lies deep within the abdominal cavity and pads the spaces between your abdominal organs.
        Of the two, visceral fat is more dangerous, as high amounts are linked with heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and high cholesterol levels. Do you have too much visceral fat? Check your waist size. ""For men, a waist of 40 inches or more is considered a sign of excess visceral fat,"" says Dr. Willett. ""But even a small change in your clothing, like pants that now feel snug or having to change notches in your belt, are signs of increasing visceral fat.""
        What is your ideal weight?
        There's no one-size-fits-all number for a person's ideal weight. The number depends on age, genetics, body frame, medical history, and average weight as a young adult.
        ""Your BMI can offer a clue about whether you need to lose excess weight, but consulting with your doctor can help determine your ideal healthy weight range,"" says Dr. Willett.
        Still, you should not ignore even small weight changes. ""A little weight gain may seem normal for many men, but that doesn't mean they should accept it and not do anything about it,"" says Dr. Willett. ""It's easier to make modest adjustments now than to wait until you gain a lot more weight.""
        You can turn back those extra pounds with a combination of aerobic exercise, strength training, and a healthy diet.
        Experts recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (for example, brisk walking, running, swimming, or cycling) most days of the week, plus at least two weekly weight or resistance training sessions to maintain muscle mass and strength. To avoid putting on more pounds, stick with a diet that prioritizes plant-based foods, like the Mediterranean or DASH diet.

        Completed in 2016, the LOOK AHEAD trial followed more than 5,000 people for 12 years. It showed that a portion-controlled diet combined with exercise could help people with diabetes lose weight. Over all, however, their risk of heart disease did not decrease.
        Published in the March 2024 issue of Diabetologia, the new study looked specifically at LOOK AHEAD participants (about 18% of the total) who showed some evidence of diabetes remission, defined as needing no diabetes medications and a close-to-normal blood sugar value at some point in time.
        Those who achieved remission had a 40% lower rate of cardiovascular disease and a 33% lower rate of chronic kidney disease compared with those who didn't achieved remission. The authors say the benefits likely stemmed from improvement in the participants' weight, fitness, blood sugar, and LDL (bad) cholesterol.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/update-on-atrial-fibrillation,Update on atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation causes a rapid, chaotic heartbeat that usually comes and goes without warning. Commonly known as afib, it's caused by electrical misfires in the heart's upper chambers (atria). While some people don't notice any symptoms, others feel a fluttering, pounding sensation in their chest and may become lightheaded, dizzy, and breathless during a bout of afib. But the real danger is a heightened risk of serious strokes (see ""Atrial fibrillation and stroke"").
        An estimated one in 11 people ages 65 and older have afib, which becomes more common with age. ""There are many things you can do to both lower your risk and prevent the progression of afib,"" says Dr. Moussa Mansour, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of the Atrial Fibrillation Program at Massachusetts General Hospital. In fact, lifestyle modifications are now a prominent focus of the latest guidelines for managing afib, he says. Here's a summary of the updated recommendations, published Jan. 2, 2024, in the journal Circulation.
        
          
            
              
                Atrial fibrillation and stroke
                
                  
                
                During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers (atria) quiver rapidly instead of contracting forcefully. Blood pools along the walls of the left atrium, eventually forming clots that may break free to travel through the left ventricle (lower chamber) to the aorta (the large vessel carrying blood out of the heart). If the clot lodges in an artery to the brain, it may block blood flow and cause an ischemic stroke.

        Alcohol and caffeine advice
        ""The most important advice is about alcohol use, which is one of the first things my patients ask about,"" says Dr. Mansour. Strong evidence from multiple studies shows that drinking alcohol raises the risk of afib. There's no magic number of drinks considered safe or risky, although the guidelines suggest no more than one per day. But it's clear that the less alcohol you drink, the better, he says.
        People also wonder if they should avoid coffee. In some people, caffeine seems to trigger palpitations — the sensation of a skipped, missed, or strong heartbeat. Still, observational studies haven't shown any increased risk of afib among coffee drinkers. In fact, one found that people who drink one to three cups of coffee daily are less likely to have afib than people who drink lower or higher amounts. ""Caffeine doesn't seem to be something people need to worry about,"" says Dr. Mansour.
        Weight
        Excess weight, on the other hand, is an issue for many people. Obesity, which is defined as a body mass index or BMI of 30 or higher, promotes afib on several fronts. First, it can worsen high blood pressure, and second, it makes people more prone to obstructive sleep apnea. ""In addition, clinical studies show that obesity increases fat around the heart,"" says Dr. Mansour. This promotes inflammation of the heart muscle, which may lead to changes in the structure of the atria, spurring the onset and progression of afib, he adds.
        The guidelines recommend that people strive for a BMI of 27 or lower. Research suggests that even modest weight loss (about 10% of your body weight) can help keep your heart rhythm more stable and is linked to better outcomes following treatment for afib.
        Exercise
        Exercise not only supports weight loss, it can also lower afib burden, which refers to both the duration and frequency of afib. The afib guidelines suggest 210 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, which may also help reduce afib symptoms. But Dr. Mansour keeps the advice to his patients simple: ""Aim for three to four hours of exercise every week, at a level of effort that's more than a casual walk, but nothing too crazy,"" he says.
        However, dedicated exercise buffs who work out far more than the average person can still develop afib. ""If you trained for marathons in your 30s and keep up that level of intensity into your 60s, the recommendation is to do less exercise if you develop afib,"" says Dr. Mansour. But if exercise is a big deal for you and important for your mental health, there's no hard-and-fast rule about dialing back, he says.
        Sleep
        Dr. Mansour recommends that anyone with afib who snores should be tested for sleep apnea, a condition marked by brief pauses in breathing that often triggers loud snoring, grunts, and gasps. More than one in five people with afib have sleep apnea, and treating the problem may lessen afib recurrence.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-wide-ranging-effects-of-psoriasis,The wide-ranging effects of psoriasis,"Decades ago, advertisements waxed on about the ""heartbreak of psoriasis"" — a skin disorder marked by noticeable patches of scaly skin — to the point that even people with garden-variety dry skin or dandruff worried they might also have the condition.
        But public perception of psoriasis hasn't kept pace with the greatly expanded arsenal of effective treatments scientists have developed in recent years. Numbering more than eight million in the United States and 125 million worldwide, people with psoriasis still face other people's fear and misperceptions about their skin changes.
        While it may seem like a skin-deep problem, psoriasis is a complicated disorder rooted in the immune system. It causes skin cells to multiply up to 10 times faster than normal, leading to itchy and painful plaques that can show up on any area of the body. These lesions can lead to sweeping physical and psychological effects, influencing what people wear, how often they leave their homes, and even their sex lives, says Dr. Martina Porter, a dermatologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        ""People generally know psoriasis patients can have a rash, but I'm not sure everyone understands how truly distressing this disease can be,"" says Dr. Porter, who is also director of the hospital's Clinical Laboratory for Epidemiology and Applied Research in Skin.
        ""A lot of people think, 'Oh, it's just your skin,' but obviously those people have never had a skin disease like this,"" she says. ""Embarrassment is the predominant emotion.""
        Women's bigger burden
        Helping dispel some of the stigma are current-day TV commercials for psoriasis medications featuring celebrities with the disorder, as well as organizations such as the National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF), which runs awareness campaigns to educate the public. ""The commercials have definitely helped,"" Dr. Porter says. ""Now, when people hear you have psoriasis, they're less likely to believe it's contagious. But when they see it, they're still somewhat alarmed.""
        It continues to alarm patients as well. Nearly six in 10 people with psoriasis report it's a significant problem in their everyday lives — and the effects are even greater in women, according to the NPF. Indeed, women with psoriasis are more likely to deal with depression than men, a 2022 study in the International Journal of Women's Dermatology suggests.
        Some people avoid divulging their symptoms to family members and friends or explaining how the disease pummels their confidence, body image, and relationships. Psoriasis plaques located on the face or genitals, under the breasts, or between the buttocks can make intimacy especially off-putting. In a small 2021 study in the journal Dermatology and Therapy, psoriasis patients reported less satisfaction with their physical appearance and sex lives than people without the condition.
        ""It changes how you dress and where you go,"" Dr. Porter says. ""Many people with psoriasis also feel uncomfortable having personal relationships or staying overnight because their skin sheds all over couches and beds. It can be hard to explain that you have psoriasis and not some contagious disease.""
        Coping strategies
        How can you better cope with the physical and psychological ramifications of psoriasis? Dr. Porter offers these suggestions:
        Make it a family affair. ""I always tell patients that the best way to treat anything is to have family members involved,"" she says. With psoriasis, ""that means they can help apply creams to your skin, pick up medications, or come to the doctor with you to discuss your treatment options.""
        See a dermatologist. Maybe you relied on your primary care doctor to diagnose and treat your psoriasis. That's fine. But if your symptoms aren't responding to topical remedies ""or are become so overwhelming and frustrating that they're disrupting your life, ask for a referral to a dermatologist who can assess your situation and determine if systemic therapies can help,"" she says.
        Take a fresh look at available treatments. Options have expanded dramatically in just the last several years — including an array of biologic drugs, which target parts of the immune system responsible for psoriasis — so it's wise to revisit what may work for you now.
        Seek support. Visit the NPF website or those of other advocacy groups to learn more about psoriasis and connect with other people who have the disease. ""It helps you understand you're not alone,"" Dr. Porter says.

        According to a 2022 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, the duration may be a marker of future health. Researchers found that people ages 51 to 75 who were unable to stand on one leg for 10 seconds have almost double the usual risk of premature death.
        The observational study found only an association between balance ability and early death. Still, the test is an excellent way to gauge your balancing skill and give you a sense of your fall risk. Here's how to do it:
        
          Stand near a counter or chair (for support if necessary).
          Keeping your arms at your sides, slowly place the top of your right foot against your left calf.
          Keep your gaze straight ahead and stand that way for 10 seconds.
          Repeat, reversing leg positions.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/night-owls-may-face-higher-diabetes-risks,Night owls may face higher diabetes risks,"Women who are night owls have a higher risk of developing diabetes and are more likely to practice unhealthful lifestyle habits compared with early birds, a new analysis suggests.
        In the Harvard-led study, published online Sept. 12, 2023, by Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers tracked nearly 64,000 female nurses ages 45 to 62 over eight years. The women had no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. Participants reported lifestyle behaviors that included diet quality, physical activity, alcohol use, body mass index, smoking, and sleep habits. They also reported whether they were diagnosed with diabetes.
        Women who fit an ""evening chronotype"" — preferring to stay up and wake up later — were 19% more likely to develop diabetes than those with a ""morning chronotype,"" who prefer to go to bed and wake up earlier. Additionally, night owls were 54% more likely than early birds to report unhealthy lifestyle behaviors such as smoking and poor sleep habits. Earlier research has also suggested that shorter or irregular sleep is linked with a higher risk of diabetes, the study authors noted. They theorized that ""circadian misalignment""—being a night owl, for example, but also working early morning shifts, which is common in nursing—could disrupt the body's ability to properly process sugar.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/eating-high-quality-carbohydrates-may-stave-off-middle-age-weight-gain,Eating high-quality carbohydrates may stave off middle-age weight gain,"Hoping to avoid middle-age weight gain? Steer clear of low-quality carbohydrates and starchy vegetables such as peas, corn, and potatoes, a new Harvard-led study suggests.
        The study, published online Sept. 27, 2023, by The BMJ, evaluated weight changes in 136,432 adults 65 or younger (average age 50, 83.5% women) who were tracked for up to 28 years. Although participants gained an average of more than three pounds every four years, the quality of carbohydrates they ate appeared to play a role in weight control. A daily increase of 3.5 ounces of low-quality carbohydrates — such as sugar-sweetened drinks, refined grains, and starchy vegetables — was associated with gaining up to three pounds over a four-year period. But an increase of just one-third of an ounce of fiber in participants' daily diets was linked with gaining 1.7 fewer pounds over four years. The associations were especially strong in women and in people with excess body weight.
        While consuming too much sugar is unhealthy, refined carbohydrates such as white pasta, white bread, white rice, and chips appeared more problematic, contributing even more to middle-age weight gain, study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/toothbrushing-tied-to-lower-pneumonia-rates-in-hospitalized-patients,Toothbrushing tied to lower pneumonia rates in hospitalized patients,"Seriously ill hospitalized patients whose teeth are brushed at least twice daily are far less likely to develop pneumonia, the most common hospital-acquired infection, a new analysis suggests.
        The study, published online Dec. 18, 2023, by JAMA Internal Medicine, reviewed 15 earlier analyses involving a total of nearly 2,800 patients. Fourteen studies were conducted in hospital intensive care units (ICUs), while 13 involved patients on ventilators. Patients whose teeth were brushed twice or more daily were 33% less likely to develop hospital-acquired pneumonia than those without a toothbrushing regimen. Patients whose teeth were brushed also needed ventilators for less time, were able to leave the ICU more quickly, and were less likely to die in the ICU than those without a toothbrushing regimen.
        Since hospital-acquired pneumonia — which kills more people than any other health care–associated infection — is largely due to inhaling germs from the mouth and throat, toothbrushing may reduce its incidence by eradicating some of those germs, study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/two-workout-strategies-that-reduce-cardiovascular-disease-risk,Two workout strategies that reduce cardiovascular disease risk,"Doing regular aerobic exercise — the kind that works your heart and lungs — is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. Now, findings published online Jan. 17, 2024, by the European Heart Journal suggest that doing a combination of aerobics and strength training might reduce cardiovascular risk factors just as effectively. The study involved about 400 people (ages 35 to 70) classified as overweight or obese who also had high blood pressure. They were randomly assigned to one of four exercise programs: a 60-minute aerobic workout three times a week, a 60-minute strength training workout three times a week, a 60-minute combination of aerobics and strength training (30 minutes of each) three times a week, or no exercise at all. After one year, people in both the aerobics-only group and the combination exercise group (but not the strength-training-only group) had a significant reduction in a combined measure of cardiovascular risk factors, compared with people who didn't exercise. These risk factors included blood pressure, LDL (bad) cholesterol, blood sugar, and body fat. People doing the combined workouts also improved their muscle strength. What this means: it might be equally healthful to replace half of your aerobic workout with strength training, without adding additional exercise time.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/is-that-dental-pain-an-emergency,Is that dental pain an emergency?,"Agonizing tooth pain, sharp jaw discomfort, a dull ache in your gums — each one is a sign of dental trouble or something even more serious. Unfortunately, many people put off a call to the dentist — a potentially risky move, since dental problems can be more advanced than you realize.
        ""As we age, we can feel less pain in our teeth because the nerves inside them shrink, and dentin — a porous material beneath tooth enamel — builds up. So something can fester for a long time and turn into a bigger, more complex problem,"" says Dr. Lisa Thompson, a geriatric dentistry specialist at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
        Here's more on what causes dental pain, how to identify it, and when you should call your dentist or even 911.
        Tooth pain
        Tooth pain can stem from several problems. Perhaps the most common is a cavity, a tiny hole in the tooth. Plaque — a sticky mix of food particles and bacteria covering the outer layer of a tooth, the enamel — creates chemicals that break down the enamel. The deeper the cavity, the more likely the nerve in the tooth will be exposed, resulting in sharp pain and sensitivity to hot or cold foods. Those symptoms can also come from a cracked tooth or a cracked or loose filling, which can expose the nerve.
        Tooth pain might also be due to trauma, such as accidentally biting down on a fork. That can bruise the ligament holding your tooth in the jaw, generating an initially sharp and then dull ache in the tooth.
        If you experience tooth pressure when you bite down on food, have sinus pressure without nasal congestion, or a have a bad (acidic) taste in your mouth, it could be that a cavity or cracked tooth has led to a painful infection at the root of the tooth, creating a small pocket of pus called an abscess.
        Gum pain
        Gum pain tends to be an achy soreness rather than a sharp pain. It has many potential causes. It might be as simple as having sensitive gums, brushing your teeth too vigorously, or having irritation from a bit of food (such as a piece of popcorn) stuck in your teeth or in the space between your gum and teeth.
        Gum pain can also come from a cut if something poked you (such as a corn chip), irritation from toothpaste that contains sodium laurel sulfate, or canker sores (aphthous ulcers).
        Pain in the gums can also be due to dentures or partials that don't fit well or aren't cleaned regularly. ""You might see red bumps on the irritated area or have a burning sensation from a fungal infection,"" Dr. Thompson says.
        Another possibility: plaque buildup at the bottom of teeth is irritating the gums and causing gingivitis, an early stage of gum disease marked by swollen, bleeding gums. Untreated gingivitis can progress below the gum line (becoming periodontal disease). It can destroy the ligament holding the tooth in place as well as the bone, leading to gum pain, abscesses, and tooth loss. Signs of an abscess caused by gum disease include a pimple of pus on the gum or facial swelling.
        Jaw pain
        Jaw pain can be sudden and sharp, or a chronic tenderness that gradually increases over time.
        Dull, chronic jaw pain usually comes from a problem with the temporomandibular joint, where the jaw bone meets the skull on either side of your head. Trouble related to this joint is called a temporomandibular disorder, or TMD.
        ""You can get TMD from injury such as joint dislocation or from problems related to muscles, stress, arthritis, and even behaviors you aren't even aware of. Maybe you grind your teeth at night, chew gum, or bite on a pen,"" Dr. Thompson says.
        Be especially vigilant about a pain that suddenly affects your neck and lower jaw. That can be a form of the pain called angina caused by narrowed heart arteries — or it could even be a symptom of a heart attack. Heart-related jaw pain can occur without the more common heart attack symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath.
        What you should do
        Sudden neck and lower jaw pain can signal an emergency. Call 911, especially if you have known heart problems.
        All other tooth, gum, and jaw pain should trigger a call to your dentist — as soon as possible if you suspect a cracked filling or tooth, gum disease, or an abscess.
        ""Bacteria from the abscess can get into the bloodstream, and can travel to other spaces in your body, such as your brain or heart. It can be life-threatening. If your dentist can't see you immediately, go to an emergency department, although there's not much they can do but give you antibiotics until you can get to a dentist,"" Dr. Thompson says. ""And if you suspect that your diet, behavior, or brushing habits might be causing pain, go ahead and experiment: get a soft toothbrush, use a Waterpik, switch toothpastes. And keep brushing and flossing your teeth every day.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/an-easier-way-to-do-high-intensity-interval-training,An easier way to do high-intensity interval training,"By now, you're probably familiar with high-intensity interval training (HIIT), a popular workout strategy that alternates bursts of strenuous exercise with rest or lower-intensity activity. The technique helps you get fit faster than a traditional moderate-intensity workout. HIIT also produces equal or greater improvements in blood pressure, blood sugar, weight loss, and functional ability (such as walking quickly or getting out of a chair), compared with moderate-intensity exercise.
        But what if you have an old sports injury, a chronic disease, or a sedentary lifestyle that makes HIIT seem too challenging? The answer might be to perform the powerhouse workout in a pool.
        Aquatic HIIT
        An analysis of 18 studies published online Nov. 14, 2023, by BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine found that people with chronic conditions who took part in high-intensity interval training in the water — called aquatic HIIT or AHIIT — experienced a similar boost in endurance (their maximum sustained physical exertion) as people who took part in land-based HIIT.
        Almost 900 people were involved in the studies. Conditions among participants included arthritis, low back pain, lung or heart problems, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, obesity, a history of stroke, and spinal cord injury.
        
          
            
              
                Water workout benefits
                Exercising in the water is often easier — and more fun — than exercising on land. One reason is your body's buoyancy in water. ""It reduces the load on your bones and muscles. You can move more easily, and you have less fear of falling than you do on land,"" says Brian Simons, a physical therapist and HIIT specialist at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
                For more information, check out the Harvard Special Health Report Aqua Fitness.
              
            
          
        
        Getting started
        While the benefits of AHIIT make it doable for people who are deconditioned or weak, it's still important to talk to your doctor before giving this strenuous workout a try, especially if you have a heart condition.
        Once your doctor gives you the green light, take a gradual approach to AHIIT, depending on your current activity levels.
        If you're not used to exercising: Work with a physical therapist or personal trainer to ease into an exercise routine, building up to 30-minute workouts on most days of the week. This can be a combination of working out in a pool on some days, and brisk walking on others. ""For a pool workout, try leisurely swimming, walking in the pool, jumping up and down, using a kickboard and kicking across the pool, or wearing a flotation device and cycling your legs. Once your endurance improves, probably after two months, you'll be ready for AHIIT,"" says Brian Simons, a physical therapist and HIIT specialist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        If you're already a regular exerciser: Get used to exercising in a pool for a few weeks before trying AHIIT. Simons suggests seeing how well you do in different depths, and trying various pool activities mentioned above.
        Diving in
        You might find an AHIIT class at your health club or local YMCA. Or you can try an AHIIT program of your own making. Start with a warm-up, such as treading water for a few minutes (to get your blood flowing and muscles ready). Then, alternate intervals of intense activity and rest or leisurely activity, for a total of 30 minutes. For example:
        Swim laps. Alternate periods of gentle swimming (such as swimming one very leisurely lap) with periods of intense swimming (such as swimming one or two laps as fast as you can). Repeat the process for 30 minutes.
        Do a circuit. Alternate between periods of rest and a circuit of four or five exercises in a row that you do as fast as you can, for about a minute per exercise. ""You could jog in place or jump up and down on the floor of the pool, scissor your arms back and forth [underwater], scissor your legs back and forth, hang on to the edge of the pool and kick hard, and then rest for a few minutes,"" says Simons. Repeat the process until you reach 30 minutes.
        Gradually increase the length of each high-intensity period. ""Ideally, we want the rest break to be shorter than the working period. But if you have a chronic condition limiting your ability, take a longer rest break,"" says Simons.
        If AHIIT still seems too challenging, Simons offers this observation: ""I've noticed that people with chronic disease develop a high level of resilience that helps them push harder than other people,"" says Simons. ""So don't be timid. With your doctor's approval, this is something that you can do.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/green-poop-what-stool-color-can-indicate-about-health,Green poop: What stool color can indicate about health,"Question:
          My poop sometimes turns green. What can cause green poop? What do changes in stool color mean about your health?
        
        Answer: Temporary changes in stool color from the usual brown most often do not indicate a serious medical problem. But certain color changes may require medical attention, especially if you have other symptoms.
        Green poop
        Intermittent green stool in someone who otherwise feels fine is usually related to eating dark green vegetables, such as spinach and kale. Another reason for green poop is the rapid passage of green bile from the small intestine when a person has diarrhea. Medications, including bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol), iron supplements, and some antibiotics, may also result in greenish colored stool.
        Very pale brown stool
        Pale stools can be a sign of liver or gallbladder conditions. If insufficient bile is produced by the liver or there is a blockage of the bile duct, the bile salts that aid digestion can be greatly reduced. Examples of conditions that can lead to pale stools include hepatitis, cirrhosis, and gallstones. People with pale stools due to one of these problems often have jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) and cola-colored urine.
        Yellow stool
        Excess fat in poop can give stool a yellow color. An extremely high-fat diet might cause the color change. However, if stool is yellow, greasy, floats in the toilet bowl, and smells bad, that probably means there is a problem with fat absorption. This can occur from liver disease, pancreatitis, a bile or pancreatic duct blockage, or a small intestine condition such as celiac disease. Some infections such as giardiasis can also cause yellowish stool.
        Red poop
        Red poop always raises the possibility of blood in the stool. Small amounts of blood in the toilet bowl or on toilet paper are most often from hemorrhoids. Larger amounts of bright red blood should always prompt an immediate call for medical advice. If a person also has lightheadedness, then emergency evaluation is needed. Anyone with persistent or recurrent rectal bleeding, even in minimal amounts, should make an appointment with their doctor. Some red foods such as beets and tomatoes and red food dyes can also cause red poop.
        Black stool
        Tarry, foul-smelling black stool can indicate bleeding from the stomach or upper small intestine. Stomach acid and digestive enzymes convert blood from a red color to black. This always requires immediate medical attention. Iron supplements, bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol), and activated charcoal may blacken stool. Blood sausage, blueberries, and black licorice are also possible causes.","Howard E. LeWine, MD","April 1, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-you-try-the-keto-diet,Should you try the keto diet?,"In the world of weight-loss diets, low-carbohydrate, high-protein eating plans often grab attention. The Paleo, South Beach, and Atkins diets all fit into that category. They are sometimes referred to as ketogenic or ""keto"" diets. But a true ketogenic diet is different. Unlike other low-carb diets, which focus on protein, a keto plan centers on fat, which supplies as much as 90% of daily calories. And it's not the type of diet to try as an experiment.
        The keto diet is used to help reduce the frequency of epileptic seizures in children. While it also has been tried for weight loss, it's best to make this only a short-term dietary change to help jump start weight reduction.
        How does the keto diet work?
        Here are the basics. The keto diet aims to force your body into using a different type of fuel. Instead of relying on sugar (glucose) that comes from carbohydrates (such as grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits), the keto diet relies on ketone bodies, a type of fuel that the liver produces from stored fat.
        Burning fat seems like an ideal way to lose pounds. But getting the liver to make ketone bodies is tricky:
        
          It requires that you deprive yourself of carbohydrates, fewer than 20 to 50 grams of carbs per day (keep in mind that a medium-sized banana has about 27 grams of carbs).
          It typically takes a few days to reach a state of ketosis.
          Eating too much protein can interfere with ketosis.
        
        What do you eat?
        Because the keto diet has such a high fat requirement, followers must eat fat at each meal. In a daily 2,000-calorie diet, that might look like 165 grams of fat, 40 grams of carbs, and 75 grams of protein. However, the exact ratio depends on your particular needs.
        Some healthy unsaturated fats are allowed on the keto diet — like nuts (almonds, walnuts), seeds, avocados, tofu, and olive oil. But saturated fats from oils (palm, coconut), lard, butter, and cocoa butter are encouraged in high amounts.
        Protein is part of the keto diet, but it doesn't typically discriminate between lean protein foods and protein sources high in saturated fat such as beef, pork, and bacon.
        What about fruits and vegetables? All fruits are rich in carbs, but you can have certain fruits (usually berries) in small portions. Vegetables (also rich in carbs) are restricted to leafy greens (such as kale, Swiss chard, spinach), cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, bell peppers, onions, garlic, mushrooms, cucumber, celery, and summer squashes. A cup of chopped broccoli has about six carbs.
        Keto diet risks
        A ketogenic diet has numerous risks. Top of the list: it's high in saturated fat. McManus recommends that you keep saturated fats to no more than 7% of your daily calories because of the link to heart disease. And indeed, the keto diet is associated with an increase in ""bad"" LDL cholesterol, which is also linked to heart disease.
        Other potential keto risks include these:
        Nutrient deficiency. ""If you're not eating a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, and grains, you may be at risk for deficiencies in micronutrients, including selenium, magnesium, phosphorus, and vitamins B and C,"" McManus says.
        Liver problems. With so much fat to metabolize, the diet could make any existing liver conditions worse.
        Kidney problems. The kidneys help metabolize protein, and McManus says the keto diet may overload them. (The current recommended intake for protein averages 46 grams per day for women, and 56 grams for men).
        Constipation. The keto diet is low in fibrous foods like grains and legumes.
        Fuzzy thinking and mood swings. The brain works best when the energy source is sugar from healthy carbohydrates to function. Low-carb diets may cause confusion and irritability.
        Those risks add up — so make sure that you talk to a doctor and a registered dietitian before ever attempting a ketogenic diet.
        What about the other diets?
        The popular low-carb diets (such as Atkins or Paleo) modify a true keto diet. But they come with the same risks if you overdo it on fats and proteins and lay off the carbs.
        So why do people follow the diets? They're everywhere, and people hear anecdotally that they work. Theories about short-term low-carb diet success include lower appetite because fat burns slower than carbs. But concerns remain about staying on a keto diet long term. And eating a restrictive diet, no matter what the plan, is difficult to sustain. Once you resume a normal diet, the weight will likely return.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-is-a-plant-based-diet-and-why-should-you-try-it-2018092614760,What is a plant-based diet and why should you try it?,"Plant-based or plant-forward eating patterns focus on foods primarily from plants. This includes not only fruits and vegetables, but also nuts, seeds, oils, whole grains, legumes, and beans. It doesn't mean that you are vegetarian or vegan and never eat meat or dairy. Rather, you are proportionately choosing more of your foods from plant sources.
        Mediterranean and vegetarian diets
        What is the evidence that plant-based eating patterns are healthy? Much nutrition research has examined plant-based eating patterns such as the Mediterranean diet and a vegetarian diet. The Mediterranean diet has a foundation of plant-based foods; it also includes fish, poultry, eggs, cheese, and yogurt a few times a week, with meats and sweets less often.
        The Mediterranean diet has been shown in both large population studies and randomized clinical trials to reduce risk of heart disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, certain cancers (specifically colon, breast, and prostate cancer), depression, and in older adults, a decreased risk of frailty, along with better mental and physical function.
        Vegetarian diets have also been shown to support health, including a lower risk of developing coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and increased longevity.
        Plant-based diets offer all the necessary protein, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals for optimal health, and are often higher in fiber and phytonutrients. However, some vegans may need to add a supplement (specifically vitamin B12) to ensure they receive all the nutrients required.
        Vegetarian diet variety
        Vegetarian diets come in lots of shapes and sizes, and you should choose the version that works best for you.
        
          Semi-vegetarian or flexitarian includes eggs, dairy foods, and occasionally meat, poultry, ﬁsh, and seafood.
          Pescatarian includes eggs, dairy foods, ﬁsh, and seafood, but no meat or poultry.
          Vegetarian (sometimes referred to as lacto-ovo vegetarian) includes eggs and dairy foods, but no meat, poultry, ﬁsh, or seafood.
          Vegan includes no animal foods.
        
        8 ways to get started with a plant-based diet
        Here are some tips to help you get started on a plant-based diet.
        
          Eat lots of vegetables. Fill half your plate with vegetables at lunch and dinner. Make sure you include plenty of colors in choosing your vegetables. Enjoy vegetables as a snack with hummus, salsa, or guacamole.
          Change the way you think about meat. Have smaller amounts. Use it as a garnish instead of a centerpiece.
          Choose good fats. Fats in olive oil, olives, nuts and nut butters, seeds, and avocados are particularly healthy choices.
          Cook a vegetarian meal at least one night a week. Build these meals around beans, whole grains, and vegetables.
          Include whole grains for breakfast. Start with oatmeal, quinoa, buckwheat, or barley. Then add some nuts or seeds along with fresh fruit.
          Go for greens. Try a variety of green leafy vegetables such as kale, collards, Swiss chard, spinach, and other greens each day. Steam, grill, braise, or stir-fry to preserve their flavor and nutrients.
          Build a meal around a salad. Fill a bowl with salad greens such as romaine, spinach, Bibb, or red leafy greens. Add an assortment of other vegetables along with fresh herbs, beans, peas, or tofu.
          Eat fruit for dessert. A ripe, juicy peach, a refreshing slice of watermelon, or a crisp apple will satisfy your craving for a sweet bite after a meal.
        
        Inspiration for plant-based eating throughout the day
        Over time, eating a plant-based diet will become second nature. Here are some ideas to get you started.
        Breakfast:
        
          Rolled oats with walnuts, banana, and a sprinkle of cinnamon
          Breakfast wrap: Fill a whole-wheat tortilla with scrambled egg, black beans, peppers, onions, Monterey jack cheese, and a splash of hot sauce or salsa

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/managing-intrusive-thoughts,Managing intrusive thoughts,"It seems to come out of nowhere — a strange, disturbing thought or a troubling image that pops into your mind. It might be violent or sexual, or a recurring fear that you'll do something inappropriate or embarrassing. Whatever the content, it's often unsettling and may bring on feelings of worry or shame. The more you try to push the thought from your mind, the more it persists.
        Intrusive thoughts, as these are called, are thought to affect some six million Americans, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America.
        Sometimes intrusive thoughts are associated with a mental health disorder, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, where thoughts become so bothersome that they prompt repetitive behaviors or compulsions to try to prevent them from occurring. They are also common in post-traumatic stress disorder, which can be triggered by a life-threatening or extremely stressful event, such as an accident or violent attack. But many people who experience these thoughts don't have a mental health disorder.
        Intrusive thoughts are often triggered by stress or anxiety. They may also be a short-term problem brought on by biological factors, such as hormone shifts. For example, a woman might experience an uptick in intrusive thoughts after the birth of a child.
        Any life stressor, if big enough, can increase your risk of having intrusive thoughts.
        While intrusive thoughts may be disturbing, they aren't harmful or mean that you have a secret desire to do the things that popped into your mind.
        Identifying intrusive thoughts
        So, how can you tell if you are experiencing intrusive thoughts? There are some signs to look for.
        The thought is unusual for you. An intrusive thought is usually very different from your typical thoughts. For example, it might be uncharacteristically violent.
        The thought is bothersome. If a thought is disturbing and it's something you want to push out of your mind, it might be an intrusive thought.
        The thought feels hard to control. Intrusive thoughts are often repetitive and won't go away.
        The more you think about an intrusive thoughts, it might make you more anxious and dwell on them even more. Instead of fighting intrusive thoughts, it's better to learn to live with them. When these thoughts emerge, try taking the following steps:
        1. Identify the thought as intrusive. Think to yourself, 'that's just an intrusive thought; it's not how I think, it's not what I believe, and it's not what I want to do.
        2. Don't fight with it. When you have an intrusive thought, just accept it. Don't try to make it go away.
        3. Don't judge yourself. Know that having a strange or disturbing thought doesn't indicate that something is wrong with you.
        When to seek help
        See a mental health professional if unwanted thoughts are starting to disrupt your daily life, particularly if they're impairing your ability to work or to do things you enjoy. However, even if intrusive thoughts aren't affecting your life in a significant way, you can still see someone to get help.
        Cognitive behavioral therapy is one strategy that is often successful in helping people manage intrusive thoughts. The process may help you to shift some of your general thought patterns, which can enable you to better manage these thoughts when they do occur and might lessen their frequency.
        Intrusive thoughts can also be managed by addressing the underlying problem, such as anxiety, stress, or a personal history of trauma. While it may be helpful to share the particular thoughts you are having, keep in mind that even if you aren't comfortable talking about them in detail, a therapist can still help. People should also know that intrusive thoughts typically respond well to therapy.
        Keep in mind that you might not need help forever. It may be a very short-term thing.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/11-foods-that-lower-cholesterol,11 foods that lower cholesterol,"Changing what foods you eat can lower your cholesterol and improve the armada of fats floating through your bloodstream. Adding foods that lower LDL, the harmful cholesterol-carrying particle that contributes to artery-clogging atherosclerosis, is the best way to achieve a low cholesterol diet.
        Add these foods to lower LDL cholesterol
        Different foods lower cholesterol in various ways. Some deliver soluble fiber, which binds cholesterol and its precursors in the digestive system and drags them out of the body before they get into circulation. Some give you polyunsaturated fats, which directly lower LDL. And some contain plant sterols and stanols, which block the body from absorbing cholesterol.
        1. Oats. An easy first step to lowering your cholesterol is having a bowl of oatmeal or cold oat-based cereal like Cheerios for breakfast. It gives you 1 to 2 grams of soluble fiber. Add a banana or some strawberries for another half-gram. Current nutrition guidelines recommend getting 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day, with at least 5 to 10 grams coming from soluble fiber. (The average American gets about half that amount.)
        2. Barley and other whole grains. Like oats and oat bran, barley and other whole grains can help lower the risk of heart disease, mainly via the soluble fiber they deliver.
        3. Beans. Beans are especially rich in soluble fiber. They also take a while for the body to digest, meaning you feel full for longer after a meal. That's one reason beans are a useful food for folks trying to lose weight. With so many choices — from navy and kidney beans to lentils, garbanzos, black-eyed peas, and beyond — and so many ways to prepare them, beans are a very versatile food.
        4. Eggplant and okra. These two low-calorie vegetables are good sources of soluble fiber.
        5. Nuts. A bushel of studies shows that eating almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and other nuts is good for the heart. Eating 2 ounces of nuts a day can slightly lower LDL, on the order of 5%. Nuts have additional nutrients that protect the heart in other ways.
        6. Vegetable oils. Using liquid vegetable oils such as canola, sunflower, safflower, and others in place of butter, lard, or shortening when cooking or at the table helps lower LDL.
        7. Apples, grapes, strawberries, citrus fruits. These fruits are rich in pectin, a type of soluble fiber that lowers LDL.
        8. Foods fortified with sterols and stanols. Sterols and stanols extracted from plants gum up the body's ability to absorb cholesterol from food. Companies are adding them to foods ranging from margarine and granola bars to orange juice and chocolate. They're also available as supplements. Getting 2 grams of plant sterols or stanols a day can lower LDL cholesterol by about 10%.
        9. Soy. Eating soybeans and foods made from them, like tofu and soy milk, was once touted as a powerful way to lower cholesterol. Analyses show that the effect is more modest — consuming 25 grams of soy protein a day (10 ounces of tofu or 2 1/2 cups of soy milk) can lower LDL by 5% to 6%.
        10. Fatty fish. Eating fish two or three times a week can lower LDL in two ways: by replacing meat, which has LDL-boosting saturated fats, and by delivering LDL-lowering omega-3 fats. Omega-3s reduce triglycerides in the bloodstream and also protect the heart by helping prevent the onset of abnormal heart rhythms.
        11. Fiber supplements. Supplements offer the least appealing way to get soluble fiber. Two teaspoons a day of psyllium, which is found in Metamucil and other bulk-forming laxatives, provide about 4 grams of soluble fiber.
        Putting together a low-cholesterol diet
        When it comes to investing money, experts recommend creating a portfolio of diverse investments instead of putting all your eggs in one basket. The same holds true for eating your way to lower cholesterol. Adding several foods to lower cholesterol in different ways should work better than focusing on one or two.
        A largely vegetarian ""dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods"" substantially lowers LDL, triglycerides, and blood pressure. The key dietary components are plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains instead of highly refined ones, and protein mostly from plants. Add margarine enriched with plant sterols; oats, barley, psyllium, okra, and eggplant, all rich in soluble fiber; soy protein; and whole almonds.
        Of course, shifting to a cholesterol-lowering diet takes more attention than popping a daily statin. It means expanding the variety of foods you usually put in your shopping cart and getting used to new textures and flavors. But it's a ""natural"" way to lower cholesterol, and it avoids the risk of muscle problems and other side effects that plague some people who take statins.
        Just as important, a diet that is heavy on fruits, vegetables, beans, and nuts is good for the body in ways beyond lowering cholesterol. It keeps blood pressure in check. It helps arteries stay flexible and responsive. It's good for bones and digestive health, for vision and mental health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/taking-aim-at-belly-fat,Taking aim at belly fat,"No matter what your body shape, excess fat isn't good for your health. But saddlebags and ballooning bellies are not equivalent. When it comes to body fat, location counts, and each year brings new evidence that the fat lying deep within the abdomen is more perilous than the fat you can pinch with your fingers.
        In most people, about 90% of body fat is subcutaneous, the kind that lies in a layer just beneath the skin. If you poke your belly, the fat that feels soft is subcutaneous fat. The remaining 10% — called visceral or intra-abdominal fat — lies out of reach, beneath the firm abdominal wall. It's found in the spaces surrounding the liver, intestines, and other organs. It's also stored in the omentum, an apron-like flap of tissue that lies under the belly muscles and blankets the intestines. The omentum gets harder and thicker as it fills with fat.
        Although visceral fat makes up only a small proportion of body fat, it's a key player in a variety of health problems.
        As women go through their middle years, their proportion of fat to body weight tends to increase — more than it does in men — and fat storage begins favoring the upper body over the hips and thighs. Even if you don't actually gain weight, your waistline can grow by inches as visceral fat pushes out against the abdominal wall.
        
          
            
              
                Where's the fat?
                
                  
                
                Visceral fat lies in the spaces between the abdominal organs and in an apron of tissue called the omentum. Subcutaneous fat is located between the skin and the outer abdominal wall.
              
            
          
        
        The trouble with visceral fat
        Body fat, or adipose tissue, was once regarded as little more than a storage depot for fat blobs waiting passively to be used for energy. But research has shown that fat cells — particularly visceral fat cells — are biologically active. One of the most important developments [since the mid-1990s] is the realization that the fat cell is an endocrine organ, secreting hormones and other molecules that have far-reaching effects on other tissues.
        Before researchers recognized that fat acts as an endocrine gland, they thought that the main risk of visceral fat was influencing the production of cholesterol by releasing free fatty acids into the bloodstream and liver. We now know that there's far more to the story. Researchers have identified a host of chemicals that link visceral fat to a surprisingly wide variety of diseases.
        Subcutaneous fat produces a higher proportion of beneficial molecules, and visceral fat a higher proportion of molecules with potentially deleterious health effects. Visceral fat makes more of the proteins called cytokines, which can trigger low-level inflammation, a risk factor for heart disease and other chronic conditions. It also produces a precursor to angiotensin, a protein that causes blood vessels to constrict and blood pressure to rise.
        
          
            
              
                Gut check
                A tape measure is your best home option for keeping tabs on visceral fat. Measure your waistline at the level of the navel — not at the narrowest part of the torso — and always measure in the same place. (According to official guidelines, the bottom of the tape measure should be level with the top of the right hip bone, or ilium — see the illustration — at the point where the ilium intersects a line dropped vertically from the center of the armpit.) Don't suck in your gut or pull the tape tight enough to compress the area. In women, a waist circumference of 35 inches or larger is generally considered a sign of excess visceral fat, but that may not apply if your overall body size is large. Rather than focus on a single reading or absolute cut-off, keep an eye on whether your waist is growing (are your pants getting snug at the waist?). That should give you a good idea of whether you're gaining unhealthy visceral fat.
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        From fat to disease
        Visceral fat can be measured in a variety of ways. CT scans and full-body MRIs are the most precise, but they are expensive and rarely available, so investigators often use estimates based on waist circumference or waist size in proportion to height (see ""Gut check""). To ensure that they're not just measuring overall obesity, researchers also check whether a person's waist circumference is higher than average for her or his body mass index (BMI).
        Visceral fat is implicated in a number of chronic conditions, including these:
        Cardiovascular disease. Several studies have documented this effect. For example, a large study of European women ages 45 to 79 concluded that those with the biggest waists (and those with the largest waists in relation to their hip size) had more than double the risk of developing heart disease. The risk was still nearly double even after adjustment for several other risk factors, including blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, and BMI. Even in healthy, nonsmoking women, every 2 inches of additional waist size raised the risk for cardiovascular disease by 10%.
        Higher visceral-fat volume also has a deleterious impact on several other heart disease risk factors. It's associated with higher blood pressure, blood sugar levels and triglyceride levels, and lower levels of HDL (good) cholesterol. Taken together, these changes, known as metabolic syndrome, create a serious risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.
        Dementia. Researchers at Kaiser Permanente found that people in their early 40s with the highest levels of abdominal fat, compared with those who had the least abdominal fat at that age, were nearly three times more likely to develop dementia (including Alzheimer's disease) by their mid-70s to early 80s. Dementia was not associated with increased thigh size.
        Asthma. In a large study of California teachers, women with high levels of visceral fat (a waist circumference of more than 35 inches) were 37% more likely to develop asthma than women with smaller waists — even if their weight was normal. The risks were highest for women who were both large-waisted and overweight or obese. The investigators believe that belly fat raises the risk of asthma more than other poundage because it has inflammatory effects throughout the body, including in the airways.
        Breast cancer. A combined analysis of several studies found that premenopausal women with abdominal obesity (the largest waist size in proportion to their height) were at greater risk for breast cancer. Large waists were also linked to breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women, but that effect was not significant once BMI was taken into account.
        Colorectal cancer. People with the most visceral fat have three times the risk of developing colorectal adenomas (precancerous polyps) than those with the least visceral fat. The relationship was found after many other risks were accounted for. The researchers also confirmed that adenomatous polyps in the colon are associated with insulin resistance, which may be the mechanism that increases the cancer risk.
        How to lose (and prevent) visceral belly fat
        Where you tend to gain fat depends on your genes, your hormones, your age, your birth weight (smaller babies more readily add belly fat later in life), and whether you've had children (women who have given birth tend to develop more visceral fat than women who haven't).
        As young adults, women on average have less visceral fat than men, but that changes with menopause. You can't change your birth weight or your genes, and you can't hold off menopause. But there are several ways you can minimize the accumulation of visceral fat. The good news is that because it's more readily metabolized into fatty acids, it responds more efficiently to diet and exercise than fat on the hips and thighs. Here are some approaches that may help:
        Keep moving. Exercise can help reduce your waist circumference. Even if you don't lose weight, you lose visceral belly fat and gain muscle mass. Engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days, such as brisk walking or bicycling at a casual pace. Also create opportunities to add motion to routine tasks. For example, park farther from your destination and walk the rest of the way, take the stairs instead of the elevator, and stand while you talk on the phone.
        Studies have shown that you can help trim visceral fat or prevent its growth with both aerobic activity (such as brisk walking) and strength training (exercising with weights). Spot exercises, such as sit-ups, can tighten abdominal muscles but won't get at visceral fat. Exercise can also help keep fat from coming back.
        Eat right. Choose a balanced diet that helps you achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Avoid products that seem to encourage belly fat deposition, especially simple sugars like fructose-sweetened foods and beverages.
        Don't smoke. The more you smoke, the more likely you are to store fat in your abdomen rather than on your hips and thighs.
        Get your sleep. Too little is bad. A five-year study found that adults under age 40 who slept five hours or less a night accumulated significantly more visceral fat. But too much isn't good, either — young adults who slept more than eight hours also added visceral fat. (This relationship wasn't found in people over age 40.)
        Forget the quick fix. Liposuction for cosmetic fat removal doesn't reach inside the abdominal wall.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/foods-that-fight-inflammation,Foods that fight inflammation,"What does an anti-inflammatory diet do? Your immune system becomes activated when your body recognizes anything that is foreign—such as an invading microbe, plant pollen, or chemical. This often triggers a process called inflammation. Intermittent bouts of inflammation directed at truly threatening invaders protect your health.
        However, sometimes inflammation persists, day in and day out, even when you are not threatened by a foreign invader. That's when inflammation can become your enemy. Many major diseases that plague us — including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, depression, and Alzheimer's — have been linked to chronic inflammation.
        One of the most powerful tools to combat inflammation comes not from the pharmacy, but from the grocery store. ""Many experimental studies have shown that components of foods or beverages may have anti-inflammatory effects,"" says Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.
        Choose the right anti-inflammatory foods, and you may be able to reduce your risk of illness. Consistently pick the wrong ones, and you could accelerate the inflammatory disease process.
        
          
            
              
                Foods that cause inflammation
                Try to avoid or limit these foods as much as possible:
                
                  refined carbohydrates, such as white bread and pastries
                  French fries and other fried foods
                  soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages
                  red meat (burgers, steaks) and processed meat (hot dogs, sausage)
                  margarine, shortening, and lard
                
              
            
          
        
        The health risks of inflammatory foods
        Not surprisingly, the same foods on an inflammation diet are generally considered bad for our health, including sodas and refined carbohydrates, as well as red meat and processed meats.
        ""Some of the foods that have been associated with an increased risk for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease are also associated with excess inflammation,"" Dr. Hu says. ""It's not surprising, since inflammation is an important underlying mechanism for the development of these diseases.""
        Unhealthy foods also contribute to weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for inflammation. Yet in several studies, even after researchers took obesity into account, the link between foods and inflammation remained, which suggests weight gain isn't the sole driver. ""Some of the food components or ingredients may have independent effects on inflammation over and above increased caloric intake,"" Dr. Hu says.
        
          
            
              
                Anti-inflammatory foods
                An anti-inflammatory diet should include these foods:
                
                  tomatoes
                  olive oil
                  green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, kale, and collards
                  nuts like almonds and walnuts
                  fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna, and sardines
                  fruits such as strawberries, blueberries, cherries, and oranges 
                
              
            
          
        
        Benefits of anti-inflammatory foods
        On the flip side are beverages and foods that reduce inflammation, and with it, chronic disease, says Dr. Hu. He notes in particular fruits and vegetables such as blueberries, apples, and leafy greens that are high in natural antioxidants and polyphenols — protective compounds found in plants.
        Studies have also associated nuts with reduced markers of inflammation and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Coffee, which contains polyphenols and other anti-inflammatory compounds, may protect against inflammation, as well.
        Anti-inflammatory diet
        To reduce levels of inflammation, aim for an overall healthy diet. If you're looking for an eating plan that closely follows the tenets of anti-inflammatory eating, consider the Mediterranean diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils.
        In addition to lowering inflammation, a more natural, less processed diet can have noticeable effects on your physical and emotional health. ""A healthy diet is beneficial not only for reducing the risk of chronic diseases, but also for improving mood and overall quality of life,"" Dr. Hu says.",Unknown,"March 26, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/what-is-creatine-potential-benefits-and-risks-of-this-popular-supplement,What is creatine? Potential benefits and risks of this popular supplement,"Question:
          A gym friend recommended taking creatine supplements. What is creatine? Does creatine have any positive effects? Are creatine supplements safe?
        
        Answer: Creatine is often called an amino acid. But technically it is not one of the 20 amino acids that are the building blocks of all proteins. Our bodies can make creatine from three other true amino acids: arginine, glycine, and methionine.
        Potential positive effects of creatine supplementation
        Creatine may enhance athletic performance. It contributes to rapid energy production and may enhance power or speed bursts requiring short periods of anaerobic activity. The reason could be related to the association of creatine supplementation and increased glycogen storage in muscle. Glycogen can quickly release glucose, one of the best sources of instant energy.
        There is also some evidence that creatine supplementation along with adequate calorie and protein intake can hasten muscle recovery after strenuous exercise. Again, this may be related to creatine's promotion of glycogen in muscle, because glucose-derived energy is needed to help the healing process.
        Creatine supplementation does not build muscle. However, creatine supplementation along with regular resistance training and a well-balanced diet may offset age-related sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass and power that happens as we grow older, but also occurs when muscles are inadequately activated, such as after an injury.
        Creatine sources and dosing
        Foods that tend to have richer amounts of creatine include meats, fish, and cow's milk. However, it's not clear that increasing intake of these foods offers any extra athletic benefits compared to getting a similar amount of protein from other sources.
        Creatine monohydrate is the most commonly used form and the one most studied. Other forms do not offer any extra benefits.
        The general recommendation for people who do take a creatine supplement is 3 to 5 grams per day. Studies show that loading up on a higher dose of creatine offers no advantages; you are just putting more stress on your kidneys.
        Creatine supplement safety
        Unlike over-the-counter and prescription drugs, the FDA does not regulate the accuracy of supplement contents. So, there is always the potential that a creatine supplement contains less or more than the amount on the label. Also, the supplement may contain other ingredients that could potentially be harmful for you.
        Otherwise, an adult dose of 3 to 5 grams of creatine daily is safe. However, people with kidney disease should consult with their doctor prior to taking it.
        Creatine is not an anabolic steroid, nor does it increase testosterone levels.
        Some people will retain a couple of pounds of fluid during the first week they start creatine supplementation. But this is temporary, and studies of long-term use do not show a persistent problem with holding onto extra water.","Howard E. LeWine, MD","March 20, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/how-to-shop-for-healthier-foods,How to shop for healthier foods,"When it comes to their diet, men often keep coming back to old favorites. They find a few foods they enjoy and rotate them through their daily meals.
        ""There is nothing necessarily wrong with that as long as their diet includes plenty of whole foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, and avoids high amounts of processed foods,"" says Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""But men also should be more mindful about reading food labels when selecting their favorite foods to ensure they get more of the healthiest nutrients and much less of certain substances.""
        Rimm suggests that for men who stick their favorites, they want to be especially mindful of adding more fiber and minimizing their intake of sodium and added sugars.
        Sodium
        FDA guidelines suggest people consume no more than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium daily. (People with prehypertension and hypertension should limit their intake to 1,500 mg.) But the average person consumes about 50% more — 3,500 mg per day — with a higher intake among men.
        Excess sodium in your bloodstream signals your kidneys to hold on to more water. The extra fluid can cause high blood pressure and lead to cardiovascular disease.
        Shopping tip: Choose low-salt versions of packaged foods. Many products, including soups, crackers, and canned vegetables and beans, come in low-salt, reduced-salt, or no-added-salt versions. ""Even bread can contain high amounts of sodium in a single slice,"" says Rimm. Select items with 150 mg or less of sodium per serving. For nuts, choose unsalted.
        Fiber
        A high-fiber diet helps keep body weight under control and lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Research has also linked eating enough dietary fiber with a reduced risk of heart disease and diabetes. Adequate fiber improves digestion, supports the immune system, and reduces symptoms in many people with irritable bowel syndrome. Men older than age 50 should consume 30 grams of fiber per day. However, most people consume, on average, only about half that amount.
        Shopping tip: There are two types of fiber: insoluble and soluble. Rimm suggests focusing on getting both kinds. ""This means loading up on whole plant foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains."" Most men can meet their daily fiber requirement from two to four servings of fruit; two to five servings of vegetables, whole grains, and legumes; and one to two servings of nuts and seeds.
        
          
            
              
                Look closer at food labels
                Added sugars are identified on a product's ingredient label. They often are called by names other than ""sugar."" Here are the ones you should look for, according to The Nutrition Source, a resource from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health:
                
                  agave nectar
                  brown sugar
                  cane crystals
                  cane sugar
                  coconut sugar
                  corn sweetener
                  corn syrup
                  crystalline fructose
                  dextrose
                  evaporated cane juice
                  fructose
                  fruit juice concentrates
                  glucose
                  high-fructose corn syrup
                  honey
                  invert sugar
                  malt sugar
                  malt syrup
                  maltose
                  maple syrup
                  molasses
                  raw sugar
                  sucrose
                
              
            
          
        
        Added sugars
        Added sugars refers to sugars and syrups in food products and beverages that increase sweetness and texture and extend shelf life. (This differs from natural sugar in fruit, vegetables, and dairy.) Research suggests that increased intake of added sugars is linked with obesity and cardiovascular disease.
        Shopping tip: It's easy to predict high amounts of added sugars in products like sodas, cookies, and cakes. But many other seemingly innocent items, such as tomato sauce, yogurt, granola bars, and breakfast cereals, also have a lot of added sugars.
        Labels now list added sugars under total sugar, so it's easier to know how much is included. ""One teaspoon of sugar is equal to 4 grams, so that is something to keep in mind when looking at the amount of added sugar,"" says Rimm.
        Also, note the number of grams of added sugar per serving and how much constitutes one serving. ""The label might say 5 grams per serving, which is low, but you might typically eat three or four servings, so you will end up consuming 15 to 20 grams of added sugar,"" says Rimm.
        You can also check the ingredients list of a food product to find added sugars. (See ""Look closer at food labels."") ""Especially avoid foods that list multiple forms of sugar or include a sugar among the first three ingredients,"" says Rimm.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ready-to-give-up-the-lead-vest-202403183025,Ready to give up the lead vest?,"At a dental appointment last month, I spotted a lead vest hanging unassumingly on the wall of the exam room as soon as I walked in. ""Still there, but now obsolete,"" I thought.
        I'd just learned about new guidelines from the American Dental Association (ADA) saying lead vests and thyroid collars that cover the neck are no longer needed during dental x-rays. But they'd been a fixture of my dental experiences — including many cavities, four root canals, a tooth extraction, and two crowns — for my entire life. What changed, and could I feel safe without the vest?
        Why were lead vests used in past years?
        Lead vests and thyroid collars have been worn by countless Americans during dental x-rays over the years. They've been in use for far longer than my lifetime — about 100 years. The heavy apron-like shields are placed over sensitive areas, including the chest and neck, before the x-rays are taken.
        ""I haven't worn a lead apron in the last 10 or 15 years — unless a dentist insists I put it on — because I know it isn't needed,"" says Dr. Bernard Friedland, an associate professor of oral medicine, infection, and immunity at Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
        What has changed about dental x-rays?
        When lead vests and thyroid collars were first recommended, x-ray technology was much less precise. But the technology has evolved significantly over the last few decades in ways that dramatically improve patient safety:
        
          Digital x-rays enable far smaller radiation doses, reducing radiation exposure and the risks associated with higher doses, such as cancer. ""The doses used in dental radiology are negligibly small now. If you go to the dentist today for a full series of mouth x-rays that are taken with a digital sensor, the total exposure time is just over five seconds,"" explains Dr. Friedland, an expert in oral radiology. ""A hundred or so years ago, that exposure time would have been many minutes.""
          The small size of today's x-ray beam significantly reduces radiation ""scatter"" and restricts the beam size to only the area needing to be imaged. This protects patients from radiation exposure to other parts of the body.
        
        A less-recognized strike against using lead vests and thyroid collars is their ability to get in the way. They may block the primary x-ray beam, preventing dentists from capturing needed images. This quirk can lead to repeat imaging and unnecessary exposure to additional radiation. This is more likely to occur with panoramic x-rays.
        The gear may also spread germs, Dr. Friedland notes. Although disinfected, it's not sterilized between uses. ""There's a risk of spreading bacteria and viruses,"" he says. ""To me, that's also an issue and another reason I don't want to use one on myself.""
        Who no longer needs the shields?
        No one does — even children, who presumably have a long life of dental x-rays in front of them. The new recommendations apply to all patients regardless of age, health status, or pregnancy, the ADA says.
        The recommendation to discontinue lead vests has been a long time in the making. In fact, the ADA isn't the first professional organization to propose it. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine did so in 2019, followed by the American College of Radiology in 2021 and the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology in 2023.
        Are some people confused or concerned about the no-lead-vest policy?
        Yes. The new guidelines are bound to draw confusion and fear, Dr. Friedland says. Some people may even insist on continuing to wear a lead vest during x-rays.
        ""A big problem is that people's perception of risk is very skewed,"" he says. ""Some people, you'll never convince.""
        People are likely to feel more comfortable if the practice is uniformly adopted by dentists. However, the ability to implement this change may hinge partly on public response. And it could take a while to fully adopt.
        ""I think the public is going to have more say on this than dentists,"" Dr. Friedland says. ""It might take a generation to make this change, maybe longer.""
        Still concerned about the new recommendations?
        If you have lingering concerns about the new recommendations, talk to your dentist.
        And ask if dental x-rays are necessary to proceed with your diagnosis or treatment plan. Sometimes it's possible to take fewer x-rays — such as bitewing x-rays of the upper and lower back teeth only — or to use certain types of imaging less frequently. Even with far safer x-ray conditions, dentists should be able to justify that the information from images is integral to diagnose problems or improve care, Dr. Friedland says.
        It's worth noting that the dose of radiation, while far lower than in the past, varies with the type of imaging and which parts of the jaw are being imaged. For example, the digital dental x-rays mentioned above involve less radiation than conventional dental x-rays. Either panoramic dental x-rays, or 3-D dental x-rays taken with a CBCT system that rotates around the head, typically involve more radiation than conventional dental x-rays.
        Whenever possible, dentists should use images taken during previous dental exams, according to the ADA. ""If I don't need an x-ray, I don't get one,"" says Dr. Friedland. ""I'm not cavalier about it. I also use technical parameters that keep the x-ray dose as low as reasonably possible.""",Maureen Salamon,"March 18, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/when-should-your-teen-or-tween-start-using-skin-products-202403113024,When should your teen or tween start using skin products?,"Social media and stores are full of products that promise perfect skin. Increasingly, these products are being marketed not just to adults but to teens and tweens. Many are benign, but some can cause skin irritation — and can be costly. And even if these products are benign, does buying them support unhealthy notions about appearance and beauty?
        It's worth looking at this from a medical perspective. Spoiler alert: for the most part teens and tweens do not need specialized skin products, especially expensive ones. But let's talk about when they may make sense.
        When can a specialized skin product help tweens and teens?
        So, when should your child buy specialized skin products?
        
          When their doctor recommends it. If your child has a skin condition that is being treated by a doctor, such as eczema or psoriasis, over-the-counter skin products may help. For example, with eczema we generally recommend fragrance-free cleansers and moisturizers. Always ask your doctor which brands to choose, and get their advice on how best to use them.
          If they have dry and/or sensitive skin. Again, fragrance-free cleansers are a good idea (look for ones recommended for people with eczema). So are fragrance-free, non-irritating moisturizers (look for creams and ointments rather than lotions, as they will be more effective for dry skin). If you have questions, or if the products you are buying aren't helping, check in with your doctor.
        
        What about skin products for acne?
        It's pretty rare to go through adolescence without a pimple. Many teens aren't bothered by them, but if your child is bothered by their pimples or has a lot of them, it may be helpful to buy some acne products at your local pharmacy.
        
          Mild cleansers tend to be better than cleansers containing alcohol. You may want to check out cleansers intended for dry skin or eczema.
          Over-the-counter acne treatments usually contain benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, azelaic acid, or alpha-hydroxy acids. Adapalene can be helpful for more stubborn pimples.
          Steer away from astringents or exfoliants, which tend to irritate the skin.
          Talk to your doctor about what makes the most sense for your child — and definitely talk to them if over-the-counter products aren't helpful. There are many acne treatments available by prescription.
        
        Ask questions and help dispel myths
        If your teen or tween doesn't fall into one of these groups, chances are they don't need anything but plain old soap and water and the occasional moisturizer if their skin gets dry.
        If your child has normal, healthy skin yet is asking for or buying specialized skin products, ask them why. Do your best to dispel the inevitable marketing myths — like that the products will prevent problems they do not have. Let them know that should a problem arise, you will work with them — with the advice of their doctor — to find and buy the best products.
        Use it as an opportunity, too, to talk about self-image and how it can be influenced by outside factors. This is an important conversation to have whether or not your child is pining for the latest cleanser they see on Instagram. Helping your child see their own beauty and strengths is a key part of parenting, especially for a generation raised on social media.","Claire McCarthy, MD","March 11, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/demystifying-hyperpigmentation-causes-types-and-effective-treatments,"Demystifying hyperpigmentation: Causes, types, and effective treatments","Disorders of skin darkening, also known as hyperpigmentation, are one of the most common complaints in dermatology offices. While hyperpigmentation is not harmful to your health, discoloration on the skin can be alarming and emotionally distressing.
        What is hyperpigmentation?
        Hyperpigmentation refers to skin that darkens in comparison to its natural color. These patches of discoloration can develop anywhere on the skin, but are most often seen on sun-exposed areas such as the face, neck, chest, tops of the arms and hands, and shins.
        Based on your skin complexion, these areas can appear brown, tan, pink, gray, black, or even purple. As opposed to a suntan, which comes and goes, hyperpigmentation tends to be more longstanding, although areas may lighten or fade with time and treatment.
        Causes of hyperpigmentation
        Hyperpigmentation occurs when skin cells produce too much melanin, the protein pigment that colors our skin and hair.
        This may occur due to hereditary factors, medical conditions, medications, and external influences. Common causes include:
        
          sun exposure
          genetics
          hormonal fluctuations, such as during pregnancy
          medications, including certain antibiotics and drugs that cause increased sensitivity to the sun
          exposure to heavy metals, such as iron, arsenic, gold, iron, and lead
          oral contraceptive pills
          tobacco smoke
          diabetes and thyroid disease
          adrenal insufficiency, including Addison's disease, in which the body does not produce enough of the hormone cortisol
          certain dermatological conditions, including acne and atopic dermatitis
          skin injury or inflammation.
        
        If you have any areas of hyperpigmentation that are more than one color, or that do not respond to treatment, make an appointment with a dermatologist. Your doctor will evaluate the site and perform a skin biopsy if necessary.
        Types of hyperpigmentation
        The most common types of hyperpigmentation are harmless skin spots that can occur during childhood, pregnancy, or develop with age. Other types can be due to underlying disorders or previous skin trauma. Examples include:
        
          Freckles. Also called ephelides, these are small tan or brown spots that usually develop in childhood on sun-exposed skin. Freckles become darker and more numerous with time spent in the sun and heat, and usually fade during the winter months.
          Age spots (solar lentigines). These spots vary from tan to dark brown and are larger than freckles. They develop in adults due to sun exposure or previous sunburns, on areas such as the face, forearms, chest, and tops of the hands.
          Melasma. Usually occurring in females in their 20s and 30s, this condition causes irregular dark patches to occur on the face. Melasma can be caused by both sun exposure and female hormonal influences.
          Maturational hyperpigmentation. Usually affecting the sides of the face, this type of hyperpigmentation refers to gradual darkening of sun-exposed skin in people with darker skin complexions. Typically, this occurs in adulthood because of chronic sun exposure or metabolic disease.
          Periorbital hyperpigmentation. Also referred to as dark circles, this is skin darkening that occurs around the eyes.
          Acanthosis nigricans. A condition that causes darkening of the skin in areas that rub together, such as the armpits, groin, and back of the neck. This is most commonly seen in association with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.
          Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Discoloration due to skin inflammation or injury, such as burns, wounds, acne, or skin rashes. The skin looks darker or changes in color after the lesion heals.
        
        Hyperpigmentation of the face: Common areas and triggers
        The face is one of the most common areas in which hyperpigmentation occurs. The specific location depends on the type of hyperpigmentation. Common types of hyperpigmentation on the face include:
        
          Melasma
	Common areas: cheeks, upper lip, and foreheadTriggers: sun exposure, pregnancy, and hormonal factors, including oral contraceptive pills
          Freckles and sunspots
	Common areas: can occur anywhere on the faceTriggers: sun exposure
          Maturational hyperpigmentation
	Common areas: sides of the faceTriggers: aging, sun exposure, genetic influences, and metabolic disease
          Periorbital hyperpigmentation
	Common areas: upper and lower eyelidsTriggers: sun exposure, genetic factors, certain drugs, and hormonal causes
          Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation

        Topical therapies (creams and lotions applied to the skin) are the most common treatment option for hyperpigmentation. Combination therapy, in which multiple topical treatments are used together, is usually most effective in treating hyperpigmentation.
        The most common cause of hyperpigmentation is sun exposure. The body darkens the skin to protect it from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, the best preventative treatment for hyperpigmentation is daily use of sunscreen and sun-protective clothing.
        Other over-the-counter topical remedies include:
        
          retinol-based skin care products
          azelaic acid gel
          vitamin C
          vitamin B3 (niacinamide)
          kojic acid
          salicylic acid
          glycolic acid
          thiamidol
          arbutin
          transexamic acid.
        
        Certain vitamins and antioxidants can also be helpful for hyperpigmentation. These include vitamins A, B, C, and E, obtained either from food or supplements. Natural oils including rosehip, jojoba, and argan oil, and extracts including turmeric, green tea, licorice, and mulberry, may help with skin brightening and inflammation.
        Other treatment options include:
        
          prescription lightening creams containing hydroquinone, tranexamic acid, tretinoin, topical steroids, or a combination of these ingredients
          chemical peels
          laser therapies
          microneedling.
        
        Contact your doctor before beginning any new medication or treatment. If your hyperpigmentation is due to a medical condition, your doctor may be able to prescribe medications to help. If you are pregnant, discuss pregnancy-safe treatment options with your doctor.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","March 11, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/dyshidrotic-eczema-effective-management-strategies,Dyshidrotic eczema: Effective management strategies,"Dry, cracked, or itchy hands are a common occurrence when the outer layer of your skin is damaged. When this itching is accompanied by small, fluid-filled blisters on the sides of the fingers — and occasionally the feet — it may indicate a skin condition called dyshidrotic eczema. In fact, the condition accounts for 5% to 20% of cases of hand eczema.
        What is dyshidrotic eczema?
        Dyshidrotic eczema, also known as pompholyx, is a skin condition that causes extremely itchy bumps and watery blisters to form on the hands and feet. Dyshidrotic eczema is a subset of eczema. The skin eruption can occur in those with a history of eczema, or in response to irritants on the skin.
        Signs and symptoms of dyshidrotic eczema
        Symptoms of dyshidrotic eczema develop on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, sides of fingers or toes, and often affect both sides of the body. Common signs and symptoms include:
        
          small fluid-filled bumps known as vesicles, often described as having a ""tapioca-like"" appearance
          blisters
          intense itching or a prickling sensation, often occurring before the rash appears
          peeling skin and discoloration after the blisters have popped and dried out.
        
        Symptoms often appear suddenly, and recurrence is common. With time the affected skin can become red, thickened, and cracked. Skin infections can also occur, typically presenting as weeping skin with yellow-colored crusting.
        Common triggers of dyshidrotic eczema
        The cause of dyshidrotic eczema is unknown. It's often seen in people with a history of eczema, and in relation to certain triggers.
        Factors often associated with dyshidrotic eczema include:
        
          exposure to metals, such as nickel or cobalt
          exposure to irritating chemicals, such as with certain occupations (for example, metalworkers and hairdressers)
          excessive sweating
          smoking
          exposure to ultraviolet light
          warm weather
          stress.
        
        Dyshidrotic eczema treatment options
        There are both over-the-counter and prescription medications available for the treatment of dyshidrotic eczema. First-line therapy usually involves topical eczema creams or ointments that are applied to the skin. Your dermatologist may prescribe oral and injectable medications in severe cases.
        Treatment options include:
        
          topical corticosteroids such as betamethasone and clobetasol
          topical calcinurin inhibitors such as pimecrolimus and tacrolimus
          short courses of oral corticosteroids
          oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as upadacitinib and baricitinib
          dupilumab, an injectable medication used for the treatment of eczema
          oral immunosuppressive medications such as methotrexate
          phototherapy.
        
        Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic if he or she suspects a skin infection.
        Episodes of dyshidrotic eczema usually resolve over the course of a few weeks, even with no treatment. For most people, the condition improves with time and eventually stops.
        Preventing and managing dyshidrotic eczema flare-ups: Practical tips
        While treatment options can help manage the episodic flares of dyshidrotic eczema, there is no cure for the skin condition. You can manage your symptoms and prevent flares through certain lifestyle changes and adopting good skin habits. Practical tips include:
        
          Keep skin clean, dry, and moisturized. Gently clean your hands and feet and dry them thoroughly. Apply moisturizers (emollients) daily and after every hand wash.
          Learn proper handwashing techniques. Prior to washing your hands, remove all jewelry and rings. Soap and water can become trapped beneath jewelry and cause irritation. Wash hands in lukewarm water using a non-fragranced, non-soap cleanser. Hot water, excessive handwashing, and harsh soaps can dry out the skin, as can alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
          Identify and avoid triggers. Direct exposure to allergens and irritants on your skin can trigger flares. Avoid these when possible, or wear gloves to prevent direct contact with your hands.
          Keep your hands protected with gloves. When performing tasks such as dishwashing, wear cotton gloves under water-resistant gloves (such as vinyl gloves). Wear protective gloves while cooking, cleaning, gardening, and outside during cold weather.
          Manage stress. Emotional stress can cause flare-ups. Try stress management techniques such as breathing exercises, meditation, or exercise. Or talk to a therapist.
        
        Home remedies for dyshidrotic eczema relief
        Flares of dyshidrotic eczema can recur despite preventive strategies. You can try various home remedies and natural treatments for relief. For example:
        
          Vaseline (white petrolatum): Apply a thin layer to hands nightly, then cover with cotton gloves.
          Aloe vera: Aloe vera helps to moisturize and soothe the skin, while also providing antibacterial benefits. But avoid gels containing aloe vera, because gels often contain other ingredients that may flare eczema. Pure aloe vera and creams containing aloe vera are a better choice.
          Colloidal oatmeal: Available in both pure powder form, which can be added to warm baths, or as a main ingredient in moisturizers, colloidal oatmeal can help protect the skin barrier and the balance of bacteria on your skin.
          Virgin coconut oil: Provides both moisturizing and anti-inflammatory benefits, which can improve eczema.
          Diluted bleach soaks: Diluted warm water bleach baths or soaks can help treat and prevent bacterial infections and reduce eczema flares. Soak affected areas for five to 10 minutes twice weekly, using one teaspoon of 6% bleach for every gallon of warm water.
          Wet wraps: In cases of extreme itching, moisturizers can be applied to the skin and then wrapped in a damp cotton cloth, followed by a dry cotton garment. Change the wet wrap every few hours or leave it on overnight.
        
        Dyshidrotic eczema on feet: Specific considerations
        While it's more common for dyshidrotic eczema to occur on the hands, it's estimated that up to 25% of people are affected by dyshidrotic eczema on the feet. Common factors that contribute to dyshidrotic eczema flares on the feet include:
        
          excessive sweat and moisture
          excessive friction on the feet, such as from wearing tight-fitting shoes
          shoe materials such as leather, rubber, glues, and adhesives
          certain chemicals used in leather processing.
        
        Practical tips to help with dyshidrotic eczema on the feet include:
        
          Wear socks and shoes made with breathable materials that allow for air circulation, such as cotton, mesh, hemp, or canvas.
          Change socks throughout the day if they become damp.
          Opt for shoes with minimal seams and an open toe box to prevent friction and rubbing.
          Avoid tight-fitting shoes. Consider those with adjustable closures, which can help you control how tightly they fit.
          If possible, look for shoes with moisture-wicking inserts, or wear sandals.
        
        If you cannot identify your triggers, or your symptoms are worsening despite treatment, see a dermatologist. Your doctor may test for fungal infection, or perform allergy testing to pinpoint specific triggers.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","March 8, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/stepping-up-activity-when-winter-slows-you-down-202403043021,Stepping up activity if winter slowed you down,"If you've been cocooning due to winter's cold, who can blame you? But a lack of activity isn't good for body or mind during any season. And whether you're deep in the grip of winter or fortunate to be basking in signs of spring, today is a good day to start exercising. If you're not sure where to start — or why you should — we've shared tips and answers below.
        Moving more: What's in it for all of us?
        We're all supposed to strengthen our muscles at least twice a week and get a total at least 150 minutes of weekly aerobic activity (the kind that gets your heart and lungs working). But fewer than 18% of U.S. adults meet those weekly recommendations, according to the CDC.
        How can choosing to become more active help? A brighter mood is one benefit: physical activity helps ease depression and anxiety, for example. And being sufficiently active — whether in short or longer chunks of time — also lowers your risk for health problems like
        
          heart disease
          stroke
          diabetes
          cancer
          brain shrinkage
          muscle loss
          weight gain
          poor posture
          poor balance
          back pain
          and even premature death.
        
        What are your exercise obstacles?
        Even when we understand these benefits, a range of obstacles may keep us on the couch.
        Don't like the cold? Have trouble standing, walking, or moving around easily? Just don't like exercise? Don't let obstacles like these stop you anymore. Try some workarounds.
        
          If it's cold outside: It's generally safe to exercise when the mercury is above 32° F and the ground is dry. The right gear for cold doesn't need to be fancy. A warm jacket, a hat, gloves, heavy socks, and nonslip shoes are a great start. Layers of athletic clothing that wick away moisture while keeping you warm can help, too. Consider going for a brisk walk or hike, taking part in an orienteering event, or working out with battle ropes ($25 and up) that you attach to a tree.
          If you have mobility issues: Most workouts can be modified. For example, it might be easier to do an aerobics or weights workout in a pool, where buoyancy makes it easier to move and there's little fear of falling. Or try a seated workout at home, such as chair yoga, tai chi, Pilates, or strength training. You'll find an endless array of free seated workout videos on YouTube, but look for those created by a reliable source such as Silver Sneakers, or a physical therapist, certified personal trainer, or certified exercise instructor. Another option is an adaptive sports program in your community, such as adaptive basketball.
          If you can't stand formal exercise: Skip a structured workout and just be more active throughout the day. Do some vigorous housework (like scrubbing a bathtub or vacuuming) or yard work, climb stairs, jog to the mailbox, jog from the parking lot to the grocery store, or do any activity that gets your heart and lungs working. Track your activity minutes with a smartphone (most devices come with built-in fitness apps) or wearable fitness tracker ($20 and up).
          If you're stuck indoors: The pandemic showed us there are lots of indoor exercise options. If you're looking for free options, do a body-weight workout, with exercises like planks and squats; follow a free exercise video online; practice yoga or tai chi; turn on music and dance; stretch; or do a resistance band workout. Or if it's in the budget, get a treadmill, take an online exercise class, or work online with a personal trainer. The American Council on Exercise has a tool on its website to locate certified trainers in your area.
        
        Is it hard to find time to exercise?
        The good news is that any amount of physical activity is great for health. For example, a 2022 study found that racking up 15 to 20 minutes of weekly vigorous exercise (less than three minutes per day) was tied to lower risks of heart disease, cancer, and early death.
        ""We don't quite understand how it works, but we do know the body's metabolic machinery that imparts health benefits can be turned on by short bouts of movement spread across days or weeks,"" says Dr. Aaron Baggish, founder of Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital's Cardiovascular Performance Program and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        And the more you exercise, Dr. Baggish says, the more benefits you accrue, such as better mood, better balance, and reduced risks of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and cognitive decline.
        What's the next step to take?
        For most people, increasing activity is doable. If you have a heart condition, poor balance, muscle weakness, or you're easily winded, talk to your doctor or get an evaluation from a physical therapist.
        And no matter which activity you select, ease into it. When you've been inactive for a while, your muscles are vulnerable to injury if you do too much too soon.
        ""Your muscles may be sore initially if they are being asked to do more,"" says Dr. Sarah Eby, a sports medicine specialist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. ""That's normal. Just be sure to start low, and slowly increase your duration and intensity over time. Pick activities you enjoy and set small, measurable, and attainable goals, even if it's as simple as walking five minutes every day this week.""
        Remember: the aim is simply exercising more than you have been. And the more you move, the better.",Heidi Godman,"March 4, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/foods-high-in-fiber-boost-your-health-with-fiber-rich-foods,Foods high in fiber: Boost your health with fiber-rich foods,"You may have heard that adding high-fiber foods to your diet can keep your digestive system regular. But fiber can do much more to improve your health, such as lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels and helping with weight loss, too.
        Understanding fiber in your diet
        Fiber is a type of carbohydrate found mainly in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes (beans and peas). Your digestive system turns most carbs you eat into sugar. But fiber is different. It passes through your body without being broken down.
        There are two types of fiber:
        
          Soluble fiber dissolves in water and forms a type of gel in your stomach and colon that slows down your digestion and helps you feel full.
          Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water and typically remains whole as it passes through your digestive system. It helps to clear out your colon and improve your gut health.
        
        How much fiber do you need?
        According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025, the recommended amount of fiber that adults should get in their diet varies by gender and age. (Recommendations also vary for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.)

        Fiber naturally exists in the plants that we eat. Some manufacturers add it to the food they produce for added health benefits. You can see how much fiber packaged foods contain by reading the Nutrition Facts label. Dietary fiber is listed there under Total Carbohydrates.
        Although fiber is an essential part of a healthy diet, most Americans don't get enough of it.
        Benefits of a high-fiber diet
        An important role of dietary fiber is to prevent constipation and support the movement of food through your body. Fiber adds bulk and absorbs water, which makes stool softer and easier to pass.
        But fiber supports health in other ways, including:
        
          Controlling blood sugar: Fiber-rich foods may keep blood sugar levels steady instead of causing them to spike.
          Protecting heart health: Fiber may protect against heart disease in a number of ways, from fighting inflammation to helping keep blood pressure and cholesterol levels in check.
          Helping to manage weight: Fiber helps you feel full for a longer time and can keep you from overeating.
        
        Large studies have had mixed results about whether a fiber-rich diet reduces the risk of colorectal cancer. The evidence is stronger for whole grains, which are rich in fiber; increasing consumption of whole grains is associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer.
        Which foods are high in fiber?
        Fiber supplements are readily available, but it's best to get your fiber from food. That's because foods high in fiber also contain vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients your body needs.
        Foods high in fiber include legumes, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts and seeds.
        Legumes
        Many people think ""beans"" and ""legumes"" mean the same thing, but there's a difference. While all beans are legumes, not all legumes are beans.
        Legumes come from plants that grow their seeds in a pod. Peas and lentils are examples of high-fiber, non-bean legumes.

        Whole grains
        There's a difference between whole grains and refined grains. Whole grains contain the entire grain, which includes bran and germ, while refined grains have been processed in a way that removes the bran and germ. Whole grains are an excellent source of fiber.
        You can't tell which foods are whole grain just by color. Check to see if ""whole"" or ""whole grain"" appears as one of the first three ingredients on the ingredient list.

        Tips for increasing fiber in your diet
        There are easy ways to get more fiber in your diet:
        
          Slice up raw vegetables to keep in your refrigerator as snacks.
          Choose whole-grain cereal or a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast, and top it with berries or almonds.
          Add beans, shredded carrots, and a sprinkling of nuts and seeds to your salad.
          Include a piece of fruit or vegetable as part of each meal.
          Switch from white rice to brown and from white bread to whole-grain.
          Try whole-wheat pasta instead of regular.
          Experiment with international dishes that use whole grains and legumes, such as Middle Eastern cuisines.
          Try to eat some fiber-rich foods with each of your daily meals.
        
        Adding fiber in your diet too quickly can cause digestive side effects like bloating and constipation. If you need to boost your fiber intake, increase it slowly, over time. And drink plenty of water, which can help fiber pass through your digestive system without stomach distress.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","March 4, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/are-you-eating-enough-protein,Are you eating enough protein?,"Age-related muscle loss, called sarcopenia, is a natural part of aging. After age 30, men begin to lose as much as 3% to 5% of their muscle mass per decade, and most will lose about 30% during their lifetimes.
        Strength training and protein are two ways to build muscle mass and combat sarcopenia. With strength training, many experts recommend progressive resistance training, where you gradually amp up your workout volume — weight, reps, and sets — as your strength and endurance improve.
        This constant challenge builds muscle and helps prevent plateaus where you start losing the gains. (Enlist a personal trainer to help you set up a detailed sequence and supervise your initial workouts to ensure you perform the exercises safely.)
        Muscles also need fuel, and that's where protein comes in. The body breaks down dietary protein into amino acids, which it uses to build muscle. ""Men need adequate protein in their diet to increase and maintain muscle mass as well as assist their body when it must recover from surgery or injuries,"" says Dr. Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology with Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        Protein by the numbers
        Despite this need, there's a good chance aging men don't get their optimal daily protein intake, especially if they also are cutting calories to lose weight. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of protein is 0.8 gram per kilogram of body weight, or about 0.36 gram per pound. For a 180-pound man, that is approximately 65 grams of protein per day. According to many experts, most Americans meet and even exceed this amount. Still, some estimates suggest that approximately 10% to 25% of older adults consume less than the RDA. And aging men — especially those trying to build muscle mass — may need more protein than the guidelines recommend.
        In fact, a review of current research published in the June 2023 issue of The Journals of Gerontology: Series A suggested older adults may benefit from consuming 1 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily (about 82 to 130 grams for a 180-pound man) to help increase muscle strength.
        However, according to Dr. Hu, you should be careful about consuming very high amounts per day — 2 grams per kilogram of body weight or more. ""Some studies have shown that too much protein is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases and mortality,"" he says.
        
          
            
              
                Timing your protein
                Research suggests that the body can make use of only 20 to 40 grams of dietary protein at one time. ""So there is no benefit from getting most of your daily protein from one meal,"" says Dr. Frank Hu with Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Instead, try to evenly distribute your protein over breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. Also, to maximize muscle growth and improve recovery, consume a portion of your daily protein within 30 minutes to one hour after your strength training workout, through either a drink or a meal.
              
            
          
        
        The best sources
        The first step to merging protein with strength training is to get a realistic estimate of how much protein you consume daily. ""People tend to over- or underestimate how much they actually eat,"" says Dr. Hu. He suggests tracking your protein intake with each meal for a week to get a daily average. ""Make sure to read labels and assess your protein per serving as accurately as possible, and don't guess at amounts.""
        Once you have a general idea of your usual intake, you can increase it as needed. Dr. Hu recommends that your protein should focus on high-quality food sources, like lean poultry, fish, dairy, and plant-based foods, such as soy, legumes, nuts, and whole grains. (Some people may need to avoid common high-protein food sources like meat, eggs, or dairy due to health concerns or dietary restrictions.)
        Here are some examples of how much protein you can get from typical servings of high-quality protein foods:
        
          3.5 ounces lean chicken (31 grams)
          3.5 ounces salmon (24 grams)
          1 cup cooked beans (about 18 grams)
          6 ounces plain yogurt (17 grams)
          1 cup skim milk (9 grams)
          ¼ cup nuts (7 grams)
          1 egg (6 grams)
        
        Another option is whey protein powder or vegan powders made from soy, peas, or brown rice. (The exact amount of protein per serving varies by brand.) Powders are a useful choice if you have trouble getting enough protein from foods. They can be added to oatmeal and smoothies, or stirred into a glass of water. ""Because powders come with measuring scoops, they can help you track how many protein grams you add to your daily diet,"" says Dr. Hu.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/hitting-the-activity-mark,Hitting the activity mark,"When it comes to staying healthy, just how much exercise is enough? The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, recommend a minimum of 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity as well as two muscle-strengthening workouts per week. (Alternatively, you also can do half that amount — 75 minutes per week of activity — but at a more vigorous intensity.)
        Organizations like the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association also support these guidelines, which have been the standard for over a decade. ""However, it is important to remember that these guidelines are meant for a broad population, and for many older adults, hitting just the 150 minutes per week poses a challenge,"" says Dr. George Ross Malik, a sports medicine physician with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        What's in a number?
        While both physical activity and muscle strengthening are important, experts tend to place more emphasis on the 150 minutes per week, since it helps keep people active and less sedentary. ""Some research has suggested that people who regularly sit more than seven hours a day with limited activity have a higher mortality risk, similar to that posed by obesity and smoking,"" says Dr. Malik.
        So where did the number 150 come from? ""When scientific advisory committees and other experts combed the body of evidence linking exercise with chronic conditions like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease, a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity was repeatedly seen as the threshold for offering health benefits,"" says Dr. Malik. ""People who regularly met this criterion often had a lower risk for disease and risk factors like weight gain, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure."" (Regular activity may also improve brain and sexual health.)
        But the key word here is minimum. The guidelines set the low end at 150 minutes, and research has found that going beyond this number offers additional benefits.
        Individual needs
        Dr. Malik says that the 150-minute target is good to aim for, but your best regimen ultimately depends on your physical condition and goals.
        ""Everyone is built differently and has different health concerns, which can dictate what is an effective and safe amount of activity,"" he says. ""For instance, people returning from an injury or with notable health issues may need to exercise for less time or less intensity until they build strength and endurance. It may even be as subtle as simply increasing your daily step count totals at first."" Your fitness goals also play a role. Older men may need to focus more on strength training (doing more than the recommended two days per week) to help offset sarcopenia, the natural loss of muscle mass. Or they may need to do more stretching, flexibility, and balance exercises to address range-of-motion and mobility issues.
        ""Consulting your doctor or a personal trainer can help you establish specific fitness goals and determine how much activity you require,"" says Dr. Malik.
        Break it up
        While the 150 weekly minutes is still a mark older adults should strive for, the number can feel daunting. Instead of focusing on the entire 150 minutes, break it down into manageable segments, suggests Dr. Malik. For example, 150 minutes equals 30 minutes done five days a week. Another option is to divide those 30 minutes into even smaller segments. ""You don't have to do the entire 30 minutes at once to reap the benefits,"" says Dr. Malik. ""Try doing 10 minutes of exercise three times a day, or two workouts of 15 minutes each.""
        You also need not do the same activity every time. ""You can always squeeze in moderate-intensity activity throughout the day,"" says Dr. Malik. For instance, hold planks during TV commercials, go for a walk after lunch, and do counter push-ups or squats in the kitchen while waiting for the coffee to brew. Everyday activities like yard work and household chores also count toward your daily number, says Dr. Malik.
        Another strategy is to focus on diversity. Find new activities of interest that can supplement your usual routine. For example, join a recreational sports league or pickleball group, or do a Peloton workout or take a yoga class.
        As for doing shorter amounts of higher-intensity activity to meet your quota, Dr. Malik suggests this is a level that should be reached with preparation and adequate training. ""It is important to reduce the risk of injuries by working gradually toward this more advanced type of exercise and incorporating cross-training to avoid overuse injuries,"" he says.
        The bottom line is that while it is good to be mindful about reaching 150 weekly minutes, don't focus on the number itself, but rather on living a healthier lifestyle. ""If necessary, begin with doing a smaller amount, like 50 minutes per week, and progress from there,"" says Dr. Malik. ""Ultimately, it is about reducing sedentary time, staying active, and enjoying what you do. If you focus on that, you'll gradually reach the 150 minutes consistently and likely even exceed it.""

        Because being overweight takes a toll on your cardiovascular health, it's worth keeping tabs on your weight. Some evidence suggests that daily weight checks may help people lose weight or at least avoid weight gain, but weekly weigh-ins are also reasonable. Compared with an analog scale, which shows weight using a pointer on a dial, a digital scale that displays numbers is more accurate and easier to read. To go one step further, you might upgrade to a smart scale, which can connect to your smartphone using an app, so you can record and track your weight over time.
        Many smart scales also feature a technology called bioelectrical impedance analysis. It sends a small current through your bare feet to try to estimate your body fat, muscle mass, and water weight. However, the accuracy — and relevance — of those readings isn't well established. And although you can't feel the current, people who have a pacemaker or defibrillator should not use this feature.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/spring-cleaning-prioritize-your-fridge-and-pantry,Spring cleaning? Prioritize your fridge and pantry,"With spring's arrival, maybe you're planning to attack those dusty baseboards, smeared windows, and cluttered closets. But if you've been neglecting your refrigerator and pantry, these hard-working storage areas should take priority — and they need far more than annual cleaning to help you avoid food-borne illnesses, Harvard experts say.
        It's not a minor threat. Each year, an estimated one in six Americans — 48 million people — get sick from germs in food, according to the CDC. About 128,000 of them are hospitalized and 3,000 die as a result of food-borne illness.
        Spring cleaning offers an opportunity not only to thoroughly scour your home, but also to give your fridge and pantry — which can harbor harmful bacteria — more than just a cursory swipe of a sponge. In the process, you can purge dated and possibly contaminated products from overlooked corners.
        Think of it this way: these chambers don't just house your food; they also protect it—and you, by extension.
        ""It's tough to compare this to spring cleaning, because certainly I'd recommend cleaning out your refrigerator and pantry way more than once a year,"" says Cynthia Parenteau, associate director of public health in the Department of Environmental Health and Safety at Harvard University, who specializes in food safety. ""Personally, I do it once a week. Every time new groceries go in, I make sure anything that's expired goes out, and I move older food to the front.""
        Dangerous complications
        Food-borne illnesses result from microbes or toxins that contaminate foods or drinks. More than 30 pathogens (disease-causing agents), including Salmonella, norovirus, Listeria, Escherichia coli, and bacteria that cause botulism, are known to travel in food. Raw or undercooked poultry or meat, raw eggs, unpasteurized milk or dairy products, raw fruits and vegetables, and foods prepared in large batches kept at unsafe temperatures are vehicles for these pathogens.
        Some lucky folks manage to skirt the consequences of eating germ-laden foods, while others develop food poisoning and suffer through symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, intense stomach cramps, and fever.
        ""The majority of us eventually get a food-borne illness,"" says Parenteau's colleague Marykate Franks, a senior environmental public health officer. ""Most people associate it with the last thing they ate, though that may not be the case. If we're lucky, we feel crummy for a day or two, rebound, and write it off.""
        While food poisoning symptoms often resolve without problem, infections spread by food can have lasting, dangerous consequences. They sometimes lead to conditions such as arthritis, meningitis, kidney damage, or brain and nerve damage. (See ""When should you see a doctor for food poisoning?"") Parenteau notes that certain people — including pregnant women, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems — are susceptible to worse cases and more serious outcomes.
        Cleaning strategies
        How can you better protect yourself? Parenteau and Franks recommend these tips to tackle your refrigerator and pantry:
        Take everything out. Approach your food clean-out with the same commitment as you would a closet purge. Completely emptying your fridge and pantry allows you to appraise each item for safety as well as inspect the inside of each space. ""Even with something as simple as cleaning out your pantry, you'll find a wayward cheese puff at the back or a pile of cracker crumbs,"" Franks says. ""You also have to be alert for mice or flour weevils that might be really intrigued by what you have in your cabinets.""
        Wash everything thoroughly. Pull out all shelving and clean every surface with food-safe sanitizer spray. (For a homemade version, Harvard experts suggest blending one tablespoon of unscented liquid chlorine bleach with a gallon of water.) Pay particular attention to any spills or dried, sticky areas. Make sure surfaces are dry before putting anything back.
        Check expiration dates. Toss all expired food or drink items, as well as those whose containers are rusted or leaking. If you don't know the expiration date, a rule of thumb suggests keeping opened refrigerated items for seven days or less. ""This is a good opportunity to go through your refrigerator and pull out all the Tupperware and leftover restaurant containers and make way for new stuff,"" Parenteau says.
        Use your senses. Expiration dates differ from sell-by or best-used-by dates, which only suggest freshness. This is often applicable to items such as condiments and salad dressings. If those dates have only recently passed, check the product's appearance and smell for signs of decay. ""If something doesn't quite smell right or the color of the food is off, trust your instincts,"" Franks says. ""Better safe than sorry.""
        Pay attention to packaging. Generally, unopened or vacuum-packed foods will stay fresher longer. But once they're opened, the clock starts. ""The date to use a product by becomes pretty confusing when you see a freshness date a month or two down the road but you've already opened it,"" Parenteau says. She advises using a marker to note on the package the date you unsealed it. Then keep it for only another seven days — especially packaged deli meats or hot dogs.
        Avoid cross-contamination. Keep raw meat, seafood, and eggs separate from ready-made foods so germs don't spread. Store these items in sealed containers so juices don't leak onto other foods. And if your refrigerator features dedicated meat and produce drawers, use them only for those items. ""You don't want juices that leak from chicken or beef packages getting on produce or food items that are not going to be cooked,"" Parenteau says.
        
          
            
              
                When should you see a doctor for food poisoning?
                In most cases, food poisoning symptoms are mild enough to ride out without medical attention. But certain symptoms should prompt a doctor's evaluation, according to the CDC. These include
                
                  bloody diarrhea or diarrhea lasting longer than three days
                  fever over 102° F
                  vomiting so frequently you can't hold liquids down
                  signs of dehydration, such as dry mouth and throat, scant urination, and dizziness upon standing.
                
              
            
          
        
        Don't forget your freezer. Since the whole purpose of freezing food is to keep it from spoiling, the freezer doesn't need as much attention as the refrigerator. But take a look at its contents every few weeks and weed items out. ""Everyone is guilty of sticking something in the back of the freezer, saving it for a rainy day, and forgetting about it,"" Franks says. ""It's good to pull that stuff out to check if it expired and assess if it's worth keeping.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/regular-exercise-improves-brain-regions-linked-with-memory,Regular exercise improves brain regions linked with memory,"Science has shown that one of the benefits of exercise is better brain health, including a lower risk for dementia, but researchers have not known why. A study published online Dec. 7, 2023, by the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease may offer an explanation.
        The study examined MRI brain scans of 10,125 people with no health issues, average age 52, more than half of whom were men. Approximately 75% reported engaging in moderate or vigorous exercise like walking, running, or participating in sports, an average of four days per week.
        The scans showed that this group had larger brain volumes in several key areas, such as the hippocampus and the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes, compared with people who exercised less than this amount or not at all.
        These brain regions are responsible for cognitive skills such as memory and learning. Over all, the exercisers also had larger volumes of gray matter, which helps process information, and white matter, which connects brain regions.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/toothbrushing-can-be-a-literal-lifesaver-in-the-hospital,Toothbrushing can be a literal lifesaver in the hospital,"Regular toothbrushing can help save hospital patients' lives during their stays in intensive care units (ICUs), according to a Harvard study published online Dec. 18, 2023, by JAMA Internal Medicine. Researchers combined the results of 15 randomized clinical trials that included about 2,800 ICU patients and found that twice-a-day toothbrushing was associated with lower rates of death compared with not regularly brushing.
        Patients who had their teeth brushed daily also had shorter ICU stays and spent less time on a mechanical ventilator. (Since ICU patients are often unable to brush on their own, toothbrushing was done by the hospital care team.) The reason? Regular toothbrushing appears to protect ICU patients from getting pneumonia, the most common ICU-acquired infection, according to the researchers. While the trials did not focus on non-ICU patients, the researchers added that regular toothbrushing might offer similar protection from pneumonia during regular hospital stays, but more research is needed.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/fighting-fatigue,Fighting fatigue,"Here are some tips to help you get your energy back.
        
        
          
        
        If you have felt like you are dragging lately, you may be wondering what is going on. Fatigue is a common symptom that can be caused by a whole host of factors, from medical conditions and stress to poor sleep.
        The good news is that in many cases you can make changes that will help bring your energy back, but you need to get to the root of the problem in order to treat it.
        Fatigue triggers
        Part of the challenge when it comes to a general symptom like fatigue is that it's so commonplace and can be triggered by so many different things. This makes it hard to pinpoint what's causing the problem. However, there are a few main culprits that often cause fatigue.
        Stress. Some people have reported feeling increasingly fatigued these days. This might be the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic — or more specifically, of the stress it has caused. Changing responsibilities, added work, struggles with child care, financial pressures, and reduced social opportunities are just some of the stressors people now face. And chronic stress can lead to fatigue. When you are under stress, it can cause levels of a hormone called cortisol to rise, which can trigger problems sleeping as well as feelings of anxiety and other symptoms.
        Hormonal changes. In women, hormonal changes can contribute to shifts in metabolism and sleep disturbances, which lead to fatigue. A decline in female hormones, such as estrogen, during the menopause transition may induce hot flashes, which can lead to broken sleep. Hot flashes are brief episodes during which your body feels like it's overheating. They can last for a few seconds or minutes. During a hot flash, your skin may flush, and you may start to sweat. If these occur at night, they can make it hard to sleep soundly and leave you dragging the next day.
        Problems associated with the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of your neck that regulates your metabolism, may also cause fatigue. When the thyroid gland is underactive and produces inadequate levels of thyroid hormone (a condition called hypothyroidism), it can make you feel tired, in addition to other symptoms. Women are more likely than men to have thyroid disease, and incidence rises with age.
        Your diet. If you are not eating a well-balanced diet, it may result in vitamin deficiencies that can sap your energy. Two of the more common ones are vitamin D and vitamin B12 deficiencies. Fatigue is also sometimes brought on by dehydration.
        Poor sleep habits or sleep disorders. Perhaps the most obvious reason you might be feeling tired is that you are not getting adequate sleep. Sometimes this results from bad sleep habits. Staying up late at night, too much screen time — those habits can definitely affect people's energy level. People who have work schedules that require staying up all night may also have difficulty getting a consistent block of time to achieve restful, deep sleep. But inadequate sleep can also be caused by insomnia or poor sleep quality triggered by stress, or sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea. If you have obstructive sleep apnea, tissues in your throat relax during sleep, periodically blocking your airway, causing breathing interruptions that disrupt sleep.
        Medical conditions and medications. Fatigue may be the predominant symptom in people with depression. Numerous medical conditions, including infections, anemia, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, neurological conditions, and autoimmune conditions also cause fatigue. Certain medications can also make people feel tired or drowsy.
        Overcoming fatigue
        If you are experiencing fatigue that lasts for more than a day or two, try to determine what is causing you to feel so tired and then test different solutions to see if they help.
        Make lifestyle changes. If you suspect that lifestyle factors, such as poor sleep or eating habits, are causing your fatigue, work on improving your diet and focusing on following good sleep practices at night. (See ""How to get a better night's sleep."")
        Fatigue may also be brought on by a sedentary lifestyle, so it is important to make sure you are getting enough physical activity. While it can be a challenge to get moving if you are tired all the time, exercise can help you feel better if you give it a chance. As with any type of behavioral change, recognize that it may feel too difficult. Try to break things down into small, achievable goals. For example, you might start by doing two minutes of exercise a day, and then after a few days increase it to five minutes, and then 10 minutes, she says. Getting more physical activity into your day can also help you sleep more soundly at night.
        Check your medications. Fatigue may be caused by certain medications. If you are taking a new medication and suddenly experience fatigue, reach out to your doctor.
        Promote calm. If anxiety or stress is triggering your symptoms, paying attention to your mental health should be a priority. Cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness meditation practice, and stress reduction strategies can help.
        
          
            
              
                How to get a better night's sleep
                If you are experiencing sleep disturbances, improving your sleep habits may help. Strategies to try include the following:
                
                  Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.
                
                Avoid electronic devices at least two hours before bed, because the light from these devices may disturb your body's natural sleep clock.
                
                  Sleep in a quiet, dark, cool space.
                
                
                  Avoid caffeine late in the day.
                
                Get regular exercise. 
                Avoid alcohol before bed. Alcohol may help you fall asleep faster, but it generally results in more fragmented sleep, and sleep quality in people who are alcohol users tends to be worse.
                However, if these strategies do not help, and the sleep problems you are experiencing are frequent and affect your daily life, it is time to visit your health care professional.
              
            
          
        
        Seeing your doctor
        However, not all causes of fatigue are treatable on your own. You may need to pay a visit to your primary care provider. Warning signs for fatigue include severe or persistent symptoms or when it interferes with your ability to function. If this is the case, it may be time to make an appointment to get checked out.
        Your clinician will want information about your diet, physical activity, sleep habits, stress level, and mood. He or she will do a physical exam and likely order blood tests to rule out anemia or a thyroid disorder. If your fatigue is being caused by an underlying medical condition, treating it can often help you get your energy back.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/band-together-for-stronger-legs-202107082537,Band together for stronger legs,"A personal trainer friend of mine once said that legs are one of the best tools for building legs. His point: don't underestimate the power of your own body weight for improving lower body strength. Many basic body weight exercises like squats and lunges work well for this, but sometimes you need to further challenge your muscles. These fantastic four resistance band exercises will help you build a better lower body.
        Why use resistance bands for lower body strength?
        Sure, you can perform these moves while holding dumbbells or kettlebells, but a better equipment choice may be a resistance band. Bands are lightweight, easy to use, and — perhaps best of all — can be added to a wider variety of of exercises that work the legs. Plus, by adjusting their tautness, you can make small changes in their resistance to fit your needs. This is not easily done with hand weights that can be either too light or too heavy.
        Which bands should you use to give your leg workouts a lift?
        There are several types of resistance bands available. For the following exercises, you should use bands made from a single length of stretchy material (one brand is TheraBand) with the ends tied together to make a loop, or use a solid rubber band loop. Both types of bands are usually color-coordinated based on their thickness. In general, yellow is the thinnest and easiest to use, followed by red, green, blue, and black, but this can vary depending on the brand.
        All four exercises are done while standing up and holding onto the back of a chair for balance. For each exercise, do eight to 12 reps on each leg to complete one set. Perform up to two sets with a minute rest in between. To make the moves more challenging, increase the band's resistance by adjusting its length or doing more reps (up to 20).
        Want a full body workout? Try adding the upper body exercises in my previous post on resistance bands.
        Standing side leg lift (outer thighs and hips)
        Starting position: Loop the band around both calves. Stand behind a chair with your feet together. Hold on to the back of a chair with one or both hands for stability.
        Movement: Shift your weight to your left leg. Keep your right leg straight and slowly lift it to the side against the band's resistance until your foot is about six to 12 inches off the floor. Don't lean to the side as you lift your leg. Return to the starting position to complete one rep. Be sure to lower your leg slowly, so the band does not jerk your leg back down.
        Standing hamstring curl (backs of thighs)
        Starting position: Loop one end of the band around your right calf. Loop the other end around the middle of your left foot and stand on it. Stand behind a chair with your feet together and lightly hold on to the back of the chair with one or both hands for stability.
        Movement: Bend your right knee and bring your heel toward your right buttock as high as possible against the band's resistance. Don't move your hips or arch your back as you lift your leg. Slowly lower your foot to the floor. This is one rep.
        Hip extension (buttocks and backs of thighs)
        Starting position: Place the loop around both calves. Stand behind a chair with your feet together. Hold the back of the chair with one or both hands.
        Movement: Shift your weight to your left leg. Keep your right leg straight and slowly lift it behind you against the band's resistance until your foot is about six to 12 inches off the floor. Don't move your hips or arch your back as you lift your leg. Tighten the buttock of your standing leg for stability throughout the move. Return to the starting position to finish one rep.
        Soccer kick (inner thighs)
        Starting position: Place one end of the loop around an anchor point that is low to the ground, such as the leg of a heavy piece of furniture like a couch. Stand so the anchor point is to your left side and put your left leg in the loop. Stand up straight next to a chair with your feet together. Hold on to the back of a chair with one hand.
        Movement: Tighten your abdominal muscles. Lift your left foot and slowly sweep it diagonally in front of you against the band's resistance, as if kicking a soccer ball with the inside of your foot. Hold for a moment, then slowly bring your foot back to the left side. This is one rep. Keep your hips even and maintain a neutral posture throughout.",Matthew Solan,"February 27, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/resistance-bands-3-great-ways-to-build-upper-body-strength-202105182458,Resistance bands: 3 great ways to build upper body strength,"Resistance bands are not impressive-looking exercise tools, but they definitely can pull their weight. During a recent gym training session, my workout routine began with several sets of bicep curls. But before I could reach for the dumbbell rack, my personal trainer dropped a resistance band at my feet.
        Really? This thin, lightweight, flimsy-looking thing is going to help strengthen my arms?
        I was skeptical, but after a few sets of speed curls where I did 20 reps as fast as possible, my arms burned and twitched like nothing I usually felt with traditional grip-and-curl dumbbells.
        Don't get me wrong, I love my dumbbells, kettlebells, and barbells. But mixing it up with different equipment and challenging my muscles in a new way added a jolt to my sometimes-mundane exercise ritual.
        By the session's end, I was a resistance band groupie.
        What types of resistance bands are available?
        There are several types of resistance bands. The most common type is a single length of stretchy material. Another kind is a closed loop that resembles a giant rubber band. A third type is a thin rubber tube with handles.
        One significant advantage of resistance bands compared with weights is that they provide variable levels of resistance. This is particularly helpful in instances when you're stuck between weights that are either too light or too heavy. You increase resistance in different ways, depending on the type of band you're using:
        
          When using lengths of stretchy material, you can change resistance by adjusting your hand position to shorten or increase the length. Colors also may be used to show different levels of resistance from easiest to hardest.
          The rubber band types are color coordinated based on the thickness and level of resistance they offer. Yellow is often the lightest and easiest to use, followed by red, green, blue, and black. (This may vary depending on the brand.)
          The tube with handles is often used for standing exercises. You adjust the resistance by how close or far apart you place your feet when standing on the tube. Tubes come in different thicknesses to provide less resistance or more resistance.
        
        Bands provide many benefits
        Bands are easy to store and use if you follow provided directions, watch videos of band workouts, or learn a band workout from a class or personal trainer.
        They can prepare your muscles for the many types of movements you make throughout the day, such as when you stretch, bend, lift, or simply rise from a chair. In addition, training with bands improves muscle power, which helps you avoid falls and risk of injury.
        Bands are especially helpful if you have trouble gripping or holding dumbbells, or need greater control when doing exercises, such as if you're recovering from an injury or dealing with joint pain.
        Three great resistance band moves for upper body strength
        Ready to join the band? Here are three resistance band moves that can help build your chest, back, shoulders, and arms. For these, use the basic stretchy material band, which is readily found online.
        
          Chest punches
        
        Starting position: Place the exercise band around your back and under your armpits. Hold an end in each hand by your shoulders.
        Movement: With control, punch your right arm out in front of you on a slight diagonal across your body. Repeat with left arm. That's one rep.
        Muscles worked: Chest
        Reps: 8 to 12
        
          Two-hand pull-down
        
        Starting position: Hold a band over your head with your hands about 12 to 16 inches apart.
        Movement: Bend your elbows and pull your hands down, stretching the band, to about chest level. Slowly raise your arms back overhead to the starting position.
        Muscles worked: Back, shoulders
        Reps: 8 to 12
        
          Biceps curl
        
        Starting position: Place the middle of the band under one foot with the opposite foot slightly behind it to help you balance. Hold an end of the band in each hand with your arms down at your sides, palms facing forward.
        Movement: Bend your elbows and raise your hands toward your shoulders. Keep your upper arms stationary and your elbows close to your body. Slowly lower to the starting position.
        Muscles worked: Front of upper arms

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/chest-workouts-exercises-for-strength-and-function,Chest workouts: Exercises for strength and function,"Chest exercises are an important way to build upper body strength. Strengthening the muscles making up the chest can help you achieve a strong, sculpted physique. But building the chest muscles offers a myriad of benefits beyond looking toned.
        What are the benefits of chest exercises?
        Your chest muscles — pectoralis major and pectoralis minor — allow you to rotate your shoulders and bring them in and forward. They also stabilize your shoulders, which allows you to move your arms up, down, in, and out. Your chest muscles are important for everyday activities such as pushing open a door, pushing a grocery cart, or lifting a child up from the floor. They're also crucial for performing sports such as swimming, baseball, or tennis.
        Like the back muscles, strong chest muscles are important for good posture. And building up your chest muscles can help improve shoulder stability and reduce your risk of shoulder injury.
        Strength training exercises for a stronger chest
        Chest exercises, whether performed with body weight, free weights, or resistance bands, are a form of strength training. Strength training is exercise that builds muscles using resistance. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, adults ages 18 to 64 should perform a complete strength training routine two or three times a week.
        Strength training not only makes you stronger, but offers a wide range of other health benefits, including:
        
          increasing your metabolic rate
          curbing muscle loss and building new muscle
          slowing bone loss
          improving insulin sensitivity
          easing joint pain.
        
        When adding chest exercises to your exercise routine, remember to exercise muscles throughout the body for a well-rounded strength program. In addition, try to balance strength training with other forms of exercise such as aerobic activity, flexibility exercises, and (for older adults) balance exercises.
        With all exercise programs, check with your doctor before you begin.
        Sample chest workout
        You can work the muscles of the chest with exercises that incorporate barbells, medicine balls, dumbbells, kettlebells, or cable pulleys. But you can also work chest muscles with no or minimum equipment, or even your own body weight for resistance.
        The exercises below can help strengthen your chest muscles. When you are training for strength, aim for eight to 12 repetitions or ""reps."" If you cannot do all the reps at first, just do what you can, and then gradually increase reps as you improve. Beginners can start with one set of reps (one set on each side in the case of wood chops), working up to three sets as you get stronger. Rest 30 to 90 seconds between sets.
        Chest punches
         
        Starting position: Place the exercise band around your back and under your armpits. Hold an end in each hand by your shoulders.
        Movement: With control, punch your right arm out in front of you on a slight diagonal across your body. Slowly bring it back to the starting position. Repeat with your left arm. That's one rep.
        Chest press
         
        Starting position: Stand tall with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Place a band across your upper back and under your arms. Hold each end with your arms bent, elbows pointing out and your hands by your armpits, palms down.
        Movement: Extend your arms straight out in front of you at chest height, stretching the band. Slowly bend your arms and return to the starting position, resisting the pull of the band.
        Wood chop
        
           
        
        Starting position: Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell with both hands. Hinge forward at your hips and bend your knees to sit back into a slight squat. Rotate your torso to the right and extend your arms to hold the dumbbell on the outside of your right knee.
        Movement: Straighten your legs to stand up as you rotate your torso to the left and raise the weight diagonally across your body and up to the left, above your shoulder, while keeping your arms extended. In a chopping motion, slowly bring the dumbbell down and across your body toward the outside of your right knee. This is one rep. Finish all reps, then repeat on the other side. This completes one set.
        Kneeling push-up
        
           
        
        Starting position: Begin on the floor on all fours with your hands slightly more than shoulder-width apart. Walk your hands forward and lower your hips so your body is at a 45° angle to the floor and forms a straight line from head to knees.
        Movement: Bend your elbows out to the sides and slowly lower your upper body toward the floor until your elbows are bent about 90°. Press against the floor and straighten your arms to return to the starting position.
        Squat and overhead toss
        
          
            
          
           
          
            
          
        
        Starting position: Stand tall with your feet about shoulder-width apart, toes pointed out slightly. Hold a medicine ball with both hands at chest height, arms bent.
        Movement: Bend your hips and knees, and squat down. Don't let your knees move farther forward than your toes. Press into your heels to stand back up. As you rise, toss the ball overhead and catch it, bringing it back to chest height.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/one-more-reason-to-brush-your-teeth-202402263019,One more reason to brush your teeth?,"Maybe we should add toothbrushes to the bouquet of flowers we bring to friends and family members in the hospital — and make sure to pack one if we wind up there ourselves.
        New Harvard-led research published online in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests seriously ill hospitalized patients are far less likely to develop hospital-acquired pneumonia if their teeth are brushed twice daily. They also need ventilators for less time, are able to leave the intensive care unit (ICU) more quickly, and are less likely to die in the ICU than patients without a similar toothbrushing regimen.
        Why would toothbrushing make any difference?
        ""It makes sense that toothbrushing removes the bacteria that can lead to so many bad outcomes,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, an instructor in oral health policy and epidemiology at Harvard School of Dental Medicine, who wasn't involved in the new research. ""Plaque on teeth is so sticky that rinsing alone can't effectively dislodge the bacteria. Only toothbrushing can.""
        Pneumonia consistently falls among the leading infections patients develop while hospitalized. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, each year more than 633,000 Americans who go to the hospital for other health issues wind up getting pneumonia. Air sacs (alveoli) in one or both lungs fill with fluid or pus, causing coughing, fever, chills, and trouble breathing. Nearly 8% of those who develop hospital-acquired pneumonia die from it.
        How was the study done?
        The researchers reviewed 15 randomized trials encompassing nearly 2,800 patients. All of the studies compared outcomes among seriously ill hospitalized patients who had daily toothbrushing to those who did not.
        
          14 of the studies were conducted in ICUs
          13 involved patients who needed to be on a ventilator
          11 used an antiseptic rinse called chlorhexidine gluconate for all patients: those who underwent toothbrushing and those who didn't.
        
        What were the findings?
        The findings were compelling and should spur efforts to standardize twice-daily toothbrushing for all hospitalized patients, Dr. Jiang says.
        Study participants who were randomly assigned to receive twice-daily toothbrushing were 33% less likely to develop hospital-acquired pneumonia. Those effects were magnified for people on ventilators, who needed this invasive breathing assistance for less time if their teeth were brushed.
        Overall, study participants were 19% less likely to die in the ICU — and able to graduate from intensive care faster — with the twice-daily oral regimen.
        How long patients stayed in the hospital or whether they were treated with antibiotics while there didn't seem to influence pneumonia rates. Also, toothbrushing three or more times daily didn't translate into additional benefits over brushing twice a day.
        What were the study's strengths and limitations?
        One major strength was compiling years of smaller studies into one larger analysis — something particularly unusual in dentistry, Dr. Jiang says. ""From a dental point of view, having 15 randomized controlled trials is huge. It's very hard to amass that big of a population in dentistry at this high a level of evidence,"" she says.
        But toothbrushing techniques may have varied among hospitals participating in the research. And while the study was randomized, it couldn't be blinded — a tactic that would reduce the chance of skewed results. Because there was no way to conceal toothbrushing regimens, clinicians involved in the study likely knew their efforts were being tracked, which may have changed their behavior.
        ""Perhaps they were more vigilant because of it,"" Dr. Jiang says.
        How exactly can toothbrushing prevent hospital-acquired pneumonia?
        It's not complicated. Pneumonia in hospitalized patients often stems from breathing germs into the mouth — germs which number more than 700 different species, including bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microbes.
        This prospect looms larger for ventilated patients, since the breathing tube inserted into the throat can carry bacteria farther down the airway. ""Ventilated patients lose the normal way of removing some of this bacteria,"" Dr. Jiang says. ""Without that ventilator, we can sweep it out of our upper airways.""
        How much does toothbrushing matter if you're not hospitalized?
        In case you think the study findings only pertain to people in the hospital, think again. Rather, this drives home how vital it is for everyone to take care of their teeth and gums.
        About 300 diseases and conditions are linked in some way to oral health. Poor oral health triggers some health problems and worsens others. People with gum disease and tooth loss, for example, have higher rates of heart attacks. And those with uncontrolled gum disease typically have more difficulty controlling blood sugar levels.",Maureen Salamon,"February 26, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-alkaline-water-better,Is alkaline water better?,"Question:
          Is alkaline water better for you than plain water?
        
        Answer: The simple answer is no. There is not any evidence to support choosing bottled or home-treated alkaline water over safe tap water or regular bottled water.
        To better understand what is meant by alkaline water, let's start with a review of pH. This is a measure of the acid-base balance of a fluid. The range of pH is zero to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral.
        A pH above 7 means the fluid is alkaline (basic) and a pH below 7 is acidic. The higher the pH number the more alkaline it is, and the lower the number the greater the acidity. For reference, the normal pH of our blood is slightly alkaline, with a range of 7.35 to 7.45. The fluid in the human stomach is very acidic, with a usual pH of 1.5 to 3.5.
        The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that town water pH should range between 6.5 and 8.5, with most town water averaging around 7.5. Common bottled waters are usually close to neutral at a pH of 7.0. Bottled alkaline water has a higher pH between 8 and 9.
        Because the fluid in the stomach is so acidic, once regular or alkaline water gets down to your stomach there will be little difference in the resulting stomach fluid pH. You could potentially raise the stomach fluid pH by drinking a lot of alkaline water, but it would only be temporary. Even if you drank enough alkaline water to slightly raise the pH of your blood, your kidneys would quickly go into action to rebalance your blood pH.
        One potential benefit of alkaline water is to provide symptom relief of heartburn from acid reflux. But again, this would only be temporary. There are much more effective options, such as antacids and drugs that block stomach acid production.
        There are possible disadvantages from drinking alkaline water with pH levels above 9. The water will likely have a bitter taste. And for people who regularly take stomach acid production blockers called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to maintain a higher stomach pH, drinking strong alkaline water could be dangerous. Adding alkaline water could raise that pH even more and might result in an increased blood pH, which can alter the normal blood levels of chemicals like potassium, especially if they have kidney disease.","Howard E.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-sleeping-with-an-eye-mask-improve-learning-and-alertness-202402213017,Does sleeping with an eye mask improve learning and alertness?,"All of us have an internal clock that regulates our circadian rhythms, including when we sleep and when we are awake. And light is the single most important factor that helps establish when we should feel wakeful (generally during the day) and when we should feel sleepy (typically at night).
        So, let me ask you a personal question: just how dark is your bedroom? To find out why that matters — and whether sleeping in an eye mask is worthwhile — read on.
        How is light related to sleep?
        Our circadian system evolved well before the advent of artificial light. As anyone who has been to Times Square can confirm, just a few watts of power can trick the brain into believing that it is daytime at any time of night. So, what's keeping your bedroom alight?
        
          A tablet used in bed at night to watch a movie is more than 100 times brighter than being outside when there is a full moon.
          Working on or watching a computer screen at night is about 10 times brighter than standing in a well-lit parking lot.
        
        Light exposure at night affects the natural processes that help prepare the body for sleep. Specifically, your pineal gland produces melatonin in response to darkness. This hormone is integral for the circadian regulation of sleep.
        What happens when we are exposed to light at night?
        Being exposed to light at night suppresses melatonin production, changing our sleep patterns. Compared to sleeping without a night light, adults who slept next to a night light had shallower sleep and more frequent arousals. Even outdoor artificial light at night, such as street lamps, has been linked with getting less sleep.
        But the impact of light at night is not limited to just sleep. It's also associated with increased risk of developing depressive symptoms, obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Light exposure misaligned with our circadian rhythms — that is, dark during the day and light at night — is one reason scientists believe that shift work puts people at higher risk for serious health problems.
        Could sleeping with an eye mask help?
        Researchers from Cardiff University in the United Kingdom conducted a series of experiments to see if wearing an eye mask while sleeping at night could improve certain measures of learning and alertness.
        Roughly 90 healthy young adults, 18 to 35 years of age, alternated between sleeping while wearing an eye mask or being exposed to light at night. They recorded their sleep patterns in a sleep diary.
        In the first part of the study, participants wore an intact eye mask for a week. Then during the next week, they wore an eye mask with a hole exposing each eye so that the mask didn't block the light.
        After sleeping with no light exposure (wearing the intact eye mask) and with minimal light exposure (the eye mask with the holes), participants completed three cognitive tasks on days six and seven of each week:
        
          First was a paired-associate learning task. This helps show how effectively a person can learn new associations. Here the task was learning related word pairs. Participants performed better after wearing an intact eye mask during sleep in the days leading up to the test than after being exposed to light at night.
          Second, the researchers administered a psychomotor vigilance test, which assesses alertness. Blocking light at night also improved reaction times on this task.
          Finally, a motor skill learning test was given, which involved tapping a five-digit sequence in the correct order. For this task, there was no difference in performance whether participants had worn an intact eye mask or been exposed to light at night.
        
        What else did the researchers learn?
        No research study is ever perfect, so it is important to take the conclusions above with a grain of salt.
        According to sleep diary data, there was no difference in the amount of sleep, nor in their perceptions of sleep quality, regardless of whether people wore an eye mask or not.
        Further, in a second experiment with about 30 participants, the researchers tracked sleep objectively using a monitoring device called the Dreem headband. They found no changes to the structure of sleep — for example, how much time participants spent in REM sleep — when wearing an eye mask.
        Should I rush out to buy an eye mask before an important meeting or exam?
        If you decide to try using an eye mask, you probably don't need to pay extra for overnight shipping. Instead, follow a chronobiologist's rule of thumb: ""bright days, dark nights.""
        
          During the daytime, get as much natural daylight as you possibly can: go out to pick up your morning bagel from a local bakery, take a short walk during your afternoon lull at work.
          In the evening, reduce your exposure to electronic devices such as your cell phone, and use the night-dimming modes on these devices. Make sure that you turn off all unnecessary lights. Finally, try to make your bedroom as dark as possible when you go to bed. This could mean turning the alarm clock next to your bed away from you or covering up the light on a humidifier.
        
        Of course, you might decide a well-fitted, comfortable eye mask is a useful addition to your light hygiene toolkit. Most cost $10 to $20, so you may find yourself snoozing better and improving cognitive performance for the price of a few cups of coffee.","Eric Zhou, PhD","February 21, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/navigating-hidradenitis-suppurativa,Navigating hidradenitis suppurativa,"Are you struggling with recurrent painful skin lumps or boils in sensitive areas? You may be experiencing symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa, also known as acne inversa.
        What is hidradenitis suppurativa?
        Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes deep, painful lumps and boils to develop on the body. As these lesions heal, new spots develop and can eventually lead to the formation of firm scars. When multiple large lumps form in the same area, they sometimes connect beneath the skin, forming skin tunnels.
        HS affects hair follicles and associated oil and sweat glands. The hair follicles become thickened and plugged, leading to rupture and inflammation.
        HS is believed to be an inherited condition that is influenced by hormonal, environmental, and lifestyle factors. The condition is not contagious and is not due to poor hygiene.
        Recognizing symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa
        As the name acne inversa suggests, the symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa can look like those of acne. But they occur in different areas and can be quite painful. Often starting in one's 20s and 30s, symptoms usually develop on areas of skin that touch or rub together, such as the armpits (the most common site), groin, genitals, upper thighs, breasts, and buttocks. Symptoms include:
        
          deep, painful, inflamed lumps known as nodules
          swollen pus-filled bumps, known asabscesses
          draining skin tunnels, known as sinus tracts
          blackheads, often seen in pairs,known as comedones
          scarring
          dearkened areas of skin, known as hyperpigmentation
          odor.
        
        Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and the course of the disease is highly variable.
        HS can be distinguished from other skin conditions based on the type and location of skin lesions, as well as how long symptoms last. While boils or cysts can occur in isolation and often do not return once treated, HS is long-lasting and the symptoms can return. Your doctor may diagnose HS if three main features are present:
        
          typical lesions: nodules, abscesses, comedones, and/or skin tunnels and scars
          recurrence: more than two lesions over a six-month period
          typical areas: primary occurrence in skin areas that rub or touch, and the condition usually affects both sides of the body.
        
        Hidradenitis suppurativa treatments
        Treatment options for hidradenitis suppurativa depend on the extent and severity of symptoms, as well as individual factors and preferences. Treatments range from topical preparations applied to the skin to oral and injectable medications. HS is usually managed by a dermatologist.
        There are both over-the-counter and prescription treatments available. For example:
        
          topical antiseptic washes such as chlorhexidine and benzoyl peroxide
          topical antibiotics such as clindamycin
          oral antibiotics such as doxycycline and minocycline
          resorcinol, a topical chemical peeling agent
          metformin, a diabetes medication
          injectable immune system–modifying drugs such as adalimumab and infliximab
          laser therapies.
        
        A dermatologist can also perform an in-office procedure. These include:
        
          incision and drainage of inflamed abscesses
          steroid injections
          surgical removal of inflamed lesions or scars.
        
        Your hormones can influence HS symptoms, and certain treatments can target this effect. For example, your doctor can prescribe treatments such as topical clascoterone and oral spironolactone that target certain hormone receptors. In addition, certain types of birth control can improve symptoms, while others may cause worsening. Females with HS should discuss this with their dermatologist or ob/gyn.
        While treatments may help improve and control the symptoms of HS, there is no cure for the disease. Ongoing treatment and follow-up with your doctor are necessary to manage the condition.
        Lifestyle changes to help manage hidradenitis suppurativa
        Obesity, diabetes, poor diet, tobacco smoking, and skin friction can worsen hidradenitis suppurativa. You can improve your symptoms and potentially prevent development or worsening disease by managing these factors.
        Lifestyle and self-care tips to help manage HS include:
        
          Avoid wearing tight-fitting clothing such as spandex.
          Wear belts and brassiere straps on a loose setting to avoid friction and pressure on the skin.
          Maintain a healthy body composition through diet and exercise.
          Quit smoking.
          Keep affected areas clean and dry.
        
        Research suggests if you have HS you may be at an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from all causes. Therefore, it's important to discuss healthy lifestyle choices with your doctor.
        Managing and coping with hidradenitis suppurativa
        The pain, drainage, odor, and scarring that may develop with HS can be embarrassing and distressing. Learning to manage these symptoms can help.
        Practical tips include:
        
          Use warm compresses to ease pain and promote drainage of inflamed lesions.
          Cover draining areas with loose gauze to absorb pus. Apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly to prevent sticking to bandages or clothing.
          Use an antibacterial wash such as benzoyl peroxide in the shower to help with odor.
          Keep body hair trimmed; hair can trap sweat and bacteria, leading to odor.
          Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) to help with pain and inflammation, in consultation with your doctor.
          Consult with a dermatologist or plastic surgeon regarding options such as laser therapy or surgery to treat scars.
        
        It is also important to develop coping strategies and find a support system to help lessen the burden of emotions you may be experiencing. HS has been linked to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide risk. You may find support from friends and family, your doctor, or a therapist. The HS Foundation also offers information and resources including access to support groups.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","February 21, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/chia-seed-benefits-what-you-need-to-know,Chia seed benefits: What you need to know,"Packed with fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants, tiny chia seeds pack a nutritional punch. From adding them to prepared dishes or as a topping on oatmeal, cereals, or smoothies, you can easily incorporate chia seeds into many foods to give them a nutritious boost.
        What are chia seeds?
        Chia seeds are tiny black or white seeds derived from the Salvia hispanica plant, a member of the mint family native to Central America. These small seeds have been a part of human diets for over 5,000 years. Chia seeds were a staple food for the Aztecs and Mayans.
        Health benefits of chia seeds
        Chia seeds are packed with nutrients that may support numerous health benefits. Among them:
        
          reducing blood pressure
          lowering cholesterol levels
          supporting digestive health
          aiding in weight management
          reducing inflammation
          helping to control diabetes
          protecting against chronic disease
          improving anxiety and depression.
        
        When chia seeds are ingested, they form a gel-like substance in the stomach that can increase your feeling of fullness and decrease your appetite and calorie intake.
        Chia seeds: Nutritional heavyweights
        Chia seeds contain a variety of nutrients including fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and various vitamins and minerals like calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus that are beneficial to your health.
        Omega-3 fatty acids
        Chia seeds are a powerhouse of omega-3 fatty acids. This type of fatty acid is primarily found in fatty fish, nuts, and seeds.
        Omega-3 fatty acids play an important role in brain function, heart health, and reducing inflammation in the body. Incorporating omega-3s into the diet promotes overall well-being, benefiting cardiovascular and cognitive functions.
        Chia seeds are rich in a type of omega-3 fatty acid known as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). The body cannot produce ALA its own, so it must be obtained through food. Consuming ALA has been linked to a decreased heart disease risk.
        Fiber
        Incorporating chia seeds into your diet is also an excellent way to increase your intake of fiber. Just one ounce of chia seeds (two to three tablespoons) provides approximately 9.8 grams of dietary fiber.
        Research has shown that adequate fiber intake is associated with a decreased risk of:
        
          
            coronary heart disease
          
          type 2 diabetes
          several types of cancer
          inflammation
          digestive disorders.
        
        On the heart health front, fiber helps lower LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and helps increase levels of heart-protective HDL cholesterol.
        The fiber in chia seeds can also aid healthy digestion by softening the stool and providing bulk to it. This allows the stool to pass more quickly through the intestines and can help alleviate constipation.
        Antioxidants
        Chia seeds are packed with antioxidants including tocopherols, phytosterols, carotenoids, and polyphenolic compounds. Antioxidants play a crucial role in protecting the body from damage caused by free radicals, which can build up in the body and lead to cell damage and disease.
        Thanks in part to their antioxidant content, chia seeds may help protect against:
        
          inflammation
          diabetes
          cancer
          heart disease
          Alzheimer's disease.
        
        Protein
        Chia seeds are also a valuable source of protein. Chia seeds contain all nine essential amino acids. The protein in chia seeds can help stabilize blood sugar levels and provide a steady source of energy.
        How to incorporate chia seeds into your diet
        It's very easy to incorporate chia seeds into your diet. You can simply sprinkle a tablespoon or two on foods such as yogurt, cereal, or salads. You can add chia seeds to smoothies or soups, or mix them into pancake batter or another breakfast food. Chia seeds have a mild flavor, so they are not likely to affect the taste of your food.
        Another popular way to get chia seeds into your diet is to make a simple chia pudding. When mixed with liquid, chia seeds develop a gelatinous coating, expanding in size and creating a pudding-like consistency.
        Chia pudding recipe
        
          
        
        
          Add 2 tablespoons of chia seeds into 1/2 cup of milk (almond, soy, and dairy all work). Use a mason jar or other container with a lid.
          Close the lid tightly and shake well. Wait 10 minutes, then shake again, making sure there aren't any clumps.
          Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes, though overnight or for least four hours will allow the pudding to thicken better.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-drinking-water-before-meals-really-help-you-lose-weight-202402203018,Does drinking water before meals really help you lose weight?,"If you've ever tried to lose excess weight, you've probably gotten this advice: drink more water. Or perhaps it was more specific: drink a full glass of water before each meal.
        The second suggestion seems like a reasonable idea, right? If you fill your stomach with water before eating, you'll feel fuller and stop eating sooner. But did that work for you? Would drinking more water throughout the day work? Why do people say drinking water can help with weight loss — and what does the evidence show?
        Stretching nerves, burning calories, and thirst versus hunger
        Three top theories are:
        Feel full, eat less. As noted, filling up on water before meals has intuitive appeal. Your stomach has nerves that sense stretch and send signals to the brain that it's time to stop eating. Presumably, drinking before a meal could send similar signals.
        
          The evidence: Some small, short-term studies support this idea. For example, older study subjects who drank a full glass of water before meals tended to eat less than those who didn't. Another study found that people following a low-calorie diet who drank extra water before meals had less appetite and more weight loss over 12 weeks than those on a similar diet without the extra water. But neither study assessed the impact of drinking extra water on long-term weight loss.
        
        Burning off calories. The water we drink must be heated up to body temperature, a process requiring the body to expend energy. The energy spent on this — called thermogenesis — could offset calories from meals.
        
          The evidence: Though older studies provided some support for this explanation, more recent studies found no evidence that drinking water burned off many calories. That calls the thermogenesis explanation for water-induced weight loss into question.
        
        You're not hungry, you're thirsty. This explanation suggests that sometimes we head to the kitchen for something to eat when we're actually thirsty rather than hungry. If that's the case, drinking calorie-free water can save us from consuming unnecessary calories — and that could promote weight loss.
        
          The evidence: The regulation of thirst and hunger is complex and varies over a person's lifespan. For example, thirst may be dulled in older adults. But I could find no convincing studies in humans supporting the notion that people who are thirsty misinterpret the sensation for hunger, or that this is why drinking water might help with weight loss.
        
        Exercise booster, no-cal substitution, and burning fat demands water
        Being well-hydrated improves exercise capacity and thus weight loss. Muscle fatigue, cramping, and heat exhaustion can all be brought on by dehydration. That's why extra hydration before exercise may be recommended, especially for elite athletes exercising in warm environments.
        
          The evidence: For most people, hydrating before exercises seems unnecessary, and I could find no studies specifically examining the role of hydration to exercise-related weight loss.
        
        Swapping out high calorie drinks with water. Yes, if you usually drink high-calorie beverages (such as sweetened sodas, fruit juice, or alcohol), consistently replacing them with water can aid weight loss over time.
        
          The evidence: A dramatic reduction in calorie intake by substituting water for higher-calorie beverages could certainly lead to long-term weight loss. While it's hard to design a study to prove this, indirect evidence suggests a link between substituting water for high-cal beverages and weight loss. Even so, just as calorie-restricting diets are hard to stick with over the long term, following a water-only plan may be easier said than done.
        
        Burning fat requires water. Dehydration impairs the body's ability to break down fat for fuel. So, perhaps drinking more water will encourage fat breakdown and, eventually, weight loss.
        
          The evidence: Though some animal studies support the idea, I could find no compelling evidence from human studies that drinking extra water helps burn fat as a means to lose excess weight.
        
        The bottom line
        So, should you bump up hydration by drinking water before or during meals, or even at other times during the day?
        Some evidence does suggest this might aid weight loss, at least for some people. But those studies are mostly small or short-term, or based on animal data. Even positive studies only found modest benefits.
        That said, if you think it's working for you, there's little downside to drinking a bit more water, other than the challenge of trying to drink if you aren't particularly thirsty. My take? Though plenty of people recommend this approach, it seems based on a theory that doesn't hold water.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","February 20, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-of-the-best-exercises-you-can-ever-do,5 of the best exercises you can ever do,"If you're not an athlete or serious exerciser — and you just want to work out for your health or to fit in your clothes better — the gym scene can be intimidating and overwhelming. What are the best exercises for me? How will I find the time?
        Just having to walk by treadmills, stationary bikes, and weight machines can be enough to make you head straight back home to the couch. 
        Yet some of the best physical activities for your body don't require the gym or ask you to get fit enough to run a marathon. These ""workouts"" can do wonders for your health. They'll help keep your weight under control, improve your balance and range of motion, strengthen your bones, protect your joints, prevent bladder control problems, and even ward off memory loss.
        No matter your age or fitness level, these activities are some of the best exercises you can do and will help you get in shape and lower your risk for disease:
        1. Swimming
        You might call swimming the best workout. The buoyancy of the water supports your body and takes the strain off painful joints so you can move them more fluidly. ""Swimming is good for individuals with arthritis because it's less weight-bearing,"" explains Dr. I-Min Lee, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        Research has found that swimming can also improve your mental state and put you in a better mood. Water aerobics is another option. These classes help you burn calories and tone up.
        2. Tai chi
        This Chinese martial art that combines movement and relaxation is good for both body and mind. In fact, it's been called ""meditation in motion."" Tai chi is made up of a series of graceful movements, one transitioning smoothly into the next. Because the classes are offered at various levels, tai chi is accessible — and valuable — for people of all ages and fitness levels. ""It's particularly good for older people because balance is an important component of fitness, and balance is something we lose as we get older,"" Dr. Lee says.
        Take a class to help you get started and learn the proper form. You can find tai chi programs at your local YMCA, health club, community center, or senior center.
        3. Strength training
        If you believe that strength training is a macho, brawny activity, think again. Lifting light weights won't bulk up your muscles, but it will keep them strong. ""If you don't use muscles, they will lose their strength over time,"" Dr. Lee says.
        Muscle also helps burn calories. ""The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn, so it's easier to maintain your weight,"" says Dr. Lee. Similar to other exercise, strength training may also help preserve brain function in later years.
        Before starting a weight training program, be sure to learn the proper form. Start light, with just one or two pounds. You should be able to lift the weights 10 times with ease. After a couple of weeks, increase that by a pound or two. If you can easily lift the weights through the entire range of motion more than 12 times, move up to slightly heavier weight.
        4. Walking
        Walking is simple, yet powerful. It can help you stay trim, improve cholesterol levels, strengthen bones, keep blood pressure in check, lift your mood, and lower your risk for a number of diseases (diabetes and heart disease, for example). A number of studies have shown that walking and other physical activities can even improve memory and resist age-related memory loss.
        All you need is a well-fitting and supportive pair of shoes. Start with walking for about 10 to15 minutes at a time. Over time, you can start to walk farther and faster, until you're walking for 30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week.
        5. Kegel exercises
        These exercises won't help you look better, but they do something just as important — strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder. Strong pelvic floor muscles can go a long way toward preventing incontinence. While many women are familiar with Kegels, these exercises can benefit men too.
        To do a Kegel exercise correctly, squeeze the muscles you would use to prevent yourself from passing urine or gas. Hold the contraction for two or three seconds, then release. Make sure to completely relax your pelvic floor muscles after the contraction. Repeat 10 times. Try to do four to five sets a day.
        Many of the things we do for fun (and work) count as exercise. Raking the yard counts as physical activity. So does ballroom dancing and playing with your kids or grandkids. As long as you're doing some form of aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, and you include two days of strength training a week, you can consider yourself an ""active"" person.

One way to keep muscles in shape is with strength training. But performing muscle-strengthening exercises the wrong way can do more harm than good. Here are some guidelines to help you avoid injury and keep your program on track.
        
          Always warm up and cool down properly.
          Use proper form to avoid injuries and maximize gains. You can learn good form through a class or one-on-one sessions with a certified exercise professional.
          Breathe out when you are lifting or pushing; breathe in as you slowly release the load or weight. Never hold your breath while straining. This action, called the Valsalva maneuver, can temporarily raise your blood pressure considerably and can be risky for people with cardiovascular disease.
          Don't lock your joints; always leave a slight bend in your knees and elbows when straightening out your legs and arms.
          Don't be so eager to see results that you risk hurting yourself by exercising too long or choosing too much weight. And remember that it's important to rest muscles for at least 48 hours between strength training sessions.
          If you've been sick, give yourself one or two days off after recovering. If you were ill for a while, you may need to use lighter weights or less resistance when you first resume exercising.
          Strength training exercises should not cause pain while you are doing them. If an exercise or movement causes significant pain, stop doing it! When performing an exercise, stick with a range of motion that feels comfortable. Over time, try to gradually extend that range.
          Listen to your body and cut back if you aren't able to finish a series of exercises or an exercise session, can't talk while exercising, feel faint after a session, feel tired during the day, or suffer joint aches and pains after a session.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/do-beta-blockers-interfere-with-exercise,Do beta blockers interfere with exercise?,"Q.
           I manage my high blood pressure with hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic) and long-acting metoprolol (a beta blocker). I feel fine, but my heart rate doesn't go up like it used to before I started taking the metoprolol. Does that mean I am not getting as much health benefit whenever I exercise?
        
        A. All beta blockers slow down your heart rate. The slower rate happens at rest and also when you exercise. To get the most from aerobic exercise, you would normally want your heart rate in a moderate-intensity zone for at least 30 minutes most days of the week. Moderate intensity means exercising at a heart rate that is 60% to 75% of your maximum.
        A simple commonly used formula to estimate your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age. An alternative formula has you multiply your age times 0.7 and subtract that from 208. Because there are multiple variables that influence your true maximal heart rate, these are at only estimates, at best.
        According to these equations, if you are 60, your suggested maximum heart rate would be calculated at either 160 or 166, not much difference. But many healthy men around age 60 or older have a higher maximum heart rate and a higher heart rate range while doing moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. For people who take a beta blocker, using either formula probably won't help at all.
        Instead, you can use your breathing to gauge your effort. With moderate-intensity exercise, you should be able to talk, but with pauses to catch your breath. If you are breathing very hard and unable to speak during exercise, you are at high intensity.
        Can beta blockers affect your ability to work out? Studies that have addressed your question have not provided a definitive answer. A competitive athlete's performance likely could be diminished by taking a beta blocker. However, for most of us who exercise to stay healthy, the evidence tilts toward no decrease in benefit, even though you may not hit the standard heart rate goals.
        So, your beta blocker won't prevent you from getting the positive effects of exercise. You will still build muscle, keep your bones strong, and lower your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. You'll also improve your heart's efficiency and endurance.
        If you recently started the beta blocker, you might feel less energetic and even sluggish during your exercise routine. But over time, you should get back to the same sense of fulfillment from working out.
        I took a beta blocker when I was diagnosed with hypertension. I didn't like not having my heart rate to guide my workouts. So, I switched to a drug from a different class of medication that doesn't slow heart rate. However, there may be reasons your doctor specifically wants you on a beta blocker. It's a good question to ask at your next doctor visit.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/fighting-inflammation-with-food,Fighting inflammation with food,"In the fight against chronic inflammation — a state of persistent activation of the immune system — your diet is a powerful weapon. Eating healthy foods helps quiet chronic inflammation, and it benefits your health in other ways (like lowering cholesterol levels). Chronic inflammation often is seen with, and may contribute to, chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline.
        Where do you find inflammation-fighting foods? They're all part of a Mediterranean-style diet, which consists of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, lean proteins, and small amounts of dairy foods and olive oil.
        ""Plant-based foods provide us with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals—plant chemicals that appear to fight free radicals [molecules that damage cells] and may protect our cells against inflammation, cancer growth, and viruses,"" says Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Fish, nuts, and plant oils contain healthy unsaturated fats, which are good for your blood vessels, heart, and brain.""
        Here are some foods that support the quest to keep inflammation in check.
        Berries
        Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries may just seem like sweet treats. But berries are also hardworking inflammation fighters. Berries contain phytochemicals called anthocyanins, which give the fruits their red and purple hues. Anthocyanins have an anti-inflammatory effect on cells and are associated with lower risks of heart disease, cognitive decline, and diabetes.
        Fatty fish
        Fatty fish — such as salmon, tuna, and sardines — are abundant sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. That benefit might be due to reduced inflammation in the body, especially in the blood vessels (protecting them against the buildup of plaque). Some evidence has found that eating fatty fish is associated with lower levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker in the blood.
        Leafy greens
        Green leafy vegetables — such as arugula, chard, kale, and spinach — are loaded with vitamins A, B, C, E, and K, as well as important minerals (iron, magnesium, and potassium) and phytochemicals. Spinach is associated with a reduction in inflammation levels over time, slowed cognitive decline, and reduced risks for coronary artery disease and stroke.
        Nuts and seeds
        Tiny but mighty, nuts and seeds (such as pistachios, almonds, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds) are rich in fiber and other nutrients that help keep your gut bacteria healthy and in turn may help tamp down brain inflammation (see ""Shield your memory from decline""). Certain nuts and seeds — such as walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and hemp seeds — are also good sources of omega-3 fatty acids.
        Tomatoes
        Tomatoes get their superpowers from a phytochemical called lycopene. It not only gives tomatoes their vibrant red color, but also appears to help reduce levels of interleukin-6, a protein that causes inflammation. Tomatoes are also associated with reduced risks for developing heart disease and prostate cancer.
        What to eat
        To get enough foods that fight inflammation, eat at least two servings of fatty fish per week and at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day (two fruits, three vegetables). It's okay to enjoy a handful of nuts or seeds each day. And you'll want to bulk up on fiber sources, such as legumes like beans and lentils (women older than 50 need 21 grams of fiber per day; men need 30 grams per day).
        ""For the most impact, get the widest variety of plant-based foods possible in each meal. For example, make a big green salad with several kinds of greens and colorful vegetables, seeds, berries, and a simple dressing of a little olive oil and vinegar,"" McManus suggests. ""Or cook whole grains such as quinoa or brown rice, and stir in the greens of your choice, beans, and colorful vegetables like carrots, squash, and tomatoes.""
        It's easiest to toss extra plant foods into a meal when you have them on hand. ""If produce seems to spoil faster than you can use it, keep it in your freezer, divided into small amounts. That way, you can reach for fruits and vegetables when you need them,"" says McManus.
        And as much as possible, avoid eating processed foods. They typically contain high amounts of calories, added sugars, unhealthy saturated fats, and salt, and are associated with chronic inflammation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/effective-exercises-for-building-a-strong-back,Effective exercises for building a strong back,"A strong back benefits overall health, well-being, and functionality. Targeted exercises can help you build a strong back and protect against injury.

Why a strong back matters: Strength and injury prevention

From improved posture to protection from injury, enhanced athletic performance, and pain relief, a strong back is crucial to good health.

Your back is made up of different types of specialized muscles that enable you to move your body so you can twist, turn, bend, stand, walk, run, and lift. Strengthening your back muscles can help you perform everyday activities such as putting on your shoes or closing a window. Strong back muscles can also enhance athletic performance in activities such as swimming or climbing.

The major back muscles include:

Upper-back and mid-back muscles


	trapezius: moves your shoulder and shoulder blade
	rhomboid: pulls your shoulder blade back
	latissimus dorsi: pulls your arm down


Low-back muscles


	erector spinae: extends and stabilizes your spine.


Your back not only allows you to move, it also supports you. Along with muscles in the abdomen, sides, pelvis, hips, and buttocks, the back muscles make up your core. Weak core muscles combined with repeat daily activities such as looking down at your smartphone or typing at your computer can lead to poor posture. Fortunately, strengthening the muscles in the back can help you improve postural problems.

Back muscle training may also help protect you from injury and back pain. As with other muscles, the muscles surrounding your spine can weaken with age or lack of exercise, making you more prone to injury and pain.

The back muscles help support the vertebrae, disks, ligaments, and facet joints. Strong back muscles provide essential support to the spine, reducing the likelihood of strains, sprains, and other injuries that can occur during lifting, bending, or twisting movements. Muscle strains and sprains can result from sports, accidents, or even daily chores such as picking up something from the floor. The painful injury can leave you feeling sore and stiff in the back, buttocks, or thighs for weeks, months, or even longer.

Incorporating exercises targeting the back muscles into a well-rounded fitness program can help support long-term musculoskeletal health and protect you from injury and back pain.

Back exercise safety

Consult with your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen, especially if you have not been active recently, or if you have any injuries (especially a history of back pain or injury) or an unstable chronic health condition, including these:


	heart disease (or multiple risk factors for it)
	a respiratory ailment, such as asthma
	high blood pressure
	joint or bone disease
	a neurologic illness
	diabetes
	a joint replacement.


It is important to practice safe exercise strategies whether working out at home or at the gym. Proper form is essential to avoid injury. A physical trainer can advise you on proper positioning and model the exercise for you. Stop the exercise if you ever experience any pain during a movement.

Body-weight back exercises

The body-weight exercises shown below do not require any special equipment.

In general, aim for eight to 12 repetitions or ""reps"" of each exercise. If you cannot do all the reps at first, just do what you can, and then gradually increase reps as you improve. Beginners can start with one set of reps on each side (if applicable), working up to three sets as you develop strength. Rest 30 to 90 seconds between sets.

Bridge



Starting position: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart and parallel to each other. Place your arms at your sides, palms up. Relax your shoulders against the floor.

Movement: Tighten your buttocks, then lift your hips up off the floor as high as is comfortable. Keep your hips even and spine neutral. Return to the starting position.

Side plank



Starting position: Lie in a straight line on your right side. Support your upper body on your right forearm with your shoulder aligned directly over your elbow. Stack your left foot on top of your right foot. Rest your left hand on your side.

Movement: Tighten your abdominal muscles. Exhale as you lift your right hip and right leg off the floor and raise your left arm toward the ceiling. Keeping shoulders and hips in a straight line, balance on your right forearm and the side of your right foot. Hold for 15 to 60 seconds. Return to the starting position. This is one rep. Finish all reps (2-4), then repeat on your left side. This completes one set.

Superman

 

Starting position: Lie face down on the floor with your arms extended, palms down, and your legs extended.

Movement: Simultaneously lift your arms, head, chest, and legs up off the floor as high as is comfortable. Hold. Return to the starting position.

More back strengthening exercises

The following exercises require different kinds of equipment — dumbbells, resistance bands, a medicine ball, or kettlebells.

Dumbbells. Depending on your current strength, you might start with as little as a set of 2-pound and 5-pound weights, or 5-pound and 8-pound weights. Add heavier weights as needed.

Resistance bands. Resistance bands look like big, wide rubber bands and are available in a variety of resistance levels.

Kettlebells. Kettlebells look like a ball or bell with a handle. Unlike dumbbells, which you grip at the center of the mass, you grip kettlebells outside of their center of mass. This requires you to exert more muscle force to control the weight, providing a more challenging workout. The lightest kettlebell is usually 5 pounds.

Medicine balls. Medicine balls are about the size of a soccer ball and come in a variety of weights. You can lift or toss them to work your muscles in new ways. Start with a lightweight ball, about 4 to 8 pounds.

Upper back exercises

Bent-over row

 

Starting position: Stand with a weight in your left hand and a bench or sturdy chair at your right side. Place your right hand and knee on the bench or chair seat. Let your left arm hang directly under your left shoulder, fully extended toward the floor. Your spine should be neutral, and your shoulders and hips squared.

Movement: Squeeze your shoulder blades together, then bend your elbow to slowly lift the weight toward your ribs. Return to the starting position. Finish all reps, then repeat with the opposite arm. This completes one set.

Reverse fly

 

Starting position: Sit on the edge of a chair, holding a weight in each hand. Hinge forward at your hips, bringing your chest toward your thighs and keeping your back in a straight line. Your arms should hang next to your calves with your palms facing toward your body and thumbs pointing forward.

Movement: Squeeze your shoulder blades together, then slowly lift the weights out to the sides until your arms are at about shoulder height. Keep your elbows soft, not locked. Pause, then return to the starting position.

Pull-down

 

Starting position: Stand tall with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Hold a band overhead with your arms extended and your hands about 12 to 18 inches apart.

Movement: Bend your elbows slightly and pull your hands down, stretching the band, to about shoulder level. Slowly raise your arms back overhead to the starting position, resisting the pull of the band.

Lower back exercises

Basic swing

 

Starting position: Stand tall with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Hold a kettlebell with both hands, arms extended down in front of you so the kettlebell hangs between your legs.

Movement: Hinge forward at your hips, shift your weight onto your heels, and sit back, swinging the kettlebell back between your legs. Then press into your heels and stand up as you swing the kettlebell forward to chest height.

Squat and overhead toss

 

Starting position: Stand tall with your feet about shoulder-width apart, toes pointed out slightly. Hold a medicine ball with both hands at chest height, arms bent.

Movement: Bend your hips and knees, and squat down. Don't let your knees move farther forward than your toes. Press into your heels to stand back up. As you rise, toss the ball overhead and catch it, bringing it back to chest height.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/eat-more-fiber-rich-foods-to-foster-heart-health,Eat more fiber-rich foods to foster heart health,"The notion that a diet rich in fiber, particularly from whole-grain foods, could prevent heart disease risk dates back to the 1970s. Evidence to support that idea has been piling up ever since.
        Up to age 50, men should eat 38 grams of fiber per day. After age 50, they should aim for 30 grams daily. The corresponding amounts for women are 25 and 21 grams. But most Americans fall woefully short of these goals, consuming only about 16 grams of fiber per day on average.
        ""As a country, we aren't eating enough fiber,"" says Dr. Cheryl Clark, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. She is the senior author of a study that confirmed the fiber shortfall in the American diet. The study also points to a connection with heart disease. People whose diets are high in fiber are less likely to have problems such as metabolic syndrome, which can be a precursor to diabetes. The condition, which is marked by too much belly fat, high triglycerides, low beneficial HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar, boosts a person's odds of developing diabetes, heart disease, and having a stroke.
        Fiber: Different types and benefits
        Fiber is a carbohydrate that your body can't break down, so it passes through the body undigested. It comes in two varieties: insoluble and soluble. Insoluble fiber is found in whole grains, wheat cereals, and vegetables such as carrots, celery, and tomatoes. Soluble fiber sources include barley, oatmeal, beans, nuts, and fruits such as apples, berries, citrus fruits, and pears. Both types have been linked to heart health.
        Fiber's role in preventing heart disease is thought to stem from its link to lower both blood pressure and cholesterol levels. It also fills you up, which helps you eat less and perhaps lose weight.
        Why haven't people jumped on the fiber bandwagon? There still remains insufficient awareness about the benefits of fiber. Get started by putting put more fiber-rich foods on your shopping list and bringing easy-to-transport whole fruits or nuts with you to snack on when you're out and about.
        Label lingo
        A label can claim a food is a ""good source"" of fiber if it delivers 10% of your daily dose of fiber—about 2.5 grams per serving. The terms ""rich in,"" ""high in,"" or ""an excellent source of"" fiber are allowed if the product contains 5 or more grams of fiber per serving. Spooning up a bowl of high-fiber cereal is one of simplest ways to reach your fiber target. Look for brands with at least 6 grams of fiber per serving. Your best bet for bread? Look for the words ""100% whole wheat"" or ""100% whole grain"" on the label and at least 3 grams of fiber per slice.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/glp-1-diabetes-and-weight-loss-drug-side-effects-ozempic-face-and-more,"GLP-1 diabetes and weight-loss drug side effects: ""Ozempic face"" and more","GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss have proven to be very effective, but they do have side effects. Among those side effects is ""Ozempic face,"" where skin on the face sags and wrinkles. ""Ozempic face"" was coined in reference one of these drugs, although any rapid weight loss can cause it.
        What are GLP-1 drugs and how do they work?
        GLP-1 drugs, also called GLP-1 agonists, are shortened names for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic the GLP-1 hormone that is naturally released in the gastrointestinal tract in response to eating.
        When you eat, your digestive system breaks carbohydrates down into simple sugars that travel through your bloodstream. GLP-1 triggers the release of insulin from your pancreas. Insulin helps usher glucose (sugar) out of the bloodstream and into your cells, where it can be used for nourishment and energy.
        In people with type 2 diabetes, the body's cells are resistant to the effects of insulin, the body does not produce enough insulin, or both. GLP-1 agonists stimulate the pancreas to release insulin and suppress the release of another hormone called glucagon, both of which help control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.
        These drugs also act in the brain to reduce hunger and act on the stomach to delay emptying, so you feel full for a longer time. These effects can lead to weight loss, which can be an important part of managing diabetes. GLP-1 agonists have been used to treat type 2 diabetes for about two decades.
        More recently, the FDA has approved several GLP-1 agonists for weight loss in people with obesity who do not have diabetes. When used for overweight or obesity, the drugs are typically prescribed in higher doses than when prescribed for diabetes.
        What GLP-1 drugs are available?
        Ten GLP-1 drugs are FDA-approved to treat either type 2 diabetes or weight loss. Some GLP-1 agonists have the same generic name but are marketed under a different brand name and are approved for a different purpose, depending on the dose and how they are taken.

        The differences between GLP-1 drugs include:
        
          Dosages. GLP-1 drugs for weight loss typically involve higher dosages than the same drug taken to manage diabetes.
          How they are taken. Most are given by injection, but there is one pill option (Rybelsus).
          Additional benefits. Some have been found to also protect the heart, and can benefit people at risk for a heart attack.
          Age. All can be used by adults, but some are also approved for children.
          Tolerance. If your body can't tolerate one GLP-1 drug, you may be able to try another.
        
        ""Ozempic face"" as a side effect of GLP-1 drugs
        You may have heard about ""Ozempic face"" as a side effect of GLP-1 drugs, though the term is misleading because this can be a side effect of any GLP-1 drug or any other cause of rapid weight loss.
        The rapid loss of fat in the face can cause:
        
          a hollowed look to the face
          changes in the size of the lips, cheeks, and chin
          wrinkles on the face
          sunken eyes
          sagging jowls around the jaw and neck.
        
        If weight is lost in a more gradual way, these changes may not be as noticeable. It's the faster pace of weight loss that occurs with GLP-1 drugs that can make facial changes more obvious.
        If ""Ozempic face"" side effects are significant, they can be treated with plastic surgery.
        Other side effects of GLP-1 drugs
        Gastrointestinal symptoms — nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation — are by far the most common side effects of GLP-1 drugs.
        
          Nausea can be managed by avoiding strong smells and eating crackers, mint, or ginger-based food or drinks about a half hour after taking a GLP-1 drug.
          Vomiting can be managed by staying well hydrated and having more frequent meals in smaller amounts.
          Diarrhea can be managed by drinking plenty of water and avoiding dairy products and high-fiber foods until symptoms go away.
          Constipation can be managed by getting enough fiber in your diet and drinking plenty of water.
        
        To help avoid gastrointestinal side effects of GLP-1 drugs:
        
          Eat slowly and stop when full.
          Have smaller portions.
          Avoid being too active immediately after eating.
        
        Less common but more serious side effects of GLP-1 agonists include:
        
          pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas that causes abdominal pain
          gastroparesis, in which movement of food out of the stomach is slowed or stopped
          bowel obstruction, a blockage that keeps food from passing through the intestines
          gallstone attacks and bile duct blockage.
        
        When to see a doctor about GLP-1 drug side effects
        Most side effects of GLP-1 drugs are not serious. You should immediately seek medical attention if you have:
        
          severe vomiting and diarrhea
          severe pain or tenderness in your belly
          inability to pass gas or move your bowels
          jaundice (yellow skin color).
        
        In addition, tell your doctor that you take GLP-1 drugs if you are having surgery or a procedure that involves general anesthesia. Because GLP-1 drugs slow digestion, you may need to stop taking them a few days beforehand to ensure you have an empty stomach before receiving anesthesia.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","February 5, 2024",1

        Nuts are actually the seeds of plants. Most are the seeds of trees; peanuts, however, are the seeds of a legume.
        Many, including walnuts and cashews, grow inside leathery fruits, with the nut corresponding to the peach pit (also a seed) within a peach. Others, such as hazelnuts and chestnuts, are classified as true botanical nuts (hard, dry fruits that don't open to release a separate seed).
        The benefits: Nuts are flavorful little packages containing healthy unsaturated fats (see ""Fat and calorie content per ounce of selected nuts and seeds""), protein, fiber, and other nutrients. For example, peanuts and pecans contain lots of B vitamins; almonds are rich in calcium and vitamin E; walnuts have lots of folate, vitamin E, and alpha-linoleic acid (ALA, an omega-3 fatty acid). And all nuts have magnesium.
        ""In just a handful of nuts, which is about an ounce or a quarter of a cup, you get a lot of bang for the buck. They contain anywhere from 3 to 7 grams of protein per ounce, 1 to 3 grams of fiber, and 160 to 200 calories,"" says registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        The risks: ""If you eat more than one or two handfuls of nuts per day, you're adding extra calories — maybe too many — that can take the place of other healthy foods and add weight,"" McManus warns. She also advises that you stay away from buying nuts with added sugar or chocolate. ""But salted nuts are fine, if you eat less than an ounce,"" she says. ""For 1 ounce of most nuts, the sodium content is less than 100 milligrams.""
        Try these: Almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, peanuts, pecans, pistachios, pine nuts, and walnuts.

        Seeds
        Unlike the seeds we call nuts, culinary seeds come from vegetables (such as pumpkins), flowers (such as sunflowers), or crops grown for a variety of uses (such as flax or hemp).
        The benefits: ""Seeds have mostly healthy fats, some fiber, and about 150 calories per ounce. And they do have protein, about 5 to 9 grams per ounce,"" McManus notes. ""Flaxseeds and chia seeds are also good sources of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids, with two or three times the ALA of walnuts.""
        Just a tablespoon of seeds yields surprising nutrition. In chia seeds, for example, you'll get 2 grams of protein, 4 grams of fiber, and 78 milligrams of calcium. A tablespoon of flaxseed has 2 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber. Hemp seeds contain only 1 gram of fiber in a tablespoon, but 10 grams of protein.
        The risks: Doctors once believed that eating seeds could lead to diverticulitis, an infection of diverticula (pouchlike structures that sometimes form in the muscular wall of the colon and bulge outward). However, the link between diverticulitis and seed consumption is unproven. In fact, seeds are rich in fiber, which is crucial for gut health.
        Try these: Chia seeds, flaxseeds, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds.
        How to use them
        Adding nuts and seeds to your diet is simple: stay within the serving guidelines of an ounce or two per day, and eat the ones you like. Sprinkle a few into salads, sauces, vegetables, or whole grains such as brown rice or quinoa.
        ""Make a cashew or pine nut pesto,"" suggests McManus. ""Add nuts or seeds to hot cereal or yogurt. Put nuts and seeds in a stir-fry. Or include some nut flour in baking recipes.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/alert-this-hidden-condition-increases-heart-attack-and-stroke-risks,Alert: This hidden condition increases heart attack and stroke risks,"It has an unfamiliar name, produces few symptoms, and involves a cluster of health problems. But metabolic syndrome is a common and dangerous condition that's steadily increasing in adults of all ages in the United States, largely a result of the obesity epidemic. The syndrome significantly increases the risks for heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and more.
        What is it?
        Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interrelated conditions. A diagnosis requires at least three of the following cardiovascular risk factors.
        Obesity. You have this risk factor if your waistline is greater than 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women, no matter your height, or if your body mass index is 30 or more.
        High blood sugar. After you eat, your body converts carbohydrates into blood glucose, a type of sugar that the body uses for energy. Sugar in the blood then enters your cells, where it's needed to produce energy. In people with diabetes or prone to it, this process is impaired, raising sugar levels in the blood and damaging the cells and blood vessels. A fasting blood sugar level of 100 milligrams per deciliter of blood (mg/dL) or more is considered high. Having diabetes (a fasting blood sugar of 126 mg/dL or higher) also counts as a metabolic syndrome risk factor.
        High triglycerides. Triglycerides are a type of fat in the blood. Having a high level — 150 mg/dL or higher — increases your risk for heart disease and stroke. You can find your triglyceride levels in your cholesterol test results.
        Low HDL (good) cholesterol. HDL is another type of fat in the blood. It helps remove LDL (bad) cholesterol. If your HDL is below 40 mg/dL in men or 50 mg/dL in women, it's considered low.
        High blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if your systolic pressure (the top number in a measurement) is 130 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher, or your diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is 80 mm Hg or higher. If you're already taking medication for high blood pressure, you should still count this condition as a metabolic risk factor.
        What does it mean?
        When three or more of these risk factors occur together, metabolic syndrome is present, and numerous studies have shown that means you have higher risks for heart disease and stroke.
        ""Having just one of the risk factors is bad enough. But having more makes the likelihood of bad health outcomes greater. That's why clinicians developed the term metabolic syndrome many years ago: it helped identify people at risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Today we have even better risk calculators, which take other risk factors into account, such as age and activity levels. But you can still pay attention to metabolic syndrome as a way to recognize that trouble is brewing,"" says Dr. David M. Nathan, a Harvard Medical School professor and the director of the Diabetes Center and Clinical Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Metabolic syndrome also increases the risk for developing liver disease, kidney disease, or sleep apnea (a condition marked by pauses in breathing during sleep).
        
          
            
              
                What to eat when you have metabolic syndrome
                Having metabolic syndrome means you're likely overweight or that you have another condition, such as high blood sugar, cholesterol, or blood pressure, that may be stoked by an unhealthy diet. One of the best antidotes is eating a healthy plant-based diet. Swap junk food for lots of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and whole grains; moderate amounts of fish and poultry; and limited portions of red or processed meats. And do one thing more: ""Eat less. If you expend more calories than you're taking in, you'll lose weight,"" says Harvard Medical School diabetes expert Dr. David M. Nathan. His go-to tricks: eat smaller portions and focus on foods high in fiber (such as vegetables and legumes), which will keep you fuller longer.
              
            
          
        
        Diagnosis and treatment
        You can measure your waist to see if you have at least one metabolic syndrome risk factor. But you can't see the others. So perhaps discuss it at your next doctor appointment, and double-check your annual blood work results.
        The good news is that you can reverse metabolic syndrome. Losing weight is central to reducing many of its features. Lowering elevated blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels also plays a major role in reducing your risk for heart disease and stroke.
        If you can do that and live a healthy lifestyle — exercising daily, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, not smoking, and limiting alcohol intake — you'll not only decrease your risks for heart disease and diabetes, but also increase your odds of living longer.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/do-i-still-need-to-keep-taking-a-statin,Do I still need to keep taking a statin?,"Q. 
          I'm 81 years old, and I've been on a statin drug for 30 years because I'm at increased risk for heart disease. At my age, do I need to still keep taking it?
        
        A. Statin drugs were introduced into medical practice in the 1980s. They are very effective at lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol and in reducing inflammation inside cholesterol-filled plaques of atherosclerosis. In people older than 75, are they still effective in lowering cholesterol and in reducing the risk of heart disease? In the last few years, we have started to get solid information that addresses your question.
        A recent study from Denmark, published in the August 2023 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, included about 84,000 people — about 10,000 of whom were older than 75. Participants began taking one of two different statin drugs, simvastatin (Zocor) or atorvastatin (Lipitor), between 2008 and 2018. The study found that the people most likely to have their LDL cholesterol lowered by statin drugs were those older than 75.
        So, statins remain effective at lowering cholesterol in people older than 75. But do they also reduce the risk of developing heart disease? Another observational study from Denmark, published in The Lancet in 2020, identified more than 90,000 people not on statins who were free of heart disease or diabetes (a risk factor for heart disease) — and then started taking a statin drug. Over an average follow-up period of 7.7 years, the people who were most likely to benefit from statin drugs were those older than 75.
        Randomized trials provide stronger evidence than observational studies. However, relatively few randomized trials of the ability of statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs to reduce heart disease risk have included people older than 75. To overcome that problem, an international team based here at Harvard pooled the results for more than 21,000 people older than 75 (and even more who were younger than 75) from multiple different cholesterol-lowering drug trials. The study, published in 2020 in The Lancet, found that the older group benefited at least as much as the younger group.
        In short, for people older than 75 who have heart disease already, or who, like you, are at increased risk of developing heart disease, I think there now is solid evidence that statins remain effective at lowering cholesterol and, more important, in reducing the risk of new or recurrent heart disease. For people older than 75 who have not been diagnosed with heart disease and are not at increased risk for developing it, I think the value of statins still is uncertain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/how-a-personal-trainer-can-enhance-your-workouts,How a personal trainer can enhance your workouts,"If your New Year's resolution to start exercising more has fallen by the wayside, hiring a personal trainer can be a good way to hold yourself accountable. Because exercise is such an important part of cardiovascular health, the cost is worthwhile — especially when you consider the added benefits of working with a professional trainer.

""A good personal trainer will create a balanced workout and teach you how to exercise safely to avoid injuries,"" says certified personal trainer Vijay A. Daryanani, a physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Outpatient Center. He always has his clients start with a dynamic warm-up, such as marching in place or sidestepping and doing arm swings, which helps loosen up the major muscle groups. ""I'll also have them do some heel-to-toe walking to help fire up some of the smaller muscles,"" he says.

People focused on heart health often prioritize exercise that raises their heart rate (cardio or aerobic exercise). But strength training builds lean muscle mass, which helps burn body fat, keeps blood sugar in check, and may help reduce cholesterol levels.

Injury prevention

Using the proper form during strength-building exercises is key. The weight machines at gyms and fitness centers can be a good option for beginners because they target specific muscle groups within a limited range of motion, says Daryanani. But when you use free weights (dumbbells, barbells, and kettlebells), you use a much wider range of muscles, including core muscles and others that help with stability and balance. A trainer will help you choose the correct type and size of free weight, based on your abilities and goals. Because free weights allow a greater range of motion, you need good body awareness to stay safe.

Always make sure to stand up straight and tall before starting any standing strength moves, says Daryanani. Most gyms and health clubs have mirrors that you can use to get feedback on your form as you exercise. Even a basic body-weight exercise like a squat requires careful attention to body alignment to avoid straining your joints (see ""The right and wrong way to do a squat"").


	
		
			
			The right and wrong way to do a squat

			

			Proper form is crucial to protecting yourself from injury and getting the most benefit from an exercise. A squat is a classic body-weight exercise that strengthens the lower body and core muscles in addition to improving your balance and posture. Here's the correct way to do this exercise without stressing the joints in your hips, knees, and ankles.

			
				Bend at your hips to work your gluteal (buttocks) muscles.
				Lean forward about 45° to keep your balance.
				Check that your knees are aligned and not rolling inward or outward.
				Keep your feet flat, with your heels on the floor.
				Don't let your knees go farther forward than your toes.
				Try not to let your thighs sink lower than parallel to the floor.
				Don't round your back; try to keep your spine in a straight line.

Choosing a personal trainer

Some gyms and fitness centers have personal trainers on staff or hire them as contractors. But many will come to your house and can devise an at-home workout plan for you, even if you don't own any machines or special equipment. Look for one who's accredited by one or more of these organizations:


	American Council on Exercise (ACE)
	American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
	International Sports Sciences Association (ISSA)
	National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM).


Ask about the person's training background, experience working with clients your age, and approach to designing client programs. Consider asking for references, especially from clients like you. Sign up for a few sessions at first to gauge how well you and the trainer work together before you commit to something longer.

Prices vary widely, depending on where you live and possibly gym affiliations. The cost ranges anywhere from $75 to $125 per hour. You might be able to save a little money by hiring a trainer to do small group sessions with you and one or several of your friends who have similar fitness levels and goals.

Another advantage to working with a trainer: a good one can make exercise feel like a fun challenge instead of a repetitive chore. ""Getting someone in the right mindset is essential, and I find that positive energy can be very infectious,"" says Daryanani.",Julie Corliss,"February 1, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-portfolio-diet-a-smart-investment-for-your-heart,The portfolio diet: A smart investment for your heart,"The portfolio diet, which emphasizes plant foods rich in fiber and healthy fats, was conceived some 20 years ago. Since then, many studies have documented the diet's ability to lower harmful LDL cholesterol. But because none of those trials lasted any longer than six months, the portfolio diet's long-term returns were unknown. Now, new research suggests that the more closely you follow a portfolio-style eating pattern, the greater your protection against heart disease and stroke.
        Published Nov. 28, 2023, in Circulation, the study included more than 210,000 people who enrolled in three Harvard-led health studies in the 1980s and 1990s. Using data from diet questionnaires the participants filled out every four years, researchers scored each person's diet based on how well it complied with the portfolio eating pattern. After 30 years of follow-up, researchers compared the scores with the participants' health outcomes. People with higher scores (that is, those who followed the diet most closely) had a 14% lower risk of heart disease compared to those with lower scores.
        ""A lot of different foods can lower LDL cholesterol, but only by a little bit — about 5% to 10%. The idea behind the portfolio diet was to combine many of these foods together to get a larger reduction,"" says registered dietitian Andrea Glenn, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a co-author of the study.
        Earlier studies found that the portfolio diet may lower LDL cholesterol by as much as 30%. In the new study, people with higher portfolio diet scores not only had better cholesterol profiles, they also had lower blood levels of C-reactive protein and other inflammatory substances compared to people with lower scores, says Glenn. Inflammation is a key player in the buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries — the root cause of most heart attacks.
        What's in the portfolio diet?
        The diet discourages foods from animal sources, particularly red and processed meat, high-fat dairy, and eggs, which means it's naturally low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol, both of which raise LDL cholesterol in the body. The featured foods fall into five main categories. Here's a rundown, including ways to incorporate them into your meals.
        Plant protein. This includes beans, lentils, and peas (collectively known as legumes), with a specific focus on foods made from soybeans, says Glenn. In 1999, the FDA authorized a health claim for soy protein, noting that consuming at least 25 grams daily as part of a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fat may lower the risk of heart disease. Soy protein comes in many different forms: edamame (whole, green soybeans often sold frozen in pods), soy milk, soy yogurt, tofu, or tempeh (fermented soybeans). But there are many other legumes to choose from, including black beans, pinto beans, chickpeas (garbanzo beans), lentils, and split dried green peas.
        
          
            
              
                Try this plant protein
                Swap out some of the meat in homemade soups, stews, or casseroles with beans or tofu.
                Replace some dairy products (like milk and yogurt) with soy-based versions.
                Snack on edamame or hummus.
              
            
          
        
        Nuts and seeds. All nuts — including almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios, walnuts — are included. So are all sorts of seeds: chia, flax, hemp, pumpkin, sunflower, sesame.
        
          
            
              
                Try these nuts and seeds
                Add nuts or seeds to hot cereal, muffins or other baked goods, yogurt, and salads.
                Spread peanut butter or other nut butters on whole-grain crackers or sliced apples.
                Snack on mixed nuts.
              
            
          
        
        Viscous fiber. Viscous fiber is a type of soluble fiber that has a somewhat sticky quality, says Glenn. ""It's found in grains like oats and barley, certain vegetables such as eggplant and okra, and fruits like apples, oranges, berries, and persimmons,"" she says. One of the best sources is psyllium seed husks, which transform into a viscous gel when dissolved in water. People may be familiar with psyllium because the powdered husks are the key ingredient in Metamucil, which helps treat constipation, says Glenn. But you can buy plain psyllium seed husk in stores.
        In the intestines, viscous fiber binds to bile acids, which carry fats from your small intestine into the large intestine for excretion. This triggers your liver to create more bile acids—a process that requires cholesterol. If the liver doesn't have enough cholesterol, it draws more from the bloodstream, in turn lowering your circulating LDL. In addition, viscous fiber is fermented in the gut into short-chain fatty acids, which may also inhibit cholesterol production.
        
          
            
              
                Try this viscous fiber
                Build what Glenn calls a ""super portfolio breakfast"": oatmeal topped with soy milk, fruit, nuts, and seeds. Try combos such as raspberries, chopped walnuts, and chia seeds or diced apples, almonds, and sesame seeds.
                Swap regular bread for oat bran bread.
                Try different ways to prepare eggplant, such as a Chinese-style stir-fry or ratatouille, a French vegetable stew.
              
            
          
        
        Plant sterols. Also known as phytosterols, these exist naturally in nuts, soybeans, peas, and canola oil. Plant sterols have a structure similar to cholesterol; eating them helps limit the amount of cholesterol your body can absorb. Margarine enriched with plant sterols, such as Benecol, provides a concentrated dose. But you have to eat quite a bit (about four tablespoons daily) to make a difference, says Glenn. It tastes similar to other types of margarine and can be used as a spread for toast and in sandwiches.
        Monounsaturated fats. Used in place of saturated fats, these fats help lower cholesterol. Extra-virgin olive oil is the top recommendation; other good options include canola, soybean, or ""high-oleic"" sunflower or safflower oils. Stock a variety of these oils for use on salads and in cooking and baking. Avocados are also rich in monounsaturated fat.
        You don't need to embrace every aspect of the diet to reap benefits, says Glenn. ""But we saw a dose-related response in the study, which means that the more of these foods were added to the diet, the lower the risk of cardiovascular disease we observed,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/antidepressant-may-help-manage-irritable-bowel-syndrome-symptoms,Antidepressant may help manage irritable bowel syndrome symptoms,"Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant also used to treat nerve pain, may be one of the best pharmacologic choices to help improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
        IBS causes abdominal pain and changes to bowel movements, with symptoms fluctuating in severity over time. IBS has no cure, and standard treatments like dietary and lifestyle changes and taking antispasmodic or antidiarrheal medications yield varying benefits.
        In a study published Nov. 11, 2023, in The Lancet, 463 people with IBS took either amitriptyline (10 to 30 milligrams based on the severity of each person's symptoms) or a placebo every day for six months. Afterward, people who took amitriptyline were almost twice as likely as those taking a placebo to report an overall improvement in their symptoms and had significantly lower IBS severity. It's believed amitriptyline helps by increasing people's threshold for IBS pain and discomfort.
        The researchers suggested that doctors should consider low-dose amitriptyline for managing IBS when dietary and other lifestyle changes are not sufficient.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/try-this-get-jumping-with-plyometrics,Try this: Get jumping with plyometrics,"Plyometrics is a popular training routine that top athletes use to boost strength, power, and agility. It involves short, intense bursts of activity that target fast-twitch muscle fibers in the lower body. These fibers help generate explosive power that increases speed and jumping height.
        For the average person, though, plyometrics can help improve coordination, agility, and flexibility and offer an excellent heart-pumping workout.
        There are many kinds of plyometric exercises. A good starting place is a favorite childhood and gym class activity: jumping rope.
        
          Begin with two minutes of jumping rope, then increase the time or add extra sets.
          If two minutes is too difficult at first, break it up into 10- to 30-second segments.
          Start with a slow pace until you find your rhythm. If your feet get tangled, pause until you regain your balance, and then continue.
          If jumping rope is too difficult, go through the motions of mimicking the movements without the rope.
        
        Even beginner plyometrics can be challenging, so if you have joint issues in your knees, back, or hips or any trouble with balance, check with your doctor before you begin.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/rinse-brush-floss-scrape-and-repeat,"Rinse, brush, floss, scrape, and repeat","One of the best things you can do for your overall health as you age is a daily routine you've followed since childhood.
        ""Maintaining good dental health not only protects against gum disease but also helps ward off many other age-related diseases,"" says Dr. Leonard Brennan, co-director of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine's Geriatric Fellowship Program. ""Good oral health helps you enjoy life by allowing you to chew, taste, swallow, speak, and smile. The chances are in your favor that you can keep your teeth for a lifetime if you maintain your oral health.""
        The most common form of gum disease is gingivitis (gum inflammation). It begins when bacteria buildup in the mouth causes plaque and tartar to form on teeth, which, if not removed, can lead to tooth decay. ""The amount of bacteria in the mouth doubles every four to five hours,"" says Dr. Brennan.
        Gingivitis also can lead to red, swollen, and bleeding gums. If left unchecked, gingivitis can advance to more serious periodontitis, which can cause bone deterioration and tooth loss, and reduce the ability to speak and chew properly.
        Gum disease can affect other aspects of one's health. Research suggests it can increase the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and dementia.
        Because regular dental care can be expensive (particularly for older people, as Medicare doesn't routinely cover dentist visits), self-care is the best preventive medicine. ""Daily dental care to remove bacteria from the teeth, gums, and tongue is relatively inexpensive compared with costly dental treatments,"" says Dr. Brennan.
        A proper dental routine consists of five steps: rinsing, brushing, flossing, tongue scraping, and a final rinse.
        
          
            
              
                How often should you see your dentist?
                Most people should see their dentist for a regular checkup at least once a year, but ideally twice for cleanings and x-rays as needed. Still, the frequency depends on your overall oral health. ""If your teeth and gums are healthy and you don't have issues, you can often stretch out dental exams to once a year,"" says Dr. Leonard Brennan, co-director of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine's Geriatric Fellowship Program. ""The ideal interval for routine dental exams is not clear cut and depends on the dental and medical health of each patient.""
              
            
          
        
        Rinsing
        Before you brush, dislodge food particles by thoroughly swishing and rinsing your mouth with plain warm water.
        Brushing
        Brush at least twice a day, suggests Dr. Brennan. With brushing, focus on quality rather than quantity. ""Focusing on how well you brush the front and back of each tooth can help remove the most bacteria,"" says Dr. Brennan.
        Dr. Brennan recommends using an electric toothbrush over a regular one. ""Studies have found that they are better at removing plaque, as you can get more strokes from the brush's vibrations than from your hand motion,"" he says. Use a brush head with soft or extra-soft bristles and replace every three to four months, or more often if the strands are visibly matted or frayed.
        To brush properly, tilt the toothbrush at a 45° angle. Beginning with the upper teeth, take several up-and-down short strokes from the gum line to the chewing surface of the tooth. Do one tooth at a time before moving on to the next. To clean the inside surfaces of the front teeth, hold the brush vertically and make several up-and-down strokes. Repeat the process for the lower teeth.
        If you have arthritis that makes it hard to hold a toothbrush, or if it's challenging to reach the back teeth, invest in grip aids that slide over your brush's handle. (You can find them at drugstores or online.) ""They make it easier to hold the brush and extend the length to help with the hard-to-reach back teeth,"" says Dr. Brennan.
        For toothpaste, choose one with the American Dental Association (ADA) Seal of Acceptance, which verifies it contains decay- and plaque-fighting fluoride. While the ingredients can differ slightly, all toothpastes have the same general components: mild abrasives, humectants, flavoring agents, thickening agents, and detergents.
        Natural toothpastes are also popular, but again, look for the ADA seal. The word ""natural"" indicates certain ingredients are omitted, such as artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, and sweeteners. It also means that certain active ingredients that help with cleaning are derived from plant sources. Toothpaste comes in gel, paste, or powder forms. They all work equally well, so choose the one you like best. Some brands also contain other ingredients that improve oral health. They might reduce tooth sensitivity, combat gingivitis or tartar buildup, prevent enamel erosion, or whiten teeth. Ask your dentist for a recommendation for these specific issues.
        Flossing
        Dr. Brennan says you can floss before or after brushing using either waxed or unwaxed floss. ""But, if possible, try to floss routinely after a meal to remove food particles that can hasten bacteria buildup."" To floss correctly, wrap the floss around your middle fingers, which helps you reach the back teeth. Loop the floss around each tooth so it makes a C shape. Beginning at the gum line, slide it up and down the tooth several times. Avoid just moving the floss back and forth in a sawing motion. You miss cleaning the entire tooth, and the friction can cut and irritate the gums.
        ""If gum bleeding occurs, don't stop flossing; just be more gentle around that area,"" says Dr. Brennan. If traditional flossing is difficult, try over-the-counter tools, such as floss picks, pre-threaded flossers, tiny brushes that reach between the teeth, or water flossers.
        Tongue scraping
        Next, do tongue scraping, which can further eliminate bacteria. Sold in drugstores and online, tongue scrapers are small tools made of stainless steel, silicone, or plastic. (You could also use a spoon.) Make a gentle raking motion several times from the back of the tongue to the front.
        Rinse again
        Finish up with another rinse, using an over-the-counter alcohol-free mouthwash with fluoride, which can help protect against tooth decay. ""Some products are available that help reduce tooth sensitivity and strengthen teeth,"" says Dr. Brennan. Ask your pharmacist or dentist for suggestions.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/ovary-removal-before-menopause-may-pose-health-risks,Ovary removal before menopause may pose health risks,"Women who have both ovaries removed before menopause face far higher odds of several chronic health conditions decades later, according to a study published online Sept. 12, 2023, by Menopause.
        The study involved 274 women (average age 67) whose ovaries had been removed before menopause for a noncancerous condition — either with or without a hysterectomy. An average of 22 years after their surgery, the women underwent comprehensive physical exams to assess the presence of any chronic conditions and measure their strength and mobility. Compared with women of the same age who still had their ovaries, women who were under age 46 when their ovaries were removed were 64% more likely to have arthritis, twice as likely to have obstructive sleep apnea, and nearly three times as likely to have had a bone fracture. They also performed worse on a six-minute walk test. Women who'd undergone ovary removal between ages 46 and 49 also had higher odds of arthritis and sleep apnea than same-age women who didn't have the surgery. However, researchers didn't find a link between ovary removal before menopause and an array of other conditions, including cancer, diabetes, dementia, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, irregular heart rhythm, osteoporosis, or kidney, liver, or thyroid disease.
        Women who have their ovaries removed before menopause should consider going on estrogen therapy until about age 50, the study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/bad-bedfellows,Bad bedfellows,"You woke up with a pep in your step, feeling energetic and well rested. But wait: your sleep tracker says otherwise. Does the data change your plans for the day and how you'll approach bedtime that night? Are you now anxious when you'd been feeling calm?
        The rise of sleep tracking devices — which monitor physiological factors related to sleep — has made this conundrum increasingly relevant. A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine shows that more than one-third of Americans have used electronic sleep tracking devices.
        Seven hours of sleep each night are generally adequate for an average adult, Harvard experts say. But many folks are fixated on getting a ""perfect"" eight hours after learning that sleep deprivation can raise the risks of an array of potentially serious health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The quest for better sleep may backfire, however, leading to anxiety and stress that can thwart restful slumber.
        ""We do need to lower the emotional temperature a bit and be rational about this,"" says Dr. John Winkelman, chief of the Sleep Disorders Clinical Research Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        ""Many people still don't respect the importance of sleep, but using sleep trackers feeds into some people's anxieties,"" he says. ""Anxiety and psychological arousal are the opposite of what we need when we sleep.""
        Influential data
        Many types of devices are marketed to track sleep, ranging from watches and rings to smartphone apps and mattress monitors. Some measure whether you're asleep or not by recording aspects such as movement, heart rate, body temperature, and breathing patterns—all of which change at different sleep stages.
        The data these devices generate can also hold a lot of sway over how people feel each day. A small 2018 study in the Journal of Sleep Research demonstrated this phenomenon. It involved 63 adults with insomnia who were given wrist-worn sleep trackers. In the morning, half of them received information telling them they'd slept poorly, while the others were told they'd slept well — regardless of their actual sleep quality. All reported on their mood and alertness several times over the course of the day.
        The 32 participants who were told their sleep was poor reported lower alertness during the day and greater sleepiness in the evening compared to those given positive feedback. And people told they had restful sleep reported a significantly higher level of positive mood and alertness.
        ""In fact, there was no meaningful difference in sleep quality between the two groups,"" Dr. Winkelman says. ""I'm a little bit addicted to my Fitbit, but I don't use it to inform how I feel during the day. I just like knowing the data and thinking about the relationship of the data to how I think I slept. But understand: those two things are far from synonymous.""
        Pluses and pitfalls
        Using sleep trackers can present distinct pros and cons, Harvard experts say. Among the pros:
        
          They can make you more aware of your sleep patterns.
          They can offer affirmation if you're trying to form better sleep habits. ""Trackers allow people to see if their bedtimes and wake times aren't stable, which they should be,"" Dr. Winkelman says. ""Our sleep is really best when we're on a regular schedule.""
          They can identify a potential sleep disorder by spotlighting signs such as awakening many times during the night. ""Some trackers offer information about your oxygen variability,"" Dr. Winkelman says. ""They can be very helpful in identifying sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea.""
        
        But the devices can also lead to an unhealthy preoccupation with sleep, which can fuel insomnia, Dr. Winkelman says. Here are some other downsides:
        
          Interpreting and using the data can be confusing. For example, your tracker may tell you that you're apparently not sleeping very deeply, but you might not know how to change that.
          Focusing on sleep data may lead some people to ignore how they actually feel after sleeping. ""Can you wake up without an alarm clock? Make it through the day without feeling exhausted or drinking five cups of coffee?"" asks Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""To me, those are probably much more useful metrics.""
        
        A lack of accuracy
        Sleep trackers are only as useful as the data they produce — which aren't always accurate. A small 2019 study in the journal Sensors compared several types of sleep trackers to the gold standard of sleep measurement, a sleep study called polysomnography. After comparing 27 nights of sleep study recordings in 19 participants ages 19 to 64 (66% women) with sleep tracker data from the same nights, researchers found the trackers lacking.
        Specifically, the devices had difficulty detecting participants' wake periods, which hindered their ability to estimate total sleep time and sleep quality. However, the sleep trackers accurately detected the most basic sleep parameter — the actual amount of time participants spent in bed.
        ""They're not accurately reflecting how much sleep people are getting, or the depth of sleep or type,"" Dr. Klerman says. ""I think they're more accurate now than they used to be. On the other hand, they haven't been tested on every type of person who wears them.""
        
          
            
              
                What color is your sleep noise?
                It may seem paradoxical that a noisy environment could promote sleep. But some people prefer not to slumber in total silence — instead, they add background sound to the bedroom to sleep more soundly.
                Recent years have seen a proliferation of sleep machines and apps that emit various audio frequencies that sound similar to static from an untuned radio or TV. Some people profess that listening to these monotonous sounds before or during sleep can help them drop off more easily and stay asleep longer, calming them and drowning out background noise like traffic or creaky pipes.
                These sounds have colors assigned to them based on each noise's strength and frequency:
                White noise is perhaps the best‑known of all noise colors and contains all audio frequencies. It can be intense and high-pitched, resembling a fan, air conditioner, or vacuum.
                Pink noise is lower-pitched than white noise. It sounds like steady rain, wind blowing through trees, or waves on a beach.
                Brown noise sounds more bass, like a rushing river, pounding surf, or strong winds.
              
            
          
        
        Sleep-boosting measures
        If you've found that anxiety surrounding sleep is keeping you from restful slumber, Harvard experts suggest seeking a special type of cognitive behavioral therapy, called CBTi, that's designed to improve insomnia.
        ""The cognitive part works on anxious thoughts, while the behavioral part actually decreases the amount of time you spend in bed so you're really sleepy when you get there,"" Dr. Winkelman says.
        Here are some other tactics to improve your sleep:
        Set consistent bed and wake times. You can use a tracker to help you do this or merely rely on the clock. But either way, the practice should prod you to wind down calmly before bed.
        Don't check sleep data first thing in the morning. Start your day, decide how you feel, and then look at your sleep tracker.
        Monitor substance use surrounding sleep. Pay attention to when you last used caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco, which can all affect sleep quality.
        Consider your medication use. Ask your doctor if any prescriptions or supplements you take might make it harder to fall or stay asleep. Tweak the use of those medications if possible.
        Stay alert for breathing issues. If your bed partner says you snore or gasp frequently while sleeping, tell your doctor. Ditto if you can't sleep lying down and need to sit up, which usually indicates breathing problems. ""A tracker may not catch that,"" Dr. Klerman says. ""That's really good evidence you should see a health professional.""

        The study included 419 people with paroxysmal afib, which is characterized by intermittent episodes of a rapid, irregular heart rate. For 10 weeks, they used a smartphone app to rate their nightly sleep as amazing, good, average, bad, or horrible, and then used mobile electrocardiograms to measure afib episodes the following day.
        Researchers found that worse sleep quality on any given night was linked to a 15% greater risk of an afib episode the next day. Continued poor sleep was associated with longer episodes of afib, with each progressively worse category of sleep linked with an average of 16 additional minutes of afib per day. Strategies to improve sleep might help prevent and treat afib, say the authors, whose findings were published online Oct. 12, 2023, by JACC Clinical Electrophysiology.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-active-ingredients-of-tai-chi,The active ingredients of tai chi,"Tai chi is a low-impact, slow-motion exercise that has been called meditation in motion. This gentle exercise continues to gain interest from practitioners and researchers for its health benefits.
        When Peter Wayne, medical editor of Introduction to Tai Chi from Harvard Medical School, began conducting scientific studies on the health benefits of tai chi, he began noticing that tai chi works in a variety of ways, not just one. Whereas most drugs have a single active ingredient, Wayne observed that tai chi was more like a multidrug combination that uses different components to produce a variety of effects. 
        
          Eight active ingredients
        
        Wayne formulated the idea of the ""eight active ingredients"" of tai chi, which he and his colleagues now use as a conceptual framework to help evaluate the clinical benefits of tai chi, explore the underlying mechanisms that produce these effects, and shape the way tai chi is taught to participants in clinical trials (and to teachers). These eight active ingredients are:
        
          1. Awareness
        
        
          2. Intention
        
        
          3. Structural integration
        
        
          4. Active relaxation
        
        
          5. Strengthening and flexibility
        
        
          6. Natural, freer breathing
        
        
          7. Social support
        
        
          8. Embodied spirituality 
        
        While different styles of tai chi emphasize different ingredients, these therapeutic factors are interwoven and synergistic. For example, studies have shown that tai chi helps prevent falls in older people by improving their bal­ance. But closer examination reveals that this benefit is actually the result of multiple active ingre­dients. The most obvious are the physical components such as improved muscular strength and flexibility (active ingredient 5) along with better function due to improved posture and alignment (active ingredient 3).
        There's also a mental component. When you are afraid of falling, you are anxious. Tai chi helps you relax (active ingredient 4), breathe (active ingredient 6), increase your awareness of both your body and your sur­roundings (active ingredient 1), and visualize yourself as walking steadily (active ingredient 2). Combined, these elements help stabilize the physical body, boost your confidence, and alleviate fall-related anxiety.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/a-sharper-mind-tai-chi-can-improve-cognitive-function,A sharper mind: tai chi can improve cognitive function,"Up until about two decades ago, it was believed that your brain only produced new cells early in life. But research has shown that the brain has the ability to change throughout your entire life span, growing new cells, making new connections, and even increasing in size. These changes can improve cognitive function—and various forms of exercise, including tai chi, can help.
        In a meta-analysis of 20 studies on tai chi and cognition, tai chi appears to improve executive function—the ability to multitask, manage time, and make decisions—in people without any cognitive decline. In those with mild cognitive impairment, tai chi slowed the progression to dementia more than other types of exercise and improved their cognitive function in a comparable fashion to other types of exercise or cognitive training.
        In one study, researchers had nearly 400 Chinese men and women with some cognitive impairment perform either tai chi or a stretching and toning program three times a week. After a year, the tai chi group showed greater improvements, and only 2% of that group progressed to dementia, while 11% from the traditional exercise group did.
        In another study, tai chi outperformed walking. Following 40 weeks of either tai chi, walking, social interaction, or no intervention, researchers compared MRI images and discovered that brain volume increased the most in the tai chi group. In addition, that group also performed better on cognitive tests.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/perioral-dermatitis-symptoms-treatment-and-prevention,"Perioral dermatitis: Symptoms, treatment, and prevention","If you are experiencing flaky red rashes and inflamed bumps around your mouth, these symptoms may be more than just dry winter skin and pimples. You may have a skin condition called perioral dermatitis.

What is perioral dermatitis?

Perioral dermatitis (POD), also known as periorificial dermatitis, is a common skin disorder that can occur around the mouth, nose, and eyes. POD is different from acne, rosacea, eczema, and dry skin, although the conditions can share overlapping features.

Perioral dermatitis symptoms

Perioral dermatitis typically appears as clusters of small red bumps and/or dry red rashes on the face. In people with darker skin, the bumps may appear flesh-colored.

As the name suggests, these symptoms most commonly appear around the mouth, but do not extend onto the lips. POD may also be seen on the chin, around the nose and eyes, and very rarely on the ears, neck, and scalp. The skin eruption may be accompanied by burning or itch.

In children, the condition may appear as small, firm, yellow or brown bumps.

Causes of perioral dermatitis and who is at risk

The cause of perioral dermatitis is unknown. Certain factors such as skin irritants, which cause breakdown of the top layer of the skin, may contribute. People with a history of eczema, which interferes with the barrier function of the skin, are at increased risk.

POD occurs in all ages, sexes, and ethnicities, but is more common in women ages 16 to 45. It is also more common in people who use topical (applied to the skin), oral, or inhaled steroid medications. Other factors that may contribute to POD flares include:


	fluoride toothpaste
	heavy skin moisturizers and cosmetic products, or those that are occlusive (create a barrier on the skin that locks in moisture)
	oral contraceptives
	hormone fluctuations in women
	the presence of certain fungi, bacteria, or mites on the skin
	problems with the balance of bacteria on your skin, or with your immune system.


Is it contagious?

Perioral dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition. It is not contagious.

Perioral dermatitis treatment

Perioral dermatitis can be treated with both over-the-counter products and prescriptions written by your doctor.

The first step of treatment is to stop using any facial products or cosmetics that are irritating, heavy, or occlusive on your skin. Topical steroids, both prescription and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, are not recommended. While steroid creams may provide an initial improvement, the rash will flare and worsen once discontinued.

In some cases, POD resolves on its own without any treatment necessary.

Over-the-counter treatments

If you have perioral dermatitis, try to adhere to a minimal therapy approach to your over-the-counter skin care regimen. This means avoiding potential skin irritants and cosmetics. Stick to fragrance-free, exfoliant-free, gentle face wash and moisturizer. Once the condition clears, you can slowly start to reintroduce your skin care products.

In addition to minimal therapy, you can try over-the-counter remedies that may help clear this condition more quickly, such as:


	azelaic acid gel
	sulfur-based topical skin care products.


Medications

If your perioral dermatitis is not improving with over-the-counter techniques, see a dermatologist or other trained clinician. He or she may prescribe topical or oral medication to treat your POD.

A doctor will typically prescribe topical medications in the form of lotions, creams, gels, or face cleansers for initial treatment. For more severe cases, or those that do not respond to topical therapies, your doctor may prescribe oral medications.

Examples of medications your dermatologist may prescribe include:


	topical antibiotics including clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole
	sulfur-based creams or cleansers
	azelaic acid cream or gel
	nonsteroid, anti-inflammatory topical treatments such as pimecrolimus cream and tacrolimus ointment
	oral antibiotics including doxycycline, minocycline, and erythromycin.


Preventing perioral dermatitis

The best way to prevent perioral dermatitis is to avoid using skin care products and cosmetics that feel harsh or irritating to your skin. In addition:


	Minimize or avoid use of topical steroids including hydrocortisone on your face. If you have a medical condition that requires the use of prescription steroid medications, discuss this with your doctor.
	Stick to a simple skin care regimen that includes a gentle face cleanser and a moisturizing lotion.
	Gradually introduce new skin care products one at a time.


Finally, you can schedule a skin evaluation with a board-certified dermatologist or other trained clinician to discuss the best products and regimen for your skin type.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","January 31, 2024",1

        Vegetarians and vegans should consume nearly twice the amount of iron as people who consume meat. This is because the type of iron in meat, poultry, and seafood known as heme iron is easily absorbed by the body. By contrast, plant-based foods provide non-heme iron, which is more difficult for the body to absorb.
        Your doctor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific health needs.
        What foods are high in iron?
        Foods such as lean meats, seafood, nuts, beans, and fortified cereals are excellent sources of iron. They should be incorporated into a balanced diet. You can check the iron content of foods on the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) FoodData Central database.

        What is iron deficiency?
        Iron deficiency can result if your body does not get enough iron. Your body stores iron in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and muscles, and those supplies of iron can be harnessed when your iron intake is low.
        However, a low iron level over an extended period of time can result in a type of anemia called iron deficiency anemia. In iron deficiency anemia, iron stores are exhausted and iron levels are too low to produce hemoglobin, the protein responsible for transporting oxygen throughout your body.
        If you have iron-deficiency anemia, you may experience symptoms such as:
        
          fatigue, or lack of energy
          shortness of breath
          dizziness
          upset stomach
          headache
          pale skin
          cold hands and feet
          difficulty concentrating.
        
        In infants and children, untreated iron deficiency can result in learning difficulties.
        Who is at risk for iron deficiency?
        Certain groups of people are more susceptible to iron deficiency due to insufficient dietary iron intake, poor absorption of iron, or increased iron requirements. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), groups at higher risk of iron deficiency include:
        
          pregnant women
          menstruating women, especially those with heavy menstrual bleeding
          infants and young children (due to their rapid growth and limited iron reserves)
          people with gastrointestinal conditions that affect nutrient absorption, such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease
          people with cancer
          people with heart failure
          people who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet
          frequent blood donors.
        
        How is iron deficiency treated?
        In order to diagnose iron deficiency, your doctor will perform a blood test to measure hemoglobin, blood iron, and ferritin levels (a measure of the body's iron stores).
        Treatment for iron deficiency typically involves taking an iron supplement and adjusting your diet to increase your intake of iron-rich foods. In the case of iron deficiency anemia, iron supplements or intravenous (IV) iron may be needed to help increase iron levels in the blood.
        Untreated iron deficiency can lead to serious health complications affecting energy levels, cognitive function, and overall well-being.
        Is it possible to consume too much iron?
        While not common in the United States, excess iron can be a concern for some people. The body has limited mechanisms to rid the body of excess iron. If not properly regulated, excess iron may lead to hemochromatosis, or iron overload.
        In hemochromatosis, the body accumulates iron in organs like the liver, heart, and pancreas where, over time, it can potentially cause organ damage. Symptoms of hemochromatosis may include fatigue, joint pain, and abdominal pain. Over time, hemochromatosis can lead to severe complications like cirrhosis, diabetes, and heart problems.
        Hemochromatosis can result from a genetic mutation or from excessive iron supplementation.
        It is essential to not exceed recommended iron intake guidelines. Talk to your doctor before considering iron supplements, especially if you have not been diagnosed with an iron deficiency.",Jenette Restivo,"January 31, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/tips-for-taming-caregiver-stress,Tips for taming caregiver stress,"Caring for others fulfills a basic social contract in ways that can draw generations and individuals closer. Certainly, caring for an elderly parent or ailing spouse or partner is a worthy, often satisfying pursuit. But it isn't easy. If you're among the many millions of Americans acting as caregivers for friends, family, or neighbors, you may often wrestle with stress as well as exhaustion, anger, guilt, grief, and other emotions.
        Two-thirds of these caregivers are women. The task is especially hard on women in the so-called sandwich generation, who are simultaneously caring for children and older parents, quite possibly while working outside the home, too.
        While you attend to the needs of others, your own sense of well-being may head south. Studies of men and women responsible for the long-term care of relatives show higher rates of illness, suppressed immune response, slower healing, and even earlier death among caregivers. Additionally, research reveals that ongoing stress endured by older adults caring for spouses with Alzheimer's disease has a negative impact on the caregiver's own mental functioning.
        In order to give care to others, you need stress relief, support, and time for yourself and your family. Theses ""Tips for taming caregiver stress"" may help.
        • Relaxation response techniques and nurturing techniques are vital. Practicing them often will enable you to feel calmer, happier, and better able to help others. If it's too hard to find the time, consider getting extra help with some household tasks. The Eldercare Locator at www.eldercare.gov can help you find varied services for older adults and their families; it's run by the Administration on Aging. The Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving, at www.rosalynncarter.org, also provides recommendations for evidence-based caregiver support programs.
        • Protect your own health. Research suggests that a caregiver's immune function is often suppressed by the stress of caring for others. Boost your resistance by eating well, getting enough rest and exercise, and pursuing activities that bring you pleasure. Take advantage of regular respite care from professionals, family, and friends to give you much needed breaks.
        • Join a support group to talk out frustrations with other people in your situation and to get helpful ideas. Some caregiver support groups are available online (such as a nationwide chat group run by AARP; for a quick link to it, go to /cgteam). Others are run by local hospitals, senior centers, and community groups.
        • A blend of assertiveness and cognitive restructuring skills can help you share the work, instead of taking on everything yourself. Spell out to other family members what needs to be done and what sort of help would be best. If no one offers help, ask for it. Linking those who can lend a hand has gotten much easier with new websites and apps that help friends, family, and communities coordinate care. Another example of a helpful site is CaringBridge (www.caringbridge.org).
        • When someone offers help, accept. Keep handy a list of small tasks people can do, such as calling regularly, cooking an occasional dinner, shopping, and running errands. You can dole out tasks or ask people to check off what they can do.
        • Accept that circumstances change quickly. Periodically reassess what you can offer and what assistance you need. If it's getting too hard to fulfill certain needs, ask family members for help or consider other options, such as hiring paid caregivers to take on these tasks. Consult a geriatric care manager (www.aginglifecare.org) or social worker for help; your local council on aging or visiting nurse association should be able to help you find one. If necessary, consider another living arrangement that would help you meet your needs and those of your loved one.
        • Accentuate your spiritual connectedness to something greater than yourself, be it to God, community, or the natural world.
        • Remember that you're doing this not solely out of obligation. Focusing on the love you hold for your loved one can help dial back stress when things become frustrating and overwhelming.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/keratosis-pilaris-treatment-and-self-care-for-this-common-skin-condition,Keratosis pilaris: Treatment and self-care for this common skin condition,"Have you or your child ever experienced rough, bumpy ""chicken skin"" on the upper arms and thighs? You are not alone. It is estimated that 50% to 80% of teens and 40% of adults are affected by this common, harmless skin condition known as keratosis pilaris.
        Keratosis pilaris symptoms and causes
        Keratosis pilaris is characterized by the development of small red or flesh-colored bumps that give the skin the appearance of ""gooseflesh."" The bumps most commonly develop on the outside of the upper arms and tops of the thighs but may also be seen on the face, cheeks, and buttocks. Other common symptoms include:
        
          redness of the skin surrounding the bumps
          rough skin texture
          dry skin
          mild itching.
        
        Keratosis pilaris usually appears during childhood or adolescence, and gradually improves with age.
        The cause of keratosis pilaris is not fully understood. It is thought to be caused by a genetic mutation in a protein called filaggrin, which causes the skin to produce too much keratin, the most abundant protein in our skin, hair, and nails. Excess keratin plugs the hair follicles on the skin, which is what causes the characteristic bumps seen in keratosis pilaris. The condition often runs in families. It is also commonly seen in people who have a history of eczema and dry skin.
        Keratosis pilaris treatment options
        While treatment can help diminish the appearance of the characteristic bumps, don't expect any treatment to rapidly clear it.
        There are both over-the-counter and prescription medications available. For example:
        
          topical preparations containing lactic acid, ammonium lactate, salicylic acid, urea, or a combination of these ingredients. Topical treatments are applied to the skin.
          topical retinoids such as tretinoin and adapalene
          topical steroids to help with redness or itching
          laser therapies.
        
        It may take weeks of consistent treatment before you notice an improvement. Treatments should be continued even if your condition improves, to prevent recurrence. The only exception to this is the use of topical steroids including hydrocortisone. Topical steroids should only be used once or twice daily for no more than one to two weeks, unless prescribed differently by a clinician.
        Most often, keratosis pilaris will improve and lessen with time and age.
        Self-care for managing keratosis pilaris
        Keratosis pilaris tends to be worse in the dry winter months. It can also be worsened by clothing that is too tight or too thick and causes friction with the affected areas.
        Self-care tips to improve the appearance of keratosis pilaris include:
        
          Moisturize your skin daily with a non-fragranced, cream-based moisturizer.
          Avoid thick, tight, or abrasive clothing such as wool or spandex.
          Opt for soap-free body cleansers in place of harsh soaps on the affected skin.
          Avoid hot and prolonged baths and showers, which can dry out the skin.
          Do not pick at the bumps.
          Use a humidifier.
        
        The role of exfoliation in treating keratosis pilaris
        Skin exfoliation is a mainstay of treatment for keratosis pilaris. Exfoliation refers to removing dead skin cells from the skin's surface. Exfoliation may be done physically or chemically; both methods smooth the skin surface and flatten the bumps. Exfoliants do not relieve the redness or itching that may be associated with keratosis pilaris.
        Topical exfoliant preparations, known as keratolytics, are generally recommended because physical exfoliation (such as with a loofa) can cause further skin irritation if used too vigorously. Keratolytics contain ingredients such as lactic acid, ammonium lactate, salicylic acid, and urea, which act as chemical exfoliants and gradually smooth the skin.
        All types of exfoliants can cause irritation if used too frequently. It is best to exfoliate two to three times weekly, and slowly increase over time as needed and as your skin becomes more accustomed to the treatment.
        Reduce your use of exfoliants if your symptoms worsen or if you experience dryness, redness, rash, or irritation.
        Distinguishing keratosis pilaris from other skin conditions
        Keratosis pilaris has a similar appearance to other skin conditions including eczema, acne, and folliculitis. The following key features help distinguish keratosis pilaris from these other skin conditions:
        
          Itch. Keratosis pilaris can be itchy on occasion, but usually does not itch. If your skin is red, dry, and very itchy, it's more likely to be dry skin or eczema.
          Bumps. The classic bumps of keratosis pilaris are usually small (1 to 2 mm), numerous, and give a rough or spiny texture to the skin. If you have bumps that are larger, painful, felt beneath the skin, or pus-filled, you may have acne.
          Timing. Keratosis pilaris usually occurs during childhood or early adolescence, and gradually improves in your 20s and 30s. While the condition may worsen or improve with certain factors, it typically never completely goes away. If you experience a sudden onset of red bumps, particularly pus-filled bumps, most commonly after shaving, wearing tight clothing, or spending time in a hot tub, you may be experiencing folliculitis. Folliculitis results from irritation or infection of the hair follicles.","Jennifer Fisher, MMSc, PA-C","January 23, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/strength-training-builds-more-than-muscles,Strength training builds more than muscles,"Most of us know that strength training (with free weights, weight machines, or resistance bands) can help build and maintain muscle mass and strength. What many of us don't know is that strong muscles lead to strong bones. And strong bones can help minimize the risk of fracture due to osteoporosis.
        Osteoporosis should be a concern for all of us. An estimated eight million women and two million men in the United States have osteoporosis. It is now responsible for more than two million fractures each year, and experts expect that number will rise. Hip fractures are usually the most serious. Six out of 10 people who break a hip never fully regain their former level of independence. Even walking across a room without help may become impossible.
        A combination of age-related changes, inactivity, and inadequate nutrition conspire to gradually steal bone mass, at the rate of 1% per year after age 40. As bones grow more fragile and susceptible to fracture, they are more likely to break after even a minor fall, or a far less obvious stress such as bending over to tie a shoelace.
        The good news is that research shows that strength training can play a role in slowing bone loss, and can even build bone. This is tremendously useful to help offset age-related declines in bone mass. Activities that put stress on bones can nudge bone-forming cells into action. That stress comes from the tugging and pushing on bone that occur during strength training (as well as weight-bearing aerobic exercises like walking or running). The result is stronger, denser bones.
        And strength training, in particular, has bone benefits beyond those offered by aerobic weight-bearing exercise. It targets bones of the hips, spine, and wrists, which are the sites most likely to fracture. What's more, resistance workouts — particularly those that include moves emphasizing power and balance — enhance strength and stability. That can boost confidence, encourage you to stay active, and reduce fractures another way: by cutting down on falls.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/when-to-worry-about-worrying,When to worry about worrying,"We all worry. Today, there seems to be no shortage of things to worry about. It's normal to feel anxious on occasion. In fact, temporary anxiety can be a healthy response to uncertainty and danger. But constant worry may be a sign of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
        
          Do I have generalized anxiety disorder?
        
        According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 5.7% of adults in the U.S. experience GAD .  While other types of anxiety disorders arise from particular situations, generalized anxiety disorder is persistent and characterized by debilitating worry and agitation about everyday matters.
        People with generalized anxiety disorder can't shake the feeling that something bad will happen and they will not be prepared. They may worry to excess about missing an appointment, losing a job, or having an accident. Some people even worry about worrying too much.
        
          Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
        
        
          Persistent, excessive worry about several different things for at least six months
          Fatigue, difficulty sleeping, or restlessness
          Trouble concentrating
          Irritability
          Muscle tension
          Feeling tense or ""on edge""
        
        Only your doctor can determine whether you meet the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. If you think you might have this condition, don't hesitate to talk to your primary care doctor. There are many different treatments that can ease the very real discomfort of this condition.
        Physical symptoms are common too and can include a racing heart, dry mouth, upset stomach, muscle tension, sweating, trembling, and irritability. These bodily expressions of anxiety can have a negative effect on physical health. For example, people with generalized anxiety disorder are at greater risk for heart attack and other cardiovascular problems.
        
          Treating anxiety
        
        If you have generalized anxiety disorder, your doctor may discuss the following treatment options.
        
          Therapy. For some people, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help. CBT helps people recognize when they are misinterpreting events, exaggerating difficulties, or making unnecessarily pessimistic assumptions, and offers new ways to respond to anxiety-provoking situations.
          Medications. Commonly prescribed drugs include antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (like Prozac or Zoloft), or dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (like Effexor or Cymbalta). These drugs take longer to work than the traditional anti-anxiety drugs, but also may provide greater symptom relief over time.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/increased-well-being-another-reason-to-try-yoga,Increased well-being: Another reason to try yoga,"How do you feel when you wake up in the morning— refreshed and ready to go, or groggy and grumpy? As many as one in four Americans sleeps less than six hours a night. Insufficient sleep can make you too tired to work efficiently, to exercise, or to eat healthfully.
        Over time, sleep deprivation increases the risks for a number of chronic health problems, including heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. But emerging research shows that yoga may help you fall asleep faster, sleep longer, and sleep more soundly—without the negative side effects of medication.
        
          How does yoga benefit sleep?
        
        Yoga facilitates sleep by reducing stress, anxiety, and arousal—all known causes of poor sleep. One small study looked at a Kundalini meditation and breathing practice. Twenty people who had trouble sleeping did the 30-minute practice every night before going to bed. After eight weeks, researchers found that the participants were sleeping 36 minutes longer on average and waking up less during the night. Overall, the quality of their sleep improved by 11%.
        
          Yoga and sleep for seniors
        
        Sleep problems tend to increase as you get older, but a study done on adults ages 60 and up offers some good news. When scientists surveyed 35 seniors who had been doing a daily yoga practice for at least two years, they found that those who did yoga fell asleep 10 minutes faster, got an extra hour of sleep, and felt more rested when they woke up in the morning, compared with seniors who did not do yoga.
        
          Fall asleep faster
        
        Yoga even helps with full-fledged insomnia. While following common advice on how to get a good night's sleep can reduce sleep problems, people in one study fell asleep 37% faster after eight weeks of yoga compared with 28% for those who received only the advice.
        Research shows that there is a ""dose-response"" effect—meaning that the more you practice yoga, the fewer sleep disturbances you are likely to experience and the more restorative your sleep will be. Even if you don't have problems falling asleep, yoga can improve the quality of your slumber.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/seeking-fitspiration-on-social-media-202401033004,Seeking fitspiration on social media?,"Now that it's 2024, perhaps you've thought about taking up a new exercise program, eating better, or some other ways to improve your health. That's great! Or, as my grandfather would say, ""there's nothing wrong with that"" — his highest possible praise.
        In fact, few medical treatments rival the massive health benefits of regular exercise. But how do you decide which type of exercise is best for you? Well, you could get advice from your doctor or a personal trainer. You might read books on fitness or sample exercise classes. It turns out, though, that many people are simply scrolling through tons of engaging ""fitspirational"" posts on social media. If you do that regularly — more often, say, than taking a brisk walk — a new study suggests you should rethink that strategy.
        What exactly is fitspiration?
        Fitspiration describes social media posts intended to inspire physical fitness and promote health. You can find fitspirational posts on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and other popular social media sites. Typically, they feature glossy photos and videos packaged with exercise and diet recommendations, accompanied by encouraging messages and quotes.
        On Instagram alone, a search for #fitspiration (or related hashtags such as #fitspo) currently lists nearly 100 million posts. Most of them display images of attractive, lean, and fit women as they exercise and talk about fitness and optimizing health.
        What's the problem with fitspiration?
        The potential benefits of a pro-fitness message reaching millions of people are obvious. But the message has to be credible and valid. And, importantly, posts should not convey inaccurate, unhelpful, or even harmful information. That's where the problems start.
        Clearly, social media posts about fitness can have positive effects, according to some research, especially when focused on realistic exercise goals rather than appearance. However, fitspirational posts may have downsides for viewers, including
        
          increased body dissatisfaction
          negative mood
          decreased perception of attractiveness
          embracing thinness as the ideal
          a limited range of diverse body shapes and types, suggesting that beauty is defined by being ultra-fit and thin
          a focus on appearance rather than function and capability.
        
        A study of #fitspiration: Do these social media posts actually inspire fitness?
        A recent study assesses the quality of content with fitspiration hashtags posted by Instagram influencers. The results were disappointing, though not surprising.
        The authors identified 100 Instagram accounts of the most popular fitspiration influencers. Each of these accounts' last 15 posts was analyzed. Posts were not considered credible if they
        
          displayed nudity or revealing clothing, such as wearing a bikini at the gym
          sexualized the person exercising, such as focusing on a woman's breasts
          included images of extreme body types, such as people who are severely underweight or extremely muscular
          conveyed messages encouraging thinness or other negative messages rather than emphasizing health
          contained fitness information in three or fewer posts out of 15.
        
        Here's what the researchers found:
        
          26% portrayed sexualized images
          22% posted nudity or images of people exercising in revealing clothing not appropriate for exercise
          15% featured people with extreme body types
          41% posted fitness-related content in three or fewer posts.
        
        A quarter of these accounts failed the credibility test on more than one of these criteria. Even among the accounts considered credible, only half were posted by people with credentials related to fitness or health, such as certification as a physical therapist or personal trainer.
        While this study did not examine whether the posts had an actual impact on fitness outcomes, the findings raise questions about the quality of fitspiration content.
        What does this mean for you?
        If you're looking for fitness-related health content, seek out the best information you can. Be skeptical of any sources lacking credentials related to fitness. Be especially wary of posts selling a product or service.
        The authors of this study established certain criteria for fitness-related content they reviewed. You could apply this to posts you see online.
        The bottom line
        It should be no surprise to find that when it comes to health information, social media may not always be the best place to start.
        While taking steps to improve your health is commendable — truly, there's nothing wrong with that! — getting motivated to be more physically active is just a start. Information you rely on to improve your physical fitness shouldn't just look appealing. It should be well-vetted for safety and backed by solid evidence that it can actually improve your health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/bed-bug-bites-how-to-identify-them-get-relief-and-prevent-future-bites,"Bed bug bites: How to identify them, get relief, and prevent future bites","Bed bugs are a nuisance that can cause itchy, uncomfortable bites. Bed bug infestations can be tricky to identify and difficult to eliminate.
        What are bed bugs and what do they look like?
        Bed bugs are small, parasitic insects that need human or animal blood to survive. They ingest this blood when they bite. Though they do not transmit disease, their bites can be irritating. Bed bugs are found all over the world and are difficult to control.
        Even if you have a bed bug infestation, you may not see many bed bugs because the pests are primarily nocturnal, coming out to feed during the night. In addition, their small size allows them to hide in hard-to-reach places such as seams of mattresses or inside cracks or crevices.
        Bed bugs look different depending on their life stage:
        
          Adult bed bugs are small, oval, flat, reddish-brown in color, and wingless. They are approximately the size of an apple seed (3/16 to 1/4 inch long). Bed bugs swell and become more elongated after feeding.
          Young bed bugs are called nymphs. They are smaller, translucent, or whitish-yellow in color. They can be nearly invisible if they have not recently fed (the blood gives them a reddish-brown color).
          Bed bug eggs are pearl white and are very small, about the size of a pinhead.
        
        
          
        
        What do bed bug bites look like?
        A bed bug bite may appear red and slightly swollen. The bite marks may be random, appear in a straight line, or in a zigzag pattern. Bite marks often appear in clusters of three to five bites. Bed bug bites may be mistaken for mosquito, flea, or spider bites, or for a rash or hives.
        Bed bug bite symptoms
        Most people do not immediately realize they have been bitten by bed bugs because the insects inject an anesthetic and an anticoagulant (a substance that prevents blood from clotting), which make it harder to detect the bite. In some cases, it can take up to 14 days after the initial bite for a bite mark to appear.
        Some people never show bite marks or may develop just a small bite mark. Others may experience bites that are itchy, irritating, red, and swollen. Some people have an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, developing large, painful, swollen bite marks. On very rare occasions, an allergic reaction to bed bug bites can cause anaphylaxis.
        Bed bug bites may also cause insomnia, anxiety, and skin infections caused by excessive scratching.
        Bed bug bite treatment
        Bed bug bites are not dangerous and usually heal on their own within a week or two. Excessive scratching, however, can lead to infection at the site of the bite. It's best to avoid scratching the bites to reduce the risk of infection.
        The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends the following measures to manage uncomfortable bed bug bites.
        
          Clean the bite marks with soap and water.
          Apply an over-the-counter corticosteroid cream or calamine lotion to help with itching and inflammation.
          Use an oral antihistamine, if needed, for symptom relief.
        
        You should see your doctor if you have many bites, blisters, an allergic reaction, or signs of a skin infection (redness, puss, oozing).
        Bed bug bite prevention
        The best way to prevent bed bug bites is to avoid bed bugs in the first place. Bed bugs have a tendency to move with us and our possessions. Because bed bugs need human or animal blood to survive, they prefer to live close to their host, near nests (or beds, in the case of humans).
        Expert hitchhikers, bed bugs can infest new locations by hiding in luggage, clothing, or other items that people carry with them. They can move from room to room (or apartment to apartment) through floors, door gaps, electrical outlets, or through furniture, books, or clothing.
        Bed bugs can also be transported into your home with secondhand furniture or household items. Always inspect these items closely before bringing them inside your home.
        Traveling is another means for bringing bed bugs into your home. Be aware of the signs of a bed bug infestation when you travel so you don't unknowingly bring the pests home with you. The National Pest Management Association (NPMA) recommends these tips:
        When traveling:
        
          Avoid placing luggage on carpets, beds, or upholstered furniture. Try to place your luggage in the bathtub while you inspect the room for signs of bed bugs.
          Pull back bed sheets, inspect mattress seams and box springs. Look for small dark blood stains, blackish specks, or shed bed bug skins.
          Check behind the headboard, inside dresser drawers, sofas, and chairs.
        
        At home:
        
          Look for bed bugs in suitcases and bags outdoors before bringing them inside your home.
          Vacuum your suitcase or use a garment hand steamer to kill any bed bugs or eggs.
          Wash and dry all clothes — even unworn ones — on hot cycles.
        
        Handling a bed bug infestation
        If you suspect a bed bug infestation, look for the following evidence:
        
          bed bugs in the folds of mattresses, bedding, furniture, and anywhere else where they can hide
          bed bug skins, or exoskeletons, that have been shed
          small, dark, rust-colored spots and black specks
          a sweet, musty odor.
        
        If you have a bed bug infestation, contact a qualified pest control professional. Also known as a bed bug exterminator, this type of expert can inspect your home for bed bugs and eliminate them.
        Bed bug spray
        If you choose to handle a bed bug infestation on your own, there are more than 300 products approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that can be used by consumers to control bed bugs. You can use the EPA's Bed Bug Product Search tool to find the best pesticide for your needs.",Jenette Restivo,"January 3, 2024",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/7-things-your-personal-trainer-wants-you-to-know,7 things your personal trainer wants you to know,"Working with a personal trainer is a helpful step toward reaching your exercise and fitness goals. Trainers are pros at developing routines for your specific needs, teaching you how to perform exercises properly, and keeping you motivated. Yet it takes more than a weekly session to maximize exercise benefits. Here are seven important strategies personal trainers want you to practice.
        1. Do your homework
        If your trainer recommends exercising a certain number of times per week, follow the advice. ""My job is augmenting what you do on your own. To make progress, do the routine at least once in a training session and twice on your own, and possibly more depending on your health,"" says Vijay Daryanani, a certified personal trainer and physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        2. Strength train first
        When you strengthen your muscles (with free weights, for example), your body uses stored sugar (glycogen) for energy. Daryanani recommends doing that before starting aerobic exercise that works your heart and lungs (such as brisk walking or a dance workout).
        ""It takes about 20 minutes to burn through glycogen stored in the muscles,"" he says. ""When that's gone, the best fuel source for your body will be fat, so that's the better time to try to burn fat with an aerobic workout.""
        Remember to warm up for a few minutes before any type of workout. March in place and move your arms, walk on a treadmill, ride a stationary bike, or use an elliptical machine.
        3. Rest your muscles
        A strengthening routine makes microscopic tears in the muscle fibers. Resting your muscles for a couple of days gives them time to repair, recover, and grow back stronger. ""Ideally, focus on your upper-body muscles one day, and your lower-body muscles the next,"" Daryanani says. ""Or work both muscle groups in one workout, but take a day off before your next exercise session.""
        Sleeping seven to nine hours per night is also essential to the repair and recovery process, not just for your muscles but for your entire body, especially your brain, blood vessels, and heart.
        4. Switch up your routine
        Doing the same exercises all the time can cause the muscles to become complacent and stop getting stronger. Daryanani advises that you challenge your muscles with a variety of exercises. ""Work the same muscles, but do it a little differently. For example, if you're doing squats, mix in some lunges. Slight changes in positions and angles are enough to make the muscles work harder,"" he says.
        5. Stretch regularly
        Stretching keeps your muscles long and supple, which makes them more flexible, protects them from injury, and improves your range of motion. The best time to stretch the muscles is once they're warmed up, either after a quick warm-up or a regular workout. Stretch all of the major muscle groups — including the neck, shoulders, chest, trunk, lower back, hips, legs, and ankles — at least a few times per week. And don't bounce during a stretch; that can injure muscle fibers. ""Hold the stretch,"" Daryanani says. ""A 30-second stretch is fine, and a 60-second stretch is even more effective.""
        6. Eat a healthy diet
        Give your body healthy fuels that come from hydration and good food. You need three to six cups of fluids (such as water, juice, or watery foods like soups) each day, and more if you work up a serious sweat during a workout. And eat a plant-based diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains; moderate amounts of fish, and poultry; and limited portions of red or processed meats. What if your diet goes off the rails sometimes? ""It won't ruin the benefit of exercise, but it sure won't help it,"" Daryanani says.
        7. Exercise with purpose
        Exercising takes time and work. Daryanani says it requires purpose, too. ""A workout shouldn't be something you just check off your to-do list,"" he says. ""Be thoughtful about it. Ask how you can make your routine more effective and get the most benefits from it. Then, go the extra mile and work out in a way that will move the dial closer to your goals. I can help people do that, but it's up to them to make it happen regularly.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/questions-and-answers-about-the-new-anti-obesity-medications,Questions and answers about the new anti-obesity medications,"A blockbuster batch of anti-obesity drugs continues to grab headlines and dominate social media posts, and not just because the new year revs up our resolve to shed pounds. The medications — semaglutide (Wegovy), liraglutide (Saxenda), and tirzepatide (Zepbound) — are backed by science and stunning accounts of people losing as much as 20% of their body weight.
        While that's remarkable, it's not the whole story. Many questions about the drugs remain, and some answers are complicated.
        What are they?
        The recently FDA-approved anti-obesity medications are in a class called GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s). They mimic a hormone (glucagon-like peptide 1) that helps the body slow stomach emptying, control blood sugar levels, and suppress appetite, a combination that leads to weight loss. One of the drugs, Zepbound, mimics GLP-1 as well as a hormone called a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), believed to promote the effects of GLP-1.
        ""Many people say these anti-obesity medications have changed their lives,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, an obesity medicine specialist and co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        The drugs also significantly reduce the risk of death from heart-related causes in people with overweight or obesity as well as heart disease (or both heart disease and diabetes, depending on the drug). Plus, they enhance the ability to exercise and boost quality of life. ""The medications may even affect the reward center in the brain, the part that enables you to eat chocolate cake even though you're full. These drugs seem to dampen the reward response, which also may reduce addictive behaviors like cravings for alcohol, sugar, and nicotine,"" Dr. Apovian says.
        Wait — aren't they diabetes drugs?
        All three of the anti-obesity drugs were first approved by the FDA just to treat diabetes, under the brand names Ozempic, Victoza, and Mounjaro.
        But people taking them noticed they were losing substantial amounts of weight. Studies confirmed this effect, and the FDA eventually approved the medications for weight loss, under new brand names: Wegovy, Saxenda, and Zepbound. For overweight or obesity, the drugs are typically prescribed in higher doses than their diabetes counterparts.
        There are older GLP-1s approved for diabetes, such as dulaglutide (Trulicity), but these treatments have less effect on weight.
        How do you take the medications?
        Most of these new drugs come in the form of injections that you give yourself daily or weekly. They are loaded in an injector pen (like an EpiPen for an allergic reaction) that you press against your abdomen or thigh.
        A pill form of semaglutide (Rybelsus) is also available. It's FDA-approved to treat diabetes, but not yet approved for weight loss. Several other pill formulations are being tested.
        What are the side effects?
        Both the anti-obesity and diabetes formulations have potential side effects. Common ones include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or constipation. Dr. Apovian says those tend to go away after a few weeks.
        In rare cases, the drugs might cause an obstruction in the small bowel, gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), or inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).
        ""As far as I know, side effects are not permanent. They go away if you stop taking the medications,"" Dr. Apovian says. But the very long-term effects of taking the newer medications are not yet known.""
        Who's a candidate for the drugs?
        The drugs are approved for weight loss only in people diagnosed with obesity (a BMI of 30 or greater) or a higher range of overweight (a BMI of 27 to 29.9), as well as a medical problem related to excess weight, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Of course, that hasn't stopped some people who don't meet these criteria from using them.
        Because these drugs are new and powerful, and are the subject of intense study, it is expected that recommendations as to who should use them will change in the coming years. Researchers are likely to identify new groups of people who might benefit — or, conversely, people who may be at extra risk from drug side effects.
        How long do you take the drugs?
        Taking one of the new GLP-1s is not a short-term solution. Once you go on the drug, you must stay on it indefinitely to keep getting the benefits. You regain the weight if you stop taking the medications.
        ""Overweight and obesity, like diabetes and hypertension, are serious conditions that often require ongoing, even lifelong treatment. There are no 'one-and-done' treatments,"" Dr. Apovian says.
        Costs and coverage
        Spectacular results don't come cheaply, and the new drugs range from about $900 to $1,600 per month. Don't expect your insurance to pay for them. Medicare does not cover the anti-obesity medications, and Medicare coverage for the new diabetes drugs is iffy and partial at best, depending on your plan. Private insurance often will pay for the drugs to treat diabetes, as long as you've tried other diabetes treatments without success. But Dr. Apovian says only about 20% to 30% of private insurers currently are covering the anti-obesity formulations.
        Some manufacturers of GLP-1s offer coupons with steep discounts, but many pharmacies don't accept them. And beware of budget-friendly versions touted in online ads or offered by ""med-spas."" Dr. Apovian says these are compounded (custom-mixed) drugs brought in from other countries, with no oversight by the FDA, and no guarantee of what they contain.
        Are they even available?
        To make matters worse, the drugs' frenzied rise in popularity has now caused shortages, making them hard to find. ""The shortage has to do with the manufacturers not anticipating this kind of demand,"" Dr. Apovian says. ""Over 40% of Americans have obesity. The drug companies didn't anticipate how many of them would want to use the medications. The companies are trying desperately to make enough supplies as we speak.""
        Until they do, and until more insurance companies cover the medications or manufacturers are forced to lower prices (both of which are being debated in Congress), many people with serious medical conditions are finding that they must forgo the most effective anti-obesity drugs we've ever seen.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/does-your-gut-affect-your-risk-for-alzheimers-disease,Does your gut affect your risk for Alzheimer's disease?,"Q. 
          I know that your genes and lifestyle can influence your risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. Now I read that microbes in our guts also may be involved. Really?
        
        A. Genes and lifestyle both influence our risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. And, as strange as it may seem, so may the microbes in our gut.
        We've known for nearly 200 years that microbes live on and in us. We thought they were just living off the warmth and nutrients that our bodies provided to them — invisible freeloaders that had no effect on our health. Beginning about 20 years ago, we began to learn that was wrong. Like humans, microbes have genes. All of the different genes of the microbes that live on us or in us, collectively, are called our ""microbiome."" To our surprise, we've learned that these microbe genes can make chemicals that can affect human health.
        We now know that our microbiome can affect our risk for obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other important diseases. A study reported in October 2023 in the prestigious scientific journal Brain finds that our microbiome may even influence our risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
        Previous studies had reported that in people with Alzheimer's disease, some particular species of gut bacteria are more prevalent, while other species are less so, compared to people without the disease. But that did not answer the cart-and-horse question: does the disease affect the difference in the gut bacteria, or does the difference in the gut bacteria affect the disease?
        The new study provides provocative evidence that the gut bacteria may actually influence the risk of getting the disease. The research team took a group of healthy young rats and eliminated all bacteria from their guts. Then the team collected bowel movement samples from people with Alzheimer's disease and from people with normal cognition and no signs of the disease. Such samples are full of gut bacteria. Then the samples from humans were squirted into the rats' guts.
        The microbiome from people with Alzheimer's disease — but not the microbiome from people without the disease — caused some Alzheimer's-like changes in the rats' brains. Those rats also developed memory impairments. Moreover, the rats that received the microbiomes from the most severely affected Alzheimer's patients developed the greatest brain abnormalities and memory problems.
        It will require much more research to confirm that our gut microbiome influences our risk of Alzheimer's disease—and, if so, how it does so. The answer to that last question could someday point to treatments that can treat or even prevent Alzheimer's disease.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tips-to-navigate-a-sleep-divorce,"Tips to navigate a ""sleep divorce""","When your bed partner regularly shatters your good night's rest — by snoring, kicking, tossing and turning, or stealing the covers, for example — you might wonder if you'd be better off sleeping apart. And you're not alone if you give it a try.
        A 2023 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that a third of respondents reported occasionally or regularly sleeping in separate rooms to accommodate a bed partner. Just keep in mind that the arrangement comes with a risk. ""Your relationship might suffer, especially if one person doesn't want to sleep apart or doesn't like the new sleeping environment,"" says Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        Here's what you can do if you're considering a ""sleep divorce.""
        
          
            
              
                Why consider a sleep divorce?
                Sleeping apart seems counterintuitive for couples. But a good night's sleep is very important for health.
                ""Sleep deprivation promotes depression, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating, which can keep you from engaging well with your partner. A lack of sleep also increases the risk for chronic health problems such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cognitive decline,"" notes Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
                The goal is to sleep seven to nine hours per night. Work with your partner to make sleep a priority for both of you. And make that sleep top quality.
              
            
          
        
        Have a heart-to-heart first
        Discuss your partner's disruptive sleep behaviors with compassion, and talk about the problems that result for both of you. ""The conversation can be embarrassing. It requires you to be vulnerable, and a lot of sensitive topics might come up beyond sleep behavior,"" Dr. Collier says. ""If it's hard to communicate about it, consider a couples counseling session with an objective third party to guide you.""
        Seek a compromise
        Before seeking a complete sleep divorce, consider compromises that are acceptable to both of you. ""For example, if your partner's snoring wakes you up, try wearing earplugs, use a bedside sound machine, or wear earbuds and listen to a podcast as you fall asleep,"" Dr. Collier suggests. If snoring is a problem, your partner could try sleeping on his or her side and seeing a doctor to find out what's causing the snoring. Dr. Collier recommends you go together to the doctor's appointment so you both learn about any possible underlying conditions and treatments, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for sleep apnea.
        ""Another solution could be sleeping separately in the same room. Perhaps you each get a bed. That's helpful when one person awakens frequently to urinate or has involuntary twitching movements in the legs during sleep. Another idea is napping in the same place during the day but sleeping apart at night.""
        Sleeping apart successfully
        If you decide to try sleeping apart, consider following these guidelines.
        Make both sleeping spaces cozy. ""Neither of you should have to sleep on the couch,"" Dr. Collier says. ""You both need a good mattress and a comfortable sleeping environment that's cool, dark, and inviting. Make sure both parties are happy.""
        Schedule intimacy. Sharing a bed promotes personal connection, sexual activity, and feelings of comfort and security. To get the same intimacy when you sleep apart, Dr. Collier says, you must make a concerted effort. For example, if nighttime is when you have sex, cuddle, or share meaningful details of your day, schedule that before bedtime, and then move to separate rooms after your time together. Or set aside time for closeness during the day and make it a priority.
        Create a nighttime routine. It can be tough sleeping alone after years of being together, especially if you have anxiety or stress. ""You'll have to develop your own bedtime routine, one that makes you feel relaxed and sleepy, such as reading for a little while and then turning out the light and listening to a bedside sound machine. If you miss the comfort and security of your partner, sleeping with a body pillow or a weighted blanket might help,"" Dr. Collier says. ""Or, talk to your partner on the phone or in a video call as you're going to sleep. That way you can still be together.""
        Assess the arrangement regularly. Check in with each other daily to see what's working and what isn't. ""It's not good enough if it's helpful only for one person,"" Dr. Collier says. ""Go back to the drawing board and come up with something better. Your relationship is at stake, and so is your health and well-being. Sleeping apart can be beneficial if both parties are happy with the setup, both parties sleep well, and you continue to nurture your relationship.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/what-can-i-do-about-my-beer-belly,"What can I do about my ""beer belly""?","Q. 
          It seems like more men are developing ""beer bellies"" as they age, including me. What causes it, and is it just a cosmetic problem?
        
        A. It's unclear when the term ""beer belly"" originated, but in the distant past, keg-shaped abdomens were uncommon. They tended to occur in men who drank heavily, especially high-calorie beers.
        Today, excessive beer drinking can still play a role in men's expanding girth. However, most men with beer bellies do not overuse alcohol. So why is it happening? Experts believe the unintended consequences of an old public health message and the conveniences of modern living are the two primary reasons.
        Decades ago, public health advocates pushed the importance of decreasing the intake of dietary fats to help control the rising rate of cardiovascular disease, but with little or no emphasis on choosing healthy versus unhealthy fats. In response, food companies moved to products with ""no"" or ""low"" fat. But instead, they created products with higher amounts of simple carbohydrates, especially added sugars. Many experts think this is a significant cause of the rising obesity problem.
        During this same time, the conveniences of modern life led to less daily physical activity. And many men have not dedicated time for the recommended 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise.
        Regarding cosmetic versus health issues from a beer belly, it matters where the body fat is deposited. Subcutaneous fat lies under our skin. Fat accumulating around our organs deep inside our abdomen is called visceral or belly fat. Any excess body fat can lead to a higher risk of health issues, like knee and hip osteoarthritis. However, extra visceral fat is more dangerous because it is closely linked to a greater chance of developing diabetes and heart disease.
        There's another much less common but important reason for a round belly: fluid accumulation within the abdomen known as ascites. Ascites most often happens in people with cirrhosis of the liver. But it can also signal heart failure or (rarely) cancer.
        Although not precise, one way to determine if your beer belly consists primarily of subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, or ascites is how the fat moves and feels. Fat that is soft and jiggles is more likely just under the skin, while a harder belly tends to indicate more visceral fat or perhaps ascites.
        If your waist size measured at your navel is 40 inches or more, it's best to let your doctor help determine the cause of your beer belly. Unless it's due to ascites, you probably already know what your doctor will advise: consume fewer calories, cut out the simple carbs, and schedule time for daily exercise. And, of course, cut back on the beer.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/time-for-your-annual-health-review,Time for your annual health review,"The start of a new year is always a great opportunity to re-engage with your health. And one of the first steps is to conduct a personal health review. ""It's a way to measure where your health stands now, outline what goals you hope to accomplish, and devise a strategy in partnership with your physician, mapping out how to reach them,"" says Dr. Jeremy Whyman, a geriatrician and specialist in internal medicine and palliative medicine at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        A personal health review follows a three-step process: gathering all your current health information, listing your goals, and sharing everything with your doctor during a scheduled wellness visit.
        Gather the information
        First, make a list of key health points from the past year. ""Include everything from routine check-ins with other specialists to urgent care visits to diagnostic tests,"" says Dr. Whyman. ""Be as detailed and concise as possible. Nothing is not relevant when looking at your overall health."" Here are some examples of information you should collect (your patient portal can help):
        
          Have you seen a new doctor or specialist for any reason?
          What tests did you have and what were the results and conclusions reached?
          What medications do you currently take and do you take them regularly? Did you begin taking any new medications? Did you stop taking any, or was your dose adjusted?
          What routine check-ups did you have (dental, eye, skin, hearing, foot)? What were the results? Were any recommendations given?
          Did you have any surgery or treatment?
          Did you suffer from an injury? Even a minor one?
        
        Another component of important health information you need to record is lifestyle issues, such as exercise routine, weight pattern, diet, and emotional health. Here's a look at what points you should include and how each can fit into your future health goals.
        Exercise: Outline your regular exercise activities (what you do daily and weekly, and for how long. For example, strength training, aerobic exercise, flexibility, or some combination). Also, highlight if these are new endeavors or continuous ones and how motivated you feel about your overall exercise efforts. ""You might be ready to increase your efforts in certain areas or be open to adapt your usual workouts with something new to increase motivation,"" says Dr. Whyman. ""Be explicit with your physician about what you are and are not ready to pursue. This helps focus the conversation during the visit."" Also, note any injuries or recurring aches that may have hindered your workouts, like a sore knee or back. ""If you have had physical therapy for an issue, make sure you include that, too,"" says Dr. Whyman.
        Weight: Has your weight gone up or down over the past year? Did it fluctuate? Do you feel you are at a comfortable weight? ""If weight loss is a goal, define a reasonable idea of how much you should aim to lose,"" says Dr. Whyman.
        Diet. Do you follow a specific diet or eating plan, like a Mediterranean diet? If not, what do your daily meals look like? ""It's difficult to provide detailed accounts of every daily meal but try to paint a picture of your usual eating habits and be as honest as you can. It's so important for your physician to know the good and the bad,"" says Dr. Whyman. What area(s) do you think are your strengths (for example, eating whole grains for breakfast and fruit for snacks) and weaknesses (for instance, skipping meals or eating too much red meat or snack foods)?
        Mental health. How has your mood been over the past year? Have you experienced any periods of time where you've felt depressed or anxious? Did you suffer a personal loss or setback? ""Everyone has the occasional down day but note any specific times where you felt low or anxious for an extended period, or if it interfered with your life, preventing you from being with friends or family, doing important work or even completing routine tasks that usually come easy to you,"" says Dr. Whyman. ""A lot of men often don't like talking about their mental health, but it could be an underlying barrier that needs to be addressed.""
        Outline your goals
        Next, choose three health goals and rank them. ""You don't want to take on too much, but selecting three goals is manageable, and prioritizing them helps you and your doctor determine what changes need to be made first,"" says Dr. Whyman.
        Some examples: increase strength and endurance to interact with grandchildren, improve your functional fitness so you can do daily chores, and continue to live independently. ""Think in terms of what you would like to achieve in the short term and the long term,"" says Dr. Whyman.
        Schedule a wellness visit
        When you schedule your annual get-together with your primary care physician, make sure the office staff indicates it is an ""Annual Wellness Visit."" Then it will be fully covered by Medicare, as well as by most other health insurance plans.
        This consultation can help your doctor identify areas that need improvement or adjustments and devise a strategy to follow. ""Your physician is like a quarterback overseeing the entire offense,"" says Dr. Whyman.
        For instance, knowing what other health care you have received, including drug prescriptions, can help your doctor determine if any changes in doses should be addressed with your specialists to match your health goals.
        Regarding exercise, your doctor may advise strategies to overcome obstacles and address your goals — for example, adopting a step counter to help you walk more, switching to a treadmill or elliptical trainer, or hiring a personal trainer to increase strength training. ""He or she also can help identify problems or barriers that may hinder your exercise, like arthritis or tendinitis,"" says Dr. Whyman.
        Your doctor can also suggest changes to your eating habits, like increasing protein to combat natural muscle loss and offering healthy alternatives to satisfy cravings. Seeing a nutritionist may be recommended if you have trouble making healthy choices. If you have weight issues (significant losses or gains), the conversation might reveal other undiagnosed issues such as depression or a thyroid problem.
        Your doctor also will want to ensure you are up to date on cancer screenings based on your age and family history. For men, this may include colon cancer screening and possibly PSA blood testing for prostate cancer. Your doctor also will review your immunization history and recommend vaccines or boosters for which you are due.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/poor-sleep-linked-to-high-blood-pressure,Poor sleep linked to high blood pressure,"Sleep problems — including trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, and too little sleep — are associated with a greater risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) in women, according to a new study.
        Published in the Nov. 2023 issue of Hypertension, the study tracked the health of 66,122 women for 16 years. When the study began in 2001, the women ranged in age from 25 to 42 and didn't have hypertension.
        After researchers accounted for various demographic and lifestyle factors, they found that compared to women who slept seven to eight hours daily, those who slept six or five hours were 7% and 10%, respectively, more likely to develop hypertension. Women who said they sometimes or usually had trouble falling or staying asleep were 14% and 28% more likely to have hypertension, respectively, compared to those who rarely had trouble sleeping.
        The findings don't prove that sleep problems cause elevated blood pressure. However, as the authors suggest, one possible explanation for the link may be increased stress, which is associated both with poor sleep and high blood pressure.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-you-worry-about-your-waistline,Should you worry about your waistline?,"Extra padding around your midsection goes by many different names — a spare tire, muffin top, or love handles. Too much of any type of fat isn't healthy, but some forms are worse than others. The flab you can pinch between your fingers is known as subcutaneous fat, which lies just beneath the skin. A more worrisome type of fat lies deep within the abdominal cavity, padding the space between your organs (see illustration).
        Known as visceral fat, it does more than add inches around your waistline; it also raises your risk of cardiovascular problems. ""Growing evidence suggests that your waist circumference is a better predictor of heart disease than your body mass index,"" says Dr. Osama Hamdy, medical director of the Obesity Clinical Program at Harvard-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center. Body mass index (BMI), an indirect estimate of body fat based on height and weight, doesn't distinguish between the different types of fat. ""People can have what's considered a healthy BMI but still have a large belly and visceral fat,"" says Dr. Hamdy.
        Another measurement, the waist-to-hip ratio, correlates with visceral fat. But there's no need to do that extra hip measurement or math because waist circumference alone is strongly linked to visceral fat, says Dr. Hamdy. Just make sure you measure correctly (see ""Gut check: How to measure your midsection"").
        Why is visceral fat dangerous?
        Visceral fat is also a marker for ectopic fat, which refers to fat that accumulates inside organs (such as the liver, heart, and pancreas) and muscles. Both type of fat are closely tied to metabolic problems, especially type 2 diabetes — which, in turn, is a potent risk factor for heart disease. In addition, visceral fat secretes hormones and other inflammatory factors, collectively called adipokines or cytokines, which trigger a buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries (atherosclerosis).
        Who's at risk?
        Your genes, ethnic background, and sex all influence how likely you are to accumulate visceral fat. Native Americans (notably the Pima tribe), Hispanics, and people living in India and South Asia have a higher likelihood of abdominal obesity (as well as diabetes). In addition, white men and black women tend to accumulate relatively more visceral fat compared with black men and white women.
        
          
            
              
                Gut check: How to measure your midsection
                To measure your waist accurately, wrap a measuring tape around your bare abdomen just above the upper border of your hipbone, which you can easily feel on both sides. Usually, the tape measure will cross your bellybutton, but not for everyone. Make sure the tape measure isn't twisted and that it stays taut, but not tight enough to compress the area. Don't suck in your gut or hold your breath. Check the number right after you exhale.
                For women, a waist circumference of 35 inches or higher signals a high risk. For men, it's 40 inches or higher. Ideally, your waist circumference should be no greater than one-half your height.
              
            
          
        
        What helps to banish a big belly?
        Although some people are predisposed to larger midsections, there's a lot you can do to remedy the problem, says Dr. Hamdy.
        Get regular exercise. Sit-ups or other abdominal exercises won't shrink your belly. Instead, you need to burn calories to lose fat and build muscle through a combination of aerobic and strength training. Aim for at least 30 minutes daily of moderate-intensity exercise (like brisk walking), and do strength-based exercise at least two days per week.
        Follow a healthy, reduced-carbohydrate diet. Avoid foods and drinks with added sugars and other simple carbohydrates that spike blood sugar and encourage your body to store fat. These include foods made with white flour (common culprits include what Dr. Hamdy calls the ""P's and B's"": pasta, pizza, pretzels, bread, and bagels) and starchy foods, such as white potatoes, white rice, and corn.
        Try time-restricted eating. Some research suggests this strategy may lower blood sugar levels and reduce visceral fat. There are many ways to structure your eating; for example, you might eat only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., and fast during the other 16 hours. This not only limits calorie intake but also kick-starts the body's fat-burning process.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-you-should-walk-with-a-doc,"Why you should ""Walk with a Doc""","You know that walking helps your heart. So does spending time with other people, being outside in nature, and learning about ways to improve your health and well-being from a professional. Want to get all four at once? Show up at a Walk with a Doc event.
        Launched in 2005, this nonprofit organization sponsors free, doctor-led walks in mostly outdoor venues (usually public parks) across America. Today, Walk with a Doc is in 34 countries worldwide, including 560 communities around the United States. In surveys and focus groups, participants give the program high marks. Nearly all of the responders — 96% — say they strongly agree that Walk with a Doc has helped them lead a healthier lifestyle, according to a 2020 article in Current Cardiology Reports co-authored by Walk with a Doc founder Dr. David Sabgir.
        The program's initial inspiration was to encourage people to be less sedentary. But the informal teaching that happens before and during the walks is a boon for patients and doctors alike, says cardiologist Dr. Simin Lee, associate physician at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""In our current health care system, most of the care is compressed into a short office visit,"" she says. Walk with a Doc gives physicians time to discuss important health topics — such as exercise, diet, and stress management — in greater depth. Dr. Lee started the Walk with a Doc chapter in Jamacia Plain, the Boston neighborhood bordering the Longwood Medical Area, which is home to Harvard Medical School and many of its affiliated medical institutions.
        Walking and talking
        ""Most of the chapters do monthly walks, but I wanted to encourage continuity and habit formation, so I did my walks every week,"" says Dr. Lee. The walks, which are currently led by her Brigham and Women's colleague Dr. Catherine Hwang, feature a 1.5-mile loop around Jamaica Pond every Wednesday evening at 5:30 pm. In general, weekday walks are usually about 30 minutes long; weekend walks may last 60 to 90 minutes.
        About five minutes before starting the walk, the doctor speaks on various topics of interest, including those requested by the participants. For her initial talks, Dr. Lee focused on the recommended ""dose"" of exercise. During the walk, she demonstrated what moderate-intensity exercise looks like. ""I'd tell people to notice how I could still talk in full sentences but that my breathing was a little heavier than when we were just standing around,"" she says.
        During later walks, she taught interval training by cueing the group to pick up their walking pace for a few minutes, and to then pull back and return to their normal walking speed. Interval training is a good way to add variety to your workout and is especially helpful for improving cardiovascular fitness, she notes.
        ""Sometimes, it can feel futile to just rattle off some basic counseling about exercise during an office visit. It's so much more powerful when you can demonstrate it in person,"" she says. As much as we appreciate all the medications we have at our fingertips to manage cardiovascular disease, people really are interested in doing things for their health that doesn't involve taking pills, Dr. Lee says. She also did a series of talks about how exercise benefits so many chronic health conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, dementia, and cancer.
        Camaraderie and pleasant scenery
        As Dr. Sabgir wrote in his article, most Americans are living lives that are sedentary, lonely, and not connected with nature. Many Walk with a Doc programs, including Dr. Lee's, have helped foster social connections and forged friendships among the participants. The walks she led often included 10 or more people, who would sometimes bring friends or family members along. ""Creating a shared sense of community is a really important aspect of the program,"" she says.
        So is the stress-relieving power of spending time in nature, which has become less and less common. Research suggests that over half of all Americans spend fewer than five hours outdoors each week. ""In our increasingly digital world, where people spend a lot of time inside in front of screens, it's just lovely to be outside to get fresh air and witness a beautiful sunset and the changing seasons,"" says Dr. Lee.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-does-coffee-help-with-digestion,Why does coffee help with digestion?,"Q. 
          I love my morning cup of joe, but I've noticed it also sends me straight to the bathroom for a bowel movement. Why can coffee have a laxative effect?
        
        A. Since about half of American adults profess to drink coffee every day, this perennially popular drink must boast some pretty compelling benefits. Beyond waking up our brains, coffee also helps jolt some people's digestive tracts.
        This happens for several reasons. A 2021 study suggests that two hormones coffee boosts — gastrin and cholecystokinin — trigger the so‑called gastrocolic reflex, prompting the colon to contract and move waste through the rectum. Since colon contractions tend to be strongest in the morning anyway, drinking coffee plays into this natural digestive process. This hormonal action is specific to coffee, not tea or other drinks, but coffee's caffeine content heightens this effect by increasing colon contractions and stool movement. For some people, this can happen within minutes; for others, it might take hours — or not happen at all.
        On the other hand, people who tend to be constipated often find that their morning cup of coffee helps keep them regular. But don't drink excessive amounts of coffee just for this reason. It can make us jittery or worsen the symptoms of certain conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, glaucoma, or overactive bladder.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/why-am-i-prone-to-skin-tags,Why am I prone to skin tags?,"Q. 
          I've had a couple of skin tags over the years, but lately several have popped up. Why?
        
        A. These fleshy, soft growths — which are more common among women — are unquestionably annoying. They can sprout almost anywhere on the skin, but skin tags tend to develop on the neck, under the arms, or around the groin.
        While skin tags can be unattractive, the good news is that they're benign and won't develop into cancer. But they're linked with several health conditions that aren't harmless, which is why you should be concerned if you're developing more of them. These include diabetes or metabolic syndrome (a constellation of high blood pressure, unhealthy blood sugar levels, extra fat around your waist, and unhealthy cholesterol levels). Skin tags are also more common if you're pregnant or obese, or if you have family members who also develop them.
        Your doctor may want to run blood tests if you're getting a lot of skin tags with no explanation. If you'd like, she can also remove them using various in-office techniques.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/prebiotics-in-plant-based-foods-may-help-control-unhealthy-eating,Prebiotics in plant-based foods may help control unhealthy eating,"Science has shown that a healthy gut can make beneficial changes in the brain and vice versa, via a connection known as the gut-brain axis. A healthy gut requires good amounts of probiotics (beneficial bacteria), which grow by feeding off prebiotics, compounds found in plant fiber. A new study suggests prebiotics have a role in the gut-brain axis beyond being a food source and eating them might help people choose healthier foods.
        Researchers recruited 59 overweight adults who regularly followed a Western diet (higher in red meat, saturated fat, and processed foods) and assigned them randomly to take either 30 grams of inulin (a prebiotic found in onions, leeks, artichokes, and bananas) or a placebo supplement, every day for two weeks. Next, the participants had brain MRIs while they viewed pictures of various low-, medium-, and high-calorie foods and indicated how much they wanted them on a one to 10 scale. The MRIs measured how much of the brain's reward network was activated when the participants made their choices. Over a second two-week period, the process was repeated: everyone took the supplement they had not taken earlier, and then underwent the MRI session. The researchers found that after taking the prebiotic supplement, people were more likely to select medium- or low-calorie foods than high-calorie ones, and their MRIs showed less activation in their brain's reward network when shown high-calorie foods.
        The results were published online Oct. 4, 2023, by the journal Gut.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/how-to-lower-your-dementia-risk,How to lower your dementia risk,"An estimated 3% of adults ages 65 and older currently have dementia, and that proportion rises substantially as people age. By age 85, about one-third will be diagnosed with some form.
        The diagnosis of dementia is based on a set of symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, changes in personality, a decline in cognitive skills, and inability to perform everyday activities.
        But can you do anything to lower your risk?
        ""The most convincing evidence continues to be for the boring stuff — aerobic exercise, a brain-healthy diet, and quality sleep,"" says neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Daneshvar, chief of the division of brain injury rehabilitation with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Even people with a family history of dementia could lower the risk by investing more in these basic healthy lifestyle habits."" Here's how they help with dementia prevention.
        Aerobic exercise. The buildup of beta-amyloid protein in the brain is a key hallmark of many diseases that cause dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia. Another common form, vascular dementia, stems from damage to brain cells that occurs when narrowed or hardened blood vessels fail to supply enough blood to the brain.
        Aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain, supporting blood vessels and decreasing the risk of blood vessel damage. It also helps reduce inflammation, thought to be one of the main causes of abnormal protein buildup.
        Aerobic exercise is any activity that increases your heart rate. Although most aerobic exercise requires you to move your entire body, the main focus should be on your heart and lungs. ""Activities like walking, running, swimming, cycling, even dancing, if done at sufficient intensity, get you breathing faster and your heart working harder,"" says Dr. Daneshvar. Guidelines recommend adults do at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week.
        It's never too late to begin, either. ""Even older people who have rarely done aerobic exercise before can still reap the benefits once they start,"" says Dr. Daneshvar.
        Brain-healthy diet. There are several extensively studied diets that promote brain health, like the Mediterranean, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), and MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diets. ""These diets are linked to lower levels of brain-damaging chronic inflammation by reducing or eliminating red meat and processed foods and increasing the intake of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables and fatty fish high in omega-3 fatty acids,"" says Dr. Daneshvar.
        Quality sleep. During sleep, the brain clears out harmful beta-amyloid proteins. But the cleaning process can't do a complete job if sleep is regularly disrupted — by insomnia, sleep apnea, or other issues that cause you to wake during the night. ""Eventually, this can cause or exacerbate abnormal protein buildup,"" says Dr. Daneshvar.
        If you regularly don't feel rested upon waking or have trouble falling and staying asleep, speak with your doctor. It's important to address any sleep disorder or other health issues that interfere with sleep, like acid reflux. Taking multiple medicines, depression, and changes in the bedroom environment (for instance, in temperature, noise level, smartphone usage, or light exposure) also can disrupt sleep.
        
          
            
              
                Engage your brain by socializing
                Another way to protect your brain from dementia is to socialize more. A study published online Oct. 24, 2023, by JAMA Neurology found that socially isolated older adults have a 27% higher chance of developing dementia than older adults who aren't isolated. ""Regular interactions activate mental processes, including attention and memory, which can bolster cognition,"" says neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Daneshvar with Massachusetts General Hospital. Here are some ways to increase your social engagement:
                Get into group dynamics.Join a group activity, such as a walking club, a golf or bowling league, a book or chess club, or a continuing education class at an adult education center.
                Schedule friend time.If you have a circle of friends but you don't see them regularly, take the initiative and schedule routine get-togethers. Designate a day, time, and place for coffee, lunch, or any type of gathering designed for easy conversation. Group video chats also are an option.
                Engage in ""weak ties."" Casual interactions, known as ""weak ties,"" also can provide stimulating engagement. For example, strike up a brief conversation with a stranger or employee at the grocery store or coffee shop. Even social media conversations and texting qualify.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/everyday-activities-count-as-exercise-but-intensity-matters,"Everyday activities count as exercise, but intensity matters","Can doing short bursts of everyday activities offer health benefits?
        Researchers used wrist activity trackers to measure daily activities of more than 25,000 people ages 42 to 78 who did not exercise formally. Activities were defined as any continuous movement done at a faster-than-normal pace: for example, taking stairs, mopping the floor, gardening, and playing energetically with children. Everyone's movements were tracked for one week, and the results were compared with their health status eight years later.
        The researchers found that people who did multiple bouts of daily activities lasting from one to 10 minutes — for a total of about 28 minutes per day — had a lower risk for heart attacks and strokes compared with those who were active for less than a minute at a time. (There was no statistical advantage for being active longer than 10 minutes.)
        Intensity was key, as the more vigorous the activity, the greater the benefit. However, the results suggested you don't need to maintain a high intensity all the time. The researchers found that doing at least 15% (about 10 seconds for every minute) at a vigorous level and the rest at a moderate level was enough.
        The results were published in the October 2023 issue of The Lancet Public Health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/prepare-for-a-fall,Prepare for a fall,"More than one in four adults ages 65 and older fall each year, and about 20% of these tumbles result in a broken bone or head injury. The best way to prevent falls is to stay in good shape by improving your core strength, balance, and flexibility. ""Studies have shown that these are the keys of fall prevention,"" says Barbara Ranucci, a physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation.
        Maintaining other aspects of your health can further reduce your fall risk, such as addressing any dizziness that might be due to an inner ear problem and having routine eye exams (to keep your vision sharp so you can avoid tripping hazards).
        Practice falling
        You can protect yourself from a fall injury by learning how to fall the right way. Because it can be near-impossible to think quickly during such a sudden and adrenaline-filled moment, Ranucci suggests practicing how to fall correctly. (Ask your doctor first if doing so is safe for you.) Such practice ""can help develop muscle memory, so your body can automatically react to the situation,"" she says. ""Fall practice can also help those who have previously suffered a fall overcome the fear of taking another tumble.""
        The greatest obstacle to overcome is the instinct to extend your arms to break a fall; this can lead to broken bones. ""You can't stop the fall, so don't try to fight it. Gravity is going to win,"" says Ranucci. ""The goal is to land as softly as possible.""
        Here is a safe falling sequence Ranucci recommends. Practice it in slow motion until you can go through the movements naturally and get used to the sensation of falling. Then practice it in real time. Use a thick, padded mat for safety. (Many gyms and senior centers also have suitable fitness pads.)
        ""Try to practice with someone at first, if possible,"" says Ranucci.
        
          Lean into the fall — this gives you some control over direction.
          Tuck your chin down.
          Bend your arms and keep them in front of your face to protect your head.
          Keep your knees bent.
          Fall like a sack of beans — relax everything.
          Turn sideways and land on the soft, fleshy places, like your buttocks and thighs.
          As you complete the fall, try to pull your body into a ball. This will spread the impact to reduce injury and stop you from rolling farther.
        
        Rising from a fall
        When you fall, don't get up immediately. ""Trying to get up too quickly or the wrong way could worsen a possible injury,"" says Ranucci. If you are hurt, call for help: use a medical alert if you have one, or — if your phone is handy — call 911. Otherwise, once you've taken a moment to get your bearings, follow this three-step process to rise safely.
        Prepare. Look around for something sturdy (like a chair or couch or bed). If you didn't fall onto your side, roll over onto your side in the direction of the chair.
        Rise. Use both hands to raise your upper body off the ground. Then slowly get into a hands-and-knees position and crawl to the chair.
        Sit. Place your hands on the chair seat and slide one foot forward so it is flat on the floor. Keep the other leg bent with the knee on the floor. From this kneeling position, slowly rise and turn your body to sit on the chair. Sit and rest for a few minutes before standing.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/chest-pain-causes-other-than-the-heart,Chest pain: Causes other than the heart,"It's so clich' it's called the Holly­wood heart attack: people dramatically clutching their chests and crumbling to the ground. Unlike in the movies, however, many instances of chest pain — especially when it's fleeting — don't involve the heart at all.
        More than 6.5 million emergency department visits in the United States each year are due to chest pain, as are nearly four million outpatient clinic visits, according to the American Heart Association. Notably, however, most of these cases are not found to be heart-related.
        To be clear, chest discomfort of any kind — whether pain itself or tightness, pressure, squeezing, or burning — should never be ignored. And new chest pain should prompt a call to your doctor. But understanding its many possible causes can calm worst-case-scenario fears and help you find solutions, says Dr. Daniel Sands, a primary care doctor at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        ""It's been drummed into us that chest pain is a danger sign that should make you see a doctor,"" Dr. Sands says. This remains solid and safe advice. But chest discomfort more often arises for reasons other than the heart.
        Lengthy list of causes
        For women, cardiac causes account for ""only a very small proportion"" of chest pain, Dr. Sands notes. This depends, of course, on each woman's specific risk factors for heart disease. And, particularly in women, heart attacks don't always show up with chest pain at all.
        ""If a 25-year-old woman comes in with chest pain, and she's generally healthy with no prior heart disease, the likelihood she has cardiac disease is infinitesimal,"" he says. ""But if it's a 60-year-old woman who smokes and has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and a family history of heart disease, that person is so likely to have heart disease that I'd send her to the ER right away.""
        A long list of other conditions — some minor and others deadly serious — can trigger chest pain or discomfort. These include
        
          gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
          gallstones
          asthma
          anxiety or panic attacks
          ulcers
          COVID
          esophagus spasms
          costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs to the breastbone)
          pleurisy (inflammation of the tissue separating the lungs from the chest wall)
          pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in the lung)
          aortic dissection (a rupture of the aortic artery)
          pericarditis (inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart).
        
        Spot the clues
        How can you tell if chest pain is most likely not heart-related? Dr. Sands offers these clues:
        
          It's brief, lasting only a few moments.
          You can climb stairs or exercise without the pain worsening.
          It's triggered by eating, occurring just afterward or only when you eat certain foods.
          It happens only when you move in a certain way, such as bending or stretching.
          It occurs only when you're coughing or breathing deeply.
          It's localized to a small spot, or feels better or worse when you rub the area.
        
        Regardless of how it shows up, any chest pain should prompt you to follow up with your doctor, Dr. Sands says. You may need treatment for another issue.
        ""Don't panic,"" he says. ""Your doctor can evaluate you to see if something serious is going on and work with you to find a solution to feel better.""
        Conversely, a heart attack or other catastrophic problem ""usually shows up with chest pain that goes on for a long period, not something that just goes away,"" Dr. Sands says. Watch for chest pain lingering for more than a few minutes; shortness of breath; pain in the jaw, neck, or back; pain in one or both arms; and feeling nauseous, weak, faint, or dizzy. Call 911 or have someone drive you to an emergency room if you experience any of these signs.
        But anytime you're not certain why you're having chest pain or where it stems from, ""call your doctor immediately,"" Dr. Sands says. ""Sometimes answering a few questions, even over the phone, can determine whether you need to be evaluated or not.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-healthy-is-sugar-alcohol-202312183002,How healthy is sugar alcohol?,"If you are trying to cut back on added sugar — and you should, because excess sugar increases risks for obesity, diabetes, and heart disease — you might be tempted by products advertised as low sugar, no sugar, or sugar-free.
        Many contain familiar low-calorie sugar substitutes like aspartame or sucralose instead of sugar. And as you're reading labels, you also may run across another ingredient: sugar alcohol, which is used in products like sugar-free cookies, candies, ice cream, beverages, and chewing gums. Are any of these sweeteners a better choice nutritionally? Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, weighs in below.
        Are low-calorie or no-calorie sweeteners any healthier than natural sugar?
        Also known as artificial sweeteners or sugar substitutes, the list of low-calorie and no-calorie sweeteners you may see on product nutrition labels includes acesulfame-K, saccharin, sucralose, neotame, and advantame. These have a higher sweetness intensity per gram than natural sugar.
        So far research on them is mixed, although some observational studies have found that beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners are associated with a higher risk for diabetes and weight gain.
        What exactly are sugar alcohols and how can you spot them?
        Sugar alcohols may have the most misleading name, as they are neither sugar nor alcohol, according to Dr. Hu. ""They are a type of carbohydrate derived from fruits and vegetables, although most commercial sugar alcohols are synthetically produced.""
        You can usually spot many sugar alcohols on ingredient lists by ""-ol"" at the ends of their names. Examples include sorbitol, xylitol, lactitol, mannitol, erythritol, and maltitol.
        Are sugar alcohols any healthier than other sugar substitutes or natural sugar?
        Here is a look at the pros and cons.
        The upside of sugar alcohols
        Sugar alcohols reside in the sweet spot between natural sugar and low-calorie sweeteners. They are not as overly sweet as sweeteners and don't add too many extra calories like sugar.
        ""Sugar alcohols are about 40% to 80% as sweet as natural sugar, whereas artificial sweeteners like aspartame are about 200 times sweeter,"" says Dr. Hu. ""And they have about 25% to 75% fewer calories per gram than sugar.""
        Another upside of sugar alcohols is that they break down slowly in the gut. Hence, your body only absorbs part of their overall carbohydrates. ""This keeps your blood sugar and insulin levels from spiking as they do with sugar,"" says Dr. Hu. ""That makes them a useful sugar substitute for people with diabetes.""
        The downside of sugar alcohols
        The main downside to sugar alcohols is this: when taken in high amounts they can cause gastrointestinal (GI) problems, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or loose stools.
        Because sugar alcohols are slowly digested, they have more time to feed bacteria in the gut, which can lead to fermentation and produce excess gas. Their slow digestion also can pull extra water into the colon and cause a laxative effect.
        People's tolerance for sugar alcohols depends on many factors, including body weight, health conditions, and the amount and types of sugar alcohols. ""Individual differences in digestion and metabolism, gut microbiome composition, and dietary habits can also make a difference,"" says Dr. Hu. ""For these reasons, we recommend introducing sugar alcohols into your diet gradually and observing how your body responds.""
        For people who experience GI symptoms caused by sugar alcohols, Dr. Hu says cutting back on the amount of foods and drinks made with them often can correct the problem. ""Sugar alcohols are commonly found in sugar-free or low-carb products, so pay attention to food labels"" he says. ""Because different sugar alcohols can have different effects, it might be useful to identify specific types of sugar alcohols that cause GI side effects.""
        Do sugar alcohols have health risks?
        Possible long-term health risks of sugar alcohol are still being explored. A 2023 observational study found a link between using erythritol as an added sweetener and cardiovascular disease events, such as stroke and heart attack, in people with heart disease or who had risk factors like diabetes and high blood pressure. However, these findings have not been confirmed in subsequent studies.
        ""Sugar alcohols offer a healthier alternative to sugar because of their lower calorie content and reduced glycemic response, which is the effect food has on blood sugar levels,"" says Dr. Hu. ""But they also have potential drawbacks, especially for those with sensitive digestive systems, so it's best to consume them in moderation as part of an overall healthy eating pattern.""",Matthew Solan,"December 18, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-surprising-benefits-of-walking,5 surprising benefits of walking,"The next time you have a check-up, don't be surprised if your doctor hands you a prescription to walk. Yes, this simple activity that you've been doing since you were about a year old is now being touted as ""the closest thing we have to a wonder drug,"" in the words of Dr. Thomas Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
        Of course, you probably know that any physical activity, including walking, is a boon to your overall health. But walking in particular comes with a host of benefits. Here's a list of five that may surprise you.
        
          Counteracts the effects of weight-promoting genes. Harvard researchers looked at 32 obesity-promoting genes in over 12,000 people to determine how much these genes actually contribute to body weight. Among the study participants who walked briskly for about an hour a day, the effects of those genes were cut in half.
          Helps tame a sweet tooth. A pair of studies from the University of Exeter found that a 15-minute walk can curb cravings for chocolate and even reduce the amount of chocolate you eat in stressful situations. And the latest research confirms that walking can reduce cravings and intake of a variety of sugary snacks.
          Reduces the risk of developing breast cancer. Researchers already know that any kind of physical activity blunts the risk of breast cancer. But an American Cancer Society study that zeroed in on walking found that women who walked seven or more hours a week had a 14% lower risk of breast cancer than those who walked three hours or fewer per week. And walking provided this protection even for the women with breast cancer risk factors, such as being overweight or using supplemental hormones.
          Eases joint pain. Several studies have found that walking reduces arthritis-related pain, and that walking five to six miles a week can even prevent arthritis from forming in the first place. Walking protects the joints — especially the knees and hips, which are most susceptible to osteoarthritis — by lubricating them and strengthening the muscles that support them.
          Boosts immune function. Walking can help protect you during cold and flu season. A study of over 1,000 men and women found that those who walked at least 20 minutes a day, at least 5 days a week, had 43% fewer sick days than those who exercised once a week or less. And if they did get sick, it was for a shorter duration, and their symptoms were milder.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/foods-you-should-eat-to-help-fight-inflammation,Foods you should eat to help fight inflammation,"We typically think of inflammation as a result of an injury or disease. But diet also plays an important role in chronic inflammation.  
        This is in part because the foods we eat influence the types of bacteria that populate our gut and their chemical byproducts. While some foods encourage the growth of bacteria that stimulate inflammation, others promote the growth of bacteria that help suppress it. That's why it's important to know which foods have anti-inflammatory properties and which can cause inflammation
        
          Foods that fight inflammation
        
        
          Fruits and vegetables. Most fruits and brightly colored vegetables naturally contain high levels of antioxidants and polyphenols. Polyphenols are potentially protective compounds found in plants. Studies have shown that polyphenols have multiple anti-inflammatory properties and may improve the function of cells that line blood vessels. Foods high in polyphenols include onions, turmeric, red grapes, cherries, and plums, as well as dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, and collard greens.
        
        
          Nuts and seeds. Studies have found that consuming nuts and seeds is associated with reduced markers of inflammation and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
          Some oils and fatty fish.  Olive oil, flaxseed oil, and fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel offer healthy doses of omega-3 fatty acids, which have long been shown to reduce inflammation.
          Coffee, cocoa and green tea. The polyphenols in coffee and the flavanols in cocoa are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea is also rich in both polyphenols and antioxidants.
        
        
          Foods that can fuel inflammation
        
        The foods that contribute to inflammation are the same ones generally considered bad for other aspects of health. These include:
        
          
            Sugary sodas 
          
          
            Refined carbohydrates (like white bread and pasta)
          
          
            Red meat and processed meats
          
          Processed foods. Certain components or ingredients used in processed foods such as the emulsifiers added to ice cream, may have effects on inflammation.
        
        Such foods are also likely to contribute to weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for inflammation..
        
          The key to reducing inflammation with diet
        
        To practice anti-inflammatory eating, it's best to focus on an overall healthy diet rather than singling out individual ""good"" and ""bad"" foods. In general, a healthy diet means one that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils, and limits food loaded with simple sugars (like soda and candy), beverages that contain high-fructose corn syrup (like juice drinks and sports drinks), and refined carbohydrates.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-more-fiber-in-your-diet,How to get more fiber in your diet,"Diverticulosis is a very common colon condition in which small pouches form on the colon wall. Most people who have diverticulosis have no symptoms, However, sometimes one of the pouches gets inflamed, usually due to a bacterial infection. 
        To reduce your risk of getting diverticulosis and diverticulitis, add high-fiber foods to each meal. Aim for up to half your plate to contain some fiber-rich food.
        Here are some tips that can help you make the transition to a higher-fiber diet.
        
          Eat a minimum of three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit every day. This makes up the five-a-day recommended by the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In general, one serving is a single piece of fruit or a half-cup of raw fruits or vegetables, or a cup of leafy greens.
          Include fruits, vegetables, or both with every meal. For instance, include fruit with breakfast and as a snack, and vegetables with lunch and dinner.
          Eat pulses (the seeds of plants in the legume family), such as beans, lentils, and peas, at least three times a week. You can include them either as a plant-based protein in meatless dishes, or as the starch side in place of grains. For example, you could have fish on a bed of lentils rather than rice.
          Rely on nuts, seeds, and fruit for snacks. Or add them to other items like yogurt, oatmeal, salads, and stir-fries.
          Replace refined grains like white rice with whole grains like brown rice, wild rice, or bulgur. For pasta, look for versions made from quinoa or pulses like chickpeas and lentils.
          Check nutrition fact labels for the amount of dietary fiber. Aim for at least 5 grams of fiber per serving.
        
        Be careful about eating a lot of fiber at once. Overdoing it can cause gas, bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps as your gut bacteria try to process all the new fiber. These problems go away after a while as your digestive system gets used to the higher fiber levels, but you can avoid them by adding extra fiber gradually to your diet. 
        For example, try to add just one more serving of a high-fiber food to your daily diet for a week, then see how your body feels. Give yourself another week, if needed. If everything is okay, add another daily serving for a week. Continue this pattern until you reach your daily quota of fiber.
        Also, make sure to drink plenty of fluids each day—about 16 ounces of water, four times a day. Increasing the water you drink can help fiber pass through your digestive system and avoid stomach distress.
        To learn how to halt the distress of  diverticulitis, read Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis, an online guide from Harvard Medical School.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/fall-prevention-strategies-to-help-keep-you-from-falling-down,Fall prevention: Strategies to help keep you from falling down,"Falling is a normal part of early childhood. However, as we age, even a minor fall can be debilitating. Falling as an older adult can lead to serious consequences including injury, disability, and even death. The good news is most falls can be prevented. Taking precautions, such as making changes in your home, starting an exercise routine, and regular checkups with your doctor, may help keep you safe.
        Why do we fall?
        Our risk of falling increases as we age, with an estimated 36 million falls occurring every year in adults over the age of 65. Older adults who are frail or have other medical conditions are at a higher risk for falls. The number one risk factor for falls in older adults is history of a prior fall.
        One of the best ways to prevent falls is to understand why people fall. Anything that decreases your strength and mobility, affects your balance, or changes your ability to walk and stand upright may increase your risk of falling. This includes:
        
          muscle weakness
          gait abnormality
          foot, knee, or back pain
          weight changes
          lack of sleep
          injury.
        
        Certain health problems can also lead to balance problems and increase your risk of fracture or other injury from a fall. For example:
        
          inner ear problems
          vision problems
          
            dementia
          
          vitamin D deficiency
          arthritis
          
            osteoporosis
          
          diseases of the nervous system, such as Parkinson's disease.
        
        In addition, side effects from many medications can contribute to falls. These include:
        
          blood pressure medications, which can cause low blood pressure upon standing quickly (postural hypotension)
          sleep medications, anti-anxiety drugs, or antidepressants, which may make you groggy and less aware of your surrounding
          diphenhydramine (Benadryl), an antihistamine that is an ingredient in many popular over the counter sleep products. Regular use is linked to memory problems and a higher fall risk.
        
        Regular follow-up with your doctor to identify and address these issues can help prevent falls.
        Fall risk assessment
        It is important to see your doctor every year to review your medical conditions and medication list. Among other benefits, this appointment is an opportunity to identify any risk factors for falls. You should also see your doctor if you sustained a recent fall, feel unsteady on your feet, or are worried about falling. Your doctor may ask about your fall history and assess your risk factors using a questionnaire. Some other common assessments that can help identify an increased risk for falls include:
        
          strength, gait, and balance tests
          blood pressure measurements while sitting, lying, and standing
          visual acuity test
          vitamin D levels
          review of potential home hazards
          evaluation of your feet and footwear.
        
        Based on these findings, you doctor may adjust treatment of your medical conditions and develop a personalized care plan to reduce your risk factors.
        Balance test
        Balance involves an ability to both stand upright and to anticipate changes in movement. It requires coordination from many parts of your body. Your doctor may have you perform a balance test, which assesses your ability to hold a few different positions without moving or needing support for 10 seconds. A 2022 study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that an inability to balance for 10 seconds while standing on one foot was associated with a significantly increased risk of dying from any cause.
        To assess your own balance, a simplified balance test can be completed at home and only requires a stopwatch. An inability to complete this test means you may be at increased risk for falls.
        How to do a 10-second balance test
        
          Start standing with both feet side by side and your arms by your sides.
          Keeping one foot planted firmly on the floor, lift the other foot at least 12 inches above the ground.
          Without lowering your raised foot, using any support, or raising your arms, remain in this one-legged position for 10 seconds.
        
        Mobility aids
        Approximately one-third to one-half of adults over the age of 65 are affected by limitations in mobility — the ease with which one can move freely and purposefully in their environment. Assistance devices are a helpful way to aid your mobility while providing an extra layer of safety and precaution against falls. Consult your doctor regarding the best form of mobility aid for your needs. Assistive devices for walking include:
        
          Canes: an easy, lightweight option designed to support about 25% of your body weight
          Walkers: a better option for increased stability, with the ability to support up to 50% of body weight
          Wheelchairs: the best option during times of impaired mobility or injury if little to no body weight can be supported.
        
        Fall prevention exercises
        Physical activity is key to preventing falls in older adults. Aside from the positive impacts on heart health, mental health, and weight management, exercise can improve your strength, balance, and endurance. These factors work together to improve your mobility and are considered the most important factors in fall prevention.
        When starting a daily exercise routine, consistency is key. Even small changes in your daily activities can make a difference. Consider starting with small exercise goals and aim for a variety of different forms of exercise.
        Target area #1: Strength
        As we age, we lose a significant amount of muscle mass. It is important to maintain strength, particularly in the core and legs, to reduce your risk of falls. Your core is made up of your abdominal, buttock, pelvic, and back muscles. These areas work together to keep the body upright and stabilized over your center of gravity. The stronger your core and legs, the better you can stay balanced and move around. Building strength can be accomplished through:
        
          Functional exercises: exercises that mimic daily activities, such as rising up from a chair.
          Weight training: exercises that involve using hand weights or machines to target specific muscle groups.
          Resistance training: exercises that use body weight to challenge your muscles, such as doing a push-up.
        
        Target area #2: Balance
        When you are not steady on your feet, your risk of a fall increases. Besides core muscle strength, foot and ankle mobility are another important factor in achieving better balance. Exercises programs that have been demonstrated to improve balance include:
        
          Yoga, particularly hatha yoga: a more physical type of yoga that utilizes breath-controlled exercises.
          Tai chi: a mind-body activity that is described as ""meditation in motion.""
          Pilates: a form of exercise that combines stretching, strengthening, and core exercises.
          Balance-training exercises: movements that build your ability to remain steady while standing still (static) or moving (dynamic).
        
        Target area #3: Endurance
        The less active we become, the more we lose our endurance, or ability to perform activities without becoming easily winded and out of breath. Lack of endurance is a risk factor for falls because it leads to impaired mobility. The best way to improve or maintain endurance is aerobic exercise that increases your heart rate. Examples include:
        
          water aerobics
          dance
          Zumba
          cycling
          stair climbing
          walking
          swimming.
        
        Many of these activities are available for free or at low cost at local gyms or senior centers. It's important to talk with your doctor prior to starting any exercise regimen, and to choose a class that feels comfortable for you and your level of mobility.
        Three at-home exercises to reduce your risk of falls
        Exercise #1: Opposite arm and leg raise
        
          Target area: core strength
        
        
          
            
            
          
        
        Starting position: Kneel on all fours, knees hip-width apart. Align your shoulders over your wrists and your hips over your knees. Keep your head and spine in alignment.
        Movement: Extend your right leg off the floor behind you while reaching your left arm out in front of you. Try to raise your extended leg and arm parallel to the floor. Hold for 10 to 30 seconds. Return to the starting position, then repeat with your left leg and right arm. Do this two to four times on each side. Rest 30 to 90 seconds and repeat the entire set.
        Exercise #2: Heel toe standing (no support)
        
          Target area: balance
        
        
          
            
          
        
        Starting position: Stand up straight near a table or chair and look ahead. Line up one foot directly in front of the other.
        Movement: Extending your arms outward for support, hold position for 10 seconds. Place the foot that is in front directly behind the other one. Hold for 10 seconds. If too easy, walk 10 steps with your feet lined up heel to toe. Turn around and walk back in the same way.
        Exercise #3: Sit to stand (no hands)
        
          Target area: leg strength, balance
        
        
          
            
            
          
        
        Starting position: Sit on a chair that is not too low. Place your hands in your lap, across your chest, or out in front of you.
        Movement: Place your feet behind your knees. Lean forward and slowly stand up without using your hands. Slowly sit down with control. Repeat 10 times.
        Fall prevention at home
        Home hazards may also make you more likely to fall. It is important to check room by room for potential fall hazards that may be lurking. Ensure your home is organized so that the items you use regularly are within easy reach. Make modifications so you can move freely about your home, with all paths clear and well lit. Pay careful attention to the floors, and check that they are free of spills and safe for walking. Some alterations that can be made at home include:
        
          nonskid rugs on the floors
          nonskid mats in the shower
          benches, seats, and bars in the shower and above the toilet
          lamps that turn on by touch or sound
          plush or low-pile carpeting
          handrails along all stairwells and the front/back steps of the home.
        
        Fall safely
        Despite our best efforts, falls can still happen. Knowing what to do if you fall can help you avoid injury. To fall more safely with a softer landing:
        
          Lean forward, keeping your knees bent and feet down — this gives you better control of the direction of your fall.
          Fall onto body areas with the most ""cushion"" such as your buttocks and thighs.
          Lean your shoulder into the fall to protect your head.
          Aim for a soft area of grass, dirt, or carpet if possible.
          Stay relaxed.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/try-this-progressive-muscle-relaxation-for-sleep,Try this: Progressive muscle relaxation for sleep,"For some people with insomnia, a racing or worried mind is the enemy of sleep. In others, physical tension is to blame. One way to quiet a racing mind or relax a tense body is a technique called progressive muscle relaxation. It involves gradually tensing and relaxing your muscles, beginning with your feet and working your way up your body. Try this when you have trouble falling asleep:
        
          Lie on your back in bed in a comfortable position. Put a pillow under your head or your knees to relax your back. Rest your arms with palms up, slightly apart from your body.
          Take several slow, deep breaths through your nose. Exhale with a long sigh to release tension.
          Focus on your toes and feet. Curl your toes and arch your feet. Hold this movement briefly to feel the sensation. Relax your muscles and let your feet sink into the bed. Feel them getting heavy and becoming totally relaxed.
          While breathing softly, move your attention slowly up your body, tensing then relaxing each area: calves, thighs, buttocks, lower back, abdomen, upper back, shoulders, arms, hands, neck, jaw, and forehead. Relax any remaining tense spots.
          If thoughts distract you, ignore them and gently return your attention to your breathing.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/can-weight-loss-slow-prostate-cancer,Can weight loss slow prostate cancer?,"You've had a biopsy and have been diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer, defined as a tumor that is confined to the prostate gland and unlikely to grow or spread. You decide to follow active surveillance, a protocol in which you regularly follow up with your doctor for routine PSA tests, prostate biopsies, and possibly MRI scans. If at some point it looks like the cancer has progressed, then you can consider treatment (radiation or surgery).
        For some men, this wait-and-see period lasts for years. But can you do anything to help slow your cancer's growth and delay treatment for as long as possible? Your bathroom scale might give you the answer.
        How monitoring works
        The reality is that most low-grade prostate cancer does not transform over time and become more aggressive, according to Dr. Mark Pomerantz, a medical oncologist with Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
        ""Being on active surveillance is more about looking out for cancer that the original biopsy missed,"" he says. ""It's not necessarily that the original low-grade cancer becomes more aggressive — although that is possible in some cases — but rather, high- or medium-grade cancer is hiding and we're looking for changes in PSA levels that might suggest it's there and become aggressive.""
        About 45% to 60% of men on active surveillance will not need cancer treatment over the 10 to 15 years following their initial diagnosis, according to Dr. Pomerantz. While those are encouraging figures, they still leave the chance you may need treatment sooner.
        Controlling factors
        You can't control two factors that can increase the risk of undetected high- or medium-grade cancer from becoming aggressive: genetics and family history. But one aspect you may be able to change is your weight.
        ""While excess weight doesn't appear to increase the likelihood of low-grade prostate cancer, there appears to be a strong association between being overweight or obese and the risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer,"" says Dr. Pomerantz. People with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 are considered overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 or higher are classified as obese.
        Scientists reported in the Aug. 15, 2019, issue of Cancer that over a 10-year period, men diagnosed with prostate cancer whose waist size and BMI increased the most had greater risks of advanced and fatal prostate cancer compared with men who maintained a healthy weight.
        Specifically, a five-point increase in BMI was associated with a 50% higher risk for advanced or fatal prostate cancer, and a 4.1-inch increase in waist size was associated with a 40% higher risk. Where that extra fat lies also is a driving a factor. The same study discovered that extra visceral fat (the hidden kind that lies deep in the abdomen and surrounds the major organs) was linked with a 31% higher risk of developing advanced prostate cancer.
        Your past weight gain also may play a role in future cancer growth, suggests research presented at the European Congress on Obesity in May 2023. Researchers found that men who gained an average of 2.2 pounds each year from ages 17 to 29 increased their risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer later in life by 13%.
        ""So losing excess weight may be one way to possibly keep prostate cancer from growing more rapidly,"" says Dr. Pomerantz.
        The weight connection
        Experts don't fully understand the relationship between excess fat and prostate cancer growth. Some theories suggest that extra weight leads to higher levels of inflammation, which in turn acts like fuel to prostate cancer cells. Overweight and obese men also are more likely to have higher levels of blood sugar, which stimulates the pancreas to release more insulin. Some studies have shown a link between higher insulin levels and an increased risk of prostate cancer. ""This could be another factor raising the chance of more aggressive cancer,"" says Dr. Pomerantz.
        While weight loss and weight management are never easy, Dr. Pomerantz says many men on active surveillance often embrace the situation as an opportunity to make overall health changes.
        ""Increasing exercise and adopting a healthy, plant-based diet, both of which can help men lose extra pounds, not only can help with their prostate cancer, but can reduce their risk of heart disease and other cancers,"" he says. ""Most men on active surveillance will die of something other than prostate cancer, so this can be a wake-up call for men to get serious about their health.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/stress-at-work-takes-a-toll-on-the-heart,Stress at work takes a toll on the heart,"Men who report specific types of job-related stress face a higher risk of heart disease than those without such stress, according to a new study.
        Researchers followed more than 6,500 white-collar workers for 18 years and identified two job-related conditions linked to higher cardiovascular risks. One was job strain, defined as high demands (such as having a heavy workload and tight deadlines) coupled with low control (for example, having little say in decision making). The other, called effort-reward imbalance, occurs when a person's effort is high but their salary, recognition, or job security are low.
        Compared with people who didn't experience work stress, men who reported either of those stressors had a 49% higher risk of heart disease. But their risk doubled if they reported both types. Among women, the results were inconclusive, which the authors say might reflect the fact that women tend to develop heart disease later in life than men. The men were also more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure, and other factors that raise heart disease risk. The study was published online Sept. 19, 2023, by Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/beyond-appetite-suppression,Beyond appetite suppression,"It's nearly impossible to miss the buzz surrounding the newest generation of obesity drugs, whose popularity is soaring alongside reports of jaw-dropping weight loss among people taking them.
        Semaglutide — first marketed as Ozempic for diabetes and later as Wegovy for obesity — is heralded as a breakthrough drug for its ability to promote an average loss of 15% to 20% of a person's body weight. But it's becoming apparent that the medications, which include others in its class and mimic a naturally produced hormone called GLP-1, might offer additional benefits, dampening cravings for things other than food.
        Some people taking GLP-1 drugs have reported less interest in addictive and compulsive behaviors such as drinking alcohol, smoking, gambling, shopping excessively, and even biting their nails. Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, is hearing similar accounts from her own patients, especially about cravings for alcohol and sweets.
        Why might this happen? GLP-1 drugs, which suppress appetite and help people feel full, appear to hamper activation of the brain's reward pathways. These are normally stimulated by substances such as food, alcohol, and nicotine as well as pleasurable activities such as gambling or shopping.
        ""We're not quite sure why, but they're doing something very positive for behavioral change,"" Dr. Apovian says. ""It's a breath of fresh air.""
        Intense research
        GLP-1 medications are already producing surprising long-term health benefits in areas other than weight loss. Wegovy may lower the risk of serious heart problems such as heart attack and stroke by 20%, the drug's manufacturer reported in August 2023. The trial involving 18,000 people — not yet published as of September 2023 — is apparently the first to show that GLP-1 drugs can confer heart health benefits for people who are overweight but don't have diabetes.
        Other research is beginning to unwrap the drugs' potential to quell alcohol abuse and smoking. A September 2022 study of 127 adults published in the journal JCI Insight suggested that people with both obesity and alcohol use disorder who were treated with a GLP-1 drug called exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon) drank dramatically less than those who received only a placebo drug. Participants who received exenatide also displayed significantly less activation of the brain's reward centers when shown pictures of alcohol while undergoing functional MRI scans.
        Another small trial in progress is focusing on 48 people with alcohol use disorder who also smoke. It aims to determine if those who receive escalating doses of semaglutide over two months will drink and smoke less than participants who receive a placebo injection.
        If further research confirms preliminary findings, Dr. Apovian believes the stampede to obtain these drugs will only increase. But FDA approval for uses other than diabetes and obesity will likely take several more years, after large clinical trials are completed. ""I think there will certainly be more demand, which is already rising astronomically,"" she says.
        Reaping advantages
        The success of GLP-1 drugs for a range of cravings could offer proof that addictions and compulsions stem from brain-based disorders, not a lack of willpower, Dr. Apovian says. ""A moral failing? We have to get rid of that stigma. The big punchline here is that all of these are diseases.""
        If you're intrigued at the thought of using one of these drugs to curb an addiction or compulsive behavior, Dr. Apovian suggests these tactics.
        Pursue it. If you're struggling with obesity but aren't taking a GLP-1 drug, perhaps it's time to start. ""Someone with obesity who also has compulsions for alcohol, gambling, or smoking could certainly obtain one of these medications for obesity and then potentially benefit from its other effects,"" she says.
        Watch for cheaper options. Wegovy and other newer GLP-1 drugs can be costly and in short supply. But other first-generation GLP-1s approved for diabetes or obesity, including dulaglutide (Trulicity) and liraglutide (Saxenda), may be sold as generics within the coming year. That should make them easier to obtain — and far more affordable. ""Staying patient is tough to do,"" Dr. Apovian says. ""But some GLP-1 drugs are less expensive or perhaps will be soon.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-are-my-heels-cracked,Why are my heels cracked?,"Q.
           Even though I apply rich moisturizers to my heels, they're severely cracked—so badly that they sometimes bleed. Why is this happening?
        
        A. Also known as heel fissures, cracks in the heels occur when the skin on the bottom of the heel becomes hard and parched, and is sometimes associated with thick heel calluses. Often, softening the skin with moisturizers or petroleum jelly does the trick — especially during dry winter months — so you may be facing a deeper problem if that practice isn't working.
        The most common other reason for dry, cracked heels may surprise you: the fungal infection known as athlete's foot. While it usually produces itchy, scaly skin on the soles of the feet and between the toes, athlete's foot can also migrate to the heels, causing painful fissures. In most cases, over-the-counter products geared toward athlete's foot successfully treat the problem within a week.
        If that approach doesn't work, see your doctor. Less commonly, cracked heels are a sign of a medical condition such as hypothyroidism, diabetes, Sjögren's syndrome (which prevents the body from generating enough moisture), or bone spurs in the heels.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/curcumin-supplements-might-ease-meal-related-discomfort,Curcumin supplements might ease meal-related discomfort,"You might know turmeric as the golden-yellow spice used in curry powder and yellow mustard. Turmeric contains the naturally occurring chemical curcumin, which might have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. And now a small randomized trial has found that taking curcumin supplements (derived from turmeric) helps reduce symptoms of functional dyspepsia — recurring, unexplained stomach pain, bloating, or early feelings of fullness. Scientists randomly assigned 206 people (ages 18 to 70) with functional dyspepsia to one of three treatments: taking 500 milligrams (mg) of curcumin (two 250-mg capsules) four times a day, taking 20 mg of the medication omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid) once a day, or taking both treatments each day. After about a month of treatment, people in all three groups said their dyspepsia symptoms had improved. The results were even better after two months. The findings suggest that curcumin supplements are as effective at relieving dyspepsia symptoms as omeprazole (which curbs stomach acid), and that curcumin is safe and well tolerated. The study was published online Sept. 11, 2023, by BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/cpap-machines-and-masks-which-ones-are-right-for-you,CPAP machines and masks: Which ones are right for you?,"Your doctor says you need continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to treat your sleep apnea, and you're eager to begin treatment. You're also a little worried, since you've heard that using a CPAP system can be uncomfortable and challenging. How do you choose a system that will give you the best odds of success? Here are some tips to help.
        Understand the treatment
        CPAP is the first-line treatment for people with obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder marked by repeated pauses in breathing caused by a blocked airway.
        The CPAP system's job is to keep your airway open. It does that by pushing a forceful stream of air through a tube and into a mask you wear while you sleep. The air comes from a small bedside pump (an air compressor).
        Other forms of positive airway pressure (PAP) may be helpful for people with central sleep apnea, although pauses in breathing in this type of sleep apnea are related to garbled messages from the brain, not blockages (see ""What is sleep apnea?"").
        
          
            
              
                What is sleep apnea?
                Sleep apnea is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. The pauses last at least 10 seconds, lead to poor-quality sleep, and put a strain on your body. Untreated sleep apnea may increase your risk for high blood pressure or stroke.
                In obstructive sleep apnea, pauses in breathing occur when the airway briefly becomes blocked. This can be caused by too much tissue in the airway (often due to excess weight), large tonsils, or a large tongue.
                In central sleep apnea, pauses in breathing occur when the brain fails to deliver electrical impulses to the muscles that help you breathe.
              
            
          
        
        Trust your doctor
        Your physician will determine what kind of CPAP device you need. ""The device and its settings are by prescription, just like a medication,"" says Dr. Noah Siegel, director of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Surgery at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        With CPAP, a single fixed air pressure is used throughout the night. Other types of PAP therapies include
        
          auto-adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP), which provides a range of preset pressures throughout the night
          bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), which provides two different preset pressures — a more powerful one when you inhale and a less powerful one when you exhale
          adaptive servo ventilation (ASV), an advanced device that provides pressure based on breathing patterns throughout the night.
        
        ""Generally speaking, people with obstructive sleep apnea respond better to CPAP or APAP. People with central sleep apnea may respond better to BiPAP or ASV,"" Dr. Siegel says.
        Investigate face mask options
        You get to choose the face mask for your PAP system, and it's an important decision.
        Face masks often feel bulky, making people reluctant to wear them. Dr. Siegel recommends looking at mask options online and trying on a few before making a selection. That might happen at a medical supply store or during a home visit from your medical equipment supplier.
        The masks fall into two categories.
        Full-face masks. These cover the nose and mouth and deliver air to them both. They are ideal for someone who breathes through the mouth or has nasal or sinus problems.
        Nasal masks. These masks deliver air through the nose only. They are less bulky than full-face masks and come in styles that fit over, under, or in the nose.
        An important consideration for both mask types, Dr. Siegel says, is the site where the tube from the pump enters the mask. ""Traditional-style masks connect the tubing in the front of the mask, near the nose. That's not great for people who roll over a lot in bed or people who are claustrophobic,"" he says. ""Newer styles attach at the top of the mask. It's much less intrusive.""
        Give it time
        Adjusting to any PAP system takes time. You may need to try a few masks to find the right fit and comfort. ""And if allergies or frequent sinus congestion keep you from using a nasal mask, we have interventions — such as nasal sprays or surgery — that might make a nasal mask more tolerable,"" Dr. Siegel says. Also, your doctor may need to make adjustments to your machine, such as changes to settings for pressure and humidification.
        Just stick with it, and remember that using a PAP system, like taking a medication, is an ongoing therapy that needs regular evaluation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/3-easy-ways-to-strengthen-your-shoulders,3 easy ways to strengthen your shoulders,"Your shoulders need to be strong and limber so you can lift groceries, do housework, prepare meals, drive a car, and do other activities necessary to stay independent. Yet shoulder exercises are often overlooked in a workout, perhaps because they seem challenging or time-consuming. ""I encourage clients to take a simple approach to shoulder strengthening, with small, easy moves they can fit in their day. Over time, it keeps the shoulders healthy and helps people avoid injuries,"" says Kevin Crowley, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Here are three ways to make shoulder exercises easier.
        1. Exercise while seated
        Yes, it's possible to strengthen your shoulders while seated at your desk or on a couch, and you don't even need complicated moves. ""Just sit up tall and bring your shoulders down and back. Holding that position for extended periods strengthens small muscles that promote shoulder stability and improve hunched posture, which is bad for the shoulders,"" Crowley says.
        If you have time for an exercise that's slightly more involved, Crowley recommends any of the following. Sit up straight while you do them.
        Arm circles. These work the rotator cuff muscles. Hold your arms out to your sides, parallel to the floor. Make a few large circles in the air, then make medium-sized circles, and then small ones. Try it with your thumbs up for a few rotations, then thumbs down. Do the circles forward or backward.
        Arm raises. These work the main muscles in your shoulders, called the deltoids. Hold your arms out to your sides — arms straight or slightly bent. Slowly raise your arms up toward the ceiling (no higher than your head, if you have shoulder injuries), and then slowly bring them back down. Repeat the arm raises about 10 times. You can also do this exercise with your arms out in front of you.
        Hand slides. These stretch your shoulders. Reach out in front of you, and place your palms down on a desk or an ottoman. Slide your hands as far forward as you can, keeping your arms straight, and bringing your chin down toward your chest as you go. Hold the stretch, then reverse the move until you're sitting up.
        2. Use resistance bands
        Elastic resistance bands are inexpensive (about $10) and lightweight. A good resistance band for this purpose is a long, flat piece of elastic material (not a loop). The three resistance band exercises shown on this page are easy to do. Crowley also recommends doing any of the following exercises while sitting or standing.
        Open books. This exercise works the rotator cuff muscles. Grasp the band with both hands, placing them 12 to 24 inches apart. Keep your elbows ""glued"" to your sides and slowly stretch the band apart, pulling your hands away from each other. Hold, then return to the starting position. Repeat 10 times.
        Horizontal abduction. This works the rhomboid muscles in the upper back, which support the shoulders. Holding an end of the band in each hand, reach straight in front of you, so your arms are parallel to the ground. Slowly move your arms out to your sides, stretching the band between them, attempting to make a T shape with your body. Hold, then return to the starting position. Repeat 10 times.
        Chest punches. This strengthens the serratus anterior muscles, which keep the shoulder blades in place. Place the resistance band around your back and under your armpits. Hold an end of the band in each hand. Punch forward with one hand, then bring it back to your chest and punch with the other. Or punch with both hands at the same time. Repeat 10 times.
        Cross punches
        
          
        
        Place a resistance band around your back and under your armpits. Hold an end in each hand, near your chest. Punch one arm out on a slight diagonal across your body, then slowly bring it back to your chest. Repeat with the other arm. Do this 10 times.
        Biceps curl
        
          
        
        Place the middle of a resistance band under one foot, with the other foot slightly behind it. Hold an end of the band in each hand, with your arms at your sides, palms forward. Bend your elbows and raise your hands toward your shoulders, then lower your arms to the starting position. Do this 10 times.
        Triceps pull
        
          
        
        Grasp a resistance band with both hands, with your elbows out to the sides, and arms bent 90° and parallel to the ground. Without moving your upper arms, straighten your arms, then slowly bring them back to the starting position. Do this 10 times.
        3. Make the exercise fun
        If you're looking for motivation to strengthen your shoulders, Crowley recommends injecting some fun into exercises. Here are two examples.
        Make alphabet shapes. This exercise strengthens all of the muscles in your shoulders. Stand in front of a wall, an arm's length away. Use one hand to press a tennis ball against the wall (at shoulder height). Keep your arm straight, your hand flat on the ball, and roll the ball in small letter shapes from A to Z. Or roll the ball in circles (or up and down) for a few minutes.
        Dance. Moving your arms to music (while sitting or standing) will strengthen all of your shoulder muscles. Just play music that appeals to you and let it inspire arm movements, such as swinging them left and then right or (if you don't have a shoulder injury) putting your arms overhead and pushing your palms repeatedly toward the ceiling in time to the music. Try some dance moves from the '60s, like the Swim (mimic swimming movements with your arms) or the Hitchhiker (make arm movements with your thumbs out, like you're hitching a ride). ""When you enjoy exercise, you're more likely to do it,"" Crowley says, ""and even a little bit of shoulder strengthening at a time will make a difference.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-best-strength-building-exercise-to-lower-blood-pressure,The best strength-building exercise to lower blood pressure?,"Aerobic exercise involves moving the largest muscles of your body in a rhythmic, repetitive pattern — think brisk walking, running, cycling, and swimming. It's long been considered the best type of activity to lower blood pressure. But growing evidence shows that strength training can also reduce blood pressure. According to a new study, the most effective type involves contracting your muscles without any movement, which is known as isometric or static exercise (see ""Muscle-strengthening activity: Types, terms, and examples"").
        Published October 2023 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, the study pooled findings from 270 clinical trials involving a total of more than 15,000 people. All the trials lasted at least two weeks and reported the effects of exercise on blood pressure. As expected, most types of exercise helped lower blood pressure. But the most effective workout, especially in people who had high blood pressure, was isometric exercise training.
        ""It's an interesting and somewhat provocative finding because of the historic focus on aerobic exercise for reducing blood pressure,"" says Dr. Timothy Churchill, a cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. Aerobic (which means ""with oxygen"") exercise boosts your heart rate and increases blood circulation to deliver oxygen throughout the body. The blood pressure benefits appear to stem from improvements in heart and blood vessel health.
        
          
            
              
                Muscle-strengthening activity: Types, terms, and examples
                Anything that makes your muscles work harder than usual counts as a muscle-strengthening activity — something all adults should aim to do at least two days a week, according to the federal Physical Activity Guidelines.
                Often referred to as strength training, this type of exercise works by harnessing resistance — that is, an opposing force that muscles have to strain against. It's also known as resistance training or weight training. You can use many different things to supply resistance, including your own body weight, free weights such as dumbbells, elastic bands, or specialized machines. Other options include medicine balls, kettlebells, and weighted ropes.
                Muscles can grow stronger by exerting force through these three actions:
                Concentric. Muscles move joints while shortening. Think of what happens when you flex your arm to show off your upper arm (biceps) muscle. It's the same type of motion you would use when raising a dumbbell or lifting a bag of groceries off the counter.
                Eccentric. Muscles move joints while lengthening. As you slowly lower a dumbbell or grocery bag, your biceps muscles lengthen while producing force to lower the object in a controlled manner rather than simply letting it drop.
                Isometric. Muscles don't shorten or lengthen much, and joints do not move. If you push against a wall, for example, or try to lift an object that is far too heavy for you, your arm muscles will tense. But since your muscles can't generate enough force to lift the object or shift the wall, they stay in the same position instead of shortening.
                Muscle-strengthening exercises that include both concentric and eccentric muscle movement is known as ""dynamic"" or ""isotonic"" strength training. Examples include push-ups, biceps curls, and squats. Examples of ""isometric"" or ""static"" strength training include doing wall squats (also called wall sits), planks, or an overhead hold.
              
            
          
        
        Adding isometric exercise
        The new findings add to the evidence that strength-based exercises are also good for cardiovascular health. But rather than taking priority over all other types of exercise, strength training should be incorporated into your overall routine, says Dr. Churchill. While isometric exercise — especially wall squats — appeared to lower blood pressure the most, the study authors were somewhat cautious about overselling that finding, given that relatively few studies (18 of the 270) included isometric exercise and none compared it directly against other forms of exercise.
        Still, experts have speculated about a possible mechanism. During isometric exercise, clenched muscles temporarily constrain blood flow. The subsequent surge of blood may stimulate the release of factors that help relax the vessels and ultimately contribute to a reduction in blood pressure.
        Isometric exercise has some additional advantages. Because you don't move your joints, isometrics can be easier and safer for people with joint injuries or diseases. Many of the exercises don't require any special equipment, and you can do them anywhere.
        The physical activity guidelines don't specify how long to do muscle-building exercises. ""But even just 10 to 15 minutes, two days a week, is a good place to start,"" says Dr. Churchill. Try doing some wall squats or a modified plank.

                To do walk squats, stand with your back flat against a wall. Walk your feet about 18 inches from the wall, placing your feet shoulder-width apart. Tighten your abdominal muscles, then inhale and exhale as you slide your back down the wall until your thighs are as close to parallel as possible to the floor and your knees are above your ankles. Hold for 20 to 60 seconds. Slide slowly back up the wall to a standing position. Rest for 30 to 60 seconds, and repeat two times.

        Remember to breathe!
        During any type of strength training, be careful not to hold your breath. Some people do this unintentionally, although others have a misguided belief that breath holding increases their effort and power. But breath holding during exertion can cause dangerous blood pressure spikes, says Dr. Churchill.
        When you do dynamic strength training, exhale as you lift, push, or pull, and inhale as you release. When doing isometric strength training, take a big breath as you move into position. Then take shallow breaths as you hold the pose, and take regular full breaths during the rest and recovery phase.

But how much protein do you need and what are the best sources of this essential macronutrient?
        Why we need protein
        Proteins are building blocks in the body. They make up bones, cartilage, muscle, blood, skin, enzymes, hormones, and vitamins. They're essential for growth and development, repair and build cells and tissue such as muscle, and play an important role in body processes such as blood clotting, fluid balance, and the immune response.
        Proteins are made from amino acids. There are some amino acids that our bodies can make on their own. These are called nonessential amino acids. But there are nine amino acids that our bodies must get by consuming foods that contain them. These are called essential amino acids, and they are necessary for normal body functioning.
        What foods are high in protein?
        We can get protein from plant or animal sources. Protein in our diet can come from meat, dairy products, nuts, some vegetables, and certain grains and beans.

        Try to eat a variety of protein-rich foods to ensure you are meeting your daily protein needs as well as getting the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients needed for optimal health. Proteins that come from animal sources, such as meat, eggs, and milk, as well as soy and quinoa, are called complete proteins. This means they contain all the essential amino acids the body needs and are the highest-quality protein sources.
        You can also get essential amino acids from plant-based foods. However, most plant-based proteins do not contain all of the needed essential amino acids, and so are called incomplete proteins. If you avoid animal proteins, the best way to ensure you are consuming a healthy mix of amino acids is to enjoy a variety of plant-based proteins through the day.
        Foods that are particularly high in protein include:
        Lean meats such as chicken, turkey, beef, and pork are excellent sources of high-quality protein as well as important nutrients like iron and zinc. To avoid unhealthy saturated fat, opt for lean or low-fat meat options such as lean ground beef, pork loin, or skinless chicken breasts.
        Fish like salmon, tuna, and mackerel are not only rich in protein but also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for heart health. Look for seafood options that are lower in methylmercury, such as salmon, anchovies, and trout.
        Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt are rich in protein, calcium, and other essential nutrients. Greek yogurt is a great option, as it is high in protein as well as nutrients such as calcium, vitamins, and minerals. Dairy products can be high in saturated fat, so choose low-fat dairy options and limit the amount of cheese you eat.
        Beans, peas, and lentils include kidney beans, pinto beans, white beans, black beans, lima beans, fava beans, soybeans, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, pigeon peas, split peas, lentils, and edamame. These plant-based foods are excellent sources of protein as well as fiber, folate, potassium, iron, and zinc.
        Nuts and seeds include almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, peanuts, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and peanut butter. They are not only rich in protein but also provide healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. Nuts are high in fat and calories, so be mindful of portion sizes.
        Eggs contain all of the essential amino acids, making them a complete protein source. Eggs are also a source of vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, and antioxidants.
        Quinoa is a plant-based protein source that is also a complete protein. A cup of cooked quinoa provides about 8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber. Quinoa is also a good source of minerals such as manganese, phosphorus, and copper.
        Soy products such as tofu and tempeh are good sources of protein, especially for vegetarians and vegans. One-quarter cup of tofu provides seven grams of protein.
        How much protein should you eat daily?
        For the average adult, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein, or the amount you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements and not get sick, is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or 0.36 grams per pound. For a person who weighs 75 kg (165 pounds), that comes to 60 grams of protein per day.
        To determine your target daily protein intake, you can multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36, or use this online calculator.
        It's important to keep in mind that your daily protein need is not a fixed number. For example, your protein needs will fluctuate depending on your level of physical activity, and whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
        Should I get my protein from animal or plant sources?
        In order to get enough dietary protein in the most healthful way, nutritional guidelines have shifted away from specific amounts of daily protein, and toward the importance of eating healthier, protein-rich foods.
        It's important to think about the protein ""package"" when making protein choices because food containing protein also includes fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, sugar, sodium, additives, and other components.
        While meat provides high-quality protein, some meats also provide unhealthy amounts of saturated fats and sodium. If you eat meat, it's important to choose leaner meats and poultry. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), meats that are high in saturated fat include:
        
          fatty cuts of beef, pork, and lamb
          ground beef (75% to 85% lean)
          processed meats such as bologna, salami, sausages, hot dogs, bacon
          some poultry, such as duck.
        
        A high-protein diet that is predominantly made up of red meat or processed meat is a cause for concern. Research has consistently found that both unprocessed and processed red meat are linked to higher risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. One meta-analysis found that replacing red meat with healthy plant proteins decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease.
        For optimal health and nutrition, you should emphasize plant-based protein and protein from a variety of sources. The Mediterranean style of eating is one approach that emphasizes healthy protein sources.
        Benefits of a higher protein diet
        While most Americans consume more than enough protein, some people may benefit from a higher intake of protein.
        To maintain or gain muscle mass
        If you are over age 50, you should increase protein intake to one gram per kilogram of your body weight just to maintain muscle mass, which declines with age.
        If you're trying to gain muscle mass, a higher-protein diet can help support muscle repair and growth. When you exercise, muscle cells break down. Protein from food helps to repair the damage, ultimately strengthening muscles.
        To lose weight
        The value of high-protein diets for weight loss remains controversial. However, one meta-analysis found that a high-protein diet could lead to weight loss and prevent weight regain after weight loss. The authors note the need for future studies that follow patients for longer than one year for more insight into this issue.
        Other benefits
        One study found that eating plant-based protein was associated with lower odds of developing cognitive decline later in life. For every 5% of calories that came from plant protein instead of carbohydrates, researchers observed a 26% lower risk for developing dementia in study participants.
        How much protein is too much?
        The idea of an upper limit of protein intake is controversial. Some experts believe the recommended amounts are too low. Others believe we are overconsuming protein.
        In general, the average person (not a body builder or an elite athlete) does not need high levels of protein and should not exceed 2 grams per kilogram; or about 125 grams per day for a 140-pound person.
        A main concern with taking in too much protein is an overall dietary imbalance. Consuming excessive protein may lead to inadequate intake of carbohydrates and fats. It's important to maintain a well-rounded diet that includes a balance of all three macronutrients for overall health.
        In addition, if you increase your protein intake without increasing physical activity, you may be taking in too many calories without expending enough, which could result in weight gain.
        There is also some evidence that eating a relatively high-protein diet can be problematic for individuals with pre-existing kidney conditions. A diet high in animal protein may pose a higher risk of kidney stones.",Jenette Restivo,"December 1, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/several-factors-may-cause-testosterone-levels-to-drop,Several factors may cause testosterone levels to drop,"Testosterone levels tend to slowly decline in middle-aged men, and often fall faster after age 70.
        In an analysis of 11 studies involving about 25,000 men in total, researchers looked at the possible factors for this more rapid decline in testosterone levels later in life.
        They found that having a body mass index higher than 27 and engaging in less than 75 minutes of weekly vigorous activity were each linked to lower testosterone levels. Other contributing factors were having ever smoked and health issues like high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Low testosterone levels can contribute to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and reduced sex drive.
        While the findings only showed an association, the researchers stressed the need for older men to continue engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors and managing chronic health issues, which could help maintain their body's testosterone production. Men also should address these areas before considering hormone therapy for low testosterone. The results appeared in the September 2023 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/veins-are-a-key-player-in-the-body-heres-why-202311292997,Veins are a key player in the body: Here's why,"Blood circulation is vital to our health. Our arteries deliver oxygen, energy-rich nutrients, hormones, immune cells, and other essentials throughout the body. When deliveries are cut off, organs and tissue can be irreversibly damaged within minutes.

But a second part of blood circulation is also vitally important: the return trip. After our arteries deliver the goods, our blood must return to the lungs to pick up more oxygen, stock up on nutrients, get rid of carbon dioxide, and head back to the heart to be pumped out again. In this way, blood is in continuous motion, ensuring organs and tissues get what they need while waste products are removed.

The vessels designed for the return trip are your veins. Read on for answers to questions about how veins work, what can interfere with their ability to work smoothly, and five ways to keep thousands of miles of these blood vessels healthy.

What are veins and what do they do?

Perhaps you haven't thought much about your veins. Or if you have, maybe you focused on varicose veins, those swollen, unsightly purplish vessels that may be visible just beneath the skin of the legs. Or perhaps you had a blood test and the person taking the blood had a hard time finding a ""good vein."" But these are just a small part of vein world.

Veins make up a network of connecting tubes throughout the human body, ranging in size from 1 mm (about the size of a pencil point) to 2 cm (about the size of a quarter), that bring blood low in oxygen back to the lungs to reload with oxygen. Then four pulmonary veins carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart. (Fun fact: some people have three or five pulmonary veins, but most of us have four.)

Often, major veins are found alongside similarly named arteries, like a highway with cars moving in opposite directions: in the upper arm, for example, the axillary vein lies next to the axillary artery; in the kidney, the renal vein runs alongside the renal artery.

How do veins help keep blood flowing?

Let's start by picturing tiny red blood cells loaded up with oxygen. Now imagine you're a red blood cell that has just traveled from the heart through the arteries to a calf muscle of someone who is jogging. After you drop off the much-needed oxygen and pick up waste products like carbon dioxide, you need to get back to the heart — fast! — because exercising muscles need extra oxygen.

But wait. As you head back to the lungs to load up on more oxygen and release carbon dioxide, there's a steep climb straight up. How can you make it back to the lungs without help?

Fortunately, veins have tiny valves within them that allow blood to flow in only one direction. When muscles contract near larger veins, they pump blood toward the lungs. In addition, taking in a breath creates a sort of suction that pulls blood toward the lungs. Without these forces encouraging blood to flow in the right direction through the veins, blood flowing into the legs would pool there, causing dangerously high pressure and swelling.

Why are veins blue?

Actually, they aren't. People think they're blue because that's often how they appear in diagrams and illustrations. But that's just to set them apart from the bright red arteries.

The veins on the back of your hand may appear blue if you have light-colored skin. That's an illusion due to the way light is absorbed by the skin. In people with darker skin tones, veins tend to blend in more.

If you could look at veins directly, without any skin in the way, they'd appear pale because they are naturally colorless, or dark red due to the blood inside them.

What sort of problems can occur in veins?

Blood clots, varicose veins, and venous insufficiency are some of the most common health conditions affecting the veins:


	Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, blocking blood flow. This condition is potentially serious because clots in deep veins can travel to the lungs, causing a life-threatening pulmonary embolism by blocking an artery that delivers blood to part of the lungs.
	Superficial thrombophlebitis is a blood clot in a small vein just under the skin. This causes inflammation and pain.
	Varicose veins are small veins under the skin that swell and twist. While these may be harmless, they can cause pain and are occasionally complicated by blood clots.
	Venous insufficiency occurs when the valves in veins are damaged — due to aging or prior blood clots, for example. The blood flow through the veins may be impaired, leading to leg swelling, increased pressure, inflamed skin, and poor healing.


One far more rare condition goes by the impressive name of phlegmasia cerulea dolens. It is a serious complication of DVT in which the obstruction of blood flow through a deep vein leads to blocked blood flow through nearby arteries. That can cause gangrene and the need for amputation.

All of these conditions can affect circulation temporarily or in a lasting way. Treatments are aimed at restoring circulation, if possible.

Top 5 ways to improve vein health

Healthy veins help the heart, brain, and every other part of your body. Here are five ways to improve vein health, even if you already have vein disease:


	Be active. Exercise regularly and avoid prolonged standing or sitting.
	Choose healthy foods, such as those in a plant-based, heart-healthy diet.
	Maintain a healthy weight.
	Don't smoke.
	Wear compression stockings if you already have vein disease such as venous insufficiency.


And of course, seek medical care for unexplained swelling, inflammation, or ulcers on your legs, ankles, or feet.

The bottom line

Our veins are busy around the clock, shuttling blood from distant sites back to the lungs and heart, which pumps enriched blood out again. Without veins, blood circulation could not happen. They're a good example of how many parts of your amazing body are easy to overlook until something goes wrong.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","November 29, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/statins-types-uses-side-effects-and-alternatives,"Statins: Types, uses, side effects, and alternatives","If your doctor wants you to take a statin for high cholesterol, you're not alone. More than 40 million Americans take them, too. In fact, statins are the most prescribed drugs in the U.S.
        But you may have questions. You may be wondering about side effects of statins, types of statins, how statins work, and what your doctor may prescribe instead of statins to help lower your cholesterol.
        What are statins?
        Statins are prescription drugs you take as pills to lower cholesterol. Cholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes. However, when you have too much, it can build up inside the walls of your arteries. This is called plaque. Cholesterol-laden plaque contributes to heart disease in different ways.
        A buildup of cholesterol can make your arteries narrow and even block them. If a cholesterol plaque ruptures, a blood clot forms there and this can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Cholesterol also provokes inflammation in the arteries, which can contribute to the formation of artery-blocking clots.
        Sometimes, just changing what you eat and being more active can lower cholesterol. But if your cholesterol stays high, you may need a statin or other cholesterol-lowering medication.
        How do statins work?
        Statins interfere with how your liver makes cholesterol; most importantly, LDL, the ""bad"" kind. Triglycerides are a second kind of cholesterol that can contribute to plaque buildup. HDL has traditionally been referred to as the ""good"" cholesterol because it helps your body get rid of LDL. However, changing HDL has not been seen to reduce the risk of heart disease, so this is no longer a focus of cholesterol management.
        Statins work to lower LDL levels. This slows the buildup of cholesterol in your arteries.
        Statins also reduce inflammation in artery walls. If you do have plaque buildup inside your arteries, statins can help prevent them from breaking open and leading to blood clots.
        Once you start taking a statin (or any cholesterol lowering drug), you probably will stay on it for life. If you stop, your protection from the statin will wear off.
        Who might benefit from statins?
        You may benefit from statins if you
        
          have high LDL cholesterol levels
          have had a heart attack or stroke, or are at risk for having one
          have diabetes (a risk factor for heart disease) and are over age 40.
        
        Statins may help you live a longer and healthier life. But the degree to which you may benefit can vary. Your doctor can tell you about your personal risk and how much benefit to expect.
        People who are pregnant or who have liver disease should not take statins.
        What types of statins are available?
        Eight statins are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA):
        
          atorvastatin (Lipitor)
          fluvastatin (Lescol)
          lovastatin (Mevacor)
          lovatstatin extended release (Altoprev)
          pitavastatin (Livalo)
          pravastatin (Pravachol)
          rosuvastatin (Crestor)
          simvastatin (Zocor).
        
        Your doctor picks which statin may work best for you by considering a few things. They include how much you need to lower your LDL by, and other medicines you are taking. Sometimes people will have a side effect with one statin but are able to tolerate another one.
        What are possible side effects of statins?
        More than three decades of research have shown that statins are safe and effective. But like all drugs, statins can have side effects.
        The most common side effects of statins are muscle aches and feeling tired. Other side effects that aren't as common are headaches, constipation, diarrhea, and sleep problems.
        A 2022 study published in The Lancet reviewed the records of over 150,000 people in randomized trials of statins, and analyzed those who had muscle aches after taking statins or placebo. The study found that more than 90% of those symptoms were not related to the statins. The researchers concluded that the risks of muscle problems are low compared to the health benefits of statins.
        How can I manage side effects of statins?
        Muscle soreness is the main reason why people want to stop using statins. Studies have evaluated many therapies for resolving statin muscle aches, including vitamin D, and coenzyme Q10, but have not found compelling evidence that any of them are effective.
        In many cases, side effects will go away as your body gets used to the statin. If they don't, your doctor may suggest switching to a different statin or taking a lower dose, and sometimes taking the low dose every other day, for example.
        What alternatives to statins might my doctor prescribe?
        Some people just can't tolerate the side effects of statins. Others still have high cholesterol even after taking statins for a while.
        Fortunately, there are different drugs to try and other ways to lower cholesterol.
        Non-statin drugs
        There are many classes of drugs to help lower cholesterol. These include ezetimibe (Zetia), bempedoic acid (Nexletol), and bile acid sequestrants, which have been seen to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke.
        Ezetimibe reduces the amount of cholesterol your body absorbs from food (or reabsorbs from what the liver releases). Large, randomized studies did not find any difference in side effects of ezetimibe compared with placebo.
        Bempedoic acid blocks the production of cholesterol in your liver, but the medication does not get into muscle cells, so it can be an effective option for people who have had problems with statins. It can be taken alone but is usually taken with other cholesterol-lowering medications. Side effects include gout (especially in those with a history of gout), mild worsening of creatinine (a measure of kidney function), and gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis).
        Bile acid sequestrants stop bile acid in your stomach from getting absorbed in your blood. Your liver then takes the cholesterol from your blood to make the bile acid it needs. Side effects include constipation, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, and muscle pain.
        PCSK9 inhibitors
        PCSK9 inhibitors are a newer type of cholesterol drug. These medicines are for people who have an inherited condition that causes very high levels of LDL. They also are for people with heart disease whose cholesterol has not been sufficiently lowered with a maximum dose of statins.
        PCSK9 inhibitors work by helping the liver remove cholesterol from the blood. PCSK9 is a naturally occurring protein that breaks down certain receptors in the liver that remove LDL from the blood as it passes through the liver. By reducing the number of these receptors, PCSK9 increases the level of LDL in the blood. By hampering PCSK9's ability to work, PCSK9 inhibitors allow more LDL receptors to remain active in the liver. With more receptors to sweep away LDL, a person's blood levels of LDL drop. These drugs are given by injection and are more expensive than statin pills. Side effects include flulike symptoms and pain from the injection.
        Nondrug ways to lower cholesterol
        Some people can lower their cholesterol without medicine by making lifestyle changes. Those changes include having a healthy diet. The DASH diet from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is one example.
        The DASH diet emphasizes fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish and poultry, beans, nuts, and low-fat dairy products. It limits sugary drinks, sweets, and foods high in saturated fat, like fatty meats and full-fat dairy products.
        If you are overweight, losing weight may lower your LDL. Having a healthy diet can help with that, too.
        Another way to lower cholesterol is through regular physical activity. Aim for 30 minutes each day. Other things to try include managing stress and quitting smoking. Both of those have an effect on cholesterol.","Lisa Catanese, ELS","November 29, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/do-toddler-formulas-deliver-on-nutrition-claims-202311272996,Do toddler formulas deliver on nutrition claims?,"Once babies are a year old, those who have been drinking infant formula don't need it anymore. By that age, they can and should get most of their nutritional needs met by solid foods. Drinking cow's milk, or a fortified plant milk such as soy milk, is perfectly fine. And honestly, they don't even need that much of it.
        A 2023 report from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) looked closely at what toddlers actually need for healthy growth and development — and toddler milks didn't make the cut. Here are a few key takeaways for parents.
        Is toddler formula more nutritious than milk?
        No. But for some parents, it feels odd and uncomfortable to stop formula and give cow's milk. They feel like formula is more nutritious and maybe even more easily digested. That may not be surprising: a lot of marketing money has encouraged people to think this way.
        So it's understandable that some parents turn to formulas marketed for toddlers. It's especially understandable given the claims that formula companies make about the nutritional advantages of toddler formula. You may have seen — or bought — these products marketed purely as ""follow-up formulas,"" ""transition formulas,"" or ""growing-up milks."" These formulas do not have a medical purpose. They simply help companies keep the customers they would otherwise lose once babies turn a year old.
        Not only are toddler formulas unnecessary, some of them are actually worse than cow's milk. That's the main message shared by the AAP, which hopes to help parents understand what older infants and toddlers actually need — and see through the marketing claims.
        Do some toddlers need specialized formulas?
        Yes. Just to be clear, I am not talking about specialized formulas for children over 12 months who have digestive, metabolic, or other medical problems.
        Are toddler formulas regulated in any way?
        No. Because infant formulas must meet all the nutritional requirements of babies less than 12 months of age, they are regulated by the FDA. The FDA has requirements about what they must and must not contain, and it makes sure that the facilities where infant formulas are made are regularly inspected.
        This is not true of toddler formulas. They are not regulated, and not required to prove any of the claims they make about their nutritional benefits.
        What might make a toddler formula unhealthy?
        Given the lack of regulation, it's not surprising that there is wide variation in the composition of toddler formulas. But what is particularly worrisome, says the AAP, is that some of these products are actually unhealthy. They may have too little or too much protein, or have added sweeteners. These added sweeteners can build a child's ""sweet tooth"" and set them on the path to obesity.
        Additionally, toddler formulas are more expensive than cow's milk, creating a financial burden for families — one that is definitely not worth it.
        Is your toddler's diet healthy?
        Instead of reaching for a toddler formula, try to take a broader look at your child's diet. Toddlers should eat from the same healthy food groups we all need. This includes
        
          fruits and vegetables
          whole grains
          protein (such as meat, fish, beans, and nut butters)
          dairy or dairy substitutes fortified with calcium and vitamin D.
        
        Limit added sugars, and after age 2 try to limit less-healthy fats in the child's diet as well. The best way to build healthy lifetime habits is to start early, and this is particularly true of nutrition.","Claire McCarthy, MD","November 27, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cellulitis-how-long-does-it-take-to-heal-on-legs-202311202994,Cellulitis: How long does it take to heal on legs?,"Cellulitis is an infection of the deep layers of the skin. It develops when bacteria enter through a cut, bite, or wound — including tiny breaks in cracked, dry skin. Common skin-dwelling bacteria, Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, are the usual culprits. Although cellulitis can occur anywhere on the body, the most common location is the lower leg.
        Dr. Arash Mostaghimi, a dermatologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, weighs in on new research that explores important questions about how long it takes to fully heal.
        What are the symptoms of cellulitis?
        The body's natural immune response to this bacterial invasion triggers a painful rash that appears red on lighter skin and dark purple on darker skin. The affected area also may be swollen and feel warm.
        How is cellulitis treated?
        The typical treatment is five to 10 days of antibiotic pills. More serious cases may require intravenous antibiotics.
        How quickly can antibiotics help cellulitis resolve?
        After starting antibiotic treatment, people usually notice improvement within a few days. However, the area may remain swollen, warm, and painful even after 10 days.
        Does that mean the antibiotic treatment was ineffective? Not necessarily, according to a recent study of people with cellulitis in the lower leg that described the natural history of the healing stages following antibiotics.
        ""The healing process has two parts, which is why a full recovery takes longer than you might think,"" says Dr. Mostaghimi.
        First, the antibiotics and your white blood cells work together to kill the bacteria. But your body's immune response against the bacteria may take a while to shut down. As a result, this second stage of the healing process may include some residual symptoms, he explains.
        What did the study find?
        The study included 247 people with mild to moderate cellulitis of the lower leg who received antibiotics for seven to 10 days. By day 10:
        
          Their swelling had lessened by 50%, and the size of the affected area had shrunk by about 55%.
          A blood marker of inflammation, C-reactive protein, dropped during treatment and reached near-normal levels in all the participants.
          Still, more than half continued to report discomfort in the affected leg, with 14% ranking their pain as 5 or greater on a scale of 1 to 10.
        
        This pattern of discomfort isn't unusual, especially with leg infections, says Dr. Mostaghimi. As people are recovering from leg cellulitis, they're often advised to elevate the leg, which helps to ease the swelling. (Putting a warm, moist washcloth on the area may also help.)
        But after they feel better and start walking more, fluid shifts back down into the legs. So it's not surprising that the area might feel a little swollen and uncomfortable again once they're back on their feet, he says.
        Who is at greatest risk for cellulitis?
        Remember, cellulitis typically occurs when bacteria normally present on our skin manage to breach that shield to enter the body.
        Some people who develop cellulitis have no obvious injury or skin damage to explain the infection, which can occur in people who are generally healthy. However, people with certain health problems are more prone to cellulitis. This includes people who are overweight or have diabetes, a weakened immune system, poor circulation, or chronic edema (swollen limbs).
        Additionally, skin conditions such as eczema and athlete's foot can create small cracks in the skin that make it easier for bacteria to penetrate deeper into the skin, Dr. Mostaghimi says. Scratching a bug bite until it bleeds is another possible entry point for bacteria.
        What happens if cellulitis goes untreated?
        Untreated cellulitis can be very serious. The rash may spread, be surrounded with blisters, and become increasingly painful. Nearby lymph nodes may become tender and swollen, followed by fever and chills. Seek medical care right away if you experience these symptoms.
        The bottom line
        ""It's important for people with leg cellulitis to realize that it may take a bit longer after finishing your antibiotics for all of your symptoms to completely resolve,"" says Dr. Mostaghimi. You'll probably start to feel better within a few days, but always finish all the pills in your antibiotic prescription. However, having residual symptoms once you're done does not mean you need another course of antibiotics or a different antibiotic, he says.",Julie Corliss,"November 20, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/8-secrets-to-a-good-nights-sleep,8 secrets to a good night's sleep,"After a night spent tossing and turning, you wake up feeling like a couple of the Seven Dwarves: sleepy… and grumpy. Restless nights and weary mornings can become more frequent as we get older and our sleep patterns change.
        Later in life there tends to be a decrease in the number of hours slept. There are also some changes in the way the body regulates circadian rhythms. This internal clock helps your body respond to changes in light and dark. When it undergoes a shift with age, it can be harder to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night.
        We all have trouble sleeping from time to time, but when insomnia persists day after day, it can become a real problem. Beyond making us tired and moody, a lack of sleep can have serious effects on our health, increasing our propensity for obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.
        If you've been having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, you may have turned to sleep medications in search of more restful slumber. However, these drugs can have side effects, including appetite changes, dizziness, drowsiness, abdominal discomfort, dry mouth, headaches, and strange dreams.
        You don't need to avoid sleep aids if you absolutely need them, but before you turn to pills, try these eight tips to help you get a better night's sleep.
        1. Exercise
        Going for a brisk daily walk won't just trim you down, it will also keep you up less often at night. Exercise boosts the effect of natural sleep hormones such as melatonin. Just watch the timing of your workouts. Exercising too close to bedtime can be stimulating. Morning workouts that expose you to bright daylight will help the natural circadian rhythm.
        2. Reserve bed for sleep and sex
        Don't use your bed as an office for answering phone calls, texting, and responding to emails. Also, avoid watching late-night TV there. The bed needs to be a stimulus for sleeping, not for wakefulness. Reserve your bed for sleep and sex.
        3. Keep it comfortable
        Television and your smartphone aren't the only possible distractions in your bedroom. Ambience can affect your sleep quality too. Make sure your bedroom is as comfortable as possible. Ideally you want a quiet, dark, cool environment. All of these things promote sleep onset.
        4. Start a sleep ritual
        When you were a child and your mother read you a story and tucked you into bed every night, this comforting ritual helped lull you to sleep. Even in adulthood, a set of bedtime rituals can have a similar effect. Rituals help signal the body and mind that it's coming to be time for sleep. Drink a glass of warm milk. Take a bath. Or listen to calming music to unwind before bed.
        5. Eat — but not too much
        A grumbling stomach can be distracting enough to keep you awake, but so can an overly full belly. Avoid eating a big meal within two to three hours of bedtime. If you're hungry right before bed, eat a small, healthy snack (such as an apple with a slice of cheese or a few whole-wheat crackers) to satisfy you until breakfast.
        6. Avoid alcohol and caffeine
        If you do have a snack before bed, wine and chocolate shouldn't be part of it. Chocolate contains caffeine, which is a stimulant. Surprisingly, alcohol has a similar effect. It makes you a little sleepy, but it's actually a stimulant and it disrupts sleep during the night. Also, stay away from anything acidic (such as citrus fruits and juices) or spicy, which can give you heartburn.
        7. De-stress
        The bills are piling up and your to-do list is a mile long. Daytime worries can bubble to the surface at night. Stress is a stimulus. It activates the fight-or-flight hormones that work against sleep. Give yourself time to wind down before bed. Learning some form of the relaxation response can promote good sleep and can also reduce daytime anxiety. To relax, try deep breathing exercises. Inhale slowly and deeply, and then exhale.
        8. Get checked
        An urge to move your legs, snoring, and a burning pain in your stomach, chest, or throat are symptoms of three common sleep disrupters — restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, and gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD. If these symptoms are keeping you up at night or making you sleepy during the day, see your doctor for an evaluation.
        
          
            
              
                Taking sleep medicines safely
                If you've tried lifestyle changes and they aren't working, your doctor may prescribe hypnotic sleep medications. These drugs can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer, but they also can have side effects. Here are some tips for ensuring that you're taking these medicines as safely as possible:
                
                  Tell your doctor about all other medicines you're taking. Some drugs can interact with sleep medications.
                  Take only the lowest possible effective dose, for the shortest possible period of time.
                  Carefully follow your doctor's instructions. Make sure you take the right dose at the right time of day (which is typically just before bed).
                  Call your doctor right away if you experience any side effects, such as excess sleepiness during the day or dizziness.
                  While you're taking the sleep medicine, also practice the good sleep habits outlined in this article.
                  Avoid drinking alcohol and driving while taking sleep aids.
                  Sleep medications may make you walk unsteadily if you get out of bed in a drowsy state. If you routinely have to get out of bed during the night to urinate, be sure the path to your bathroom is clear of obstacles or loose rugs so you don't fall.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/stomach-troubles-with-no-clear-cause-heres-what-you-can-do,Stomach troubles with no clear cause: Here's what you can do,"Your stomach doesn't feel well. It's not heartburn, but you feel bloated, full, and nauseous.
        The discomfort started during a meal, or maybe a half an hour later. When this happens commonly, you should seek medical evaluation. Your doctor will make sure there are no worrisome symptoms or signs, and then likely diagnose you with functional dyspepsia. This is a type of chronic indigestion, or a stomachache and full feeling during and after meals.
        While most often there is no single medical solution to functional dyspepsia, different approaches might work. Here are some to try out: 
        Eat Right
        
          Avoid foods that trigger symptoms. Common culprits are caffeine, chocolate, alcohol, and spicy, acidic, or fatty foods.
          Eat smaller, more frequent meals so your stomach does not distend and can empty quickly.
          Chew your food slowly and completely.
          Avoid activities that result in swallowing excess air, such eating quickly, chewing gum, drinking carbonated beverages, and smoking.
          Avoid lying down within two hours of eating.
          Keep your weight under control.
        
        Reduce Stress
        
          Use stress reduction techniques, including relaxation therapies.
          Exercise. In addition to being good for your overall health, it's a proven stress reducer.
          Try cognitive behavioral therapy.
        
        Reduce Fatigue
        
          Get enough rest.
          Try to go to bed and get up at the same times each day.
          Avoid caffeine after noon.
        
        Exercise
        
          Perform aerobic exercise three to five times a week for 20 to 40 minutes per session.
          Don't exercise immediately after eating.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/long-lasting-c-diff-infections-a-threat-to-the-gut-202311012987,Long-lasting C. diff infections: A threat to the gut,"If you've ever dealt with diarrhea, you know how quickly it leaves you feeling depleted. Now imagine a case that rages on and on — or comes back again and again.
        This is the reality for nearly 500,000 Americans each year who have the bacterial infection known as Clostridioides difficile, or C. diff. Virulent diarrhea and inflammation of the colon can even turn life-threatening.
        This primer will help you understand how C. diff spreads and releases toxins, what the common symptoms are, and who is most vulnerable. Dr. Jessica Allegretti, director of the fecal microbiota program at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, also touches on promising preventive strategies and treatments.
        How does C. diff spread?
        Like many bacteria, C. diff is present in our stool. It's carried by virtually everyone — on our skin and even on the soles of our shoes. When C. diff bacteria are outside the body, they are inactive spores. They only have a chance to become active when they're swallowed and reach the intestines.
        Even then, many people who swallow C. diff spores never become ill. The spores only sicken people whose gut microbiome — the trillions of organisms living in their intestines — becomes imbalanced for one of the various reasons described below. When an imbalance occurs, the spores start to multiply and create toxins that lead to a C. diff infection.
        ""Many of us are colonized with C. diff bacteria without any consequences,"" says Dr. Allegretti. ""We're swallowing C. diff spores all the time. Only under the right circumstances will the spores germinate and release a toxin. It's the toxin that makes you sick.""
        What are the symptoms of a C. diff infection?
        The symptoms mimic those of many other types of gastrointestinal ailments. Initially, this may make it difficult to tell the infection apart from milder illnesses.
        Symptoms to watch for include
        
          persistent diarrhea lasting three or more days
          nausea
          fever
          stomach pain or tenderness
          appetite loss.
        
        ""C. diff isn't something that people in the general population should be walking around scared of,"" Dr. Allegretti says. ""But if you need to take an antibiotic, be on the lookout for diarrheal symptoms after finishing the course of antibiotics. Diarrhea that's associated with antibiotics alone should resolve once you finish taking the medication.""
        Who is most vulnerable?
        A few sobering facts from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC):
        
          C. diff is the top cause of health care-associated infections in the US.
          It disproportionately strikes people in hospitals and nursing homes.
          Among people over 65, one in 11 of those diagnosed with a health care-associated case of C. diff dies within a month.
        
        However, other groups are also susceptible to the infection. Health care-associated C. diff infections are plateauing, Dr. Allegretti notes, while so-called community-based infections that occur among the general population are increasing.
        People most likely to experience such infections:
        
          Are taking antibiotics or have just finished a course of antibiotic therapy. People are up to 10 times more likely to get C. diff while on antibiotics or during the month afterward, according to the CDC. ""Not everyone who takes an antibiotic gets C. diff, and not everyone who gets C. diff gets recurrent C. diff,"" says Dr. Allegretti. ""It has a lot to do with your host response, your gut microbiome, and your individual risk factors, such as immunosuppression or inflammatory bowel disease.""
          Have a weakened immune system due to cancer, organ transplant, or treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (such as people with inflammatory bowel disease or autoimmune conditions).
          Have close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with C. diff.
        
        What prevention strategies help block the spread of C. diff?
        Hospitals try to prevent C diff. among patients in several ways. They impose scrupulous hand-washing requirements among staff members. Patients who develop new diarrhea are tested for C. diff infection. Those who have it are isolated in their own rooms to help prevent further spread.
        Outside of a hospital, you can help prevent this gut infection through a few commonsense measures.
        
          Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water every time you use the bathroom and always before eating. Clean hands are especially important if you've had C. diff or know you've been exposed to someone with it. By the way, alcohol-based hand sanitizer isn't effective against C. diff because its organisms can form resistant spores.
          Take antibiotics only when strictly necessary and for the shortest period possible. ""The biggest thing we can do is advocate for ourselves,"" Dr. Allegretti says. ""During cold and flu season, we know a lot of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are written for infections that are most likely viral, not bacterial. Antibiotics do not kill viruses — and unnecessary antibiotics may upset the bacterial balance in your gut. Ask your doctor: Do I need this prescription? Is there an alternative?""
          When you do need antibiotics, ask if a narrow-spectrum antibiotic would be effective for your type of infection. Why? Broad-spectrum antibiotics kill a wider array of bacteria. This may be overkill, depleting your gut microbiome unnecessarily and enabling C. diff bacteria to germinate. ""The caveat is, we don't want patients to not take antibiotics they need for an actual infection,"" she says. ""But have a conversation with your health care team.""
        
        The type of antibiotic prescribed also matters, according to a 2023 study in the journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases. Researchers compared more than 159,000 people who had C. diff infection with 797,000 healthy controls. Study findings suggest that using clindamycin and later-generation cephalosporin antibiotics pose the greatest risk for C. diff infection. Meanwhile, the antibiotics minocycline and doxycycline were associated with the lowest risk.
        ""But there are very few safe antibiotics with regard to C. diff risk,"" Dr. Allegretti says.
        Can probiotics help prevent or treat C. diff infection?
        Probiotics are live microorganisms that can help keep the gut healthy and are found in supplements, yogurt, and other fermented foods. Two familiar examples are various strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
        However, probiotics haven't been found to prevent C. diff or its recurrence. Research performed in mice and humans suggests that giving probiotics after a course of antibiotics may slow the pace of microbiome recovery. ""You're potentially delaying the recovery of your microbiome with probiotics,"" she says.
        How is C. diff infection treated?
        Ironically, C. diff therapy typically starts with antibiotics, despite the infection's proliferation due to antibiotic use. The antibiotics of choice include fidaxomicin or oral vancomycin.
        However, about one in five people will suffer one or more recurrences –– and with each one, yet another recurrence becomes far likelier, Dr. Allegretti says. A repeat episode may happen because people haven't disinfected their homes effectively. That leaves them open to reinfection with the same strain of C. diff while still vulnerable.
        When C. diff recurs, fecal microbial transplants (FMT) are considered the gold standard treatment. FMT transplants fecal matter from a healthy donor into a patient's gut, placing it there using an endoscope, enema, or within an oral capsule. This year, the FDA approved two live fecal microbiota products aimed at preventing recurrent C. diff infections.
        ""We haven't gotten away from antibiotics yet to treat this disease,"" says Dr. Allegretti. ""But we have a lot of preventative strategies now. It's certainly very exciting for people struggling with C. diff infections.""",Maureen Salamon,"November 1, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/move-of-the-month-side-lunge-with-knee-lift,Move of the month: Side lunge with knee lift,"This exercise works your inner and outer thigh muscles and helps improve balance. It also trains your body to move from side to side, as opposed to the more common forward-and-back motions.
        Starting position: Stand up straight with your feet together and your arms at your sides.
        Movement: Step way out to the side with your left foot, while keeping your right foot in place. As your left foot hits the ground, transfer most of your weight to your left leg, hinge forward at your hips, and bend your left knee, lowering into a lunge. Keep your right leg straight and put your hands on your left thigh for support. Press with your left foot to stand back up, shifting your weight onto your right foot, and raise your left knee to hip level. Get your balance, and then step out with your left leg again for another lunge. Continue for 30 seconds. Repeat the sequence stepping out to the right for 30 seconds.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Keep your spine neutral (neither arched nor rounded), your shoulders down and back, and your abdominal muscles tightened throughout the move.
          Don't let the knee of the lunging leg extend farther forward than your toes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-tongue-scraping-improve-bad-breath,Can tongue scraping improve bad breath?,"Q.
          My friend is raving about a tool she bought to scrape her tongue, saying it makes her breath much fresher. Does tongue scraping work?
        
        A. For someone with persistent bad breath, also known as halitosis, using a tool to scrape the tongue can indeed make a difference. Here's why: many of us build up a white or yellowish coating on our tongues consisting of food debris, bacteria, and dead skin cells. This happens when tiny bumps on the tongue called papillae — which ""grab"" food and help move it to the throat — trap this buildup, which develops a bad smell after bacteria settle in.
        Sold in drugstores and online, tongue scrapers are small tools made of stainless steel, silicone, or plastic. Using one involves a simple raking motion to remove tongue buildup. You could also use a spoon. Don't scrape too aggressively, though, or you could overdo and scratch your tongue. Done regularly, tongue scraping can help a person's breath feel fresher — but it's not necessary. Oral care that includes twice-daily toothbrushing and regular mouthwash use will stave off bad breath for most people.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/try-this-look-snap-and-connect-for-better-memory-recall,"Try this: Look, snap, and connect for better memory recall","Mnemonics, named for Mnemosyne, the Greek goddess of memory, are techniques for recalling information.
        Mnemonics use cues — such as images, acronyms, rhymes, and easy-to-recall phrases — to reinforce memories.
        One type of mnemonic is called ""look, snap, connect."" It uses visualization, word association, and storytelling to help you solidify a memory so you can recall it later. It's a great tool for retaining details of new information.
        Here's an example of how it works:
        Look. Look refers to slowing down and noticing what you want to remember — for example, the fact that you parked your car in section 3B of the parking garage.
        Snap. Snap means taking a mental snapshot of the item. That could be an image of the actual parking garage sign, or a more elaborate image, such as that of three bumblebees (representing the 3B section where you parked).
        Connect. Connect involves connecting the image and the information you want to remember — in this case, the three bees and the garage section where you parked. Imagine the bees in your car. Then when you return to the garage and pause to remember where you parked, the image of the three bees buzzing in your car will help jog your memory.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-more-for-your-core,Do more for your core,"Practically every move you make originates from one area of your body: the core.
        When you mention the core, most people think of the ""six-pack"" of abs, a muscle called the rectus abdominis. But the core is made up of abdominal, pelvic, and back muscles.
        Beside the rectus abdominis, the other main muscles include the external abdominal obliques, located on the side and front of your abdomen, and the internal abdominal obliques, which lie under the external obliques. A deeper layer called the transverse abdominis lies under the obliques and attaches to your spine.
        ""The core is vital for your body, as it serves as the foundation for upper- and lower-body movements,"" says Shawn Pedicini, a physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. ""Your core musculature must have a good combination of endurance, stability, and power for many activities.""
        Everyday moves
        Your core is in action every day. For example, when you take a walk, your core muscles provide the support and endurance to maintain a healthy posture. Core strength allows you to transfer power during rotational movements, like swinging a golf club or tennis racket. Your core also generates stability around your spine to prevent back injuries, like when you lift and carry heavy objects.
        Core strength is also essential for preventing falls. ""Our bodies constantly have to adapt to ever-changing surfaces and environments,"" says Pedicini. ""Adequate core stability and strength can assist you in reacting to sudden changes and prevent falls.""
        Strengthen weak muscles
        Like any other muscles, your core muscles weaken with age. Also, a sedentary lifestyle can cause a person to lose core muscle strength faster over time compared with an active individual. ""This is why it's important to maintain exercise habits as you age and give regular attention to building and maintaining core strength,"" says Pedicini.
        He suggests doing core exercises two to four times per week. ""Include them in your regular workouts, or perform them independently."" And always get approval from your doctor, a physical therapist or a certified personal trainer if you have any physical limitations or health issues related to doing these movements.
        The best core exercises are movements that can activate many core muscles at one time. Here are three exercises that do that.
        Plank
        To get into the starting position, kneel on all fours with your hands and knees directly aligned under your shoulders and hips.
        Movement: Tighten your abdominal muscles, and lower your upper body onto your forearms, clasping your hands together and aligning your shoulders directly over your elbows. Extend both legs with your feet flexed and toes touching the floor so that you balance your body in a line like a plank. Hold. This is one rep. Aim to hold for 30 to 60 seconds, doing as many reps as needed to reach that total. For example, if you can hold a plank for 15 seconds, you would do four reps.
        Modifications: Do the exercise with straight arms (harder) or while leaning against a counter or table at a 45° angle (easier).
        Diagonal chops
        Stand and hold a lightweight medicine ball or dumbbell by your right side with both hands.
        Movement: While keeping your abdominal muscles tight and your feet grounded, twist at the waist and swing the ball or dumbbell up until it's just past your left shoulder. Only your arms and midsection should move. Reverse the movement and return to the original position to complete one rep. Repeat five to 10 times, switch sides, and repeat. Complete two or three sets on each side.
        Modification: If standing is a challenge, do this in a seated position.
        Deadbugs
        For this floor exercise, lie on your back with your feet off the floor and knees bent at 90°. Extend your arms toward the ceiling with your hands directly above your shoulders. Squeeze your abdominal muscles and maintain this tension throughout the movement.
        Movement: Extend your right leg, holding it six inches above the floor, while at the same time you lower your left arm, extending it over your head, parallel to the floor. Pause and return to the starting position. Repeat with the opposite arm and leg to complete one rep. Do 10 reps to complete one set. Rest and then repeat the movements to complete two or three sets.
        Modification: Make the movements less challenging by not lowering your arm and leg as close to the floor.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-new-weight-loss-drugs,Understanding new weight-loss drugs,"Some people who struggle with weight loss have been able to find assistance from several FDA-approved weight-loss medications, such as bupropion plus naltrexone (Contrave), phentermine (Adipex-P), phentermine plus topiramate (Qsymia), and orlistat (Xenical, Alli). On average, such drugs can help people lose 5% to 7% of their body weight when paired with a healthy diet and exercise.
        Now a newer class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes has gained attention because of their impressive weight-loss results — in many cases, 10% to 20% of a person's body weight. They're called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists.
        Tale of two drugs
        Two of these GLP-1 receptor agonists are FDA-approved in formulations specifically designed for weight loss in people without diabetes: liraglutide (Saxenda) and semaglutide (Wegovy).
        Lower-dose versions of these same active ingredients, known respectively as Victoza and Ozempic, have been used for years to help people with diabetes control their blood sugar levels.
        ""They can lead to substantial weight loss when used in conjunction with healthy lifestyle changes in people who are overweight or have obesity with or without type 2 diabetes,"" says Dr. A. Enrique Caballero, an endocrinologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""But whether they can be safely used for all people who simply want to lose an extra 10 to 20 pounds is questionable.""
        
          
            
              
                New drugs on the horizon
                Other GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight loss may soon be available. A recent trial, funded by Eli Lilly, the company that makes tirzepatide (Mounjaro), found that around half of participants with both obesity and type 2 diabetes lost around 15% of their body weight on the medication. Also, initial research suggests that retatrutide, a triple hormone receptor agonist (acting on receptors for GLP-1, GIP, and CGCR), may lead to weight loss of up to 25% in people with diabetes. The FDA approved tirzepatide for treating type 2 diabetes in May 2022 and is now reviewing whether to approve it to treat obesity.
              
            
          
        
        How the new drugs work
        GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic the GLP-1 hormone that is naturally released in the gastrointestinal tract in response to eating.
        ""The drugs prompt the body to produce more insulin after eating, limiting the elevation of blood sugar levels after meals, something particularly crucial for people with type 2 diabetes,"" says Dr. Caballero. The drugs also regulate appetite by sending signals to the brain to tell the body it is full, which inhibits overeating.
        It is important to remember that these medications are only approved for people who meet certain criteria. Wegovy and Saxenda are for adults diagnosed with obesity — a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher — or those with a BMI of 27 plus at least one weight-related condition, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or type 2 diabetes. The other versions of these drugs—Victoza and Ozempic — are for people with type 2 diabetes.
        Still, that has not stopped some doctors from prescribing these medications ""off-label"" for weight loss, which means they are used for a different purpose than explicitly intended. ""But there isn't enough evidence to know whether these drugs might be beneficial or dangerous for people who fall outside of the FDA criteria,"" says Dr. Caballero.
        However, the larger issue is that many people see the new drugs as a quick-fix solution. ""It is paramount to remember that all weight-loss medications are recommended as an aid in the overall strategy that centers around a healthy meal plan and regular physical activity,"" says Dr. Caballero. ""In fact, people who stop taking these drugs will often regain the weight unless they have truly established a consistent and effective change in their eating and physical activity habits.""
        Know the downsides
        When discussing with your doctor whether GLP-1 receptor agonists are worth exploring, it's important to understand their potential downsides. You might develop various gastrointestinal side effects, including gas, bloating, indigestion, nausea, or irregular bowel movements.
        But these issues usually resolve within a few weeks, according to Dr. Caballero. ""The lowest doses of these medications are usually given at first and then gradually increased so people have less chance of developing side effects,"" he says.
        Another downside is the cost. The drugs are expensive — about $1,000 to $1,500 per month. Even if you qualify for their use, the drugs are not covered by Medicare for obesity, although Victoza and Ozempic are covered by Medicare and most private insurers to treat type 2 diabetes. Finally, be aware that the drugs are given via injection into the arm, stomach, or thigh using a pen-like device with a tiny needle the width of two human hairs. (Semaglutide is given weekly, while liraglutide injections are done daily.) Semaglutide prescribed for diabetes is now also available as a daily pill called Rybelsus. You have to wait 30 minutes to an hour after taking it before you can eat or drink.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/check-out-your-skin,Check out your skin,"You probably look at your face in the bathroom mirror a couple times each day. But do you ever take a close-up look at your entire skin? Devoting time to regular full-body check-ups can help you identify abnormalities that may signal skin cancer.
        ""Many skin spots and growths are related to normal aging and are not cause for concern,"" says Dr. Abigail H. Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""But you should note and monitor anything new or unusual.""
        Do a self-check
        Dr. Waldman recommends doing a head-to-toe self-exam every three to six months. Use a full-length mirror, plus a handheld mirror for hard-to-see spots, and a magnifying glass to examine smaller areas. ""If possible, have someone assist you so you don't miss anything,"" says Dr. Waldman. Here's how to do it.
        
          Look at your face, neck, ears (especially behind them), and scalp. Use a comb or a blow dryer to move your hair so that you can see better.
          Look at the front and back of your body in the mirror. Then, raise your arms and look at your left and right sides.
          Bend your elbows. Look carefully at your fingernails, palm and back of each hand, forearms (including the undersides), and upper arms.
          Check the back, front, and sides of your legs. Also, check the skin all over your buttocks and genital area.
          Sit and examine your feet, including the soles of your feet, the spaces between your toes, and your toenails.
        
        Note any new or questionable moles, sores, painful or itchy spots, raised or firm bumps, dark flaky patches, and black or brown lines along fingernails and toenails. Make sure to feel any suspicious areas for firmness, too. ""We often feel something troubling before we see it,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        Write down the date of your self-exams and record what you find, including the exact locations. Take photos with your phone to share with your doctor or dermatologist. ""After six to eight weeks, look at the trouble spots again, and get them checked out if they have not improved, or have changed color or size, have become painful, or easily bleed,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        
          
            
              
                Cosmetic changes
                Father Time brings us wrinkles, lines, bags under the eyes, age spots, raised rough lesions, and sagging skin. Many cosmetic treatments can treat these issues, such as botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, chemical peels, freezing liquid nitrogen sprays, laser treatments, prescription creams, and plastic surgery. Speak with your dermatologist about available options.
              
            
          
        
        Looking for skin cancer
        Melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer, and the earlier you can catch it, the better the outcome. The first sign of melanoma is usually a change in an existing mole. However, it also may appear as a new mole. Melanoma often appears on sun exposed areas, however, it also can occur in areas protected by the sun like nails. To recognize possible melanoma, follow the ABCDE guide:
        Asymmetry: the shape of one half doesn't match the other half
        Border: ragged or blurred edges
        Color: red, brown, blue, black, or white, and the shades may be uneven
        Diameter: about a quarter of an inch or larger, although some can be smaller
        Evolution: any changes in size, shape, or color.
        Here are some other skin issues to look out for during your self-exam:
        Freckles. Monitor large, irregular ones. If they grow or change appearance, this can be a prelude to a specific form of melanoma called lentigo maligna melanoma. Problem freckles often appear on the face, upper shoulders, chest, and arms.
        Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). ""Both are types of skin cancer, but they are slow-growing, usually not life-threatening, and easy to treat if caught early,"" says Dr. Waldman. BCC may look like a bleeding pimple, an open sore, a red patch, a shiny pink growth, or a scar. SCC resembles a crusted, scaly red bump, patch, or wart. Both cancers appear in areas frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face, rim of the ear, lower lip, balding scalp, neck, hands, arms, shoulders, back, and legs.
        Actinic keratoses (AKs). These growths are rough, gritty, and sometimes painful. They can be flat or slightly raised and appear in different colors, such as red, tan, pink, skin-colored, brown, or silver. AKs often appear on the face, tips of the ears, bald spots, and backs of the arms and hands. ""While AKs are not initially dangerous, get them looked at, as they may lead to squamous cell carcinoma if left alone,"" says Dr. Waldman.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/staying-regular,Staying regular,"Maybe you notice your spouse visits the bathroom every morning after a cup of coffee and marvel at his regularity. Perhaps you don't share that level of frequency — and wonder if you should.
        But what does ""staying regular"" really mean? The answer is different for every person, reflecting such factors as age, diet, physical activity, daily routine, and hydration levels, says Dr. Lawrence Borges, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Mt. Auburn Hospital.
        For some people, being regular means having a bowel movement once or twice a day. But it could also mean once or twice a week — or anything in between. ""Normal"" is whatever's normal for you. But many people still fret if they don't have frequent bowel movements, he says.
        ""People have in their minds that one perfect poop a day is the goal, but the reality is everyone's pattern may be different from that,"" Dr. Borges says. ""I try to stress that there's no single right answer, no perfect or correct pattern.""
        When routines change
        Stress alone is one negative offshoot of irregular bowel habits. Another is disrupted sleep, since people may awaken in discomfort or need to use the bathroom at odd hours. ""But being irregular, on its own, is common and not necessarily a sign of something wrong,"" Dr. Borges says.
        While how often you have a bowel movement doesn't matter, what does matter is that the pattern remains relatively consistent and you feel comfortable. With healthy bowel movements, you'll also feel you're completely emptying the rectum, not bloated or in pain, and don't have to strain hard to get the job done.
        Spotting a problem starts with noticing a dramatic change in what's normal for you. If you typically have one bowel movement a day and suddenly you're having them only once a week, for example — and you can't explain this change — you should see your doctor. That visit is even more pressing if you're also having other symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, unintended weight loss, blood in your stool, or a change in stool consistency. ""These are alarming changes that should prompt an evaluation,"" Dr. Borges says.
        Digestion direction
        Many people who ask Dr. Borges about being regular really want to know how to avoid constipation. Again, there's no single answer, with a menu of options to help keep digestion humming.
        In addition to mainstay advice such eating whole grains and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, exercising regularly (which keeps your colon moving, too), and drinking plenty of water, Dr. Borges offers this guidance.
        Maintain a toileting schedule. Try visiting the bathroom at the same time every day, such as in the morning after breakfast. This can help train your body to go at the same time in a place you're comfortable. ""If you're racing out the door for work and not leaving time to take advantage of that readiness, that's not helpful — you may not be able to take advantage of it later in the day,"" he says.
        Heed your body's signals. Along those lines, when you feel the urge to have a bowel movement, don't put it off until later. ""The opposite is also true: just because you haven't gone doesn't mean you should try to force it,"" he says. ""If your body's not ready, you may not be able to go because no stool is ready to be expelled.""
        Try a toilet stool. Toilet footstools have emerged as a quietly popular bathroom accessory, with devotees saying it helps them have more comfortable, effective bowel movements. ""The purpose is to change the angle and orientation of the rectum to make it more of a straight path to expel stool,"" he says. ""Some people find when they raise their feet six inches, they do have an easier time.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/debunking-common-wellness-myths,Debunking common wellness myths,"Some tried-and-true wellness guidance we can spot a mile away: get enough sleep, move your body regularly, and eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, for starters. But social media now pummels us with so-called health advice at such a rapid pace it can be difficult to know what to heed — and what to ignore.
        Much of it is of dubious value. But the reason this counsel is confusing is that many wellness myths contain a grain of truth, says Dr. Leonor Fernandez, a primary care doctor at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        ""There's some good information out there,"" she says, ""but the general problem with the Internet is that it's sometimes hard to distinguish what's reliable from what's being spread for commercial, political, or other purposes.""
        People can also be vulnerable to questionable advice because they're hungry for a quick fix, even when that's rarely possible.
        ""We're often looking for a one-pill type of solution, that one thing we can do to take care of a problem or simplify our lives to feel effective,"" Dr. Fernandez says. ""But for most things in health, the solution lies in the balance between what you do and what you eat rather than one specific thing.""
        Fiction vs. fact
        Dr. Fernandez dissects three common wellness myths and offers time-tested ways to improve your well-being.
        1. Myth: Thin is synonymous with healthy.
        TRUTH: It's not that simple. ""There's certainly not just one healthy body type, and I've seen many people with a low body weight who aren't healthy,"" Dr. Fernandez says.
        Indeed, carrying extra weight is associated with higher risks of many health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and some forms of cancer, ""so it's not realistic to say that our weight has no impact on our health,"" she says. ""But it's a distortion to think that body mass index alone gives us a good indicator of our current health.""
        What you can do: Stay physically and mentally active, regardless of your size. ""What matters most, perhaps, is how much we move and how connected and engaged we are,"" she says. ""Being sedentary is definitely a negative for our health, and being heavier is sometimes associated with being sedentary.""
        2. Myth: Detoxes and cleanses make you healthier.
        TRUTH: Your body doesn't need them, and they may do more harm than good. Maybe your sister swears that detoxes or cleanses help her feel and look better by removing toxins and jump-starting weight loss. But these tactics won't help you and may harm you, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH).
        These approaches often involve short-term diets and periods of fasting, and they may call for teas or juices, nutritional shakes, or specific supplements or herbs. Detoxes, in particular, are marketed on the premise that they help the liver ""reset"" and work more efficiently to remove toxins we're exposed to in food and the environment.
        But these products haven't been proven to offer any health benefits and can be dangerous for older adults, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and some people with underlying health conditions, according to the NCCIH. They can lead to an excessive intake of vitamins and minerals; kidney problems from drinking juices of high-oxalate foods, such as spinach and beets; and bacterial infections from unpasteurized products.
        Moreover, we naturally get rid of toxins through our breath, sweat, urine, and feces.
        What you can do: ""My advice isn't that thrilling: eating a balanced, highly plant-based diet with fewer processed foods is better for you than any particular cleanse or detox,"" Dr. Fernandez says.
        3. Myth: Eating before bedtime leads to weight gain.
        TRUTH: Timing doesn't count as much as what's on your plate. Popular wisdom posits that our metabolism slows at night, automatically converting any evening snacks into fat. But chips or ice cream somehow tend to trump an apple while we're watching TV. It's no wonder we feel sluggish and doughy in the morning.
        ""There may be some truth that our metabolism and insulin secretion change at night because we're sleeping,"" Dr. Fernandez says. ""But I suspect what you eat, and whether your eating is mindful, matter more.""
        What you can do: Incorporate more protein, fiber, and complex carbohydrates into dinner choices to keep you feeling full through the evening. If you still feel compelled to snack, keep healthy options available when the urge arises, such as Greek yogurt and berries or carrots dipped in hummus.

          My fingernails are sprinkled with tiny white spots. Why do these form?
        
        A. These nail spots are a common occurrence — and usually don't signal a serious problem — but it may take some sleuthing to figure out why you've developed them. The most likely cause of white spots on the nails is minor trauma of some sort, whether from a rough manicure involving filing and cuticle cutting or excessive tapping of the hands and fingers on a hard surface.
        Sometimes, dry, white areas on the nails form when you leave nail polish on for too long — weeks or longer — which doesn't allow the nail to shed cells normally. A fungal infection could also be the culprit, depositing a white film that may cover a few areas or even all of the nail. Certain more serious conditions can also cause half or more of the nail to appear white. These include low iron levels, kidney disease, or scarring of the liver (cirrhosis).
        If hand trauma or wearing nail polish for prolonged periods don't seem likely causes of your nail spots, ask your doctor for her assessment. Letting the spots disappear on their own could be a lengthy process, since it can take six or more months for fingernails to grow out.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/uk-study-confirms-mediterranean-lifestyle-benefits,UK study confirms Mediterranean lifestyle benefits,"Living a Mediterranean lifestyle — eating a particular diet and getting enough sleep and physical and social activity — has been linked over and over to reduced risks for chronic disease and early death. But most studies have involved people in Mediterranean countries, such as Spain. Now an observational study published online Aug. 8, 2023, by Mayo Clinic Proceedings suggests what experts have long suspected: the lifestyle has benefits for people living in other parts of the world, too. Researchers, including some from Harvard, analyzed diet assessments and self-reported lifestyle habits of about 111,000 people (ages 40 to 75) in England, Wales, and Scotland. Participants were followed for up to nine years. People who adhered most closely to a Mediterranean lifestyle had a 28% lower risk of dying from cancer and a 29% lower risk of dying prematurely from any cause, compared with people whose lifestyles were most different from the Mediterranean pattern. The authors say the findings indicate that people outside Mediterranean countries can use their own locally available products to follow a Mediterranean-style eating pattern, which emphasizes olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains; moderate amounts of fish, poultry, cheese, and wine; and limited portions of red or processed meats.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/does-poor-sleep-diminish-the-cognitive-benefits-of-exercise,Does poor sleep diminish the cognitive benefits of exercise?,"Getting at least 150 minutes of exercise each week (such as brisk walking) is crucial to keeping your memory and thinking skills sharp. Exercise promotes the birth of new brain cells and increases the production of enzymes that break down amyloid proteins associated with dementia. Sleep also plays a role in cognitive health, flushing those amyloid proteins out of the brain. The right amount of sleep is so important that a lack of Z's may sabotage the cognitive perks of exercise, according to a study published July 2023 in The Lancet Healthy Longevity. Researchers evaluated the periodic memory test results and self-reported sleep and exercise habits of almost 9,000 dementia-free people (ages 50 and older) who were followed over 10 years. Among people who started the study at age 50 or 60 and reported the highest rates of exercise, those who said they got less than six hours of sleep per night had faster rates of cognitive decline than those who said they got six to eight hours of sleep per night. For people who started the study at age 70 and reported high rates of exercise, the amount of sleep they got didn't seem to affect their rate of cognitive decline. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that poor sleep quashes the brain benefits of exercise.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/unsticking-sticky-thoughts,"""Unsticking"" sticky thoughts","Some thoughts just won't leave us alone — they play over and over again, like a song you can't get out of your head. While a recurring melody can be annoying, it probably won't pose any problems, especially if you can think of other things. A sticky thought is different. ""It causes distress. You can't divert your attention away from it, and it interferes with your day,"" says Dr. Stephanie Collier, a psychiatrist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        Causes and examples
        It's normal for people to have sticky thoughts occasionally. If it happens a lot, it could be due to stress or an underlying condition, such as the following.
        Generalized anxiety disorder. People with generalized anxiety disorder, a condition marked by excessive worry, can have sticky thoughts about many things, such as an upcoming event, finances, or a future bus or plane ride.
        Depression. When you're depressed, which involves having feelings of extreme sadness or hopelessness, you tend to feel bad about yourself. You might have sticky thoughts that you've failed at something or that no one likes or cares about you.
        Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is characterized by obsessions (intrusive, disturbing thoughts) or compulsions (feelings of pressure to carry out repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing). A classic OCD sticky thought is about germs, and whether you touched something contaminated and need to wash your hands.
        Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a cluster of symptoms that can occur after witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event, such as violence or loss of life. One PTSD symptom is a sticky thought that replays the traumatic scene.
        Sticky thoughts can hurt us
        Sticky thoughts can have many negative effects. They make it hard to concentrate, they can promote shame and fear, and they can damage your self-esteem. ""After devoting so much time to them, you start to believe the thoughts,"" Collier says.
        In time, sticky thoughts can lead to social isolation. ""Some people don't want to leave home anymore,"" Collier says. ""They might feel convinced no one likes them. Or they might not want to be exposed to something they fear, such as germs.""
        Getting ""unstuck""
        When you try to push a sticky thought away, it seems to stick even more. That's because you wind up devoting additional attention to it. Instead, try one of the following tactics.
        Examine the evidence. How much of the thought is true? Write out the evidence for it and then write down anything that contradicts it. ""If your brain says you're a failure, think of ways you've succeeded. Maybe you're a really great cook, or a really dedicated parent,"" Collier says. ""Fight back.""
        Distract yourself. It's hard to focus on a sticky thought when you're in the middle of an activity. To break away from the thought, Collier suggests that you change the scenery and go for a walk, or jump into an activity that engages you.
        Schedule more activities. If you have too much free time in the day, your brain will have more time to focus on sticky thoughts. Stay busy.
        Limit your worry time. ""People often worry throughout the day because they don't want to forget things,"" Collier says. ""So choose a time, such as five o'clock, to worry about anything you want for 30 minutes. When a worry comes up before then, remind yourself that you'll get to it later in the day.""
        Talk to a family member or friend. Sharing your thoughts helps give you perspective and helps fight isolation and loneliness.
        Seek help
        It's hard to navigate sticky thoughts alone, especially if you have an underlying mental health condition and you're unaware of it. Don't carry the burden by yourself.
        If you've been experiencing sticky thoughts for a few weeks, talk to your primary care doctor or make an appointment with a therapist for an evaluation.
        Treatment might involve cognitive behavioral therapy. This is a general approach that helps you recognize sticky thoughts and redirect them in ways that are less negative and more manageable.
        Other therapies are tailored to specific conditions, such as an OCD therapy that gradually exposes you to things you fear, or a PTSD therapy that aims to change the way the memory of the traumatic experience is stored in the brain. You might also need medication to get sticky thoughts under control.
        ""With time and practice,"" Collier says, ""you can learn to live with and overcome sticky thoughts. Don't give up.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-a-healthy-gut-helps-your-heart,How a healthy gut helps your heart,"Your gut microbiome — a collection of trillions of microorganisms inhabiting your intestinal tract — has wide-ranging effects on your health. Your unique mix of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses reflects your genes, your age, the medications you take — but most of all, what you eat.
        Over the past two decades, numerous studies have explored how gut microbes and their breakdown products (metabolites) affect factors linked with heart disease. For the most part, the findings support the same basic advice health experts recommend: Follow a mostly plant-based eating pattern, and cut back on highly processed foods. Doing so can help promote a more diverse, healthier microbiome.
        ""The standard American diet — appropriately called SAD — features a lot of processed foods that are high in sugar, artificial sweeteners, and unhealthy fats,"" says Dr. Uma Naidoo, director of nutritional and metabolic psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. This nutrient-poor diet can lead to dysbiosis, an overgrowth of harmful microbes. When bad microbes thrive in the gut, they form pro-inflammatory breakdown products and toxins, Dr. Naidoo explains. The resulting low-grade, bodywide inflammation contributes to obesity, poor mental health, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.
        Animal vs. plant-based foods
        One metabolite of interest is trimethylamine (TMA), which is created when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). While some research suggests a link between TMAO and artery-clogging plaque, the evidence isn't consistent. Still, the advice to limit red meat consumption — the main source of TMA in the diet — makes sense.
        But according to Dr. Naidoo, there's no need to avoid those animal-based foods, which most Americans aren't especially keen on doing. Instead, people should focus more on what they're not eating — namely, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
        
          
            
              
                Fermented foods
                Eating fermented foods may help dampen inflammation in the body. When shopping, look for the words ""contains live cultures"" when choosing yogurt or kefir, a yogurtlike drink with a tart flavor and a thinner consistency than yogurt. While both products are usually made with dairy milk, they also come in nondairy versions made from almond, coconut, or oat milk. Another beverage, kombucha, is a fizzy, tart, slightly sweet drink made from fermented tea that's often flavored with fruits and herbs. Look for brands without added sugar.
                For fermented products made from vegetables, look in the refrigerated section and check for the words ""naturally fermented"" on the label. When you open the jar, check for telltale bubbles in the liquid, which signal that live organisms are inside. Most supermarket pickles are preserved with vinegar and not made with a natural fermentation process using water and salt. For sauerkraut (pickled cabbage), choose raw or nonpasteurized products. If you're a fan of spicy food, try kimchi, a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish from Korea made with a mix of garlic, salt, vinegar, and chili peppers. From Japan, there's miso (a strong, salty paste made from soybeans fermented with brown rice) and tempeh (a firm, chewy product made from fermented soybeans).
              
            
          
        
        Diversify your diet
        A woefully small percentage of adults — only about 10% — eats the recommended daily amount of fruit (one-and-a-half to two cups) or vegetables (two to three cups). Don't limit yourself to only a few favorites like apples or broccoli, says Dr. Naidoo. ""Eat a wide variety of different fruits and vegetables on a regular basis to bring biodiversity to your microbiome,"" she says.
        Despite a recent uptick, whole grains make up less than 16% of the average American's total grain intake. Whole grains such as oats, quinoa, spelt, and barley are healthier choices than most ""whole-wheat"" bread, which isn't always made with 100% whole grains. Other foods that promote gut health include beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds.
        Fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains are good sources fermentable or prebiotic fiber, which gets broken down by bacteria in your colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds then circulate through the bloodstream and interact with receptors on cells that quell inflammation. These fatty acids also appear to play a role in keeping blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels in check.
        You can also increase good gut bacteria levels by consuming probiotics, which are found in fermented foods (see box). ""Try adding a little bit of these foods to your meals and then grow from there,"" Dr. Naidoo suggests.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-you-an-everyday-exerciser-or-a-weekend-warrior,Are you an everyday exerciser or a weekend warrior?,"The standard advice about exercise is to do about 30 minutes a day, most days of the week. But in terms of heart-related benefits, does it matter if you rack up most of your exercise minutes over just one or two days instead of spreading them out over an entire week?
        Earlier research has suggested that both patterns are equally beneficial. But those findings relied on people to self-report their exercise, which can be unreliable. Now, a study of nearly 90,000 adults who used wristband monitors to record their physical activity has reached a similar conclusion.
        ""The findings add to the body of literature showing that it doesn't matter when you get your exercise, as long as you get the recommended amount each week,"" says Dr. I-Min Lee, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert on the role of physical activity in preventing disease.
        
          
        
        Volume matters more than pattern
        The study, published July 18, 2023, in JAMA, doesn't define the term ""weekend warrior"" in quite the same way as most people do, says Dr. Lee. ""Usually, weekend warriors are seen as people who don't exercise on weekdays but then take a long hike or play two hours of tennis on Saturday or Sunday,"" she says.
        Instead, researchers used participants' physical activity data, which were recorded over seven consecutive days, to categorize them into different groups. About two-thirds of them met the federal physical activity guidelines (see ""How much exercise?""). About 42% were deemed ""weekend warriors,"" meaning they met the guidelines but got half or more of their total physical activity — not just exercise — on just one or two days. Another 24% were ""regularly active,"" meeting the guidelines with activity spread out over the week. The remaining 34% didn't meet the guidelines.
        After roughly six years, the researchers found that participants who followed either activity pattern had a similarly lower risk of heart attack, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure compared with people in the inactive group. Historically, experts have encouraged people to be regularly active, mainly because anecdotal reports suggest that weekend warriors may be more prone to injuries. But this study didn't find any difference in injury rates between the two active groups. That's likely because of the definition used in the study: the ""warrior"" group wasn't necessarily doing the types of high-intensity activities or sports often associated with muscle sprains and related injuries, Dr. Lee says.
        
          
            
              
                Best time of day to exercise? Whatever works for you
                Are there any pros or cons associated with exercising at certain times of the day? Research results are all over the map, says Harvard Medical School professor Dr. I-Min Lee. The best strategy is to exercise when it's most convenient and comfortable for you, whether that's the first thing in the morning, early evening, or anytime in between.
                If you exercise early in the day, you can check it off your to-do list and can take advantage of the ""feel-good"" brain chemicals, serotonin and dopamine, that are released during exercise. But afternoon workouts also have some benefits. Your joints and muscles may be more limber later in the day, which may make exercise feel less taxing. If you experience a midafternoon lull, exercise can be a good way to reinvigorate yourself. If you can, find a buddy who likes to exercise at the same time, so you can go together and hold each other accountable.
                Likewise, there's little evidence to suggest that coordinating your exercise with respect to mealtimes has any good or bad effects. Some people find that vigorous exercise right before a meal curbs their appetite, while others find the opposite is true. A pre-breakfast workout works well for certain people. But having a small, carbohydrate-rich snack (like a banana or a slice of whole-grain toast) at least half an hour before exercising may provide a helpful energy boost, says Dr. Lee.
              
            
          
        
        Short bouts of activity count
        Wristband devices enable researchers to capture all the short bouts of activity people do throughout the day that they may not remember. ""If you do jumping jacks occasionally while watching television, you won't necessarily recall that activity the way you remember that you play tennis three times a week,"" says Dr. Lee. Similarly, people whose daily commutes include a few 10-minute bouts of walking may not consider that as counting toward their moderate-intensity activity minutes. But these small spurts of activity — sometimes referred to as exercise ""snacks"" — seem to be beneficial. If you're sitting for a long stretch, stand up and move around for a few minutes every hour. Activating your muscles even just briefly can help improve your body's ability to keep your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol in check.
        It's also worth noting that if you don't meet the physical activity guidelines, you'll still benefit from doing even small amounts of exercise — and every minute counts.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/saturated-fat-how-much-is-okay,Saturated fat: How much is okay?,"Q.
          I was very interested in the May 2023 
          Heart Letter feature about Dr. Ludwig's research, which suggests that eating fewer carbohydrates and more protein and fat can help with weight loss and lead to better health outcomes. But his menus and recipes include foods that contain saturated fat, such as meat and full-fat dairy products. For many years, we heard from reputable sources that we should aways limit saturated fat. This is very confusing! Can you explain?
        
        A. You're right about advice to limit saturated fat in your diet, which stems from the fact that eating too much saturated fat tends to raise levels of harmful LDL cholesterol. But not everyone agrees on what the limit should be. The American Heart Association advises a limit of 5% to 6% of your daily calories, while the Dietary Guidelines for Americans says 10% is fine. Registered dietitian Kathy McManus, who directs the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, suggests a happy medium of 7%. That happens to be the typical amount of saturated fat in the heart-friendly Mediterranean-style diet.
        She analyzed the nutrient composition of the sample menu in the feature you referenced (""Cut calories or carbohydrates for better heart health?"" in the May 2023 Heart Letter). The three meals and snack include about 1,900 calories, which is just below the 2,000 daily calories recommended for the average woman. About 12% of the calories in Dr. Ludwig's sample menu are from saturated fat, which isn't too much higher than the Dietary Guidelines limit of 10%. Also, a 1.3-ounce piece of dark chocolate contains about eight grams of saturated fat, which is close to one-third of the 25 total grams of saturated fat in this menu. If you omitted the chocolate, the saturated fat in this sample menu would be around 8% of the total calories.
        But here's the thing: Most people don't want to spend time calculating their calories or saturated fat, which is why McManus and many other nutrition experts recommend focusing more on eating mostly whole or minimally processed foods, which is also one of Dr. Ludwig's main messages. As she notes, his menu doesn't include refined, processed carbohydrates like white rice, white bread, sugary drinks, or other sweets. Muffins, cookies, pie, and other baked goods often contain quite a bit of saturated fat because they're made with butter, lard, vegetable shortening, or tropical oils such as palm or palm kernel oil.
        Finally, although dark chocolate has saturated fat, it also contains heart-protecting plant compounds known as flavanols, which appear to outweigh the risk from saturated fat, according to nutrition experts at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-sleep-do-you-actually-need-202310302986,How much sleep do you actually need?,"On average, how many hours do you sleep each night? For most healthy adults, guidelines suggest at least seven hours of slumber.
        But these are general recommendations and not strict rules. ""Some people need less than seven hours, while others might need more,"" says Eric Zhou with the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        Do you need more or less sleep time?
        We get it: you know people who swear they only need five hours of sleep per night, yet you feel foggy unless you log in eight to nine hours. The major reason for individual differences is that we often look at sleep the wrong way.
        ""Instead of focusing exclusively on the number of hours we sleep per night, we should also consider our sleep quality,"" says Zhou.
        Sleep quality means how well you sleep during the night. Did you sleep straight through? Or did you have periods where you woke up? If so, did it take you a long time to fall asleep? How did you feel when you woke up?
        ""If you awaken refreshed and feel like you have the energy to get through your day, then I would worry less about the exact number of hours you're sleeping,"" says Zhou.
        How does sleep quality affect your health?
        Sleep quality is vital for our overall health. Research has shown that people with poor sleep quality are at a higher risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and mental health issues like anxiety and depression.
        And that's not all. ""Poor sleep also can increase daytime fatigue and make it more difficult to enjoy life,"" says Zhou.
        Yet it's normal for people's sleep patterns to change over time. ""Many people are not going to sleep in their 50s and 60s exactly like they did in their 20s,"" says Zhou.
        Many of these changes are age-related. For instance, your circadian rhythm — which regulates many bodily functions, including our sleep-wake cycle — can naturally get disrupted over time. This means people spend less time each night in restorative slow-wave sleep.
        Production of melatonin, the sleep hormone, also gradually declines with age. ""As a result of these changes, when we get older we may start to wake up earlier than we did when we were younger, or wake up more frequently during the night,"" says Zhou.
        How can you track sleep quality?
        How can you better understand the factors likely contributing to your sleep quality? One way is to keep a sleep diary where you track and record your sleep.
        Every day, record the time you went to bed, how long it took you to fall asleep, whether you had any nighttime awakenings (and if so, how long you were awake), and at what time you woke up. Also, keep track of how you feel upon awakening and at the end of the day.
        ""After a week or two, review the information to see if you can identify certain patterns that may be affecting your sleep quality, then make adjustments,"" says Zhou.
        For example, if you have trouble falling asleep, go to bed half an hour later than usual but maintain the same wake-up time. ""It is common for people struggling with their sleep to try to get more sleep by staying in bed longer, but this disrupts their sleep patterns and diminishes their sleep quality,"" says Zhou.
        Three key strategies to support the quality of your sleep
        Other strategies that can help support good sleep quality include:
        
          maintaining a consistent wake time, especially on weekends
          limiting daytime naps to 20 to 30 minutes, and at least six hours before the desired bedtime
          being physically active.
        
        When it comes to sleep quality, consistency is vital. ""People with good sleep quality often have a predictable sleep window where their sleep occurs,"" says Zhou. ""Good sleepers are likely to sleep around the same number of hours and stay asleep through the night.""
        The bottom line on getting restful sleep
        It's unrealistic to expect perfect sleep every night. ""If you have trouble sleeping one or two nights during the week, that can be related to the natural ebbs and flows of life,"" says Zhou. ""You may have eaten a big meal that day, drank too much alcohol while watching football, or had a stressful argument with someone. When tracking sleep quality, look at your overall sleep health week-to-week, not how you slept this Tuesday compared to last Tuesday.""
        If you are doing all the right things for your sleep but still do not feel rested upon waking, talk to your doctor. This can help you rule out a sleep disorder like sleep apnea, or another health issue that can interfere with sleep such as acid reflux or high blood pressure. Other factors that can affect the quality of your sleep include taking multiple medicines, depression, anxiety, loneliness, and environmental changes like temperature, noise, and light exposure.",Matthew Solan,"October 30, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-body-fat-percentage-determine-whether-you-are-overweight,Can body fat percentage determine whether you are overweight?,"On call
        
          Q.
          My fitness club recently measured my body fat at 14%. What are the normal ranges for older men, and is body fat percentage a good way to determine a healthy weight?
        
        A. A 14% body fat is considered excellent for a healthy male, but it may not indicate a ""healthy"" weight. Body fat percentage, just like weight, depends on multiple factors that can vary per person, such as overall health, metabolism (how your body burns excess calories for energy or stores them as fat), amount of activity, and musculature.
        Also, where you store body fat has a significant impact on health risks. Even if your weight is close to the normal range, a large waist size may mean you have an unhealthy amount of belly fat (visceral fat). Larger amounts of belly fat increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Therefore, it's possible that you could have a good overall body fat percentage yet still be at higher risk if the fat is concentrated at your waistline.
        Rather than just relying on one measurement like body fat percentage or body mass index (a calculation based on both weight and height) to determine if you are overweight, I suggest using two measurements: waist size and ratio of waist size to hip size.
        
          
            Waist size. Wrap a measuring tape just above your navel to find your waist size. Ideally men should strive for 35 inches or less.
          
          
            Ratio of waist size to hip size. Measure your hips around the widest part of your buttocks. Then divide your waist size by your hip size. The ideal waist-to-hip ratio for men is 0.9. If your number is higher, you may have too much belly fat.

        Many studies suggest that having strong social networks (friends who support or help you) or taking part in social activities is associated with a reduced risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia.
        For example, a study of more 66,000 people in Europe and Israel (average age 70), published online Oct. 25, 2021, by Ageing & Society, found that people with the highest levels of social connectedness (good friends) and engagement (activities) had the highest scores on cognition tests, compared with people who had the lowest levels of social connectedness and engagement.
        And an earlier study of 1,100 adults (average age about 80) followed for five years found that the people who were the most socially active had 70% less cognitive decline compared with those who had the lowest rates of social activities.
        These studies were observational and don't prove conclusively that socializing protects cognition, but we know that it engages the brain in ways that promote better cognition. ""Social activities cause us to use our brains more than almost any other activity,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a neurologist and chief of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology at VA Boston Healthcare System. ""All of our senses — vision, hearing, smell — are engaged during social activities. We process people's facial expression, body language, tone of voice, and speech content, and analyze what's being said and the emotions behind the words. In turn, that influences how we react: our facial expression, body language, tone of voice, speech, and actions. Putting the brain to work like that strengthens the connections between brain cells and creates new ones, too.""
        Other health benefits
        Beyond cognition, socialization also appears to help with the following aspects of health.
        Longevity. Being social protects us against loneliness and isolation, which are associated with chronic disease and premature death.
        Stress reduction. ""People are emotion regulators. When someone you trust listens to you, you can feel your body calm down. Your blood pressure returns to baseline, your levels of stress hormones decrease. It takes us out of 'fight or flight' mode, which can gradually break down the body if we're stressed all the time,"" says Dr. Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Mood. ""The way people react to you reminds you of aspects of yourself, aspects that you may forget. It gets you out of your own head and your worries, and reinforces your sense of being competent. That boosts your mood,"" Dr. Waldinger notes. ""And connecting with people you haven't spoken to in a long time can remind you that you have this history with these people, you belong to this group, and you matter. That also boosts mood.""
        Reach out to friends
        All of us tend to lose touch with old friends. People move; circumstances change. But it's worth the effort to have some social interaction in your life, even if it's not in person.
        How do you get the ball rolling? Dr. Waldinger suggests something low-key. ""Send a card, an email, a text, or a message on Facebook,"" he says. ""You just want to see if someone might reply.""
        What should you say in the initial contact, especially if it's been a long time? ""Just say you're thinking of the person and want to see how they're doing,"" Dr. Waldinger advises.
        Other icebreakers include saying you were thinking about how you used to do a particular activity together, or sharing a nice memory of something you both experienced, such as a graduation or a successful project. You might even include a one- or two-sentence update on how you're doing and what you've been up to lately.
        What happens next? ""See if the person reciprocates,"" Dr. Waldinger says. ""If so, build from there. Ask if the person would like to have coffee or take a walk with you sometime soon. If the person is far away, ask they're available for a catch-up phone call or video chat.""
        Keep up the connection
        It may take time to rebuild the closeness or the frequency of contact you once had with a friend, if that's what you both want. So be patient, and keep reaching out to the person.
        How much contact will it take to boost your cognition and health? ""We don't have an amount of social connection that is 'enough' or a lower amount that is 'not enough.' Studies suggest that more is better, and some is better than none for improving your thinking and memory,"" Dr. Budson says.
        So why not rekindle several friendships? If they bring you joy, and if they offer important, healthy side effects, then you have nothing to lose and much to gain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-bitter-truth-about-added-sugar,The bitter truth about added sugar,"Extra sugar can cause big health problems. Here's how you can reduce your intake.
        
        
          
        
        There's a good chance you eat way too much sugar every day — and don't even know it.
        American adults consume an average of 77 grams (almost 20 teaspoons) of sugar per day, which adds up to around 60 pounds of added sugar per year, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).
        Added sugar refers to sugars and syrups that are included in food products and beverages to increase sweetness and texture and extend shelf life. (This is different from natural sugar found in fruit, vegetables, and dairy.)
        A little extra sugar may seem harmless, but ingested often, it can contribute to a variety of health issues, like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. ""There's consistent evidence that all that excessive added sugar intake is a significant threat to one's health,"" says Dr. Qi Sun, an associate professor of nutrition at Harvard-affiliated T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        
          Where the sugar is
        
        Sugar-sweetened drinks are the largest source of added sugar in the American diet. They include any of the following:
        
          regular soda
          juice drinks, like fruit punch and juice cocktails
          energy drinks
          sports drinks
          sweet tea
          sweetened coffee drinks
        
        Whole (100%) juices, which contain only the sugars from the extracted fruit or vegetable are healthier, but you don't get the benefits of fiber and other natural ingredients as you do in whole fruit. Many food products also contain high amounts of added sugar, even if they are not always sweet-tasting. The most common are fruit-flavored yogurt, breakfast cereals, processed instant meals, soups, tomato sauces, snacks, and cured meats. Another source of added sugar is condiments, such as ketchup, relish, barbecue sauce, and salad dressings.
        
          
            
              
                
                  Look closer at food labels
                
                Added sugars are identified on a product's ingredient label. They often are called by names other than ""sugar."" Here are the ones you should look for, according to the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2015–2020:
              
            
            
              
                agave nectar
                brown sugar
                cane crystals
                cane sugar
                corn sweetener
                corn syrup
              
              
                crystalline fructose
                dextrose
                evaporated cane juice
                fructose
                fruit juice concentrates
                glucose
              
              
                honey
                invert sugar
                lactose
                malt sugar
                malt syrup
              
              
                maltose
                maple syrup
                molasses
                raw sugar
                sucrose
              
            
          
        
        
          Too much is too much
        
        Research has found that too much added sugar can affect your health in many ways.
        For instance, a study published online Sept. 3, 2019, by JAMA Internal Medicine looked at more than 450,000 people over a 16-year period and found that those who drank two or more 8-ounce glasses of sugar-sweetened soda a day had a higher risk of dying for any reason than people who drank less than a glass each month. Drinking large amounts of artificially sweetened sodas was also associated with earlier death.
        Consuming too much sugar also can increase chronic inflammation. And higher sugar consumption has also been linked to a higher risk of frailty as we age. A study in the May 2018 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that older adults who consumed more than 36 grams per day of added sugar were more likely to become frail compared with those who consumed less than 15 grams daily.
        One of the biggest threats from added sugar is weight gain. Your body doesn't know the difference between natural sugar and added sugar. They both get processed the same way. The important difference is how fast the body digests them. ""Foods with natural sugar — fruits and vegetables — also contain soluble fiber, which means your body digests the accompanying sugars more slowly,"" says Dr. Sun. In comparison, added sugar lacks fiber, so it's absorbed much faster. ""This can cause blood sugar levels to spike, leading to an insulin surge, which can increase hunger,"" says Dr. Sun.
        
          
            
              
                
                  Substitutes for sugar
                
                Another way to avoid added sugar is to switch it out for other sweeteners. Add whole or frozen fruit to cereal or oatmeal, tea, and yogurt. Also, try antioxidant-rich spices like ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
              
            
          
        
        
          Manage your intake
        
        The AHA suggests men consume no more than 36 grams (about 9 teaspoons) of added sugar per day. This is approximately equal to what's in a 12-ounce can of soda. The best ways to control your intake of added sugar are to read food labels and cut out sugar-sweetened beverages, suggests Dr. Sun.
        ""For labels, note the number of grams of sugar per serving and the total number of servings,"" he says. ""The label might say 5 grams of sugar per serving, but you might eat three or four servings, so you end up consuming a lot more added sugar."" A good rule is to choose products that have less than 10 grams per serving and to monitor how many servings you eat.
        Instead of buying sugar-sweetened beverages, make your own healthier versions. Begin with plain or sparkling water and then add slices of fresh fruit or an ounce or two of 100% fruit juice for flavor.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/are-certain-types-of-sugars-healthier-than-others-2019052916699,Are certain types of sugars healthier than others?,"Most people consume many different types of sugars from a variety of foods and beverages in their diet. A high intake of sugar is linked to an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. But whether some sugars are healthier (or worse) than others remains a question of interest to many.
        Sugar basics
        Sugar provides energy that our cells need to survive. Sugar is a type of carbohydrate, a macronutrient that provides energy (in the form of calories) from foods and beverages we consume. Carbohydrates are classified into two subtypes of sugar: monosaccharides, or ""simple sugars"" (consisting of one molecule),` and disaccharides (two molecules). The monosaccharides include glucose, fructose, and galactose. The major disaccharides include sucrose (one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule), lactose (one glucose molecule and one galactose molecule), and maltose (two glucose molecules).
        Fructose, glucose, and sucrose are found naturally in fruit and some vegetables, while lactose is found in dairy and maltose is found in germinating grains. Fructose and glucose are also found naturally in honey, as well as in common table sugar.
        Added versus natural sugars
        An increasingly important distinction among sugars as they pertain to health is whether they occur naturally in foods such as fruit, vegetables, and dairy, or whether they are added sugars (added to foods and beverages during manufacturing, processing, or preparation).
        Sugary beverages are the greatest source of added sugar in the diet, followed by sweets and grains such as ready-to-eat cereals. Intake of added sugar, particularly from beverages, has been associated with weight gain and higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
        Natural and added sugars are metabolized the same way in our bodies. But for most people, consuming natural sugars in foods such as fruit is not linked to negative health effects, since the amount of sugar tends to be modest and is ""packaged"" with fiber and other healthful nutrients. On the other hand, our bodies do not need, or benefit from, eating added sugar.
        Are all added sugars created equal?
        Added sugars come from a variety of sources and go by many different names, yet they are all a source of extra calories and are metabolized by the body the same way. A common misconception exists that some added sugars such as high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) are unhealthy, while others such as agave nectar (from the succulent plant) are healthy.
        The reality is that most added sugars are composed of glucose and fructose in varying ratios. For example, sucrose (common table sugar) is 50% glucose and 50% fructose; the most common form of HFCS (which is produced from corn starch through industrial processing) contains 45% glucose and 55% fructose; and some types of agave nectar contain up to 90% fructose and 10% glucose.
        Whether an added sugar contains more or less fructose versus glucose has little impact on health. Some types of added sugar — honey, for example — may also contain micronutrients or other bioactive compounds. But these properties have little benefit when it comes to metabolic health.
        In short, it's best to limit all sources of added sugar to within the recommended intake level. For most people, one type of sugar isn't better than another.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sleep-paralysis-causes-symptoms-and-treatments,"Sleep paralysis: Causes, symptoms, and treatments","For many people, sleep paralysis is a distressing condition affecting their sleep and emotional health. While there is still much to learn about sleep paralysis, understanding the source of sleep paralysis symptoms can help with treatment and prevention.
        What is sleep paralysis?
        Sleep paralysis is a temporary sense of paralysis that occurs between stages of wakefulness and sleep. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you are conscious but unable to move or speak.
        One of the primary differences between sleep paralysis and other sleep states such as dreaming and nightmares is that you are awake during an episode of sleep paralysis.
        Types of sleep paralysis
        There are two types of sleep paralysis:
        
          Isolated sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis is isolated when it appears without any other signs of narcolepsy or other sleep disorders. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder in which a person may frequently fall into sudden episodes of deep sleep at any time.
          Recurrent sleep paralysis. This condition involves multiple sleep paralysis episodes over time. Recurrent sleep paralysis can be associated with narcolepsy.
        
        In many cases, both types of sleep paralysis occur together. In this case, you may experience recurrent isolated sleep paralysis (RISP). RISP involves ongoing instances of sleep paralysis without an association with narcolepsy.
        When does sleep paralysis typically occur?
        Sleep paralysis usually occurs when
        
          falling asleep
          waking from sleep
          at both times.
        
        Sleep paralysis is considered a parasomnia, or an abnormal behavior that occurs during sleep. Because it is linked to the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of the sleep cycle, sleep paralysis is considered a REM parasomnia.
        During REM, the eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming occurs, but the muscles of the body are relaxed to reduce movement. This muscle relaxation is controlled by the brain and called REM atonia. The purpose of atonia is to keep you from acting out your dreams, and typically ends when you wake up.
        However, during sleep paralysis you wake up suddenly from REM, regaining awareness even as your muscles are still relaxed, in atonia. For this reason, sleep paralysis may feel like temporary paralysis. In addition to atonia, the mental imagery of REM sleep also seems to persist even as you are in an aware state.
        How long does sleep paralysis last?
        An episode of sleep paralysis can last from a few seconds to a few minutes. The episode usually ends on its own, or when someone moves or touches you or speaks to you. Making an intense effort to move can also end an episode.
        What does an episode of sleep paralysis feel like?
        An episode of sleep paralysis often involves hallucinations that can be frightening or cause anxiety. Hallucinations during sleep paralysis fall into three categories.
        
          Intruder hallucinations involve a sense of evil or a disturbing presence in the room, such as a bedroom intruder.
          Chest pressure hallucinations describe a sense of pressure on the chest, often accompanied by sensations of being choked or suffocated.
          Vestibular-motor (V-M) hallucinations can include feelings of movement, such as flying or out-of-body sensations.
        
        Can you die from sleep paralysis?
        Sleep paralysis can be frightening and can cause emotional distress for some people. However, it usually does not happen frequently enough to cause significant health effects, and is not a serious medical risk on its own.
        People who experience recurrent or frightening episodes may develop unhealthy sleep habits to avoid sleep, leading to sleep deprivation. This can have negative effects on a person's health.
        Symptoms of sleep paralysis
        Sleep paralysis may involve such symptoms as:
        
          inability to move the arms, legs, body, and head when falling asleep or waking up
          inability to speak
          full awareness of what is happening
          hallucinations.
        
        Episodes last from a few seconds to a few minutes, and may occur once in a person's life or repeatedly over their lifetime.
        What causes sleep paralysis?
        While the exact cause of sleep paralysis is not understood, research has linked certain sleep habits to the condition:
        
          inadequate sleep
          an irregular sleep schedule or a sleep schedule that often changes (this is often the case for shift workers)
          sleeping on your back.
        
        In addition, sleep paralysis has also been linked with
        
          sleep disorders such as narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a disorder that causes sudden episodes of deep sleep caused by a problem with the brain's ability to regulate sleep.
          some mental conditions, such as bipolar disorder, PTSD, or panic or anxiety disorders
          use of certain medicines, such as for ADHD
          substance use
          alcohol use.
        
        Many people report stressful events or an emotional experience preceding the episodes.
        In addition, research suggests there may be a genetic predisposition to this condition.
        How is sleep paralysis diagnosed?
        Sleep paralysis can affect men and women. It can be seen at any age, though it tends to first appear in the teen years. After appearing during the teenage years, episodes can occur more frequently in later years.
        If you experience episodes of sleep paralysis that make you feel anxious or if you have repeated episodes of sleep paralysis, speak with your doctor. It is possible that sleep paralysis may be due to another medical problem that needs further attention.
        To learn more about how sleep paralysis is affecting your health, your doctor may ask about your symptoms, sleep habits, and factors that affect your sleep. You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire about your sleep, or even complete a sleep diary to help identify sleeping patterns.
        Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may refer you to a sleep specialist for further diagnosis, testing, and treatment.
        Your doctor may have you do a sleep study called a polysomnography. In this procedure, small wafer-thin electrodes and other sensors are pasted on specific body sites to take a variety of readings during the night. The sensors will record muscle activity, movements, breathing, blood oxygen level, heart rate, and rhythm.
        Readings are collected on a single printout (called a polysomnogram) and analyzed by a technician and physician. If a breathing problem is detected early on, you may be awakened and given treatment, such as PAP, during the second half of the night. This allows the sleep experts to monitor how well the treatment works for you.
        Your doctor may also want you to take one or more daytime sleep tests as well. One test, called a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), measures how long it takes you to drift off while lying down in a quiet room. The procedure is usually repeated four or five times during the day at two-hour intervals. The test also determines what stages of sleep you experience during a brief nap.
        MSLT can help to show if your sleep paralysis is a sign of narcolepsy. Falling asleep within eight minutes each time indicates extreme sleepiness. A person who enters REM sleep very quickly (within about 20 minutes) during two or more naps may also have narcolepsy.
        How to prevent sleep paralysis
        If you experience occasional sleep paralysis, one of the best ways to prevent sleep paralysis episodes is to improve the quality of your sleep.
        Try any of these sleep hygiene techniques to help improve sleep quality and prevent sleep paralysis:
        
          Get adequate sleep. Try to get seven to nine hours of sleep per night on a regular basis.
          Keep a consistent sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at consistent times every day, including on weekends.
          Create an ideal sleep environment. Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet.
          Ensure your mattress and pillow suit your body's needs. Choose a pillow that keeps your neck and head naturally in alignment. Your mattress needs will depend on the level of firmness that feels best to your body. Memory foam mattresses boast the benefit of molding to your body's pressure points.
          Reduce distractions. Avoid using electronic devices before going to bed.
          Relax before bed by taking a bath, reading, or listening to soothing music.
          Try new sleeping positions if you sleep on your back. Sleep experts have found a correlation between sleeping on your back and sleep paralysis.
          Do what you can to ease stress in your life, especially just before bedtime.
          Curb substance use: avoid alcohol intake, especially in the evening, and steer clear of nicotine altogether.
          Reduce caffeine intake. If you can't or don't want to give up caffeine, avoid it after 2 p.m.
        
        If you are diagnosed with narcolepsy or another sleep disorder, a sleep doctor will work with you to find a treatment plan for your disorder.
        If you are diagnosed with a mental health condition such as anxiety or bipolar disorder, your doctor will oversee your ongoing treatment with medication and behavioral therapy to help treat your mental health condition. Treating your underlying mental health condition may help resolve sleep paralysis.
        Be sure to see your doctor if sleep paralysis routinely stops you from getting a good night's sleep.
        Stopping sleep paralysis in the moment
        Currently, there is no direct treatment strategy to treat sleep paralysis during an episode.",Jenette Restivo,"October 20, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/eat-these-fruits-for-their-anti-inflammatory-benefits,Eat these fruits for their anti-inflammatory benefits,"They're nature's original desserts. And naturally sweet fruits are essential in protecting our bodies from disease.
        Eating at least one-and-a-half to two cups of diverse fruits every day can boost antioxidant activity. Fruits are particularly abundant in anti-inflammatory compounds, which are important in protecting our bodies from heart disease, diabetes, and certain forms of cancer and bowel disease.
        How to get enough healthful fruits in your diet? One strategy is to eat with the seasons, choosing grapes and stone fruits in the summer, apples and pears in the fall, persimmons and pomegranates in the winter, and citrus and cherries in the spring.
        While all fruits tend to be rich in disease-protective nutrients, some have received particular attention in the nutrition world for their anti-inflammatory benefits.
        Berries. From strawberries and blackberries to cranberries and blue­berries, these gemlike fruits are particularly potent in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Along with fiber and vitamin C, berries possess plant pigment phytochemicals, such as anthocyanins and ellagic acid, which may be behind their health benefits. Studies have linked increased berry consumption with lower risks of heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes.
        Apples. Maybe it's true what they say about an apple a day. A study of nearly 35,000 women, found that consumption of this fruit — along with its relative, pears — was linked with a lower risk of death from heart disease. The star components of apples — fiber, vitamin C, pectin, and polyphenols — have been associated, primarily in animal studies, with anti-inflammatory effects and an increase in beneficial microbes in the gut.
        Stone fruits. Cherries, peaches, apricots, and plums are all examples of stone fruits. These fruits contain fiber, vitamin C, potassium, and a variety of phytochemicals associated with their colors. For example, cherries have garnered the lion's share of the research among stone fruits. Some studies suggest that cherries can reduce pain and soreness after exercise as well as a reduced risk of gout attacks. The high levels of phenolic compounds in cherries, which have been linked to reduced inflammation, may be behind those benefits.
        Citrus. Oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes are famously rich in vitamin C. They also contain fiber, potassium, calcium, B vitamins, copper, and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals such as flavonoids and carotenoids. Though there is little human research on citrus, the nutrients found in citrus fruits have been associated with heart-protective effects.
        Pomegranates. Those tiny pomegranate seeds contain big rewards of vitamins C and K, potassium, fiber, and potent phytochemicals such as anthocyanin and resveratrol. These nutrients may be behind the potential benefits of eating pomegranates.
        Grapes. These succulent fruits are burst­ing with fiber, vitamins C and K, and powerful phytochemicals.

Over 80% of people with prediabetes (that is, high blood sugar with the high risk for developing full-blown diabetes) don't know it.

Research suggests that a healthy lifestyle can prevent diabetes from occurring in the first place — and even reverse its progress.
        Can a healthy diet and lifestyle prevent diabetes?
        The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a large, long-term study, asked the question: we know an unhealthy diet and lifestyle can cause type 2 diabetes, but can adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle prevent it? This answer is yes: the vast majority of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be prevented through diet and lifestyle changes, and this has been proven by 20 years of medical research.
        Researchers from the DPP took people at risk for type 2 diabetes and gave them a 24-week diet and lifestyle intervention, a medication (metformin), or a placebo (a fake pill), to see if anything could lower their risk for developing diabetes. The very comprehensive diet and lifestyle intervention had the goal of changing participants' daily habits, and included: 16 classes teaching basic nutrition and behavioral strategies for weight loss and physical activity; lifestyle coaches with frequent contact with participants; supervised physical activity sessions; and good clinical support for reinforcing an individualized plan.
        Perhaps not surprisingly, the diet and lifestyle intervention was incredibly effective. After three years, the diet and lifestyle group had a 58% lower risk of developing diabetes than the placebo group. Participants ages 60 and older had an even better response, with a whopping 71% lower risk of developing diabetes. The diet and lifestyle effect lasted: even after 10 years, those folks had a 34% lower risk of developing diabetes compared to placebo.
        Men, women, and all racial and ethnic groups had similar results (and almost half of participants represented racial and ethnic minorities). These results are not surprising to me or to other doctors, because we have all seen patients with prediabetes or diabetes get their sugars down with diet, exercise, and weight loss alone.
        Meanwhile, the medication group had a 31% lower risk of diabetes after three years, and an 18% lower risk after 10 years, which is also significant. It's perfectly all right to use medications along with diet and lifestyle changes, because each boosts the effect of the other. Studies looking at the combination of medication (metformin) with diet and lifestyle changes have shown an even stronger result.
        Dietary recommendations to prevent diabetes (and even reverse it)
        
          Decrease intake of added sugars and processed foods, including refined grains like white flour and white rice. This especially includes sugary drinks, not only sodas but also juices. The best drinks are water, seltzer, and tea or coffee without sugar.
          Swap out refined grains for whole grains. Whole grains are actually real grains that haven't been stripped of nutrients in processing. Foods made from 100% whole grain (like whole wheat) are okay, but intact whole grains (like farro, quinoa, corn, oatmeal, and brown rice) are even better.
          Increase fiber intake. High-fiber foods include most vegetables and fruits. Legumes are also high in fiber and healthy plant protein. Legumes include lentils, beans, chickpeas, peas, edamame, and soy. People who eat a lot of high-fiber foods tend to eat fewer calories, weigh less, and have a lower risk of diabetes.
          Increase fruit and vegetable intake. At least half of our food intake every day should be nonstarchy fruits and vegetables, the more colorful the better. Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts, and high-fiber fruits like berries of all kinds, are especially healthy.
          Eat less meat, and avoid processed red meat. Many studies have shown us that certain meats are incredibly risky for us. People who eat processed red meat are far more likely to develop diabetes: one serving a day (which is two slices of bacon, two slices of deli meat, or one hot dog) is associated with over a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Eating even a small portion of red meat daily (red meat includes beef, lamb, and pork), like a palm-sized piece of steak, is associated with a 20% increased risk of type 2 diabetes. In fact, the less meat you eat, the lower your risk of diabetes. People who don't eat red meat at all, but do eat chicken, eggs, dairy, and fish, may significantly lower their risk of developing type 2 diabetes, by about 30%; those who eat only fish, 50%; those who eat only eggs and dairy, 60%; those who are vegan, 80%.
          Eat healthier fats. Fat is not necessarily bad for you. What kind of fat you're eating really does matter. Saturated fats, particularly from meats, are associated with an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease. Plant oils, such as extra-virgin olive oil and canola oil, carry less risk. Omega-3 fats, like in walnuts, flax seeds, and some fish, are actually quite good for you.
        
        Diet and lifestyle changes that can help prevent diabetes
        The CDC's Diabetes Prevention Program, used in many clinics, is a free tool to help you learn and stick with the healthy diet, physical activity, and stress management techniques that reduce your risk of diabetes.
        Another helpful tool is the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Nutrition Source Healthy Eating Plate, which shows you what your daily food intake should look like: half fruits and vegetables, about a quarter whole grains, and a quarter healthy proteins (plant protein is ideal here), with some healthy fats and no-sugar-added beverages.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-skin-creams-are-most-effective-for-eczema-202310122981,Which skin creams are most effective for eczema?,"Quelling the discomfort of atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema, can be a daily quest. This inflamed, itchy skin condition can interfere with sleeping, socializing, and many other activities.
        If home remedies such as gentle cleansing and regular moisturizing don't provide relief, your doctor might recommend a prescription treatment to apply to your skin. Which prescription cream is most effective? A new study boils it down to a few overall winners.
        What is atopic dermatitis and the itch-scratch cycle?
        Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. The areas commonly affected include the face, hands, feet, or the skin folds of the elbows or behind the knees.
        We don't know exactly what causes atopic dermatitis. Genes, the environment, and an overactive immune system all seem to play a role in creating inflammation, which feels itchy. Scratching the itch creates more irritation and inflammation, which causes more itching.
        As the itch-scratch cycle continues, the rash gets worse. The skin might tear, ooze, and crust over, which can be painful.
        Which skin treatments were more effective in the study?
        Some prescription topical skin treatments for atopic dermatitis are more effective than others, according to a 2023 study published online by The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.
        Scientists evaluated more than 200 randomized trials involving more than 43,000 people with atopic dermatitis (average age 18). The researchers compared almost 70 different prescription creams or ointments, which are broadly called topical treatments and are designed to be applied to affected areas of skin.
        These treatments fall into five categories. If you have eczema, their generic names may or may not be familiar to you, but your medical team is likely to know them well:
        
          topical corticosteroids, divided into seven classes ranging from the most to the least potent, decrease the release of an inflammatory chemical called phospholipase A2
          topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors interrupt inflammatory signals as they enter cells
          topical PDE4 inhibitors raise the production of a chemical called phosphodiesterase-4, or PDE4, and lower the body's inflammatory response
          topical calcineurin inhibitors help suppress the production of chemical messengers that tell the body to ramp up its defenses
          other topical treatments, including antibiotics and prescription moisturizers.
        
        Researchers looked at which medications had outcomes important to patients, including which
        
          were best at improving quality of life
          were best at reducing eczema-related severity, itch, sleep disturbances, or flare-ups
          caused the fewest serious side effects
          were discontinued least often due to serious side effects.
        
        Which atopic dermatitis medications proved to be most effective?
        The study yielded some predictable results and a surprise. The overall winners were
        
          two calcineurin inhibitors: pimecrolimus (Elidel) and tacrolimus (Protopic)
          moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, a large group that includes fluocinolone acetonide (Synalar cream 0.025%) and triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog cream/ointment 0.1%).
        
        What did these medications improve?
        
          Pimecrolimus improved six of seven outcomes, and was among the best at reducing sleep disturbances and eczema flares.
          High-dose tacrolimus (0.1%) improved five outcomes, and was among the best at reducing itch and eczema flares.
          Moderate-potency steroids improved four to six of the seven outcomes, and were best at reducing eczema itch, flares, and serious side effects.
        
        ""That's in line with what we often prescribe,"" says Dr. Connie Shi, a dermatologist who often treats people with eczema at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""The strongest topical steroids appeared to be the most effective at reducing eczema severity in the study. However, for longer-term maintenance we may consider switching to a moderate-potency steroid, or one of the nonsteroid options, to minimize the risk of thinning the skin, which can occur with long-term use of topical steroids.""
        The surprise finding: the study found little to no effectiveness from using a topical cream twice daily versus just once daily. ""The traditional advice is twice daily,"" Dr. Shi says. ""Once a day would make it more convenient to use, and it may help people stay on their medication regimen without decreasing effectiveness.""
        Which treatments were less effective in this study? The researchers found that topical antibiotics were among the least effective treatments for eczema.
        Should you change your treatment?
        ""While the study included more than 40,000 people, what worked for participants may not always work for you, as different people may respond differently to the same treatment,"" Dr. Shi explains. ""There are many factors to consider when prescribing a treatment, including your age, the areas on your skin that are affected, the severity of the eczema, and potential side effects.""
        The bottom line? ""If a treatment regimen is working for you, then continue it, as long as you don't have any serious side effects,"" she says. ""If your current regimen isn't working well, talk with your doctor or a dermatologist to see if there's another prescription cream or ointment that you may want to try.""",Heidi Godman,"October 12, 2023",1

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/managing_common_vulvar_skin_conditions,Managing common vulvar skin conditions,"Many women have been primed to think no further than ""itch equals yeast infection."" But the vulva, which is the external genital area surrounding the vagina, is subject to a range of skin problems, many of them inadvertently self-inflicted.
        And with age, the decline in estrogen after menopause means women become more prone to a variety of conditions that irritate vulvar skin. These conditions aren't getting the medical attention they need — and women aren't getting the relief they deserve.
        Vulvar skin conditions and their treatment
        Several vulvar skin conditions are familiar from other areas of the body but may be difficult to recognize when they appear on the vulva. These include the following:
        Eczema
        This inflammatory skin condition disrupts the skin's surface, causing red patches and thin cracks, weeping, and crust formation.
        On the vulva, crusts are less likely, but eczema may initiate a cycle of vulvar itching and scratching that leads to lichen simplex chronicus — thickened and intensely itchy skin.
        If eczema affects an area of the vulva called the vestibule (the smooth skin next to the vaginal opening and upward toward the clitoris), it may cause stinging and burning. Sometimes eczema appears in early childhood and its cause is unknown. More often, it begins with exposure to an irritant or allergen.
        To diagnose vulvar eczema, the clinician will ask about your symptoms; your history of eczema, allergy, and related conditions; your vulvar cleansing habits; and any products the vulva has been exposed to. During the exam, she or he will look for redness, scaling, cracking, and thickening.
        All eczema requires gentle skin care. In simple cases, patients use topical corticosteroid ointments twice a day for two to four weeks, and then gradually reduce the frequency until the symptoms are gone. Severe cases may require a short course of a potent corticosteroid ointment.
        During treatment, you must stop scratching, so your clinician may prescribe an antihistamine (usually taken at night to prevent daytime drowsiness). A cold pack can also help relieve itching.
        Psoriasis
        Psoriasis is a common condition in which new skin cells are produced too rapidly, leading to thickened, scaly patches of inflamed and red skin on various parts of the body.
        On the vulva, skin surfaces are usually too moist for dry scaling, so psoriasis is more likely to appear in the form of pink patches with defined edges. It most commonly affects the labia majora, and there may produce dry, scaly, and itchy patches of skin in the hair-bearing areas. If the skin cracks open, irritation or infection may result.
        You may have treated psoriasis outbreaks elsewhere on your body with remedies that may be too harsh to be used on the vulva. Your clinician may prescribe a topical steroid cream or ointment.
        Lichen sclerosus
        Although it can occur elsewhere on the body, this inflammatory skin disorder usually affects the vulvar or anal area in postmenopausal women. By some estimates, one in 30 older women has lichen sclerosus. It's especially common in women with psoriasis.
        Itching is usually the first symptom, and it may become severe enough to disrupt sleep and other activities. During an examination, the clinician may notice white (sometimes crinkly or shiny) patches. Some may contain tears or red areas from bleeding (often the result of scratching), and these areas may be painful and sting. As the disease progresses, there's a danger that vulvar tissues will scar and shrink.
        Lichen sclerosus is diagnosed by its appearance and sometimes by biopsies. No matter how mild the symptoms, it should be treated to prevent progression. The usual treatment is application of a high-potency corticosteroid ointment for several weeks, then slowly tapering the dose.
        Women also need regular examinations after treatment for lichen sclerosus because the condition can make affected skin more likely to develop skin cancer. Early treatment and prompt attention to new lesions or nonhealing sores in the area will reduce the risk further.
        Lichen planus
        This skin condition, believed to result from an overactive immune system, can affect the vulva, the vagina, the inside of the mouth, and other skin surfaces. In most areas of the body, lichen planus causes itchy purple bumps sometimes streaked with white.
        On vulvar skin, the most common symptoms are soreness, burning, and rawness. The vulva may appear pale or pink, sometimes with a white lacy pattern. If the vulvar skin breaks down, the eroded areas appear moist and red. Lichen planus often affects the vagina as well, causing a sticky yellow discharge and erosions that can make intercourse painful.
        Eventually, lichen planus can affect underlying as well as surface tissues, and produce scarring that alters the vulva's shape, sometimes leading to the virtual disappearance of the labia minora.
        Lichen planus is diagnosed by its appearance (although it can be difficult to distinguish from atrophy caused by a lack of estrogen or the excessive use of steroids), and the diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy. The condition may start as a reaction to certain medications, so be sure to tell your clinician about any drugs you take.
        The most common initial treatment is high-potency topical steroid medication. Unfortunately, lichen planus is persistent and likely to require long-term maintenance treatment.
        Irritants and allergens that can affect the vulva
        Many things can cause an allergic reaction or irritate vulvar skin. Here are some of the leading suspects.
        Irritants
        On exposure, irritants can cause immediate stinging or burning. Irritants include:
        
          soap, bubble baths and salts, detergent, shampoo, conditioner
          adult or baby wipes
          panty liners and their adhesives
          nylon underwear, chemically treated clothing
          vaginal secretions, sweat, and urine
          douches, yogurt
          spermicides, lubricants
          perfume, talcum powder, deodorants
          alcohol and astringents
          scented toilet paper
          sensitivity to some fabrics.
        
        Allergens
        Symptoms of allergic reaction may not appear until several days after exposure. Allergens can include:
        
          benzocaine
          neomycin
          chlorhexidine (in K-Y Jelly)
          imidazole antifungal
          propylene glycol (a preservative used in many products)
          fragrances
          tea tree oil
          latex (in condoms and diaphragms).
        
        Adapted from The V Book by Elizabeth G. Stewart, M.D., and Paula Spencer (Bantam Books, 2002).
        
          
            
              
                Anatomy of the vulva
                The vulva (Latin for womb or covering) consists of several layers that cover and protect the sexual organs and urinary opening. The fleshy outer lips of the vulva — the labia majora — are covered with pubic hair and contain fat that helps cushion the area. Inside the labia majora are the thinner, more pigmented and delicate flaps of skin called the labia minora. The labia minora join at the top to enclose the clitoris.
                
                  
                
                The labia majora, labia minora, and clitoris are made up of erectile tissue, that is, tissue that can become engorged with blood. The area between the labia minora, the vestibule, contains the openings to the urethra and the vagina, as well as the Bartholin's glands, which are located on either side of the vaginal opening and produce lubricant for the vestibule.
                The flesh between the vaginal opening and the anus (not part of the vulva but often involved in vulvar skin problems) is the perineum. This is where the incision called an episiotomy is sometimes made during childbirth, and also where tears can occur on their own during normal childbirth.
              
            
          
        
        Getting a diagnosis for vulvar skin conditions
        Vulvar skin conditions are highly treatable, but the treatment depends on the specific cause. And identifying the underlying diagnosis can be very challenging.
        Tell your clinician about any other past or present medical conditions (including bladder and bowel issues) and any skin problems elsewhere on your body.
        For example, psoriasis anywhere on the body raises the risk of lichen sclerosus. Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory intestinal disease, may cause abscesses or draining fistulas in the vulvar area, and vulvar skin problems are often one of its early symptoms. Lichen planus is another cause of vulvovaginal problems. (The term ""lichen,"" as applied to skin disorders, refers fancifully to skin lesions that resemble lichen on rocks.)
        Long-term treatment with oral steroids, immune suppressants, or antibiotics can affect vulvar skin and raise the risk of infection.
        Your clinician will want to know how you care for your vulvar skin, which can help identify possible sources of irritation. Even if you can't pinpoint a change, that doesn't mean your standard routine isn't the culprit. Sometimes vulvar problems are the cumulative effect of long-term practices.
        It's often what you've done day after day, year after year, that causes the problem. If you wear abrasive clothing and engage in abrasive activities like bicycling or spinning class, and wear tight workout clothes that expose your vulva to sweat or to detergent or soap residue, eventually it might catch up with you.
        Report all the symptoms that concern you, including itching, burning, soreness, discoloration, discharge, bumps, and any rashes the vulva. It will also help if you can provide a history of your symptoms and recall what seems to make them better or worse.
        Your clinician will examine the vulva, perhaps using a magnifying glass, and insert a speculum to inspect the vagina. She or he may test the pH (acid-base balance) of the vagina, and take samples of secretions to examine under the microscope or culture for yeast. Remember, even if you're seeing an experienced clinician, several visits may be needed to diagnose and improve certain vulvovaginal conditions.
        The problem with self-treatment
        When vaginal or vulvar itching occurs, women usually assume it's a yeast infection and treat it with an over-the-counter antifungal cream. Often this does the trick, but not always. Instead, the cause of the symptoms might be dry skin, a sexually transmitted disease or bacterial infection, a less common strain of yeast that requires special medication, or irritation by and allergic reactions to common products such as soaps, creams, and lotions.
        If yeast isn't the problem, an antifungal cream isn't the solution. And if your skin is already irritated, you may exacerbate the problem by introducing preservatives (such as alcohol or propylene glycol) and other ingredients contained in many antifungal remedies. That's why it's important to see your gynecologist or dermatologist if a problem persists after you've tried a standard antifungal cream.
        Another common response of women faced with a vaginal discharge or itch is to wash the vulvar skin vigorously, on the assumption that this will disinfect the area or remove irritants. But aggressive cleansing can add to the irritation, and won't get rid of the underlying problem. Until the problem is diagnosed, it's best to follow a gentle skin care routine (see ""Gentle vulvar care"").
        In fact, gentle cleansing applies whether you have a vulvar skin condition or not: Wash the area gently with your fingertips or a soft cloth and pat dry with a soft towel. Don't use a rough washcloth, and don't rub.
        
          
            
              
                Gentle vulvar care
                Whether you have a vulvar skin problem or are just prone to irritation, gentle care of the area is a must. The following gentle care tips may help relieve vulvar itching, dryness, and irritation:
                
                  Wear loose clothing.
                  Choose cotton underwear (and go without when at home).
                  To cleanse the area, use your fingers instead of a washcloth and an unscented, nonalkaline cleanser such as Cetaphil or Basis (plain water is also fine).
                  Soak for five minutes in lukewarm water to remove any residue of sweat, lotions, or other products.
                  Pat dry, and apply any prescribed medication or a soothing and protective substance such as Vaseline or olive oil.
                  Avoid products with multiple ingredients. Even those that sound designed for vulvar care — like A&D Original Ointment, baby lotion, or Vagisil — contain chemicals that could irritate or cause contact dermatitis.
                  In the bathroom, forego moistened wipes. If you want moisture, use a spray bottle with plain water, and then pat dry.
                  After bathing, wait a few minutes before getting dressed, in order to allow any moisture to evaporate.
                
              
            
          
        
        Some women with vulvar skin problems may benefit from estrogen therapy (delivered vaginally via ring, tablet, or cream, or applied directly to the vulva), which can help counter atrophy and inflammation and make the vulvar skin less vulnerable to irritation.

Many people have developed habits over 20, 30, or 40 years that are ingrained and can take a significant effort to modify. Does having a partner who is supportive and participatory help? A recent study demonstrated it can.
        The RESPONSE-2 Trial is a lifestyle intervention study that enrolled patients with coronary artery disease. More than 800 study participants were randomized into either a nurse-coordinated referral of patients and their partners to three widely available community-based lifestyle programs, or to usual care. The community-based intervention programs targeted weight reduction, increasing physical activity, and smoking cessation. Both the intervention and control groups continued to receive visits to their cardiologist, participate in cardiac rehab programs, and attend general counseling sessions on healthy lifestyles, risk factors, and medication adherence. Success was defined as improvement in one of the three risk factors without deterioration in the other two after 12 months.
        Results showed the proportion of successful patients who improved at least one of the lifestyle risk factors was 37% in the intervention group compared with 26% in the control group. Weight loss was the most successful component, with almost two times the number of patients achieving significant weight loss (at least 5% of starting weight) in the intervention group compared to the control group. Patients whose partner participated in the community-based program had the highest proportion of success.
        Modifiable lifestyle risk factors for heart disease
        It is well established that obesity puts you at risk for high cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes — all factors that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. By managing your weight through physical activity and healthy eating, you can reduce these risk factors, and thus decrease heart disease risk.
        How can a partner help?
        There are many challenges to improving our diet: what we eat, how much we eat, and where we eat, to name a few.
        What we eat: What is put on the table will translate into what we eat. A partner can develop a shopping list with you to determine what is brought into the house. You can create a menu together that is consistent with healthy eating guidelines. Limiting food brought into the house that is not heart-healthy can play a major role in someone's success. Once food is readily available, it is even more challenging for someone trying to modify their food intake. Making sure there are plenty of vegetables, fresh fruit, and lean protein, along with healthy fats, some low-fat dairy, and whole grains, can contribute to your success.
        How much we eat: Some people may eat mostly healthy foods, but they eat too much and therefore may struggle with their weight. A partner can help support you in preparing a reasonable amount of food so that there are not many leftovers. When plating food, you and your partner can use the ""balanced plate"" guidelines of 1/2 the plate with lower-calorie vegetables, 1/4 plate with lean protein, and 1/4 plate with whole grains or a healthy starch.
        
          
        
        Where we eat: Prior to the pandemic, Americans allocated a fair amount of their food dollar to consuming food away from home — as takeout, fast food, and in restaurants. With the shutdown of many establishments in 2020 and early 2021, cooking at home rose significantly. However, now that dining out has reopened, many Americans are resuming pre-pandemic habits. This can result in some meals being higher in overall calories, saturated fat, and sodium than home-cooked meals. A partner can help in the decision regarding how often and where to eat out. In addition, a partner can help choose restaurants where healthy options are readily available.
        Tips on healthy eating out
        Don't start out famished. Skipping meals or starving yourself can cause you to overeat! You may also find it difficult to avoid all those tempting foods.
        Don't feel like you have to eat everything on your plate. Send back what you don't want. Better yet, bring it home in a doggy bag and you'll enjoy the meal twice as much.
        Avoid nibbling. Listen to your body when it tells you it's full. Have the waiter or wait staff remove extra food from the table. The longer it stays, the more apt you will be to nibble.
        Eating is not meant to be a race. Eating too fast can lead to overeating, as it takes 20 minutes for your body to know it's full. So, take your time, put your fork down between bites, and focus on the social aspect of eating.
        Order a la carte. Who says you must order an entree? Make your own. You can choose any combination of appetizers, soups, salads, and side dishes. This allows more variety, and gives you more control over what and how much you eat.
        Longstanding habits are hard to change, but you can make small changes every day. A partner who is willing and able to support you in the change process may be a helpful resource for your success.","Katherine D. McManus, MS, RD, LDN","October 10, 2023",1

        Stocking your freezer isn't just a precaution to take when bad weather may prevent you from getting out of the house. For older adults who can't always go to the store, it's smart to keep the freezer stocked with healthy foods all year round.
        Malnutrition risks
        Fresh vegetables, fruits, lean meats, dairy products, and whole grains are loaded with vitamins, minerals, protein, and fiber your body needs to function properly. But older adults may not buy enough fresh food because they feel it won't keep, or they'll cut back on meals when the good food runs out. Consuming fewer calories can lead to malnutrition, low energy levels, and poor concentration. 
        If you turn to processed canned or packaged meals that last longer, you'll likely consume extra sugar, salt, trans fat, preservatives, and other additives. Even canned vegetables may have salt or other preservatives, and canned fruit may be packed in sugary syrup. Those poor-quality calories can make it harder to manage your blood sugar, blood pressure, and other chronic conditions.
        Creating an inventory
        One way to avoid malnutrition and ensure that you have nutritious food at all times is to fill your freezer with healthy options. Start with the basics—a variety of proteins (meat, poultry, and seafood), fruits, and vegetables. It doesn't matter if you buy fruit and vegetables from the produce aisle or from the frozen food section (as long as the frozen foods are not precooked and have no additives or sauces).
        Most fresh foods freeze well and retain their nutrients, including leafy greens such as kale, collards, and spinach; starchy vegetables such as corn and peas; most meat, poultry, and seafood, such as salmon, scallops, chicken, turkey, and lean beef; most fruits such as blueberries, strawberries, mangos, and peaches; and even milk, egg whites, and most cheeses, such as cheddar and Colby. Cooked whole grains (such as brown rice) and whole-grain breads, pastas, and crackers also freeze well.
        Foods that don't do well in the freezer include bananas, avocado, melon, dairy-style yogurt (not frozen dessert yogurt), cottage cheese, and whole tomatoes.
        You can still eat those foods after thawing, but there will be a significant change in texture. Don't freeze whole eggs; they tend to crack and must be thrown away.
        Using your supplies
        When you're ready to dip into your frozen food supplies, don't feel compelled to cook large quantities. Grab a handful of frozen blueberries and add them to oatmeal, or a handful of frozen vegetables and add them to soups or stews.
        Or prepare in advance: place servings of the frozen foods you'd like tomorrow in covered dishes in your refrigerator today, to give them time to thaw. You can also thaw foods on low power in a microwave, or by placing a bag of frozen food in cold—not hot—water (to avoid bacterial growth). Don't place frozen food on the counter to thaw; that promotes bacterial growth as well.
        Just remember to keep your supplies plentiful. Each time you use something from your freezer inventory, add a new item to your grocery list.
        
          
            
              
                Will freezer-burned foods make you sick?
                The movie ""Mother,"" starring Debbie Reynolds and Albert Brooks, features a funny scene with Reynolds describing a thick layer of frost on some sherbet as ""protective ice."" But frost or fuzzy white ice that you see on frozen foods is a sign that air has come in contact with the contents of the container. The USDA says freezer burn doesn't make foods unsafe; it just makes them dry. Should you still eat them? You can, but you probably won't enjoy them, because the food quality suffers, and the foods absorb other odors in the freezer.
                It's better to try to avoid exposing frozen foods to air. Cover them tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then place them in sealed freezer bags, and label them so you know what's inside. If you're placing food in a plastic container, protect it further by covering the surface of the food (inside the container) with a little plastic wrap, and then putting the lid on the container. The USDA recommends keeping your freezer at a frosty 0° F or lower to ensure foods retain vitamin content, color, flavor, and texture.",Unknown,"October 10, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/handling-hypoglycemia,Handling hypoglycemia,"Hypoglycemia is a potentially dangerous condition in which blood sugar falls too low. Too much exercise, too little food or carbohydrates, a missed or delayed meal, or a combination of these factors can bring on hypoglycemia.
        
          Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the reaction, but commonly include
        
        
          nervousness
          sweating
          feeling cold and clammy
          trembling or shakiness
          rapid heartbeat
          lightheadedness
          hunger
          irritability.
        
        
          If early symptoms aren't recognized and treated quickly, blood sugar levels may continue to fall, resulting in
        
        
          drowsiness
          weakness
          blurred vision
          slurred speech
          confusion
          clumsiness
          personality change or strange behavior such as belligerence or silliness.
        
        At its worst, hypoglycemia can cause seizures or coma.
        Most people with type 2 diabetes don't have to worry about hypoglycemia. It may, however, occur in those who use insulin or take a diabetes medication known as a sulfonylurea. Changes in eating habits, such as dieting— especially if carbohydrates are reduced—or increased exercise can lead to hypoglycemia. Talk with your doctor before making any changes in your diet or increasing your exercise.
        
          The 15/15 Rule to treat a low blood sugar
        
        Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of hypoglycemia, so that if it occurs, you can take steps to treat it appropriately and prevent the problem from recurring.
        If you think you're having an episode of low blood sugar, don't ignore your symptoms. If possible, test your blood sugar with a finger-stick test. If it is low, follow the 15/15 rule. Eat 15 grams of carbohydrate and wait 15 minutes. Here are some foods that will provide about 15 grams of carbohydrate to lower blood sugar:
        
          eat three glucose tablets or four dextrose tablets
          drink 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice
          drink 5 to 6 ounces (about half a can) of regular soda, such as Coke or Pepsi
          eat five to seven Life Savers
          eat 2 tablespoons raisins
          eat six jelly beans.
        
        Don't eat foods containing chocolate, peanut butter, nuts, or fats. Fat slows the body's absorption of carbohydrates, so foods with fat won't raise your blood sugar quickly enough. After the carbohydrate is eaten, wait about 15 minutes for the sugar to get into your blood. If you do not feel better within 15 minutes, more carbohydrate can be consumed. Your blood sugar should be checked to make sure it has come within a safe range.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/try-this-natural-remedy-to-stay-regular,Try this natural remedy to stay regular,"October kicks off kiwifruit season, which lasts through May. The tasty green fruit is great in salads, smoothies, and desserts. And it might have an added bonus of helping to ease chronic constipation, according to a small randomized trial. Scientists asked more than 180 adults (some with constipation, some without) in Italy, Japan, and New Zealand to take part in two four-week courses of treatment. In one regimen, they ate two peeled kiwifruits per day. In the other, they took 7.5 grams of psyllium (a natural ingredient found in fiber supplements such as Metamucil or Fiberall) daily. The order of the two regimens was randomly assigned, and participants took a four-week break in between. The results: both treatments seemed to help constipated participants produce more bowel movements and experience less straining and abdominal pain, with kiwi being slightly more effective than psyllium. Scientists say kiwi contains not only fiber (about 3 grams per half-cup serving), but also raphides (natural needle-shaped crystals), which both help improve bowel function. The findings were published in the June 2023 issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-closer-look-at-alcohols-effect-on-heart-health,A closer look at alcohol's effect on heart health,"Along with many major health organizations, the American Heart Association (AHA) warns about the dangers of excessive drinking, which can contribute to high blood pressure, obesity, and stroke. It also discourages people from drinking alcohol to improve their health, although the AHA maintains that moderate drinking (no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks or fewer per day for men) is acceptable.
        This complex advice stems from conflicting studies about the health effects of light to moderate alcohol consumption. While some research focusing on inherited factors (see ""Using genetics to explore drinking's effects"") has hinted that even light drinking may be harmful, other studies have looked for mechanisms through which moderate drinking could benefit the heart.
        Limited evidence suggests that alcohol may raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels, boost antioxidant levels, or enhance blood flow. But none of these explanations has proven very convincing. A recent report raised another possibility: reduced stress.

                Using genetics to explore drinking's effects
                One well-known problem of observational studies is that they can't prove cause and effect. Light to moderate drinkers tend to be educated and relatively wealthy, which often enables healthy habits and good medical care. Also, people who are ill or taking certain medications are often advised to avoid alcohol. If you compare these abstainers to drinkers, the drinkers appear healthier by comparison, but that's not necessarily due to the alcohol.
                In an attempt to adjust for these and other confounding factors, researchers have looked at genetic factors that influence alcohol use. But the studies — which found that even small amounts of alcohol might increase heart disease risk — relied on gene variants linked to alcohol use disorder or binge drinking. A predilection to heavy drinking, which has many damaging health effects, isn't necessarily a good way to assess the effects of light to moderate drinking, says Dr. Kenneth Mukamal, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. In addition, genetic factors are multifaceted and complex (see ""Genetic profiling for heart disease: An update"").
              
            
          
        
        The stress connection
        A study published in the June 20, 2023, Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that brain scans of people who reported light to moderate drinking showed less activity in the part of the brain that responds to stress, compared with the scans of people who abstained or drank very little. Stress not only raises blood pressure and heart rate but also triggers inflammation that causes plaque buildup, which contributes to heart attacks.
        The finding is limited by the fact that the brain scans were commonly done for cancer surveillance or diagnosis, says Dr. Ken Mukamal, an internist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who studies how alcohol and other lifestyle factors affect health. ""The stress level of someone in the midst of a cancer workup is likely quite high and may not reflect the typical stress level of an average person,"" he notes. Still, he says it's an intriguing finding that merits further study.
        In the moment, alcohol can help people feel relaxed, and that's especially true when people drink in social situations. It's possible that light to moderate drinkers have stronger social ties, which in turn provide resilience against stress. The study authors are now focusing on other interventions — such as meditation or exercise — that might lower the brain's stress activity without the potentially harmful effects of alcohol.
        How is drinking linked to diabetes?
        A 2022 study showed a link between moderate drinking (eight to 16 drinks per week) and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, but specifically among people who drank alcohol with meals. Many short-term trials that randomly assign people to drink either alcohol or a nonalcoholic beverage show lower blood sugar levels and better insulin sensitivity among people who drink moderate amounts of alcohol. While these biomarkers aren't a perfect representation of diabetes risk, they're pretty close, says Dr. Mukamal. People with diabetes are twice as likely to have heart disease as people without the condition.

But again, sticking to moderate intake is important. If you drink alcohol, enjoy it with a meal, which will slow down the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream. Because alcohol is high in calories, drinking excessive amounts can lead to weight gain, which raises the risk of diabetes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/hidden-causes-of-weight-gain,Hidden causes of weight gain,"The reason for gaining weight isn't always a mystery. For example, you might know you've been eating more and exercising less, a potent combo that often results in extra pounds. But sometimes the cause isn't quite so obvious. And you might not be aware of many of the other factors that can contribute to weight gain.
        Age-related causes
        Getting older brings physiological changes that can affect weight. Chief among them is muscle loss. Starting in middle age, we lose about 1% of muscle mass per year, which affects strength and metabolism (how fast we burn calories). ""Smaller muscles use fewer calories. If your diet doesn't change, you'll consume more calories than you need. The excess is stored as fat,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, an obesity medicine specialist and co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Here are other age-related changes that can affect weight.
        Chronic stress. It's harder to manage stress as we get older. And if you're constantly under stress, you might have consistently high levels of the stress hormone cortisol. One job of cortisol is helping the body replenish energy stores. In some people, that might indirectly promote weight gain by increasing appetite (since the body thinks it needs energy) and increasing the storage of unused energy as fat. ""But mostly, stress leads to compulsive behaviors, such as eating 'comfort' foods, which are often full of sugar, unhealthy fat, extra calories, and salt,"" Dr. Apovian says.
        Poor sleep. Age-related changes affect our ability to sleep well. ""If you're a chronic 'short sleeper,' getting six hours or fewer each night, it might affect hormones that regulate appetite. Short sleep is associated with higher levels of hormones that make us hungry, lower levels of hormones that tell us we're full, and higher levels of cortisol,"" Dr. Apovian says.
        Sex hormone changes. Older men and women experience reductions in certain sex hormones. In women, low estrogen levels are associated with sleep problems and increased body fat. In men, reduced testosterone levels are linked to less muscle mass.
        Underlying conditions
        Weight gain, especially if it's new, can signal a number of health conditions. For example, someone with heart failure might experience weight gain from fluid retention—which might appear as swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, or belly. ""This would likely be accompanied by symptoms such as fatigue or shortness of breath,"" Dr. Apovian says.
        Other underlying conditions associated with weight gain include
        
          diabetes
          certain kidney diseases
          sleep apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep)
          thyroid problems.
        
        Medication side effects
        Taking certain medications regularly can lead to weight gain. Some drugs, such as prednisone, can make you retain fluid and increase your weight.
        And many medications affect brain chemicals that regulate appetite, which might make you hungrier than usual, so you might eat more and gain weight. Examples include
        
          antidepressants such as paroxetine (Paxil) or phenelzine (Nardil)
          antihistamines that contain the ingredient diphenhydramine (the active ingredient in Benadryl)
          antipsychotics such as clozapine (Clozaril) or olanzapine (Zyprexa)
          beta blockers such as the drug atenolol (Tenormin) or metoprolol (Lopressor)
          sleep aids that contain the drug diphenhydramine, such as Sominex, Unisom SleepGels, or ZzzQuil.
        
        Other potential causes
        Some potential causes of weight gain aren't yet well understood and are currently being studied.
        One possibility is late-night eating. Some evidence, including a 2022 Harvard study, suggests that eating late at night might make us hungrier in the daytime, slow metabolism, and increase body fat.
        Another suspected factor in weight gain is the population of microbes that live in your gut (their genes are called your microbiome). Considerable evidence suggests gut microbes might influence appetite, metabolism, blood sugar, and fat storage. The strongest support comes from studies of animals. In humans, the evidence is less clear.
        ""Studies have found that the gut microbes of people with obesity are different from those of people who are lean,"" Dr. Apovian explains.
        ""But we don't know if this causes people to develop obesity. It could be that people who are genetically programmed to gain weight have a certain microbiome,"" she notes. ""Or it could be that people with obesity are eating a different way than lean people are eating, which may change the microbiome. We need more research for better answers.""
        What you should do
        Any recent or excessive weight gain warrants a visit to your doctor, who can hunt for new underlying conditions and check if your medications might be influencing your weight. Getting those two aspects of health under control are essential.
        It might also help to see a dietitian to determine the right calorie intake for your current needs.
        Beyond that, Dr. Apovian says the best way to control weight as we age is clean living: eating a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, limited amounts of whole grains and starchy vegetables, and ample amounts of lean protein to help build muscle; avoiding late-night eating; getting seven to nine hours of sleep per night; exercising briskly every day for at least 20 minutes; and strength training at least twice a week. ""You can rebuild muscle,"" Dr. Apovian says, ""but it takes a combination of healthy lifestyle habits to control weight.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/cardiorespiratory-fitness-may-protect-men-from-some-cancers,Cardiorespiratory fitness may protect men from some cancers,"Better cardiorespiratory fitness (also known as cardio fitness or aerobic fitness) may help men lower their risk of death from cancer of the colon, lung, or prostate, suggests a study published online June 29, 2023, by JAMA Network Open. Researchers collected health data on more than 170,000 men that included measurements of their VO2 max while they pedaled a stationary bike. VO2 max is the maximum amount of oxygen the body can use during exercise. The higher the VO2 max, the greater a person's cardio fitness.
        After a mean follow-up time of 9.6 years, the men with greater cardio fitness were less likely to die from these cancers. These findings highlight that improving cardio fitness through moderate- to high-intensity aerobic exercises is not only important for heart health, but could lead to a better prognosis in men with these common cancers.

A new study suggests not, although with some caveats. Researchers enrolled 5,246 men ages 45 to 80 with testosterone levels of less than 300 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL). (Normal levels range from 300 to 1,000 ng/dL.) More than 50% had existing cardiovascular disease, while the others were considered at increased risk because of such factors as diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, and an imbalance of lipids (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides).
        For an average of 22 months, the men applied a gel to their skin daily. For half of the men, the gel was a placebo (inactive). For the others, it contained enough testosterone to maintain their hormone levels between 350 and 750 ng/dL. At the three-year follow-up, the researchers found no difference in the rate of heart attacks, strokes, or death from cardiovascular problems between the TRT and placebo groups. However, compared with the men using the placebo, those using TRT were more likely to have developed atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rate that can increase the risk for stroke and heart failure) and pulmonary embolism (in which a blood clot travels to a lung artery and blocks blood flow).
        The researchers pointed out that their findings do not apply to men who do not have a testosterone deficiency. Men considering TRT should discuss possible risks with their doctor, especially if they have any cardiovascular disease risk factors. The results were published in the July 13, 2023, issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/try-this-take-a-tactical-breather,Try this: Take a tactical breather,"Next time you feel overwhelmed by stress or need to stay mentally sharp in a high-stress situation, try tactical breathing.
        This breathwork (sometimes referred to as box breathing) is used by military and law enforcement personnel to remain calm and collected in dangerous situations. It works like this:
        
          Gradually take a full inhalation through the nose while counting one, two, three, four. With each count, draw in more air, so when you reach the count of four, you inhale to your maximum.
          Hold your breath as you count one, two, three, four again.
          Then slowly exhale through the mouth, again counting from one to four. Release some air with each count, fully exhaling when you reach four.
          After full exhalation, hold your breath again for a count of four.
          Repeat the breathing cycle several times.
        
        Tactical breathing can damp down the body's sympathetic nervous system, which directs our response to dangerous or stressful situations. It also engages the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls the body's ability to relax.
        Tactical breathing also can be used to calm a racing mind when you're trying to sleep and to help soothe pain.

        How can you put some pep in your steps? Here are some suggestions from Dr. Aaron Baggish, director of the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Change locations. It's easy to get into a rut when you cover the same ground over and over. Explore different locations and even commit to trying a new route once a week or once a month. ""There are loads of websites and apps that map popular routes for runners and walkers with a variety of distances and types of terrain and scenery,"" says Dr. Baggish.
        Tweak your regular route. Even making minor changes to your usual routine can be stimulating. For instance, go at an earlier or later time, or walk or run in the opposite direction.
        Enlist a workout buddy. If it has become easier to blow off workouts, invite someone to join you. ""We are 10 times more likely to commit to a workout if we know someone is waiting, as we don't want to disappoint them,"" says Dr. Baggish.
        Join a running or walking club. Besides offering another way to show accountability, clubs offer organized group runs and walks where you can work out with others at your same level. Inquire about such clubs at your local specialty running store or senior community center.
        Set regular goals. ""People who choose small, incremental, achievable goals and write them down are more likely to get them done,"" says Dr. Baggish. For example, focus on covering a certain number of miles per week or month or gradually increasing your speed or distance for each workout. ""Signing up for a 5K race or similar event also can be a useful carrot,"" says Dr. Baggish. ""You will more likely follow through because you don't want to waste your entry fee.""
        Race against yourself. A self-challenge also is a great motivator. Try this: Time how long it takes to walk or run for a specific distance, like a mile around your neighborhood or local track. Then try to meet or beat that number. When you have achieved it, reset the challenge and start anew.
        Create a cue. If you need help sticking to a routine, schedule your run or walk around a regularly scheduled activity, like when you first get up in the morning or before lunch or dinner. ""Many daily habits are created when something signals you to do them,"" says Dr. Baggish
        Listen to an audiobook. Make a rule that you can listen to an audiobook only during your outing. Always keep the volume low and use only one earbud, so you remain alert for trouble in your surroundings.
        Combine running and walking. Devote a regular outing to a run/walk routine. For runners, it helps break up the intensity by offering a brief recovery period, which may help them run farther with less struggle. For walkers, it's a great way to increase cardio output.
        For example, run for one to two minutes and then walk for four to five minutes until you fully recover. (Walkers would speed walk for one to two minutes and then walk at a normal or slower pace for the recovery.) Repeat the pattern five times or until you have covered your usual workout time or distance. Adjust the times to make it easier or more challenging.
        Take exercise ""breaks."" Break up your regular routine with two minutes or so of body-weight exercises. Stop and do 10 squats, walking lunges, or push-ups (on the ground or against a tree or bench).
        Treat yourself. Accessories can make you feel confident. Invest in new workout shirts, shorts, hats, shoes. Treat yourself to a new water bottle, or upgrade to a hydration pack that carries water in a rubber bladder and offers handy pockets for snacks, phone, and keys.
        Walkers also can try using walking poles, which are available with pointed tips for trails or rubber tips for sidewalks. They come in fixed or adjustable heights and are readily available online, as are videos on how to use them.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/an-inside-look-at-body-fat,An inside look at body fat,"As men age, their metabolism naturally declines and they burn calories more slowly. Testosterone levels drop, and they may be less active, leading to potentially less muscle mass and making calorie burning even more challenging. In addition, many men consume more daily calories than they need. The typical outcome: too much body fat.
        ""When you take in extra calories and don't burn them off, they eventually get stored as fat, and over time can accumulate,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        But the real problem is where this fat ends up. Many people think of ""bad"" fat as the kind they can pinch around their waist. But the fat that collects just under the skin — called subcutaneous fat — appears to cause few health issues.
        A more dangerous type of fat, called visceral fat, is stored at waist level, but inside the abdominal cavity and around vital organs like the pancreas, liver, and intestines.
        Visceral fat makes up only about 10% of a person's total body fat. Still, research has found that high amounts can raise several heart disease risk factors, such as blood pressure, blood sugar, and total cholesterol levels.
        How to measure
        How can you measure visceral fat? The most accurate way is with an MRI, but that can be expensive (and the test is not covered by health insurance if ordered solely to assess visceral fat). Body mass index (BMI) provides a reasonable estimate using a person's height and weight. (Find your BMI at /bmi.) But BMI does not account for ethnic differences, nor does it consider extra weight from muscle and bone mass.
        One of the best (and easiest) ways to gauge visceral fat is your waistline, according to Dr. Apovian. ""In general, a man whose waist measures 40 inches or more has excess visceral fat."" (See ""Waist management."")
        But what if you have only put on an extra three to five pounds that moves the belt buckle over one hole? Is that a problem? Not necessarily—but be careful, warns Dr. Apovian. ""It's easy for five pounds to quickly turn into 10 pounds, and the more extra weight you carry, the greater the risk for high amounts of visceral fat.""
        
          
            
              
                Waist management
                A tape measure is a simple way to keep tabs on visceral fat. Place the bottom of the tape at the top of your right hipbone, then pull the tape around at navel level (not the narrowest part of your torso). Do not suck in your gut or pull the tape tight enough to compress the area. A waist circumference of 40 inches or more is considered a sign of excess visceral fat for men. Also monitor whether your pants get snug, which also can be a sign you have gained visceral fat.
              
            
          
        
        Going deep
        The best way to fight the fat you cannot see is the same as for fat you can see—aerobic exercise, strength training, and a healthy diet. But keep in mind that visceral fat can be slow to come off. ""You first gain visceral fat, and then you gain subcutaneous fat,"" says Dr. Apovian. ""But when you lose weight, only about one-third is visceral fat.""
        Dr. Apovian recommends a combination of 30 minutes to an hour of moderate-intense aerobic exercise, two or three days a week, plus two sessions a week of weight or resistance training to add muscle mass. ""The combination helps to burn calories and tap into stored visceral fat,"" she says.
        The kind of aerobic exercise doesn't matter as long as the intensity raises your heart rate enough that it is difficult to have a conversation. Some of your aerobic workouts should include high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, Dr. Apovian adds.
        With HIIT, you run or walk at a higher intensity for a brief time, followed by a period at a slower pace to catch your breath. You repeat the cycle for the entire workout. You can enlist a personal trainer to help design a HIIT program and teach you how to perform the exercises correctly and safely.
        Besides following a healthy, plant-based diet, make sure you eat enough daily protein to help build muscle mass. The recommended daily intake is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. (You can convert your body weight from pounds to kilograms by dividing by 2.2.
        So, for instance, 160 pounds is 72 kg; multiplying this by 0.8 equals about 58 grams of protein a day.) Fish, poultry, beans, and yogurt are good protein sources. You can also mix protein powder into smoothies, oatmeal, or a glass of water or milk.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/lending-a-helping-hand,Lending a helping hand,"The Greek philosopher Plato once said, ""Happiness springs from doing good and helping others.""
        Almost 2,500 years later, research shows that Plato was correct — people who devote time to helping others are often happier than those who don't.
        There are many ways lending a hand helps our minds and moods. One way is to turn our attention away from our own problems.
        ""Too much self-focused attention is linked with more negative thinking and a higher risk of anxiety and depression,"" says Robert Drozek, a psychotherapist with Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital who specializes in the use of ethics in psychotherapy. ""But serving redirects our energy and helps us realize that we have something to offer people, and they sometimes need our help.""
        Serving others helps brain health in other ways, too. It increases social connections, which can protect against loneliness and depression, and improves executive function skills like planning, attention, and remembering tasks. And when you help others, your brain releases feel-good chemicals like serotonin and dopamine.
        You don't need to devote much time to reap these benefits. A study in the August 2020 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that older adults who did any kind of service work for two hours a week felt more optimistic and had a greater sense of purpose compared with those who performed no service.
        How can you help yourself by helping others? Here are a few ways.
        Volunteering
        Volunteering provides a sense of purpose and an emotional boost as you support a cause or organization you believe in. You could also volunteer in professional fields or industries that match your life or work experience, like education, health care, or the arts.
        ""Volunteering in this way also offers opportunities to find structured and defined roles that fit your schedule, skills, and comfort levels,"" says Drozek.
        You can even volunteer from home. For instance, thanks to computers, being a ""virtual"" volunteer is common. You can provide administrative, accounting, or marketing assistance via computer or video chat. Telephones are still crucial for volunteer work. For example, you can make calls to help raise money for nonprofits, answer a hotline, or make check-in calls to homebound adults.
        
          
            
              
                Finding opportunities
                Search online for volunteering opportunities in your ZIP code on websites such as Volunteer Match (www.volunteermatch.org) or Idealist (www.idealist.org). You can look for local mentoring programs at the website of the National Mentoring Partnership (www.mentoring.org).
              
            
          
        
        Mentoring
        Mentors share their knowledge, wisdom, and experience with people who need direction. Many times, this is a child or young adult.
        A good place to begin is with a national program like Big Brothers, Big Sisters of America or the United Way. Also, many high schools, senior centers, churches, and faith-based organizations have mentoring opportunities. If you are more interested in sharing your professional expertise, contact your area Junior Achievement program or the local business community, or service clubs.
        Random acts of kindness
        Look for opportunities to serve others in daily life. For example, write to a friend saying you are thinking about them. Order takeout food for a neighbor. Send a gift in the mail. For an additional benefit, do the act anonymously, and don't tell anyone about it. ""This further takes the focus away from you and your worries,"" says Drozek.
        Different perspective
        An indirect way to serve others is to see things from their point of view. When you interact with someone — whether a friend, acquaintance, or stranger — focus the interaction entirely on the other person. What is going on with them? What issues do they face? Are they in pain or feeling conflict?
        Avoid injecting yourself — for instance, by describing how the same situation happened to you (unless they ask for feedback or advice).
        ""By lending an ear, you can provide emotional support they may need in that moment,"" says Drozek. ""Even if the exchange is generic and friendly, placing emphasis on the other person can boost their mood, and in the process, yours, too.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/overcoming-heart-health-obstacles,Overcoming heart health obstacles,"Prevention is the best medicine, but many men wait for a problem to arise before seeking help. For heart disease — the No. 1 cause of death among men — it could be runaway blood pressure, escalating cholesterol levels, or even a heart attack.
        Even when faced with the reality of heart disease, men often encounter obstacles that keep them from managing their condition or lowering their risk. What can they do?
        To find out, we asked two cardiologists — Dr. Haider Warraich and Dr. Dale Adler with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital — what they hear from their male patients and the advice they offer.
        Think about the future. During consultations, Dr. Warraich asks his patients about how they define longevity. ""When they reflect on what they hope to achieve as they age, most say they value a high quality of life and independent living rather than simply living a few years longer than normal,"" he says. Getting men to focus on their future helps them define goals and then determine if they are on the path to meet them. ""It helps them understand their shortcomings, like needing to be serious about weight loss or managing cholesterol, and can motivate them to make lasting changes,"" says Dr. Warraich.
        Monitor your blood pressure. Men sometimes don't feel in control of their heart health, says Dr. Warraich. One way they can play an active role is to regularly monitor their blood pressure. ""The heart health risks of high blood pressure are far-reaching, and even if men are not taking medication to manage high levels, keeping tabs on their numbers can be a proactive way to look out for potential problems,"" says Dr. Warraich. Men can easily do this by investing in a home blood pressure monitor. Record weekly readings and alert your doctor about sudden changes.
        Confront suspicions about medication. Dr. Adler has found that many men who need blood pressure medicine, statins to manage cholesterol, or other medications are hesitant to take them. ""They often focus too much on potential side effects and less on the benefits,"" he says. Much of this may reflect a general mistrust of medicine and the idea they have to take the pills indefinitely.
        But Dr. Adler says men can overcome this resistance by realizing they have a say in how the drugs are used. ""I tell my patients that by making diet and lifestyle changes, they can possibly take lower doses or even eventually stop taking them,"" he says. ""When they understand their power, they are more open to taking medication they need for better heart health.""
        Schedule time for health. Consistency is vital for maintaining heart-healthy exercise. But one of the top complaints Dr. Adler hears is lack of time. ""In general, men are receptive to routine and schedules, but they often don't do well when it gets disrupted,"" he says. Dr. Adler advises his patients to find a few blocks of time that work with their schedule and daily energy levels so they have multiple options. For instance, in the morning as soon as you wake up, or in the evening before dinner (exercise before a meal also curbs appetite).
        Also, treat workout sessions as critical meetings, and always have a backup plan in place. ""This way, if you miss your scheduled workout, you can automatically go to plan B."" For example, take a quick walk, do five minutes of squats and push-ups, or stop by the gym.
        Make weight loss a group effort. One of the greatest threats to heart health is weight gain. ""Weight loss is not easy, but studies have found that sharing your weight-loss efforts through friendly competitions or online community forums is a tool for staying motivated and overcoming setbacks,"" says Dr. Adler. You could also enlist friends and begin your own weight-loss club, where you share your daily or weekly weigh-ins, exchange tips and strategies, talk about challenges, and encourage each other.
        Learn portion control. ""People are generally not great at estimating food portions,"" says Dr. Adler. This is one reason weight-loss programs like Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers are effective, he adds. ""They give you the exact portions you are supposed to eat, which is what you need to feel satisfied.""
        He tells his patients trying to eat healthier or lose weight to always plan their meals in advance and get in the habit of measuring portions. ""This way, you can take the guesswork out of what to eat and avoid consuming extra calories.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/statin-alternative-lowers-heart-related-deaths,Statin alternative lowers heart-related deaths,"For people who can't take statin drugs, a cholesterol-lowering drug called bempedoic acid (Nexletol) can also lower the risk of heart attacks and related problems, a new study shows.
        Published July 11, 2023, in JAMA, the study included about 4,200 people with high LDL (bad) cholesterol who couldn't take statins because of side effects. Their average age was 68, and about two-thirds had diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to take either bempedoic acid or a placebo. Over a follow-up period of about 40 months, those taking the drug were 30% less likely to die of a heart-related condition, have a heart attack or stroke, or need an artery-opening stent compared with the people who took placebos. Bempedoic acid reduced LDL levels by 21%.
        About 5% to 10% of people who try statins have to stop taking them, mostly because of muscle-related symptoms. This problem is less likely with bempedoic acid, although the drug has other side effects, including a slightly increased risk of gout and gallstones. Still, bempedoic acid can be a good alternative for people at high risk of heart disease who can't take statins.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/higher-bmi-associated-with-greater-odds-of-joint-disease,Higher BMI associated with greater odds of joint disease,"A higher body mass index (BMI) is one of the major risk factors for developing osteoarthritis. But a new study suggests that carrying extra weight also makes it more likely a person will experience an inflammatory joint condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis.
        The study, published online May 23, 2023, by the journal Arthritis and Rheumatology, involved nearly 362,000 adults participating in the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database. Researchers analyzed how participants' BMI — a calculation of body size that considers height and weight — related to their likelihood of developing any of five joint conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and inflammatory spondylitis (a type of spinal arthritis). Other than osteoarthritis, most other joint diseases are driven by inflammation.
        Participants with higher BMIs (significantly greater than the ""normal"" BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9) had higher rates of rheumatoid arthritis (52%), osteoarthritis (49%), psoriatic arthritis (80%), gout (73%), and inflammatory spondylitis (34%) compared with people in the normal BMI range. Weight control can help reduce the risk of developing a joint disease, the study authors concluded.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/hormone-therapy-linked-to-higher-risks-of-gerd,Hormone therapy linked to higher risks of GERD,"Women who have used hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms may be more likely to develop gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, a new analysis suggests.
        The study, published online June 27, 2023, by the journal Menopause, analyzed data from five earlier studies involving more than one million women, none of whom had been diagnosed with GERD before the study's start. Researchers found that participants who were current or past users of hormone therapy for relieving menopausal symptoms were 29% more likely over all to develop GERD, which is characterized by heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and chest pain. Women who used estrogen alone had a 41% higher odds of GERD, while progesterone-only hormone therapy was linked to a 39% higher risk. Hormone therapy combining estrogen and progesterone was associated with only a 16% higher risk for GERD.
        The study was observational, meaning it couldn't prove that hormone therapy causes GERD, only that an association exists. Female hormones are believed to relax the muscles that control the lower esophageal sphincter (the valve between the bottom of the esophagus and top of the stomach), allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. Women considering hormone therapy should review their other risk factors for GERD and make necessary lifestyle changes to prevent it, including quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and not lying down after eating heavy meals, the study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-bumpy-truth,The bumpy truth,"Noticing a new lump or bump on your skin is never a happy discovery, especially if it's something unfamiliar — not your garden-variety wart, mole, or hives — and you're not sure whether to worry.
        Even the term ""lump"" or ""bump"" can be confusing. Located on or just under the skin, these growths can be almost flat or ""cause the skin to pooch out over them,"" says Dr. Rachel Reynolds, interim chair of dermatology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Beyond that, their characteristics run the gamut: soft and squishy or rock-hard, movable or fixed in place, round or irregularly shaped, or growing slowly or quickly.
        Regardless, they seldom signal something serious. ""People feel a lump and often immediately think it's cancer,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""But that's quite rare.""
        Most common types
        Aside from highly common basal and squamous cell skin cancers — which can appear as shiny or wartlike domes — the vast majority of other skin bumps are either epidermal cysts or lipomas, Dr. Reynolds says. What are their qualities?
        Epidermal cysts often appear on the face or back and ""may feel like a marble under the skin,"" she says. They grow as benign ""buds"" off hair follicles, filling with a cheesy protein called keratin. (Pilar cysts are another version, but on the scalp.) As they grow, epidermal cysts can become inflamed or infected.
        ""Sometimes, even after being present for many years, they act like a boil, enlarging and becoming red and tender,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""If that happens, see a doctor, since some will require drainage or antibiotics.""
        Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that often appear on the trunk or shoulders. They usually grow slowly and can run in families. ""You can't see most lipomas unless they get really big,"" she says. ""But if you are able to feel them, they're really squishy, without any sharp edges.""
        A lipoma can become uncomfortable if it presses on surrounding nerves. In this case, your doctor can remove it surgically or with liposuction, or dissolve it by injecting it with a drug called deoxycholic acid (Kybella).
        Diverse list
        Other types of skin growths are defined by a variety of diverse features.
        Cherry angiomas are smooth, red bumps representing an overgrowth of superficial blood vessels in the skin. They can range in size from a tiny dot to the diameter of a pencil eraser. Cherry angiomas tend to appear suddenly, especially on the torso, and are more common in people over 40.
        Dermatofibromas are small, firm, brown or pink spots that contain scar tissue, sometimes appearing after a skin injury or insect bite. They might itch or pucker inward if you pinch them, but they aren't painful.
        Keloids occur when scar tissue continues to grow beyond an injured area. These large bumps aren't harmful, although ""they can become itchy and unsightly,"" she says.
        Sarcomas are cancerous tumors that can appear deceptively similar to cysts or lipomas, but typically grow more quickly. ""A sarcoma may feel firmer under the skin, but not like a marble, as an epidermal cyst does,"" Dr. Reynolds says. ""It's a little more ill-defined, and sometimes it's painful."" If the lump hurts even when it's left alone, that's a particularly concerning sign.
        When to act
        While sarcomas are one of the few types of skin lumps that are dangerous, Dr. Reynolds urges caution about any lump appearing near lymph nodes — immune system nodules located in the armpits, groin, and neck. While lymph nodes can enlarge from a cold or other infection, swollen nodes sometimes signal cancer. Other symptoms might also be present, including weight loss, fever, and chills.
        ""Get checked,"" she says. ""Some lymph nodes become temporarily inflamed, enlarge, and then go back down, but it's something that should be monitored.""
        A dermatologist can usually diagnose a skin bump or lump on sight alone. Occasionally, imaging tests or a biopsy may be needed to determine the culprit. You can be proactive by doing the following:
        Pointing it out. At your next primary care appointment, ask your doctor to take a look. ""Seek a more urgent visit if something is growing quickly, bleeding, feels painful, looks infected, or is red or tender,"" Dr. Reynolds says.
        Speaking up. Your doctor might not focus on a benign bump unless you mention that it's painful, irritating, or cosmetically unappealing.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/staying-in-shape-a-case-of-use-it-or-lose-it,"Staying in shape: A case of ""use it or lose it""","Everybody needs a little time away — from jobs, people, and even exercise. But if you've stayed fit and strong from diligent, regular workouts, it's astonishing how quickly it can all slip away if you take weeks or months off, either voluntarily or because of illness or injury.
        Beyond losing exercise's immediate benefits — including sounder sleep and stress relief — the disadvantages of stopping become rapidly apparent. The phenomenon is called deconditioning, and it happens to both recreational exercisers and elite athletes. Certain factors influence how quickly you'll lose strength and endurance — including age, prior fitness level, and any medical conditions — but it's universal, says Dr. Beth Frates, a clinical assistant professor in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School.
        ""It will happen no matter who you are,"" Dr. Frates says. ""We say exercise is medicine, and it's true. When you take the medicine — or in this case, do the exercise — you reap the benefits. But it's 'use it or lose it.'""
        Endurance and strength suffer
        What does it mean to lose fitness, and how quickly does it erode? That depends on the category.
        Cardiovascular fitness is the fastest to decline. Within just a few days of our last aerobic exercise session, our hearts pump less blood around the body, and the blood that's circulating to cells and muscles contains less oxygen. Only a few weeks later, you'll find yourself huffing and puffing to complete the same brisk walk, cycling route, or swim routine you'd once done with ease. Your heart might be pounding, too.
        ""Perhaps you'll notice that you can't talk while you're walking up that hill like you did four weeks ago,"" Dr. Frates says. ""Something that was moderate-intensity exercise for you before is now vigorous, and you might feel like stopping earlier.""
        Muscle strength takes longer to lose after you've been inactive — about two months. You won't be able to lift as much or do as many repetitions as before your hiatus. The same weights or body-resistance exercises will prove far more fatiguing, and your muscles will likely feel extremely sore within a day of working out again.
        The good news? ""Muscle memory"" is real, meaning shrunken muscle fibers can indeed rebound, Dr. Frates says. ""You can get back to muscle strengthening a little more quickly than you can get back to the same level of cardiovascular conditioning,"" she says.
        Staging your comeback
        The first step in getting fit again is believing you can do it. There's no question it will get harder before it gets easier, Dr. Frates says.
        ""No one has a precise equation for how long it will take a particular person to regain fitness,"" she says. ""The longer you were away from it, the longer it will take. It will not happen immediately — it will take at least several weeks.""
        Dr. Frates offers this guidance for safely rebooting your exercise routine:
        Get your doctor's okay. This is crucial if you haven't exercised in a long time — many months or years — or have chronic conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. And if you experience any alarming symptoms when first exercising again, such as chest pain or pressure, stop immediately and seek medical attention.
        Start small. Instead of reverting to your toughest workouts, try lighter activities or weight levels to get comfortably moving again. ""Don't go off and do sprints at the track on your first day,"" she says. ""Build up slowly. Even taking a walk can help.""
        Do what worked before. Perhaps you felt on top of your fitness when you took group classes or biked dozens of miles a week. So ease into doing it again. ""Think back to when you were routine-consistent and successful and consider using a similar strategy this time around,"" Dr. Frates says.
        Channel your inner kid. We learned as children that movement can be fun. If you loved hula-hooping or paddle-boarding when you were younger, consider returning to it.
        Set up a support system. Accountability partners aren't a new idea, but they work — which is why getting an exercise buddy should be top of mind when you're resuming a regimen. If you don't have a ready workout buddy, consider working with a health coach.
        Track your progress. Wearable devices can fuel renewed exercise efforts by tracking step count, resting heart rate, and other metrics. But an old-school pen and paper log can also do the trick. ""You can look at how you did and make adjustments,"" she says. ""If Week 1 doesn't go the way you wanted, there's no shame or guilt. This is definitely a case where some exercise is better than none.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/mastering-memory-maintenance,Mastering memory maintenance,"You know something's important to you when you can't seem to get it out of your mind. For many of us as we age, staying sharp seems to be that thing — a priority that becomes increasingly pressing as we hear frightening projections that dementia will affect nine million Americans ages 65 and older by 2030 and 12 million by 2040.
        ""There's more focus on this now because medical science has done a relatively good job of treating heart disease and cancer, but made fewer strides in addressing memory disorders such as dementia,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. ""I think more people are worried about this than ever.""
        But concern need not feed a sense of helplessness. Indeed, research is revealing we may possess more power against brain decline than once believed. A large new study zeroes in on the potent influence a healthy lifestyle exerts on memory maintenance, even in older adults with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia.
        ""Just because you have a family history of a medical condition or neurocognitive disorder like dementia doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be stricken with it,"" says Lydia Cho, a neuropsychologist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""Our genetics don't completely define our physical and neurocognitive health. We have a choice for how to improve our bodies and minds to live the healthiest life we can.""
        Healthy habits matter
        The new study, published online Jan. 25, 2023, by The BMJ, involved more than 29,000 people in China without dementia (average age 72). Participants initially underwent cognitive testing, as well as genetic testing a variant of the APOE gene, APOE4, which is known to raise the risk for Alzheimer's.
        Participants also reported how stringently they stuck to six good lifestyle habits: eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, not smoking, not drinking alcohol, being socially active, and engaging in brain-challenging activities. Over the next 10 years, participants periodically reported their lifestyle habits and had additional cognitive tests.
        By the study's end, people who stuck with at least four healthy habits exhibited significantly slower memory decline than those who didn't practice any healthy habits — and this was true even among participants with the Alzheimer's-related gene.
        Dr. Budson wasn't surprised by the findings, noting that earlier studies reported similar results. ""But I'm thrilled that additional evidence has shown that by making these healthy lifestyle changes, people really are able to reduce their risk of developing dementia,"" he says. ""I think the study's message is clear: your fate, to a large extent, is in your own hands.""
        The central six
        Let's dissect the six lifestyle habits that appear to stem memory decline and why practicing each is important to our brain health.
        1. Eat a healthy diet. Doing so reduces the risk of clots and other blood vessel problems in the brain, thereby cutting the risk of stroke — the second leading cause of memory problems. ""What's bad for the brain? One important example is eating simple sugars and carbohydrates in processed foods, which causes glucose and insulin spikes that can damage brain cells,"" Dr. Budson says.
        2. Exercise regularly. Defined in the study as at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, consistent exercise boosts brain health through two pathways: reducing the risk of stroke and generating growth factors that help spawn new brain cells. ""Plus, there are more new brain cells produced in a structure called the hippocampus — which is critical for learning and memory — than in any other part of the brain,"" Dr. Budson says.
        3. Don't smoke. ""By not smoking, you're doing two very important things: reducing the risk of stroke and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of your red blood cells,"" Dr. Budson says.
        4. Limit drinking. ""There's no evidence that having a single alcoholic beverage a day causes permanent damage to the brain, but there's increasing evidence that having more than one drink per day can,"" Dr. Budson says. ""We all should be aware that with even a single drink, our memory performance will simply not be as good as if we abstained.""
        5. Stay socially active. This can mean regularly visiting friends or relatives, attending parties, participating in meetings, traveling, and chatting online. (See ""Enjoy time online? It may stave off dementia."") Scientists don't fully understand why this tactic keeps brains healthier. ""I think it's because social interactions activate very large areas of the brain,"" Dr. Budson says. ""It's important to keep your mind active, and social interactions are truly one of the best ways to do that.""
        6. Challenge your brain. This can include both fun pursuits and more serious ones — reading, writing, playing chess and card games, taking a course, learning a new language, and the like. ""Crossword puzzles are especially good because they force people to think about concepts and the relationships between words and ideas in new, flexible, creative ways,"" Dr. Budson says.
        
          
            
              
                Enjoy time online? It may be linked to lower dementia risk
                Whiling away a few hours online by posting on social media, playing games, and surfing websites can certainly feel relaxing. But if you're wary that it's just a time sink, think again: using the Internet regularly may be linked to a lower risk of dementia, according to a new observational study.
                The study, published online May 3, 2023, by the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, tracked more than 18,000 people (average age 55, 54% women) for an average of eight years. Every other year, researchers asked participants about their Internet use and administered cognitive testing. Nearly 65% of study participants reported being regular Internet users.
                People who connected online for about two hours a day were about half as likely to develop dementia than those who didn't use the Internet regularly. The Internet users also maintained better verbal reasoning and memory. The benefits disappeared at high levels of Internet use — defined as six to eight hours a day.
                The study authors speculated that online engagement could develop and maintain what's called cognitive reserve — the brain's ability to resist decline and find alternate ways to function efficiently. This could compensate for brain aging. But the study was observational — meaning it couldn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between Internet use and dementia risk — and participants' Internet use was self-reported.
                ""If we take the findings at face value, this would mean Internet use is another cognitive activity that can keep your brain active and healthy, which can potentially increase thinking and memory skills in the short term and reduce the risk of dementia over the long term,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School. More study is needed to determine if specific types of online activity might be related to health outcomes.

In fact, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) echoes the dietary guidelines recommended for the general public: A diet centered on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (peas and beans), and low-fat dairy products.
        How carbs fit in
        However, you'll want to pay special attention to your carbohydrate intake. For most people with diabetes, carbohydrates should account for about 45% to 55% of the total calories you eat each day.
        Make sure you choose your carbohydrates wisely — ideally, from vegetables, whole grains, and fruits.
        Try to avoid highly refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta, and rice, as well as candy, sugary soft drinks, and sweets. Refined carbohydrates tend to cause sharp spikes in blood sugar, and can boost blood triglyceride levels.
        The facts on fiber
        Vegetables, fruits, and whole grains not only provide more nutrition per calorie than refined carbohydrates, they also tend to be rich in fiber. Your body digests high-fiber foods more slowly — which means a more moderate rise in blood sugar.
        Fiber comes in two forms: insoluble fiber, the kind found in whole grains, and soluble fiber, found in beans, dried peas, oats, and fruits. Soluble fiber in particular appears to lower blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity, which may mean you need less diabetes medicine.
        In addition, a number of studies suggest that eating plenty of fiber reduces the chances of developing heart disease — and people with diabetes need to do all they can to lower their risk.

Mediterranean-style diets emphasize healthy fats and healthy carbs.
        Saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol are the bad guys. Good fats are monounsaturated (found in olive oil, for example) and polyunsaturated (found in such foods as fish, canola oil, and walnuts). The Mediterranean diet advocated by Mollie Katzen and Harvard professor Walter Willett in Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less has a moderate amount of fat, but much of it comes from healthful monounsaturated fats and unsaturated omega-3 fats. It is high in carbohydrates, but most of the carbs come from unrefined, fiber-rich foods. It is also high in fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, and fish, with only modest amounts of meat and cheese.
        People living in Mediterranean countries have a lower-than-expected rate of heart disease. But the traditional lifestyle in the region also includes lots of physical activity, regular meal patterns, wine, and good social support. It's hard to know what relative role these different factors play — but there is growing evidence that in and of itself, the Mediterranean diet can reduce cardiovascular risk and the development of diabetes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/is-your-daily-nap-doing-more-harm-than-good,Is your daily nap doing more harm than good?,"A midday snooze can be helpful, but the need for one might signal chronic sleep deprivation.
        
        
          
        
        In many cultures, napping in the afternoon is not only common, but a regular part of daily life. In the United States, as many as a third of adults regularly partake in a midday catnap, according to the National Sleep Foundation.
        If you are in good health, these short daytime sleeps can bring benefits: helping you catch up on a late night, making you feel less cranky, or ensuring you're well rested if you do a job that falls outside traditional daytime work hours. They can also keep you safe on the road, protecting you from drowsy-driving accidents.
        ""In addition to reducing sleepiness, naps have been shown to improve memory in the laboratory setting.
        But the research on napping isn't all rosy.
        There have been some large epidemiology studies that have suggested both benefits and harms with napping on a population level. It is difficult to draw conclusions on the individual level.
        The pros and cons of naps
        For example, some studies have found that adults who take long naps during the day may be more likely to have conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and depression. The urge to sleep during the day may be a sign that they are not getting enough sleep at night, which is associated with a higher risk of developing those chronic conditions. Daytime drowsiness may also be a sign that you are getting low-quality sleep, which may indicate a sleep disorder.
        In some instances, napping sets up a vicious cycle. You sleep during the day to make up for lost sleep at night, but then you have a harder time falling asleep at night because you slept during the day.
        Limiting naps is one potential strategy to improve overall nighttime sleep.
        How to nap well
        If you do plan to take a nap during the day, here are some guidelines you can follow to help ensure that it won't interfere with your nighttime slumber.
        Time it right. The best time to sleep is the early afternoon, when your body experiences a natural circadian dip. If you take a nap in the late afternoon or evening, it will likely be harder to fall asleep later.
        Keep it short. Abbreviated sleeps, around 20 minutes, may be best to avoid grogginess when you wake up. Shorter naps can also help to prevent you from having trouble falling asleep that evening. Time it right by setting an alarm.
        Get comfortable. For a high-quality rest, be sure to find a quiet, cozy spot where you won't be distracted.
        Examine your motivation. If you need to nap during the day, it is important to assess why you may be sleepy enough to fall asleep during the day, especially if you nap regularly. Track how much sleep you are getting at night. If you aren't getting enough, try to improve your sleep habits (see ""Tips for better nighttime sleep""). If you are already getting at least seven or more hours of sleep at night and are still tired during the day, discuss this with your doctor.
        
          
            
              
                Tips for better nighttime sleep
                If you find yourself tossing and turning at night, here are some strategies you can use to rest more soundly.
                Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.
                Avoid alcohol and caffeine late in the day. These can both interfere with sleep quality.
                Turn off electronics at least one hour before bedtime. Blue light from screens, such as your television or phone, can make it harder for you to fall asleep. So shut them down at least an hour before you turn in.
                Exercise regularly. Daily workouts during the day can help promote better nighttime sleep.
                Set the stage. You'll get the best sleep if your room is cool, dark, and quiet.
                Be alert to signs of a sleep disorder. Pay a visit to your doctor if you are sleeping for the recommended seven to eight hours a night and are still feeling fatigued.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/barium-swallow-upper-gastrointestinal-series-or-upper-gi-series-a-to-z,Barium swallow (upper gastrointestinal series or upper GI series),"What is the test?
        A barium swallow, or upper GI series, is an x-ray test used to examine the upper digestive tract (the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine). Because these organs are normally not visible on x-rays, you need to swallow barium, a liquid that does show up on x-rays. The barium temporarily coats the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and intestine, making the outline of these organs visible on the x-ray pictures. This test is useful to help evaluate potential problems in the esophagus, stomach and first part of the intestine. Images may suggest conditions such as an ulcer, narrowing of the esophagus, or an abnormal mass that could be a benign tumor or cancer,
        How do I prepare for the test?
        Tell your doctor and the x-ray technicians if there is any chance you could be pregnant. If you have diabetes or take an SGLT2 inhibitor for weight loss, let your doctor know because medication adjustment may be necessary prior to the test.
        Stop eating and drinking the night before your test. This is important because food in your stomach or intestine could prevent the doctors from seeing a clear outline of these structures on the x-rays. Usually it isn't a problem for you to take most of your regular pills, but you should check with your doctor.
        What happens when the test is performed?
        You wear a hospital gown for the test. At the start of the test, you drink barium, a liquid that looks like a milk shake but does not taste nearly as good (most patients say it tastes like chalk). You might also be asked to swallow some tablets that ""fizz,"" causing air-bubbles to be released in your stomach. This might make you feel like burping, but try not to. You will get better pictures if you can keep yourself from burping.
        The x-ray technician may ask you to stand or lie in different positions over the next few minutes, to help spread around the liquid you have swallowed. Most often, the x-ray pictures are taken while you lie on your back on a table. The x-ray machine or the table is moved a few times so it can take pictures of all of the internal structures. You are asked to hold your breath for each picture so that your breathing movement does not blur the image.
        What risks are there from the test?
        There are no significant risks. You are exposed to a small amount of radiation during the test, but the amount of radiation is too small to be likely to cause any health problems.
        Must I do anything special after the test is over?
        After the test, you can eat normally and do your normal activities. You should drink more water than usual to help clear out the barium and to prevent constipation, which might be a side effect of the test. Your stool may appear light in color for a couple of days.
        How long is it before the result of the test is known?
        Typically you can get the results within a day or two.",Unknown,"September 21, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/when-and-how-should-you-be-screened-for-colon-cancer-202309202975,When — and how — should you be screened for colon cancer?,"Colon cancer is the second-deadliest form of cancer after lung cancer. If recent messages about colon cancer screening have left you a little confused, that's understandable. In August, the American College of Physicians (ACP) released updated guidance for colon cancer screening that differs from other major organizations, including recommendations from the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the US Preventive Services Task force (USPSTF).

So, what do you need to know?

How does the advice differ?

First, please note that this advice applies only to people at average risk without a family history of colon cancer. If you have family history, or if other health issues put you at higher-than-average risk for colorectal cancer, talk to your doctor about the best course of action for you.

The main point of disagreement relates to the age at which people should start getting screened. The new ACP guidance says 50, while the other two organizations recommend 45. That earlier age is endorsed by the U.S. Multisociety Task Force on Colorectal Cancer. It's also endorsed by many physicians, including Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Andrew T. Chan, a gastroenterologist and director of epidemiology at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, who helps explain key facts below.

Why do experts suggest starting screening earlier?

""We're facing an unexplained and alarming increase in the incidence of colon cancer in people younger than 50,"" says Dr. Chan.

Overall, deaths from colon cancer dropped by 2% per year from 2011 to 2020. But that's not the case among people younger than 50. In that age group, deaths from colon cancer rose between 0.5% and 3% during the same time period, according to statistics published in 2023.

The rising rates of colon cancer in younger people are occurring in all racial and ethnic groups, with the steepest rises seen among Alaskan Natives and Native Americans. Overall, Blacks and African Americans are more likely to get and die from colon cancer than whites, and early-onset cases are higher in Black individuals than whites.

Efforts to encourage colon cancer screening began in the mid-1990s. Today, about 60% of adults over 50 follow the advice to receive a colonoscopy (described below) on a regular basis. This track record, while not perfect, likely explains the decline in deaths from colon cancer in older adults.

""I think that promoting earlier screening will help stem the rise in early-onset cases, at least for those in their 40s. We've also seen that earlier colonoscopies may be associated with lowering incidence of colon cancer even later in life, ""says Dr. Chan.

What are the different screening tests for colon cancer?

The two most widely used screening tests are a standard colonoscopy and various stool-based tests.

Colonoscopy. For this test, a gastroenterologist or surgeon snakes a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end through your rectum and beyond to inspect the entire length of your colon. Considered the gold-standard test, this procedure can detect precancerous polyps called adenomas, and allow for their removal.

The test requires taking laxatives and drinking lots of fluids beforehand to clean all the fecal material (stool) out of your colon. Serious complications, which include perforation or bleeding, are rare, occurring in about three in 1,000 procedures. If no polyps are found, a repeat colonoscopy isn't recommended for another 10 years. If you have polyps, or your risk or symptoms change, this interval will be shorter.

Stool tests. The more worrisome colon polyps (adenomas) often shed tiny amounts of blood and abnormal DNA into the stool. This can be detected from samples you collect yourself at home.


	Two tests, the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical test (FIT), check for blood. They require small stool samples that you put on a card or in a tube that's then mailed to a lab. These tests should be done every year.
	A third option, the FIT-DNA test, checks for both blood and abnormal DNA; it's usually repeated every three years.


Additionally, the guidelines from the American College of Physicians suggest another option: flexible sigmoidoscopy, which inspects only the lower part of the colon, once every 10 years, combined with a fecal FIT testing every two years. However, doctors in the United States rarely order sigmoidoscopy today.

If flexible sigmoidoscopy or any of these stool tests show evidence of a problem, a colonoscopy is needed to check for adenomas or cancer.

Why might stool-based screening make sense for younger adults?

Colonoscopy isn't necessarily the best initial screening test for everyone, says Dr. Chan. That's especially true for younger people, mainly because it's time-consuming and inconvenient.

""Maybe you just can't find time in your schedule or are worried about having a colonoscopy,"" he says. If that's the case, a stool-based test — which is noninvasive and takes very little time — is an appropriate option.

""The worst option is not doing anything, because early detection and treatment can prevent deaths,"" he says.",Julie Corliss,"September 20, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/got-expendable-body-parts-202309182974,7 organs or glands you may do just fine without,"There was a time when pediatricians routinely recommended tonsil removal, even for healthy children — including me. As far as I can tell, I suffered no ill effects — plus, I got extra ice cream!
        That practice is no longer routine. But it does raise an interesting question: Why do we have body parts that can be safely removed? If they're not needed, why do humans have them in the first place?
        One theory is that these nonessential organs and glands once served important roles in the lives of our evolutionary ancestors but now represent anatomic remnants. For example, it was long thought that the appendix helped our predecessors digest food, but over thousands of years became obsolete. And some organs are supremely useful during certain stages of life, but then become expendable.
        Seven (mostly) unnecessary body parts
        Here are seven removable parts of the body:
        Appendix
        This organ is about the size of your little finger and hangs from the lower right side of your colon. For reasons that aren't clear, this part of the intestinal tract sometimes becomes blocked, infected, or inflamed. Aptly enough, the word appendicitis means inflammation of the appendix. While it may settle down with antibiotic treatment, emergency surgical removal (an appendectomy) is often necessary.
        Tonsils
        A network of lymph nodes throughout the body is part of the immune surveillance system that helps trap dangerous invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Consider your two tonsils as larger, specialized lymph nodes watching out for these intruders. They are located at the back of the throat just to the sides of and behind the uvula, the dangling piece of tissue above them.
        Now, removing the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is only recommended for people with repeated bouts of bacterial throat infections such as strep throat, a condition common in children. Once removed, other lymphoid tissue, including the actual lymph nodes, can take over the job of the tonsils.
        Adenoids
        Situated in the back of the nose where the nasal passages meet the mouth and throat, adenoids are similar to tonsils. They can also become inflamed, infected, and swollen. So when the tonsils are removed, the adenoids are generally removed at the same time. The combined procedure is called tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. As is true for the tonsils, other lymphoid tissue takes over when the adenoids are gone.
        Gallbladder
        The gallbladder sits just under the liver in the upper right part of the abdomen. It stores bile made in the liver and releases it into the digestive tract when needed to help digest fatty foods. The gallbladder may need to be removed (a cholecystectomy) if it becomes inflamed, a condition called cholecystitis. Most often this occurs due to infection or gallstones, which are a hardened collection of bile. In some cases, rest and antibiotics can control gallbladder inflammation so removal can be delayed or even avoided.
        Uterus
        This remarkable reproductive organ has a single purpose: to support fetal growth until birth. When necessary, the uterus can generally be removed (hysterectomy) without impairing health. Common reasons for removal include painful or excessive menstruation, benign growths called fibroids that cause pain or bleeding, or cancer.
        Thymus gland
        This small gland sits high in the upper chest behind the breastbone. In a fetus or newborn, it's quite important in the development and maturation of the immune system. But adults can live well without it. Surgery to remove the thymus (a thymectomy) may be recommended if the thymus becomes cancerous, or if a person develops the autoimmune condition myasthenia gravis.
        Spleen
        Like adenoids and tonsils, the spleen is made up of lymphoid tissue. It filters the blood, removing infectious organisms, aging blood cells, and other abnormal cells traveling through the bloodstream. But sometimes the spleen becomes overactive and begins removing healthy cells.
        For example, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) may develop when platelets (clotting blood cells that prevent excessive bleeding) are removed from circulation. With few platelets left in the bloodstream, bruising and bleeding may be life-threatening. Although medications can help, removal of the spleen (a splenectomy) may be necessary. Or sometimes trauma to the spleen, especially after sports injuries and car accidents, causes internal bleeding, which may lead to splenectomy.
        People who lack a spleen are more prone to certain infections, so if removal isn't urgent, a number of vaccinations are recommended before splenectomy.
        The bottom line
        I've heard it said that at least half of all body parts are unnecessary. That's a myth. But as with most myths, there is some truth to it: there are indeed many body parts that can be safely removed. That said, it's generally best to avoid unnecessary surgery and keep the parts you were born with if you can.
        Sure, you can survive and thrive despite having your appendix removed. But it's worth keeping in mind that our understanding about so-called spare parts may change over time. The appendix is a good example: researchers have discovered that the appendix may play a role in immune development and stores ""good bacteria"" to repopulate the gut in case of future illness. And there is evidence that removing the thymus may slightly increase the risk of cancer, autoimmune disorders, and death.

        If you've got a vomiting kid, you don't need to rush out to the drugstore and buy those oral rehydration solutions. Just add some water to the juice you have in the refrigerator, and you're all set.
        That's the bottom line of a study published in JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical Association). Researchers studied about 600 children who came to the emergency room with stomach flu and minimal dehydration. Half of them were given dilute apple juice, and half were given an oral rehydration electrolyte solution (like Pedialyte), colored to look like apple juice and sweetened to make it taste better. The families whose children got the apple juice were told to give them whatever fluids they would take once they got home, while the ones who got the electrolyte solution were told to continue giving the solution at home.
        The children that got apple juice were less likely to need intravenous fluids or end up back in the emergency room.
        There are a few reasons why doctors have recommended the special solutions. The major reason is that they worry that fluids that have a lot of sugar in them, like juice or Gatorade, can worsen diarrhea. The other reason is that when you have a lot of vomiting or diarrhea, you can lose electrolytes like sodium that are crucial for your body's function. And certainly, in children with severe dehydration or in very small infants, these are real worries.
        But for the average child sick with stomach flu who has only mild dehydration, these aren't big worries. Those kids generally do just fine as long as they get fluids into them — pretty much any fluids. And as any parent knows, kids are most likely to drink fluids that are familiar to them, and that taste good. Solutions like Pedialyte are not familiar to most children — and while they don't taste bad, they can have an odd taste that many children don't like.
        Here are some important tips when giving fluids to children with vomiting and diarrhea:
        
          Start with clear fluids, like the diluted apple juice used in the study. Once they are keeping that down well, you can try milk or other fluids.
          The ""dilute"" part is also a good place to start. A little extra water, and a little less sugar, is easier on the stomach. Once they are keeping fluids down, it's less important to add the water.
          When children are vomiting, give them little bits at a time (an ounce or two) to be sure it stays down. Sometimes kids will be thirsty and want to take more — but their stomach can't handle it yet. Keep giving the small amounts until they are keeping fluids down.
        
        If your child can't keep anything down or is having repeated diarrhea, goes more than 6 hours without urinating, seems excessively tired to you, has a high fever, or has really bad pain of any kind, call your doctor. You should also call for advice if your child is less than 6 months old or has any ongoing medical problems.

          Q.
          I have about three episodes of heartburn per month and it often lasts all day. What do you suggest?
        
        A. Heartburn is caused by stomach acid moving up and out of the stomach and into the lower part of the esophagus. Reducing the overall acidity in the stomach protects the esophagus from irritation when the stomach contents back up (reflux).
        The fastest treatment is to neutralize the acid already in the stomach and lower esophagus by taking an over-the-counter antacid. While antacids work within minutes, they often don't last, so you may have to take repeated doses until symptoms subside.
        For longer-lasting relief, you can try an H2 blocker, which stops stomach cells from making acid. There are several over-the-counter brands of H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and ranitidine (Zantac). Generic versions also are available. H2 blockers come as a pill, liquid, or chewable or effervescent tablet. Most people react well to all of them.
        H2 blockers begin to act within an hour and last for another 10 to 12 hours. (If you still need the occasional antacid, wait 30 to 60 minutes after taking one before adding an H2 blocker.) Proton-pump inhibitors are even stronger acid blockers. Over-the-counter brands include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24HR), omeprazole (Losec, Omesec, Prilosec OTC), and omeprazole with sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid). If your heartburn doesn't respond to these drugs or lasts for more than 10 days, see your doctor.

        We all benefit from inflammation, the process by which our immune system detects and disables foreign molecules or microbes. Although we may not enjoy the runny nose and scratchy throat of a winter cold—the signs of our immune system at work—inflammation eventually rids us of the virus responsible. However, when inflammation persists at low levels after the invader is eradicated, it can become our enemy. Many major diseases that plague us—including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, depression, and Alzheimer's—have been linked to chronic inflammation.
        Our diets play an important role in chronic inflammation because our digestive bacteria release chemicals that may spur or suppress inflammation. The types of bacteria that populate our gut and their chemical byproducts vary according to the foods we eat. Some foods encourage the grow of populations of bacteria that stimulate inflammation, while others promote the growth of bacteria that suppress it.
        That's why one of the most powerful tools to combat inflammation comes not from the pharmacy, but from the produce counter. Many experimental studies have shown that components of foods or beverages may have anti-inflammatory effects.

                    Chronic inflammation plays a central role in some of the most challenging diseases of our time, including rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, and even Alzheimer’s. This report will examine the role that chronic inflammation plays in these conditions, and will also provide information on the breadth of drugs currently available to alleviate symptoms. Drug choices range from simple aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that’s been available for more than a century, to disease-modifying drugs and so-called biologics that promise more targeted treatments.

Choose the right foods, and you may be able to reduce your risk of illness. Consistently pick the wrong ones, and you may promote chronic inflammation, which sets the stage for a host of degenerative diseases
        
          Inflammation-promoting foods
          Not surprisingly, the foods that contribute to inflammation are the same ones generally considered bad for our health, including sodas and refined carbohydrates, as well as red meat and processed meats.
          Some of the foods that have been associated with an increased risk for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease are also associated with excess inflammation. It's not surprising, since inflammation is an important underlying mechanism for the development of these diseases.
          Such unhealthy foods are also likely to contribute to weight gain, which is itself a risk factor for inflammation. Yet in several studies, even after researchers took obesity into account, the link between foods and inflammation remained, which suggests weight gain isn't the sole driver. Mounting evidence suggests that certain components or ingredients in processed foods, like the emulsifiers added to ice cream, may have independent effects on inflammation.
        
        
          Inflammation-fighting foods
          Fortunately, you are probably already enjoying many of the foods and beverages that have been found to reduce the risk of inflammation, and with it, chronic disease. They include the following:
          Fruits and vegetables. Most fruits brightly colored vegetables contain high levels of natural antioxidants and polyphenols—protective compounds found in plants.
          Nuts and seeds. Studies have also associated nuts and seeds with reduced markers of inflammation and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
          Beverages. The polyphenols in coffee and the flavonols in cocoa are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea is rich in both polyphenols and antioxidants.
        
        
          Anti-inflammatory eating
          It's best to focus on an overall healthy diet rather than singling out individual ""good"" and ""bad"" foods, so you won't need bookkeeping software to balance your intake of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory foods. In general, a healthy diet means one high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and healthy oils. If your plate is dominated by unprocessed plant-based foods and bursting with color, you're on the right track.
          In addition to lowering inflammation, a more natural, less processed diet can have noticeable effects on your physical and emotional health. A healthy diet is beneficial not only for reducing the risk of chronic diseases, but also for improving your mood and your overall quality of life.",Unknown,"September 18, 2023",1

But if things change, home remedies often help.

        You received good news after your last colonoscopy: no cancer or precancerous polyps. But with the good news came with another finding: though you don't have symptoms, you do have diverticulosis and hemorrhoids. The news may be puzzling, but don't worry. Both conditions are common and usually don't cause any problems.
        
          Diverticulosis
        
        Diverticulosis is the term used to describe the presence of diverticula — pouch-like structures that sometimes form in the muscular wall of the colon and bulge outward. Between 40% and 60% of people have them, and they get more common as we age. They tend to cluster in the sigmoid colon, just above the rectum.
        Diverticulosis only causes symptoms if one of the diverticula bleeds or gets infected. When bleeding does occur, it tends to be intense for a short period, but usually stops on its own. We don't know the cause of the diverticular bleeding, only that something injures a blood vessel in the pouch. Even if bleeding stops on its own, you can still lose a considerable amount of blood, so you should see a doctor.
        In some people, diverticula can get infected. That's called diverticulitis. It's not clear why or how diverticulitis develops. Age, obesity, a lack of exercise, and a low-fiber diet are risk factors for the condition. 
        Typical symptoms of diverticulitis include lower abdominal pain, more often on the left side; fever; and change in bowel habits, either loose stools or constipation. Mild cases might not even need antibiotics. But most often doctors will treat will oral antibiotics initially to prevent it from getting worse. People with more severe disease, such as an abscess (pocket of infection) or pus that needs drainage, often need hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics.
        
          Preventing problems
        
        It's not clear yet if we can prevent diverticulosis or diverticulitis. Exercising, controlling your weight, and eating less red meat and more fiber may help. Some data suggest that more fiber reduces the risk of both developing diverticula and getting symptoms if you already have them.
        Adults should get 25 to 30 grams of dietary fiber every day from foods such as beans, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. A fiber supplement may also help. But add fiber to your diet slowly, since you can get gas and bloating if you increase your fiber intake too fast.
        What about the warning that eating foods with small seeds can add to diverticulitis risk? There used to be a theory that seeds, nuts, and popcorn increased the risk of diverticulosis and diverticulitis, because they might lodge in the pouches and cause irritation or infection. However, that's never been proved. Seeds and nuts are an important source of fiber.
        
          Hemorrhoids
        
        Hemorrhoids have a bad rap, but we all have these pillow-like clusters of veins in the lining of the lower part of the rectum and anus, which help play a role in preventing stool leakage. When they become enlarged, however, they are anything but helpful and can even contribute to some leakage in addition to pain, itching, and bleeding.
        What causes hemorrhoids to swell? The veins are anchored by connective tissue. If the tissue is weakened, the hemorrhoids bulge out. The weakened tissue may be caused by a combination of genetics and pressure from sitting on a toilet too long or straining to have a bowel movement. Pregnancy is also a common trigger.
        When hemorrhoids in the lower rectum (internal hemorrhoids) swell, they may bleed, and you may see bright red blood in the toilet. But you won't feel the hemorrhoids unless they extend beyond the anus and become itchy.
        The hemorrhoids most people complain about (called external hemorrhoids) are located outside the anus. If they become swollen, the overlying skin becomes irritated, erodes, and may itch or hurt. A clot can form inside the hemorrhoid, which can be very painful.
        
          Treatment and prevention
        
        Hemorrhoids are typically diagnosed from a medical history and physical exam. Home remedies are usually effective to treat external hemorrhoids. Sitting in a warm bath may help soothe an irritated hemorrhoid. And lifestyle changes can also make a difference. Avoid sitting and straining on the toilet for long periods, and make sure stool moves along. He suggests increasing dietary fiber intake; using stool softener, such as docusate (Colace); or using a gentle laxative if you're constipated, such as polyethylene glycol 3350 (Miralax).
        Internal hemorrhoids that are bothersome are usually resolved with minimally invasive procedures performed in a doctor's office.",Unknown,"September 18, 2023",1

        Plan for a soft landing
        Simple trips over curbs or small objects—often our own shoes or clothing—are common occurrences. Aside from taking the steps to prevent them, when you feel yourself going down, you can take control of your fall. Fall prevention courses may be available in your community. These courses that will show you not only how to prevent falls but how to fall safely. You can also try the following techniques.
        Think of yourself as a pilot and use the two to three seconds going down to actively plan a soft landing.
        
          Lean forward into the fall—this gives you some control over direction.
          Fall sideways, if possible.
          Aim toward open areas and toward grass or dirt rather than concrete.
          Aim away from other people and away from objects that can cause puncture wounds or fractures.
          Swing your arms sideways to direct your fall.
          Twist your shoulder to protect your head.
          Keep your knees bent and your feet down.
          Fall like a sack of beans—relax everything.
          Fall on the soft, fleshy places, like your butt and thighs. These areas have more protection and are lower to the ground.
          As you complete the fall, try to roll to your side in a ball. This will spread the impact to reduce injury and stop you from rolling further.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-color-is-your-tongue-whats-healthy-whats-not-202309132973,"What color is your tongue? What's healthy, what's not?","If the eyes are the windows to the soul, then consider the tongue a sort of check-engine light for the body. The tongue's appearance gives doctors an idea about certain aspects of your health, and its color is an important clue.
        What should your tongue look like?
        The tongue should have a rounded, symmetrical shape. It's generally light pink, though it may have a little purple or brown pigmentation in African, Asian, and Mediterranean populations. It can also have a hint of white coating.
        ""The coating comes from a tough protein called keratin, which helps keep your tongue from being scratched when you eat,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, a prosthodontist in the Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
        Up close, you might be able to see that your tongue is covered in tiny bumps (papillae) that serve several purposes:
        
          They sense temperature and touch.
          They contain taste buds that enable you to detect if food is sweet, salty, sour, bitter, or savory.
          They create friction to help you form a little ball of food (bolus) that you can swallow.
        
        Can diet affect tongue color?
        Yes. Sometimes diet may be partly to blame for a shift away from your usual tongue tone. That's because the papillae can absorb the colors and residues of foods and drinks you consume. For example, that blue popsicle or candy you ate as a kid probably turned your tongue an exciting shade of azure. Coffee, tea, and many types of foods, such as curried dishes with lots of yellow turmeric, can also leave their marks.
        Discoloration is usually just temporary, however. Drinking plenty of water and maintaining good oral hygiene will wash away food and dyes that cling to the tongue.
        A dark or bright tongue, white patches, and other causes for concern
        Some tongue colors and appearances are signs of health issues. Check with your doctor if you notice any of the following:
        
          A brown or black tongue signals a condition called ""black hairy tongue."" This occurs when papillae get too long. These tiny bumps don't usually get much chance to grow because they are shed regularly with all the activity in your mouth. If they do grow, they can trap bacteria and a mix of food colors, leading to the brown or black tinge. Risk factors include taking antibiotics or antihistamines, smoking, dry mouth, drinking excessive amounts of coffee or black tea, or poor oral hygiene.
          Thick white patches or white sores on the tongue probably mean you have an overgrowth of yeast in the mouth (thrush). Thrush can be triggered by conditions such as diabetes or HIV, side effects of antibiotics or cancer treatment, wearing dentures, smoking, dry mouth, or using steroid inhalers. In rare cases, white patches or sores are symptoms of oral cancer.
          If your tongue has painful red or yellow sores, you might be dealing with canker sores (irritated tissues), thrush (which can sometimes appear as red patches), or (in rare cases) oral cancer.
          A bright red tongue can indicate that you have a vitamin B12 deficiency or an infection called scarlet fever — a Streptococcus bacteria infection in the throat (strep throat) accompanied by a red body rash. If you have bright red patches that don't hurt and seem to migrate from one place on the tongue to another, you might have a harmless, incurable condition called ""geographic tongue.""
        
        Should you brush your tongue or use a tongue scraper?
        Good oral hygiene requires that you floss your teeth at least once a day and brush them at least twice a day. Take a few seconds to use the brush on your tongue.
        ""Stick out your tongue and swipe your toothbrush from the back of your tongue to the front: one swipe down the middle, one swipe down the left side, and one swipe down the right side. That helps remove bacteria and debris that collect in papillae,"" Dr. Jiang says.
        Some people swear by using a tongue scraper to clean the tongue. Dr. Jiang isn't a fan, but doesn't have a problem with someone using the tool, which is pulled forward on the tongue in a similar fashion to brushing the tongue. ""The data about tongue scraper effectiveness are mixed,"" she says. ""It just comes down to what you're willing to do daily to keep your tongue, teeth, mouth, and gums as healthy as possible.""
        Worried about your tongue? What to do
        If you're worried about anything wrong with your tongue — especially if you also have a fever, a very sore throat, sores that won't go away, or other new symptoms — call your primary care doctor or dentist.
        Your doctor or dentist can
        
          assess your condition
          prescribe or suggest treatments to relieve discomfort, such as medicated mouthwashes or warm-water rinses
          urge you to stay hydrated and step up your oral hygiene.
        
        If necessary, your doctor can refer you to a specialist for further evaluation.",Heidi Godman,"September 13, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/upper-endoscopy-esophagogastroduodenoscopy-or-egd-a-to-z,Upper endoscopy (eophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD),"What is the test?
        This test inspects your esophagus, stomach and the first section of intestine (the duodenum) using an endoscope. An upper endoscopy allows the doctor to explore the cause of such symptoms as difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, vomiting up blood, or passing blood in the stool. It can also diagnose irritation, ulcers, and cancers of the lining of the esophagus and stomach. During this type of endoscopy, the doctor can also take biopsy samples of tissue.
        How do I prepare for the test?
        Don't eat or drink anything for eight hours before this test. It's also best to stop taking aspirin and other NSAIDs for several days beforehand, to reduce the chances of bleeding should your doctor need to take a biopsy. Ask your doctor if you should avoid taking any other medicines on the day of the test. If you have diabetes, talk with your doctor about ways to avoid low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) since you will be fasting. If you wear dentures, remove them before the test. Arrange for a ride home because the medicine given for this test will make you drowsy.
        What happens when the test is performed?
        The nurse will place an intravenous catheter into your arm. During the procedure, the nurse will be monitoring your heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen content of your blood. You'll probably be given a sedative through an IV. This medicine may prevent you from remembering the test; it might even make you sleep through it.
        The doctor will spray a local anesthetic into your throat to prevent you from gagging when the endoscope is inserted. The endoscope used in this test is about half an inch in diameter and long enough to reach from your mouth through your stomach and into the first part of your small intestine. When the doctor places the endoscope in your throat, he or she asks you to swallow. This helps guide the endoscope into your esophagus. You are likely to feel pressure against your throat while the tube is in place and you might experience a ""full"" feeling in your stomach.
        The doctor gently advances the tube through your esophagus into your stomach. He or she will then move the scope into the duodenum. The camera at the end of the scope takes pictures that appear on a video screen. Your doctor will watch for any suspicious spots on the lining of your esophagus, stomach and duodenum. If any appear, your doctor might use some small clippers on the end of the scope to remove a tiny piece of tissue for a biopsy.
        Though the exam itself takes only 10-15 minutes, you will probably be in the exam room for 40 minutes or more because of the time it takes to set up. Your throat will feel numb, but this will wear off about 30 minutes later. The sedative will make you sleepy for an hour or more.
        What risks are there from the test?
        Complications are rare. One possible complication is aspiration (accidentally inhaling saliva into the lungs), which can cause pneumonia. If a biopsy is taken, or if the endoscope injures the wall of the esophagus or stomach, it can cause bleeding. If severe, internal bleeding can require a transfusion. In rare cases, perforation of the lining of the stomach, esophagus, or intestine can also occur, requiring surgery. The sedative given can sometimes cause an allergic reaction.
        Must I do anything special after the test is over?
        Medical personnel will probably watch you for half an hour or more after the test. Although you may eat an hour after the test, you shouldn't drive or drink alcohol for the rest of the day due to grogginess from the sedative. Call your doctor if you experience dizziness, chest pain, difficulty or pain with swallowing, fever, black stools, or vomiting material that looks like coffee grounds.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/percutaneous-transhepatic-cholangiography-ptca-a-to-z,Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTCA),"What is the test?
        Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is an x-ray test that can help show whether there is a blockage in the liver or the bile ducts that drain it. Since the liver and its drainage system do not normally show up on x-rays, the doctor doing the x-ray needs to inject a special dye directly into the drainage system of the liver. This dye, which is visible on x-rays, should then spread out to fill the whole drainage system. If it does not, that means there is a blockage. This type of blockage might result from a gallstone or a cancer in the liver.
        How do I prepare for the test?
        Tell your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to lidocaine or the numbing medicine used at the dentist's office, or to x-ray dye. Also tell your doctor if you could be pregnant, since x-rays can harm the developing baby. If you have diabetes and take insulin, discuss this with your doctor before the test.
        Most people need to have a blood test done some time before the procedure, to make sure they are not at high risk for bleeding complications. If you take an anticoagulant drug (blood thinner), aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or other medicines that affect blood clotting, talk with your doctor. It may be necessary to stop or adjust the dose of these medicines before your test.
        You will be told not to eat anything on the morning of the test so that your stomach is empty. This is a safety measure in the unlikely case you have a complication, such as bleeding, that might require surgery.
        What happens when the test is performed?
        You lie on a table wearing a hospital gown. An IV (intravenous) line is inserted into a vein in case you need medicines or fluid during the procedure. An area over your right rib cage is cleaned with an antibacterial soap. Then the radiologist may take a picture of your abdomen with an overhead camera. Medicine is injected through a small needle to numb the skin and the tissue underneath the skin in the area where the dye is to be injected. You may feel some brief stinging from the numbing medicine.
        A separate needle is then inserted between two of your ribs on your right side. The needle is advanced into your liver. A small amount of x-ray dye is injected, and some pictures are taken that are visible on a video screen. Your doctor adjusts the placement of the needle until it is clear that the dye is flowing easily through the ducts (drainage tubes) inside your liver.
        Because taking the x-ray pictures sometimes requires a significant amount of time, the doctor replaces the needle with a softer plastic tube. First, the syringe holding the dye is detached from the top of the needle, leaving the needle in place. The doctor then gently pushes a thin wire through the needle and into the duct where the needle has been sitting. Next the needle is pulled out, sliding over the outside end of the wire. The wire is left with one end inside the liver to hold the position where the needle had been. The doctor then slides a thin plastic tube similar to an IV line along the wire, like a long bead on a string, until it is in the same place where the needle was. The wire is then pulled out, and the syringe with the dye is reattached to the tube.
        Then more dye is injected through the plastic tube, and pictures are taken with the video camera as the dye spreads inside the liver. If there is no blockage, the dye drains out of the liver through the bile ducts and begins to show up on the x-ray in your small intestine. Once all of the needed pictures have been taken, the plastic tube is pulled out, and a small bandage is placed over your side. The whole test usually takes less than an hour.
        What risks are there from the test?
        It is possible to have serious bleeding from this test. In some cases, blood leaks to the outside surface of the liver and causes a buildup of blood there. In other cases, blood can leak directly into the liver's drainage system, in which case it might start showing up in your intestine, causing a bloody bowel movement. It is possible that you could develop an infection after the test, although this is rare. The only soreness you are likely to have is at the skin surface where the needle went in. This should last for only a day or two.
        In rare cases, the dye used in the test can damage your kidneys. This kidney effect is almost always temporary, but some people have permanent damage.
        Because x-rays are used, there is a small exposure to radiation. In large amounts, exposure to radiation can cause cancers or (in pregnant women) birth defects. The amount of radiation from the video x-ray in this test is very small—too small to be likely to cause any harm. (The people performing the test will wear lead shields, since they would otherwise be exposed to this radiation over and over.)
        Must I do anything special after the test is over?
        Call your doctor right away if you have pain in your right abdomen or shoulder, fever, dizziness, or a change in your stool color to black or red.
        How long is it before the result of the test is known?
        You may be told some early results of your test as soon as the test is done. It takes a day or two for the radiologist to review the x-rays more thoroughly and to give your doctor a full report.",Unknown,"September 13, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-add-core-exercises-to-your-workout-routine,How to add core exercises to your workout routine,"Core exercises are good for more than just building strong abdominal muscles. These efficient exercises can improve your posture, make everyday activities such as bending or twisting much easier, reduce low back pain, and even improve your balance and lessen the risk of falling. Core work should be part of a well-rounded workout routine.
        
          A basic workout plan
        
        According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, a balanced exercise plan includes:
        
          At least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, 75 minutes of vigorous activity, or an equivalent combination of the two every week. (During moderate activity, such as a brisk walk, you can talk, but not sing; during vigorous activity, such as running, you can't say more than a few words without catching your breath.)
          Strength-training sessions twice a week for all major muscle groups.
          Balance exercises if you're an older adult at risk for falling.
        
        Core work falls under the second and third categories: strength training and enhancing balance. Advanced core exercises tone more than just core muscles: for example, chair stands strengthen muscles throughout your legs, while planks work some arm and back muscles as well as abdominal muscles.
        
          Adding core work
        
        You don't need to be sporting six-pack abs or be ready for an advanced Pilates class to add core work to your routine. Gentle core exercises can get you started and offer real benefits.
        Core work doesn't have to take a lot of time, either. Slipping in exercises and stretches during the day or adding a few core exercises to your usual routine takes just a few minutes.
        
          Start slowly, and gradually challenge yourself. Aim to do a core workout two to three times a week. Start with basic exercises. When you can do a full set of reps easily, move on to a slightly more advanced set of exercises. Changing exercise routines can also help prevent boredom and keep you motivated.
          Sprinkle in core work throughout your day. Look for opportunities to do short bursts of exercises or stretches a few times a day. You can do this daily or start slowly with just a few days a week — say, every Monday and Thursday — then gradually incorporate core exercises into additional days.
          Tack core work on to strength sessions. When you do your twice-weekly strength training sessions (see the recommendations above), add two extra core exercises to your regimen. When you have time or when it becomes easy to do the core exercises, step it up again by beginning a separate core workout or sprinkling bursts of core work throughout your day.
        
        
          For more information on increasing your core strength and improving your balance, check out Gentle Core Exercises, a Special Health Report from Harvard Medical School.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/will-digestive-enzyme-supplements-help-your-heartburn-2018041313643,Digestive enzyme supplements for heartburn?,"My love affair with spicy food came to a sad end a few years ago. Age — and I'm guessing too many jalapenos — have left me prone to heartburn if I eat meals with a fiery flare. My doctor says there's no underlying condition causing the problem, and advises me to avoid the foods that seem to trigger symptoms. But that's tricky sometimes.

So I was particularly interested when a friend suggested that an over-the-counter (OTC) digestive enzyme supplement might help. I learned pretty quickly that there are lots of ads for the pills and powders. It's a booming business, with sales for OTC digestive enzymes of all kinds expected to reach $1.6 billion by 2025.

About the supplements touted for heartburn relief

OTC digestive enzymes claim they can help you break down food, just like digestive enzymes your own body makes (mostly in the pancreas). For example, the enzymes produced by the pancreas include:


	lipase, which breaks down fats
	amylase, which breaks down carbohydrates
	proteases and peptidases, which break down proteins.


The supplement versions of these enzymes come from plants and animals. Plant sources include bromelain, derived from pineapples; papain, derived from papayas; and lactase that's obtained from purified yeasts or fungi. Animal sources include enzymes from the pancreases of pigs, cows, or lambs.

But there's no way to know what's really in supplements. The FDA does not regulate them, therefore you can't be sure what the pills are really made of or the exact amounts of enzymes they may contain. ""It's buyer beware,"" warns Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.

Do supplements help heartburn?

Sometimes the body doesn't make enough digestive enzymes. This can slow the digestion process and lead to uncomfortable symptoms.

Would a digestive enzyme supplement help treat the symptoms of occasional heartburn, caused by acid reflux, slow stomach emptying, or an unknown reason (like I have)? The answer is that we don't know. ""Unfortunately, there is little evidence that OTC digestive enzymes are helpful for heartburn,"" says Dr. Staller.

But we do know that OTC digestive enzymes can help manage other conditions. For example, if you don't make enough of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase, needed to digest the sugar in beans, you may benefit from taking an alpha-galactosidase supplement (Beano, Bean Relief).

Or if you don't make enough of the enzyme lactase, needed to digest lactose — the sugar in milk and milk-based products — you may benefit by taking a lactase supplement (Lactaid, Lactrase). ""If you don't have lactase, the undigested lactose goes to the colon, which leads to more fluid entering the colon and more gas produced by bacteria in the colon. That creates bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea,"" explains Dr. Staller. ""A supplement might help.""

What about prescription enzymes?

Sometimes doctors recommend taking prescription-strength digestive enzymes. These may be necessary when digestion enzyme levels are low because of a health condition such as chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis.

Taking prescription digestive enzyme medications helps bring levels back to normal. ""People with known deficiencies clearly get a benefit,"" says Dr. Staller.

But these medications are not appropriate treatments for heartburn.

The rest of my story

Because I am persistent, I asked if it would hurt to try an OTC digestive enzyme for occasional heartburn. Both my doctor and Dr. Staller had the same answer: ""In most cases, it's unlikely to be harmful. But don't spend a lot of money on them,"" Dr. Staller advised. In other words, it won't hurt, but we don't know if it will help. So don't make a big investment in the treatment.

With that dubious green light and a lot of curiosity, I tried an OTC enzyme made from papaya. And guess what — it helped! But as a health reporter I know that this could have been the result of my own personal hope (the placebo effect) or just a happy coincidence.

I also know that ignoring my doctor's orders to avoid spicy foods (which is my heartburn trigger, but may not be someone else's) would be foolish, and could cause damage to my esophagus. So would using digestive enzymes as a crutch to eat anything I want.

The lesson for me is that the OTC digestive enzyme supplement is there if I need it in a pinch, and that it might or might not work.

But I won't make a habit of using it. I'll keep the spice factor dialed down to a lower heat, and l'll just have to learn to love being symptom-free the way I once loved those jalapenos.",Heidi Godman,"September 12, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fermented-foods-for-better-gut-health-201805161607,Fermented foods for better gut health,"Naturally fermented foods are getting a lot of attention from health experts these days because they may help strengthen your gut microbiome — the 100 trillion or so bacteria and microorganisms that live in your digestive tract. Researchers are beginning to link these tiny creatures to all sorts of health conditions from obesity to neurodegenerative diseases.
        Fermented foods are preserved using an age-old process that not only boosts the food's shelf life and nutritional value, but can give your body a dose of healthy probiotics, which are live microorganisms crucial to healthy digestion, says Dr. David S. Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.
        Not all fermented foods are created equal
        The foods that give your body beneficial probiotics are those fermented using natural processes and containing probiotics. Live cultures are found in not only yogurt and a yogurt-like drink called kefir, but also in Korean pickled vegetables called kimchi, sauerkraut, and in some pickles. The jars of pickles you can buy off the shelf at the supermarket are sometimes pickled using vinegar and not the natural fermentation process using live organisms, which means they don't contain probiotics. To ensure the fermented foods you choose do contain probiotics, look for the words ""naturally fermented"" on the label, and when you open the jar look for telltale bubbles in the liquid, which signal that live organisms are inside the jar, says Dr. Ludwig.
        Try making your own naturally fermented foods
        Below is a recipe from the book Always Delicious by Dr. Ludwig and Dawn Ludwig that can help get you started.
        Spicy pickled vegetables (escabeche)
        These spicy pickles are reminiscent of the Mediterranean and Latin American culinary technique known as escabeche. This recipe leaves out the sugar. Traditionally, the larger vegetables would be lightly cooked before pickling, but we prefer to use a quick fermentation method and leave the vegetables a bit crisp instead.
        
          2 cups filtered water
          1 to 1-1/4 tablespoons sea salt
          2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
          1 jalapeño or a few small hot chiles (or to taste), sliced
          1 large carrot cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds or diagonal slices
          1 to 2 cups chopped cauliflower or small cauliflower florets
          3 small stalks celery (use only small inner stalks from the heart), cut into 1-inch-long sticks
          1 bay leaf
          1 cabbage leaf, rinsed
        
        Warm the water (no need to boil). Stir in the sea salt until it dissolves completely. Set aside to cool (use this time to cut the vegetables). Add the vinegar just before using. The brine can be made ahead of time and stored in a sealed glass jar on the counter to use when ready to pickle.
        Set a quart-size canning jar in the sink and fill it with boiling water to sterilize. Empty the jar and tightly pack the vegetables and bay leaf inside to within 1 to 2 inches from the top of the jar. Pour the brine over the vegetables to fill the jar to within 1 inch from the top. Wedge the cabbage leaf over the top of the vegetables and tuck it around the edges to hold the vegetables beneath the liquid.
        Set jar on the counter and cover with a fermentation lid. (Alternatively, use a standard lid and loosen it a bit each day for the first few days, then every other day, to allow gasses to escape.) Let pickle for three to five days, depending on the indoor temperature. Check the taste after a couple of days, using clean utensils. Vegetables will pickle faster in warmer climates. Make sure the vegetables stay packed beneath the level of the liquid and add salted water (2 teaspoons sea salt dissolved in 1 cup warm filtered water) as needed.
        When the vegetables are pickled to your liking, seal the jar with a regular lid and refrigerate. Vegetables will continue to slowly pickle in the refrigerator. They will keep for about one month. Taste for saltiness before serving and, if desired, rinse gently to remove excess salt.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/6-self-help-tips-for-hemorrhoid-flare-ups-201307196496,6 self-help tips for hemorrhoid flare-ups,"Getting older has its benefits—and its drawbacks. Included in the latter are hemorrhoids. These swollen blood vessels on the outer rectum and anus can turn bowel movements into intensely painful experiences. Classic symptoms include rectal pain, itching, bleeding, and possibly prolapse (protrusion of hemorrhoids into the anal canal). Although hemorrhoids are rarely dangerous, they can be a painful recurrent bother.
        Hemorrhoids come in two varieties. The internal type sprout from within the rectum. External hemorrhoids develop on the anus itself. Either way, stools passing by them can cause pain and bleeding.
        But simple self-help measures can ease the ordeal of most hemorrhoids and allow healing. Here are effective steps you can take to care for hemorrhoids—and when it's time to seek out a procedure to remove them.
        
          What helps hemorrhoids
        
        Here are six self-help tips to ease hemorrhoid pain and promote healing:
        
          Step up the fiber. The most important thing is to add fiber to your diet. This is best done with foods that help hemorrhoids, but some people find they need to take a fiber supplement to get 20 to 30 grams of fiber per day. To start, try a psyllium husk fiber supplement, such as Metamucil or a generic equivalent. If psyllium causes gas or bloating, try a supplement containing wheat dextrin or methylcellulose.
          Lubricate the process. Mixing a tablespoon of mineral oil with applesauce or yogurt and eating it at breakfast or lunch allows stool to slide by the hemorrhoid more easily. But don't do this for a long period (if you try this, you may want to place a liner in your undergarments to absorb any oil leakage.)
          Don't delay. When you feel the urge, go to the bathroom immediately; don't wait for a more convenient time. Putting off bowel movements can worsen constipation, which then aggravates hemorrhoids.
          Try elevation. Elevating your feet a bit with a step stool as you sit on the toilet changes the position of the rectum in a way that may allow for easier passage of stools.
          Off-the-shelf remedies. Over-the-counter products are available for hemorrhoids. These include witch hazel infused pads and soothing creams, like Preparation H and its generic equivalents. If these don't work, ask your doctor about prescription preparations.
          Sit in a sitz. Don't overlook the relief offered by sitz baths. Using a basin that fits under the toilet seat, soak the inflamed area in warm water for 10 to 15 minutes, two to three times a day.
        
         
        If hemorrhoids persist no matter what steps you take to make them go away, or they begin to bleed, interfere with bowel movements, or make life difficult, ask your doctor about medical procedures to remove or reduce hemorrhoids.",Daniel Pendick,"September 12, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/leaky-gut-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-you-2017092212451,"Leaky gut: What is it, and what does it mean for you?","Before the medical community had better understanding of the mechanisms that cause disease, doctors believed certain ailments could originate from imbalances in the stomach. This was called hypochondriasis. (In Ancient Greek, hypochondrium refers to the upper part of the abdomen, the region between the breastbone and the navel.) This concept was rejected as science evolved and, for example, we could look under a microscope and see bacteria, parasites, and viruses. The meaning of the term changed, and for many years doctors used the word ""hypochondriac"" to describe a person who has a persistent, often inexplicable fear of having a serious medical illness.
        But what if this ancient concept of illnesses originating in the gut actually holds some truth? Could some of the chronic diseases our society faces today actually be associated with a dysfunctional gastrointestinal system?
        What exactly is leaky gut?
        Inside our bellies, we have an extensive intestinal lining covering more than 4,000 square feet of surface area. When working properly, it forms a tight barrier that controls what gets absorbed into the bloodstream. An unhealthy gut lining may have large cracks or holes, allowing partially digested food, toxins, and bugs to penetrate the tissues beneath it. This may trigger inflammation and changes in the gut flora (normal bacteria) that could lead to problems within the digestive tract and beyond. The research world is booming today with studies showing that modifications in the intestinal bacteria and inflammation may play a role in the development of several common chronic diseases.
        Who gets a leaky gut (and why)?
        We all have some degree of leaky gut, as this barrier is not completely impenetrable (and isn't supposed to be!). Some of us may have a genetic predisposition and may be more sensitive to changes in the digestive system, but our DNA is not the only one to blame. Modern life may actually be the main driver of gut inflammation. There is emerging evidence that the standard American diet, which is low in fiber and high in sugar and saturated fats, may initiate this process. Heavy alcohol use and stress also seem to disrupt this balance.
        We already know that increased intestinal permeability plays a role in certain gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. The biggest question is whether or not a leaky gut may cause problems elsewhere in the body. Some studies show that leaky gut may be associated with other autoimmune diseases (lupus, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis), chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, arthritis, allergies, asthma, acne, obesity, and even mental illness. However, we do not yet have clinical studies in humans showing such a cause and effect.
        A path toward a healthier gut
        Although it is unusual to hear the term ""increased intestinal permeability"" in most doctors' offices, alternative and integrative medicine practitioners have worked on gut healing as an initial step to treat chronic diseases for decades. Other cultures around the world often recommend specific diets to make people feel better. Even in the United States, it is common to see people changing their diets after getting sick. A common initial step some practitioners take is to remove foods that can be inflammatory and could promote changes in the gut flora. Among the most common are alcohol, processed foods, certain medications, and any foods that may cause allergies or sensitivities.
        Controversy still exists on whether leaky gut causes the development of diseases outside the gastrointestinal tract in humans. However, it is always a good idea to eat a nutritious, unprocessed diet that includes foods that help quell inflammation (and avoids foods known to trigger inflammation), which may, at least in theory, help to rebuild the gut lining and bring more balance to the gut flora. This recipe could make you feel better, without any side effects. It is definitely worth a try.","Marcelo Campos, MD","September 12, 2023",1

It normally relaxes only when you swallow, to let food into your stomach. However, sometimes the muscle fails to tighten enough to prevent acid reflux.

Each of us has a flat plate of muscle just beneath our lungs, separating our chest from our abdomen. It's called the diaphragm, and it helps us breathe: when it moves downward, it causes the lungs to pull in air through the nose and mouth. And when it moves upward, it forces air out of our lungs. The movement of the diaphragm is directed by the brain, which sends signals down nerves that end in the diaphragm. A hiccup occurs when the brain sends a signal for the diaphragm to shift forcefully downward, suddenly pulling a lot of air into the back of the throat. The sudden change in pressure causes a narrow area in the throat to temporarily snap shut, causing the ""hic"" sound of a hiccup.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-best-exercises-for-your-bones,The best exercises for your bones,"Just like every part of your body, your bones need maintenance to be healthy and strong. Exercise is one of the pillars of bone care and fall prevention. By taking steps now, you can help maintain the bone mass you have and may even build a little more, reducing your risk of debili­tating fractures later in life.
        Certain types of exercise can increase muscle mass, which in turn enhances strength, muscle control, bal­ance, and coordination. Good balance and coordination can mean the difference between falling—and suffering a fracture—and staying on your feet. In fact, strong evidence shows that regular physical activity can reduce falls by nearly a third in older adults at high risk of falling.
        All exercises for bone strength have one or more of the following attributes:
        Provide resistance. In these forms of exer­cise, you challenge your muscles by working against some type of resistance, such as dumbbells, elastic bands, or even your own body weight. Resistance exercises, including classic strength training, rely on muscle contractions that tug on bones to stimulate them to bulk up.
        Weight-bearing. Weight-bearing exer­cise is any activity, such as running, walking, dancing, hiking, climbing stairs, or playing tennis, golf, or bas­ketball, in which you carry your body weight and work against gravity. This contrasts with non-weight-bearing activities such as swimming or cycling, where the water or bicycle supports your body weight. The force you exert to counteract gravity when you do weight-bearing activities is what stimulates bones to get stronger.
        Provide impact. When you land a jump or pound the ground with each step as you run, you mul­tiply the weight-bearing effect of gravity. That's why higher-impact activities generally have a more pro­nounced effect on bone than lower-impact exercises.
        Higher velocity. Impact can be increased even more as your speed increases. For example, jogging or fast-paced aerobics will do more to strengthen your bones than a leisurely stroll or slow calisthenics exercises.
        Involve sudden changes of direction. Changing direction while you're moving also appears to benefit bones. When researchers reviewed bone strength in the hips of a variety of athletes, they found that those who played sports such as soccer and squash, which involve rapid turns and start-and-stop actions, had bone strength similar to those who did high-impact sports, like triple jumpers and high jumpers—and they all had greater bone density than long-distance runners.
        Improve balance. Exercises that target balance may not be the best for building bone, but they will help keep you from falling, so they also serve a bone-protecting function.

From IV drips and detoxes to superfoods,"Ever see ads for products that promise to supercharge immunity? Activate your body's natural defenses? Support a healthy immune system while delivering a potent boost derived from nature's hottest immune-enhancing ingredients?
        While the words may change to reflect the latest trends, the claims certainly sound amazing. But do the multitude of products promoted as immune boosters actually work? What steps can we take to support the immune system? Both are important questions, especially in the wake of a deadly pandemic and as flu and cold season arrives.
        IV drips, supplements, cleanses, and superfoods
        The lineup of immune-boosting products and advice includes:
        
          Home intravenous (IV) drips. Want a health professional to come to your home with IV fluids containing various vitamins and supplements? That's available in many US cities, and some companies claim their formula is designed to supercharge immunity. These on-demand IV treatments aren't risk-free and can be quite expensive.
          Vitamins and supplements. Popular options include turmeric, milk thistle, and echinacea, often in combination with various vitamins. Hundreds of formulations are available.
          Superfoods and foods to avoid. If you search online for ""foods to boost the immune system"" you'll see thousands of articles touting blueberries, broccoli, spinach, dark chocolate, and other foods to keep infections away. There's also a list of foods to avoid, such as sugary drinks or highly processed meats, because they're supposed to be bad for your immune system.
          Cleanses and detox treatments. No doubt you've seen pitches for cleanses and detox products intended to remove toxins from the body. Their marketing warns that the environment is full of harmful substances that get into the body through the air, water, and food, which we need to remove. Advocates suggest that, among other harmful effects, these often unnamed toxins make your immune system sluggish.
        
        Are the heavily marketed IV drips, supplements, or detox products endorsed by the FDA?
        No. In fact, the standard disclaimer on supplements' claims of immune-boosting properties says: ""This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.""
        Yet sellers are allowed to use phrases like ""boosts immune function"" and ""supports immune health."" These terms have always seemed vague to me. More importantly, they're confusing:
        
          Boosting immunity is what vaccinations do. They prime your immune system to help fight off a specific infectious organism (like the flu shot before each flu season).
        
        
          Immune support typically describes vitamins such as vitamin C, or other nutrients necessary for a healthy immune system. It's true that a deficiency of vital nutrients can cause poor immune function. But that doesn't mean a person with normal levels of nutrients can expect supplements to improve their immune system.
        
        Can products marketed as immune boosters actually boost immunity?
        Unless you have a deficiency in a key nutrient, such as vitamin C or zinc, the short answer is no.
        That is, there's no convincing evidence that any particular product meaningfully improves immune function in healthy people. For example, results of studies looking at various supplements for colds and other similar infections have been mixed at best. Even when taking a particular supplement was linked to reduced severity or duration of an infection like a cold, there's no proof that the supplement boosted overall immune function.
        This goes for individual foods as well. None has ever been shown to improve immune function on its own. It's the overall quality of your diet, not individual foods, that matters most. A similar approach applies to advice on foods you should avoid, such as sugary drinks or highly processed meats: the best foods to avoid in support of your immune system are the same ones you should be limiting anyway.
        How to get the most out of your immune system
        It's not a secret and it's not a product. What's good for your overall health is good for immune function. The best ways to keep your immune system at peak performance are:
        
          Eat well and follow a heart-healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean diet.
          Exercise regularly and maintain a healthy weight.
          Don't smoke or vape.
          If you drink alcoholic beverages, drink only in moderation.
          Get plenty of sleep.
          Minimize stress.
          Get regular medical care, including routine vaccinations.
          Take measures to prevent infection such as frequent hand washing, avoiding people who might have a contagious illness, and wearing a mask when it's recommended.
        
        This list probably looks familiar. These measures have long been recommended for overall health, and can do a lot to help many of us.
        Certain illnesses — HIV, some cancers, and autoimmune disorders — or their treatments can affect how well the immune system works. So some people may need additional help from medications and therapies, which could truly count as immune boosting.
        The bottom line
        Perhaps there will come a time when we'll know how to boost immune function beyond following routine health measures. That's simply not the case now. Until we know more, I wouldn't rely on individual foods, detox programs, oral supplements, or on-demand IV drips to keep your immune system healthy, especially when there are far more reliable options.","Robert H.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/weak-kidneys-pay-attention-but-dont-worry-excessively,Weak kidneys? Pay attention but don't worry excessively,"You often hear older people say I have weak kidneys. That doesn't mean they can't do their job or are destined to fail. But it does indicate you have some form of chronic kidney disease. The kidneys — the body's blood-filtering urine factory — have less capacity to filter toxins from the blood and excrete them in the urine.
        How the kidneys work
        Every day, a healthy kidney filters a total of about 200 quarts of blood, removing waste products, excess water, and certain chemicals. If the kidneys didn't keep things in balance, you would slowly poison yourself.
        The kidneys have a remarkable ability to keep working despite changing conditions, like drops in blood pressure. The tiny filtering tubes in the kidney, called glomeruli, adapt in various ways.
        In a serious health crisis, the kidneys may shut down completely as a defensive move to keep fluids in the body. That's called an acute kidney injury, and it happens frequently to people who are hospitalized.
        What causes low kidney function?
        Half of U.S. adults over 75 may have below-normal kidney function. Most of them will never get sick from it.
        Several conditions or factors can injure the kidneys, leading to lower kidney function and possible chronic kidney disease. These include:
        
          diabetes
          smoking
          excessive alcohol consumption
          uncontrolled hypertension
          high cholesterol
          in addition, some medications can injure the kidneys.
        
        If you are leading a heart-healthy lifestyle (regular exercise and a nutritious plant-based diet), that will help protect your kidneys.
        How low is low?
        A healthy kidney filters wastes from the blood at a rate of 90 milliliters (ml) per minute or more. This is known as the glomerular filtration rate, or GFR. With time, many men's kidneys start to slip, but function must decline quite a lot before you start to really feel the impact. You feel fine up to the point that kidney function is almost gone, which means you can lead a normal life with reduced kidney function.
        On the other hand, lack of early warning from symptoms can deny you the chance to slow the slide. Most people don't start feeling really ill until kidney function is under 10%.
        How is kidney function tested?
        As part of standard blood tests, your doctor can check the creatinine level to assess kidney function. Creatinine is released from muscle cells into the bloodstream.
        Creatinine is one of the things that the kidneys filter from the blood. If the kidneys start to lose some function, blood creatinine level rises. The creatinine level is used to calculate an estimate of the GFR and provide an estimate of your kidney function.
        Most people who have a minor reduction in kidney function can take steps to not keep the kidneys from getting worse. If the function is somewhat low but stable, you may need to see your doctor only once per year. If the GFR is declining or it is already under 50, it's best to see a kidney doctor.
        How high blood pressure damages the kidneys
        High blood pressure can cause tiny cracks in the lining of arteries, which provide a breeding ground for fatty deposits that hamper blood flow. As the arteries that feed blood to the kidneys narrow, the body produces renin, a hormone that makes small arteries narrow further. This worsens high blood pressure, causing even more kidney damage. Over time, restricted blood flow can damage or destroy the nephrons, the tiny filtering units inside your kidneys.
        How to protect your kidneys and improve kidney function
        If kidney function begins to decline, you can take the following steps.
        Keep your blood pressure and blood sugar within norms
        This will help slow the decline in kidney function. In particular, keep blood pressure below 130/80.
        Lower your cholesterol
        Taking a statin medication to lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol may help to protect the kidneys. Also, individuals with reduced kidney function are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease, so reducing cardiac risk factors is important.
        Consider medication
        Certain prescription medications can protect the kidneys. The ones that physicians often use for this purpose are angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), and SGLT2 inhibitors. These drugs lower pressure in the kidney filters and limit further damage.
        Eat a plant-based diet; limit protein intake
        Plant-based proteins rather than animal-based proteins may put less strain on weak kidneys.
        Use NSAIDs with caution
        Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, interfere with kidney function. Taking them when you are also depleted of fluids can lead to kidney shutdown and possibly hospitalization. For pain relief, acetaminophen (no more than 3,000 milligrams per day) is safer. If you must take an NSAID, be sure to drink plenty of water.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/dealing-with-thick-discolored-toenails-202308242970,"Dealing with thick, discolored toenails","Wriggling toes in the sand and wearing sandals are warm weather treats, unless you'd rather keep your toes under wraps due to thickened, yellowish nails. Nail fungal infections (known as onychomycosis) are common, affecting up to 14% of the general population. In advanced cases, nails can become brittle, crumbly, or ragged, or even separate from the nail bed.
        While completely curing these fungal infections is difficult, the right treatments can discourage the problem from spreading and make your nails look better.
        Do nail fungal infections only affect toenails?
        No, fingernails can become infected, too. However, toenails are a more common target because of certain habits, including wearing shoes, so we'll concentrate on them in this post.
        How do people get toenail fungus?
        ""Feet are more likely to be sweaty and damp, which provides a better environment for the fungi, yeasts, and molds that are naturally present on your skin to flourish,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, a dermatologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        People also can be exposed to various fungi, known as dermatophytes, by walking barefoot in locker rooms, spas, or near swimming pools, or getting a pedicure at a nail salon, she says. A fungal overgrowth can infect the area between your toes and the skin or your feet, causing athlete's foot. The fungus can then spread to the toenails.
        What makes toenail fungus hard to treat?
        While antifungal creams can easily treat skin infections, toenails are another story.
        ""Nail tissue is harder and thicker, so these medications don't penetrate very well,"" Dr. Waldman explains. That's also true for antifungal drugs taken as pills. Toenails grow slowly and the tissue isn't very metabolically active. So although the medication gets into your bloodstream, only small amounts end up in your toenails. That's why it's hard to get rid of toenail fungus once it takes hold.
        What counts as a cure?
        Research reports so-called clinical cure rates between 60% to 80%, but this means only the absence of symptoms — that is, your toenails return to their normal appearance. The fungal infection may still be lurking under your nails, says Dr. Waldman.
        In fact, in clinical trials when investigators recheck toenail clippings for any residual fungus after treatments applied to nails, only around 10% to 15% show no detectable fungal spores. As a result, recurrences of toenail fungal infections are fairly common.
        Despite this, there's a reasonable chance that different treatment approaches can improve your symptoms and the appearance of your toenails.
        What works for treating toenail fungus?
        Here is a rundown of the different treatment options, starting with Dr. Waldman's go-to first-line suggestion, which uses inexpensive products you may already have in your home.
        Home remedies
        Soaking your toes to soften your nails before applying a fungus-fighting agent will help the remedy penetrate the nail. For the soak, Dr. Waldman recommends mixing one part white or apple cider vinegar to three parts warm water. Soak your toes for at least 10 minutes (but up to 40 minutes is better). Instead of vinegar, you can use Listerine, which contains thymol, the main compound in the herb thyme. Like vinegar, thymol has antifungal properties.
        Then dry your feet well and apply an antifungal substance to all the affected nails. One option is a paste of crushed garlic, but most people will probably find the over-the-counter drugstore products listed below more convenient to use.
        Over-the-counter products
        The best evidence is for 100% tea tree oil, but another popular option is Vicks VapoRub (which also contains thymol and other essential oils that may fight fungus), Dr. Waldman says. Or you can use one of the various creams sold to treat athlete's foot on your toenails.
        Be sure to apply the product right after soaking. The clinical cure rates for each of these approaches vary between products, and depend on the severity and duration of the infection. But about 60% of people notice improvements after a few months of treatment, Dr. Waldman says.
        Drugstores also carry several other toenail treatments, including a treated patch you put on your nails overnight. It contains urea, an acidic substance that improves the look of your nails by making them less brittle and discolored. Another product that promises similar results uses a tiny LED light that you clip onto your toenail after applying a liquid containing polyethylene glycol, which softens nails.
        Prescription treatments to put on toenails
        These topical products, which are best for milder infections, include amorolfine (Loceryl, others), efinaconazole (Jublia), tavaborole (Kerydin), and ciclopirox (Penlac). They are clear lacquers that you brush on your toenails once daily, usually for months. It may take as long as a year to see results. Clinical cure rates range from 35% to 60%.
        Prescription pills
        More severe infections may respond better to oral drugs, which include fluconazole (Diflucan), griseofulvin (Grifulvin), itraconazole (Sporanox), and terbinafine (Lamisil). These are taken daily in pill form for three months. While the clinical cure rates are higher (around 80%), these drugs have more side effects, including stomach upset, diarrhea, and (in rare cases) liver damage.
        Laser therapy
        Lasers penetrate and break down nail tissue, helping to destroy the fungus. There are many different types of lasers and protocols. Clinical cure rates are hard to pin down, but some have been reported as ranging between 60% and 75%.
        Advice on toenail clippers, nail polish, new shoes, and more
        During and after treatment, Dr. Waldman advises people to use two sets of toenail clippers — one for infected nails and one for noninfected nails — to prevent fungal spread. If you're embarrassed by the appearance of your toenails, it's okay to use nail polish for short periods of time, she says.
        Once you finish treatment, buying new shoes will help avoid reinfection. ""I also always recommend people do a diluted vinegar soak once or twice a week after finishing treatment, which helps prevent any lingering fungus from reinfecting the nail,"" says Dr. Waldman.",Julie Corliss,"September 7, 2023",1

        You see a young woman getting into her car, sitting in her work cubicle, sitting in a restaurant, and finally in the waiting room of her doctor's office. But she's not sitting on the seat of the car or on a chair; in every scene, she's sitting on the lid of a toilet.
        Strange, right?
        Why all the toilets?
        The voiceover provides a clue: ""When you live with moderate or severe Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, your day can be full of reminders of your condition. Never knowing, always wondering."" And there's another hint: the woman keeps grimacing and clutching her belly.

But these clues may not be enough. What's never explained in this ad is that abdominal pain and sudden diarrhea are among the most common symptoms of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, conditions known collectively as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The ""never knowing, always wondering"" refers to the way people with these conditions often have unpredictable bouts of diarrhea and an urgent need to get to a restroom. And that's why there are toilets everywhere.
        What does this ad get right?
        The ad provides useful information about:
        
          How this treatment works. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two forms of IBD that cause inflammation of the intestinal tract. Given as an infusion every two months, vedolizumab works by blocking cells involved in that inflammation. The ad uses visually appealing animations and graphics to get these points across.
          Side effects. The FDA requires every drug ad to describe common and potentially serious side effects. For vedolizumab, possible side effects include infusion reactions, allergic reactions, liver problems, and an increased susceptibility to infection. The ad highlights an infection called PML, noting that it's ""a rare, serious, potentially fatal brain infection.""
          Benefits. The voiceover states that ""in clinical trials, Entyvio helped many people achieve long-term relief and remission.""
        
        What else do you need to know?
        As with most drug ads, this ad doesn't provide all the information that's important to know about this medication, especially if you're a person with IBD for whom this drug might be helpful.
        For starters, the ad never explains that diarrhea and abdominal pain are among the most common symptoms of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And while the ad focuses on frequent diarrhea, it never mentions more serious complications, such as

Just three out of 10 American adults are active enough to stay healthy and fit, and nearly four out of 10 admit they aren’t active at all, despite reams of research proving that exercise is a powerful preventive, and sometimes an antidote, for disability and illness. Which side of this divide are you standing on — and why? Maybe you’re not sure what blend of exercise is best. Or perhaps you know exactly what you need to do, but your workouts have become so humdrum that it’s harder than ever to dig up the energy to do them. Do you want to jump-start your sputtering exercise program? Or are you stuck on a plateau and wishing you could kick it up to the next level?

          an increased risk of colorectal cancer
          inflammation in other parts of the body, including joints and eyes.
        
        The ad also omits:
        
          Explaining how moderate to severe Crohn's and ulcerative colitis is defined. Generally, it would include people with either condition who have large areas of intestinal inflammation, deep ulcers in the walls of the intestines, or who have had surgery; and those who haven't responded to other standard treatments.
          Other ways to treat Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Steroids, azathioprine, infliximab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, and other drugs are also options to treat these disorders. 
          The high cost of this drug (up to $52,000/year). For some, health insurance may cover much of this cost, and a discount program is mentioned at the end of the ad (though eligibility details are not provided). Still, for many people with IBD, the cost of expensive drugs like Entyvio is a major barrier to receiving optimal care.
        
        Also troubling is the way the ad skims over two important points:
        
          Little information is provided about PML. The ad doesn't even say what the letters stand for: progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. PML is a virus that can infect the brain, often causing death or severe neurologic disease.
          What benefits does the drug deliver? Only one sentence speaks confidently about benefits, and no details are provided. How often people do taking this drug have at least some relief from their symptoms? How often do they experience remission of symptoms? And how long do these improvements last?
        
        The bottom line
        The ad ends with the young woman driving home after her doctor's visit. She's sitting on a regular seat for the first time. She glances at the rearview mirror and smiles at the toilet that's been relegated to the back of the car. The message is clear: she's better now and doesn't have to worry about having to rush to the toilet since her doctor prescribed vedolizumab.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/should-i-worry-about-the-side-effects-of-proton-pump-inhibitors,Should I worry about the side effects of proton-pump inhibitors?,"Q.
          I have had intermittent heartburn for years. My doctor ordered an upper endoscopy to look at my esophagus and stomach. My esophagus is inflamed due to acid reflux. I was told to stay on prescription-strength pantoprazole indefinitely. But I worry about side effects. If I eat less acidic foods and don't experience heartburn, is it necessary to take this drug to keep my esophagus healthy?
        
        A. Pantoprazole (Protonix) is a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). Drugs in this class are the most potent acid inhibitors. Examples of other PPIs include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), and rabeprazole (AcipHex). Most are available in low doses and less expensive generic formulations over the counter. Doctors can prescribe higher doses if needed.
        There is no simple yes-or-no answer to your question, but here is how I approach this common situation. First, I would ask these questions: Did you have the endoscopy because the heartburn was more frequent or severe? Were you taking any acid blockers before the endoscopy, and if yes, at what dose and for how long?
        These questions are to understand the severity of your esophageal inflammation (esophagitis). If your reflux was severe, or if you had been on treatment for a few weeks before the endoscopy and still had visible esophagitis, your doctor's recommendation sounds correct. Treating esophagitis with a high-dose PPI is not just about controlling symptoms. Persistent severe esophagus inflammation from acid reflux can lead to scarring and narrowing of the lower esophagus. It also increases your risk of developing a condition called Barrett's esophagus, which can lead to cancer.
        Most people who take PPIs have minimal, short-term side effects. PPI use is associated with a slightly increased risk of infections. It's possible to develop lower blood levels of vitamin B12 or magnesium. Studies looking at other long-term concerns regarding bone thinning, dementia, and kidney disease have provided some reassurance that PPIs are not the cause.
        Many people with acid reflux and esophagitis can use less potent anti-acid therapy. Your doctor may advise a repeat upper endoscopy before making any changes, or you might begin to taper down first.
        If you and your doctor decide it's the right time to transition, you will want to do it gradually. Never stop the acid blocker abruptly, as this could lead to rebound heartburn, since your body is used to the medication.
        It's also important to maintain lifestyle changes to reduce acid reflux, including losing weight if needed, not lying down after eating, and avoiding foods that typically cause heartburn.

        The study included more than 59,000 people who wore activity trackers on their wrists for a week. All were part of the UK Biobank, a large database of genetic, lifestyle, and health information from more than a half-million people in the United Kingdom.
        After a median follow-up of nearly seven years, researchers found that people who did more than an hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily had a 74% lower risk of developing diabetes compared with people who did less than five minutes of physical activity per day.
        That finding was true even among people at high genetic risk for diabetes, who are 2.4 times as likely to get diabetes than people at low genetic risk. The study was published online June 5, 2023, by the British Journal of Sports Medicine.

        The study, which pooled findings from six randomized trials, included more than 7,000 people in total. Most received scans to check for plaque in the arteries of their hearts or necks. Each of the studies randomly assigned people to two groups. Half were shown their scan results; the others were either not shown their results or were not scanned. The study follow-ups lasted one to four years.
        Researchers found greater improvements among people who saw images of their plaque buildup. Compared with people who didn't see scans, those who did had lower cholesterol and blood pressure values at the end of the follow-up period, as well as lower overall risk of heart disease. The study was published online May 24, 2023, by JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.

        For the study, researchers pooled results from 30 trials (including a total of nearly 2,400 people) published over the past four decades. All participants were randomly assigned to follow either a vegetarian diet (which included dairy and eggs but no meat), a vegan diet (which omitted all animal products), or an omnivorous diet (which included meat and dairy products). The average duration of the diets was 29 weeks. Compared with people eating an omnivorous diet, those following a vegetarian or vegan diet experienced average drops in levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B of 7%, 10% and 14%, respectively, from levels measured at the start of the study. (Apolipoprotein B is a particle found on LDL as well as other artery-clogging lipoproteins in the blood.)
        Plant-forward diets tend to be higher in healthy unsaturated fats but lower in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat, which likely explains the findings. The study was published online May 24, 2023, in the European Heart Journal.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/after-the-baby-grows-up-how-will-your-heart-fare,"After the baby grows up, how will your heart fare?","Pregnancy is seldom a walk in the park. But if yours was marked by complications such as high blood pressure or diabetes, you probably hoped those hurdles were behind you after your baby was born.
        Hope isn't a strategy, however, when it comes to protecting your health. And it's becoming increasingly evident that certain pregnancy and reproductive factors raise red flags about your cardiovascular health years or decades down the line. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine equates pregnancy to a ""cardiovascular stress test,"" noting that certain complications point toward higher risks for heart attack or stroke later in life.
        ""We now understand that pregnancy is a window into a woman's future health,"" says Dr. Brett Young, an OB/GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        For example, women who had high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia (a condition marked by high blood pressure that can impair function of the heart, kidneys, and other organs) while pregnant later develop chronic high blood pressure at least twice as often as women whose blood pressure remained normal in pregnancy. Women who had these blood pressure problems also have 70% higher rates of diabetes and 30% higher rates of elevated cholesterol later in life, according to a Harvard-led 2018 study in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
        Diabetes or blood pressure complications, estimated to affect 5% to 10% of pregnancies, are on the rise as obesity rates climb and more women decide to have babies later in life.
        ""While they often resolve soon after, those conditions can translate into long-lasting increased risks for heart disease for these women,"" says Dr. Nicolas-Sonny Nguyen, a Boston-area family medicine doctor and clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School. ""Once you've finished having children, years or decades may go by where these health issues may not come up.""
        Common disease features
        New research magnifies these revelations. Pregnancy and childbirth complications can pose deadly implications as long as 50 years later, according to a study published online March 8, 2023, by Circulation.
        The analysis, which used long-term data from more than 46,000 women who gave birth between 1959 and 1966, tracked participants' deaths from any cause until 2016. Pregnancy-related high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, and preterm delivery were all linked to a greater risk of death in the decades following childbirth.
        Meanwhile, problems such as infertility, miscarriage, and stillbirth may be associated with greater stroke risks later in life, according to an analysis published online June 22, 2022, by The BMJ. Researchers reviewed data on nearly 619,000 women ages 32 through 73 from seven countries. Infertility was associated with a 15% higher risk of stroke, while repeated miscarriages were linked to a 37% higher risk. Women who'd had recurrent stillbirths were 44% more likely to die of a hemorrhagic stroke, characterized by uncontrolled bleeding in the brain.
        What's the link? Pregnancy and reproductive difficulties can share common features with cardiovascular disease, including blood vessel problems and fat deposits in blood vessel walls, Dr. Young says.
        ""Pre-eclampsia is a systemwide condition that affects many organs,"" she says. ""We think of it as a disease of the placenta, but the consensus is that it's actually a blood vessel disease that also affects the kidneys, heart, and brain.""
        Similarly, diabetes during pregnancy may signal simmering problems with a woman's insulin production or how efficiently her cells use energy. ""Even if you had gestational diabetes for only a few months of your life in a span of five, six, or more decades, those few months may have made a difference in your risks,"" Dr. Nguyen says.
        The need for check-ups
        The mounting research drives home the importance of preventive care and screenings for women who had complicated pregnancies and deliveries — especially at midlife and beyond, when heart disease risks already increase.
        ""The risks become less silent when women who had these pregnancy conditions reach menopause or beyond,"" Dr. Nguyen says.
        But even younger women — including those whose pregnancies weren't marked by complications — shouldn't skip regular primary care visits. A 2022 study in the journal Hypertension suggests that limited medical follow-up in the year after childbirth may miss high blood pressure in one of 10 new mothers whose blood pressure wasn't elevated during pregnancy.
        If you've dealt with pregnancy or reproductive difficulties, tell your primary clinician and your other doctors. Your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels should be monitored regularly, and any irregularities should be ""treated aggressively,"" Dr. Young says.
        ""Even if a woman had problems during only one of her pregnancies many years ago, that history is very important. It should be part of a conversation for the rest of her life,"" Dr. Nguyen says.
        Also don't ignore even mild symptoms that might be heart disease trouble signs, such as chest pain, unusual fatigue, neck or jaw pain, or shortness of breath.
        ""Talking about symptoms that pop up is important because early recognition is key,"" Dr. Nguyen says. ""Create a platform to have these conversations with your clinicians instead of waiting years, when coronary artery disease has perhaps been brewing for a while.""
        
          
            
              
                High blood pressure during pregnancy also endangers the brain
                Cardiovascular health isn't the only thing that might suffer in the aftermath of pregnancy-related high blood pressure. A new analysis suggests this complication is linked with later cognitive problems as well.
                The study, published online May 9, 2023, by Neurology, involved more than 2,200 women (average age 73), 83% of whom had at least one pregnancy. Every 15 months over an average of five years, participants took nine tests of memory and thinking that evaluated aspects such as processing speed, executive function, language, and overall cognition.
                After assessing the women's medical records for pregnancy-related data, researchers found that those who'd had high blood pressure during pregnancy experienced a greater decline in many aspects of thinking skills compared with women who maintained normal blood pressure while pregnant. The effects were even more pronounced among women who'd had pre-eclampsia, a more severe pregnancy-related blood pressure disorder.
                The findings aren't surprising, given that blood vessel problems that may contribute to pregnancy complications can also affect vessels that carry blood to the brain, says Dr. Brett Young, an OB/GYN and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The results also suggest monitoring and managing blood pressure during and after pregnancy could pay important dividends for brain health later in life.
                The findings are consistent with the understanding that pregnancy can illuminate a woman's future health risks, including many conditions that affect the blood vessels, Dr. Young says. ""The brain,"" she says, ""requires healthy blood vessels just like the placenta does — it's a system based on blood vessels.""
              
            
          
        
        Big-picture risks
        Pregnancy complications, of course, are far from the only factor that influences a woman's future pregnancy risk. Also important are family history, race, diet, weight, and physical activity levels.
        ""It's important to know that heart disease affects one in five women, regardless of age,"" Dr. Nguyen says. ""Some women may think, 'I'm 35 and had my kids, I'm healthy, and there's no way for me to get heart disease.' But that's not true. I emphasize this to encourage women to optimize their lifestyle.""
        ""When you see your health care providers, be honest and thorough about your medical history, especially relating to your pregnancies,"" says Dr. Nguyen.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-apple-cider-vinegar-curb-appetite,Can apple cider vinegar curb appetite?,"Q.
          My friend says she drinks apple cider vinegar at bedtime to help her eat less and lose weight. Could it work?
        
        A. Scientific evidence doesn't support drinking apple cider vinegar to dampen appetite or help with weight loss. But even on a commonsense level, it's not likely. Here's why: changing only a single part of our routine — such as drinking a shot of apple cider vinegar each evening — can't help us shed excess pounds as effectively as broader efforts that include changing our overall diet and exercising more often.
        Beyond that, apple cider vinegar's high acidity level makes bedtime a less-than-ideal time to drink it. Anyone prone to heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) should avoid eating or drinking anything acidic at least 30 to 60 minutes before sleep to lessen the odds of uncomfortable burning in the chest. Over time, drinking undiluted vinegar can also erode your tooth enamel.
        People who still want to consume apple cider vinegar can do it more safely and comfortably if they mix a small amount into a large glass of water or combine it with other ingredients in salad dressings.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/weekly-aerobic-exercise-may-help-reduce-flu-and-pneumonia-deaths,Weekly aerobic exercise may help reduce flu and pneumonia deaths,"Flu season runs from October through April. Getting the annual flu vaccine when it is available (usually in late September) can offer protection. In addition, doing enough aerobic exercise may help reduce the risk of dying from flu or pneumonia, according to a study published online May 16, 2023, by the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
        Guidelines advise people to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Researchers examined exercise data collected from 577,909 adults from 1998 to 2018 who were followed for an average of nine years. They found that people who met the recommendation were 36% less likely to die from pneumonia or influenza than those who did not exercise. For people who exercised 301 to 600 minutes per week, the risk was cut in half.
        However, there was no extra protection from doing more than 600 minutes. The researchers speculated that the benefit came from aerobic exercise helping to strengthen the body's immune response.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/eating-junk-food-may-affect-deep-sleep,Eating junk food may affect deep sleep,"Want better-quality sleep? Cut back on junk food. Researchers found that eating an unhealthy diet high in processed food can affect people's deep sleep (also known as slow-wave sleep). During this sleep stage, the pituitary gland in the brain releases a burst of growth hormone, which helps build and repair muscles, bones, and other tissues. Deep sleep also boosts cognitive function and memory.
        The study, published online May 28, 2023, by Obesity, looked at 15 healthy men with normal sleep habits (sleeping an average of seven to nine hours per night). The participants ate either a healthy or unhealthy diet for one week. The two diets contained the same number of calories, adjusted to each individual's daily requirements. However, the unhealthy diet had a higher content of sugar and saturated fat and included many processed foods.
        After a week on the diet, the participants spent two nights at a sleep laboratory where their slow-wave brain activity was measured. They first slept a regular night that matched their usual sleep schedule. The next night they were kept awake past their regular bedtime and then allowed to catch up on their sleep to mimic disrupted sleep. After several weeks, the study was repeated, with everyone switching to the other diet and revisiting the sleep lab.
        The researchers found that when participants followed the unhealthier diet they had poorer-quality deep sleep (indicated by a decrease in slow-wave activity). This was true for both normal and disrupted sleep. They noted that it is difficult to draw conclusions from only one week of poor eating. Still, the findings suggest there may be important ways diet can influence sleep quality.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/try-this-all-aboard-for-paddleboarding,Try this: All aboard for paddleboarding,"Paddleboarding has surfaced as a popular water sport. You stand or kneel on a ""surfboard,"" and using a long paddle (eight inches more than your height), glide across the surface as if walking on water.
        There are many types of paddleboards. Soft-top boards are ideal for beginners, and inflatable ones are perfect for travel and easy storage.
        Paddleboards come in different sizes and thicknesses to match a person's weight and skill level. They range in length from 10 feet to 12 feet and in width from 29 to 35 inches.
        Paddleboarding is fun and a great stress buster, and it also can improve your movements on land.
        For instance, it helps with balance. The paddle's angle and depth almost always change throughout each stroke, so your muscles have to react to the changes in resistance so you don't fall.
        ""This variety is similar to the real world, where you and your muscles have to quickly respond to different movements and tension, like if you have a misstep and need to catch yourself,"" says Kathleen Salas, a physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Network.
        Paddleboarding can also help strengthen key muscles used in daily movements, like those in the core, back, arms, and shoulders.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/rising-up-from-a-fall,Rising up from a fall,"Prevention is the best protection against falls. Exercising, working on balance, and fall-proofing your home are essential. But if you take a tumble, and you're uninjured, can you safely get back up?
        ""Your body requires certain movements to rise from the ground that we don't always practice or do as well as we age,"" says Janice McGrail, physical therapist and clinical specialist with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Network. ""This is also why it's often difficult for older adults to get up and down in everyday life, like when they're kneeling in the garden, looking for something under the bed, or playing on the floor with the grandkids.""
        Exercises that can help you rise from a seated position and improve your daily up-and-down movements are the kneel-to-stand, crawling, and the sit-to-stand.
        ""Practicing these also can make you feel more confident about being active and able to live independently,"" says McGrail. ""The moves also are a way to gauge your current fitness, flexibility, and mobility and identify areas where you need to improve.""
        Sit-to-stand
        
          Muscles worked: core, legs, hips
        
        This movement helps you practice rising from a seated floor position and is an excellent test of balance, coordination, and overall wellness, as it requires many physical skills.
        Sit down on the floor with your legs crossed or straight out. Now stand up again. (This can be a difficult movement, especially for people with sore knees, arthritis, or poor balance, so practice with someone next to you for safety.) Note how you used your body for support.
        Repeat the movement again, only this time, grade your effort. Beginning with a score of 10, subtract one point each time you do one of the following for support while sitting or standing:
        
          use your hand
          use your knee
          use your forearm
          use one hand on the knee or thigh
          use the side of your leg
          lose your balance at any time.
        
        For example, take off one point if you sat with no problem but had to use either a hand or a knee to get up. If you had to use both hands and both knees, deduct four points (one point for each hand and knee). If you can sit on the floor and stand without assistance, you scored a perfect 10. If you cannot get up at all, your score is zero. Ideally, you want a score of eight or higher.
        Kneel-to-stand
        
          Muscles worked: core, hips, thighs
        
        When you're on the ground, you often need to stabilize yourself in a kneeling position before you can stand. To practice this move, place a pillow, cushion, or folded towel on the floor. From a standing position, kneel so one knee is on the padding and the other leg is bent, so you are in a ""marriage proposal"" position. Stay there for one or two seconds, and then stand up.
        If needed, push your hand against the bent knee for leverage, or do the exercise next to a chair or table and use it for assistance. Repeat the down-and-up movement five to 10 times. Then repeat, kneeling with the other leg, the same number of times.
        Crawling
        
          Muscles worked: core, shoulders, hips
        
        If you fall, you might need to crawl to a couch or chair or another place where you can lift yourself up.
        To practice crawling, get into a hands-and-knees position on the floor with your wrists under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. To crawl, move your right hand and left knee forward, then vice versa. Crawl in one direction for 10 counts, then turn around and crawl back.
        
          
            
              
                Plan for a soft landing
                You can't always avoid a fall, but you may reduce injury by controlling how you fall. Falls happen quickly, and it can be challenging to think fast, but here are some strategies to help soften your landing.
                
                  Lean forward into the fall, which gives you some control over direction.
                  Fall sideways, if possible.
                  Turn your shoulder into the fall to protect your head.
                  Fall like a sack of beans — relax everything.
                  Fall on the soft, fleshy places, like your buttocks and thighs. These areas have more protection and are lower to the ground.
                  As you complete the fall, try to roll to your side in a ball. This will spread the impact to reduce injury and stop you from rolling farther.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/exercise-tied-to-reduced-risks-of-dying-from-flu-or-pneumonia,Exercise tied to reduced risks of dying from flu or pneumonia,"Here's some motivation to keep exercising this fall and winter: Exercise, even just a little, is linked to significantly lower risk of death from flu or pneumonia, according to a study published online May 16, 2023, by the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Researchers evaluated the survey responses of more than 577,000 adults who reported their health and exercise habits and were followed for nine years. Compared with people who said they didn't meet the guidelines for weekly physical activity (150 minutes of aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, plus two or more sessions of muscle strengthening), people who said they met both guidelines had a 48% lower risk of dying from flu or pneumonia during the study period. Even if participants reported doing only aerobic exercise, below recommended amounts, the risks of dying from flu or pneumonia were still 21% lower, compared with people who didn't exercise. The study was observational and doesn't prove that exercise prevents these deaths in people who get sick. But study authors say the link is plausible, since exercise is associated with strong immune systems and lower rates of heart disease and stroke (two risk factors for fatal complications of flu and pneumonia). So even if you aren't up to meeting exercise recommendations, remember that any activity that works your heart and lungs could have big payoffs for you this winter and all year through.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/chronic-stomach-pain-in-children-whats-the-most-common-cause-202308232964,Chronic stomach pain in children: What's the most common cause?,"The most common cause of chronic stomach pain in children isn't anything you can find on a test or cure with a medicine. And that can make it very challenging to diagnose — and treat.
        You may not have ever heard of functional abdominal pain. Yet it ranks as the most common cause of stomach pain lasting two months or more in children and teens.
        What is functional abdominal pain?
        The mind and the body are tightly connected in ways that we are still working to understand, and this is particularly true of the mind and the gastrointestinal tract. Stress — particularly chronic stress, depression, and anxiety — can lead to pain that is very real. Sometimes the pain is the only symptom of stress, especially in children who are high-achieving or tend to hide their emotions.
        Sometimes the pain doesn't start from stress but from an infection or other illness, and stays once the illness is gone or adds additional pain to the illness while it is being treated. Worry about the pain and its possible cause can make things worse. The nervous system of the gut can go into overdrive.
        What are common symptoms of functional abdominal pain?
        Children with functional abdominal pain can have mild symptoms that just show up occasionally, or they can have more severe symptoms that interfere with daily life. Along with stomachaches, they can have nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea — or some combination of all of them. They may have a poor appetite or complain of feeling full very quickly.
        When should you contact your child's doctor?
        It's important to check in with your doctor if your child is having chronic stomachaches. They should have a physical examination, and your doctor may want to do some testing, such as blood or stool tests, as there are many medical conditions that can cause chronic stomachaches.
        It's particularly important to call your doctor if your child
        
          is losing weight
          has blood in their stool
          has severe pain
          has fever, rashes, sore joints, or other signs of illness.
        
        If your doctor finds that your child's examination and tests are normal, and they aren't losing weight, chances are that your child has functional abdominal pain.
        For some families, getting this diagnosis sounds like the doctors are saying that it is all in the child's head. But nothing could be further from the truth. It is very real pain — but it is not being caused by something dangerous, which is very good news.
        How can you help a child diagnosed with functional abdominal pain?
        There are many ways to help a child who has functional abdominal pain once the diagnosis is made. They include:
        
          Understanding and managing stressors in the child's life, if there are any
          Medications recommended by your health care team can help with symptoms, such as laxatives for constipation
          Cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a kind of therapy that teaches strategies for managing pain, as well as managing any stress or sadness that can be contributing
          Meditation, yoga, and other ways for a child to relax and regulate how they react to their world
          For some children, a low-FODMAP diet can be helpful
          Probiotics, peppermint oil preparations, and some other supplements are sometimes used to help soothe and prevent pain.
        
        Most children with functional abdominal pain can receive care from their pediatrician. Regular visits are a good idea, to check in to see how things are going and adjust any treatments. If things aren't getting better, a referral to a gastroenterologist can be helpful.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/quick-fixes-to-keep-you-from-falling,Quick fixes to keep you from falling,"Home is where the heart is; unfortunately, it's also where about half of all falls take place. Older adults tend to spend a lot more time at home, and they don't realize there are things around their home that can make them lose their balance and fall.
        With falls sending about three million older people to emergency departments each year and causing 95% of hip fractures among older adults, it's time to take steps to protect your mobility and independence. Look around your home with this list, evaluate potential fall risks, and make necessary fixes in every room.
        
          In the bedroom
          The risk: A lack of lighting for nighttime trips to the bathroom or kitchen. Many older adults have difficulty with vision, especially in the dark. If you can't see things, you may easily bump into them and fall.
          The fix: Light the pathways you know you'll use when it's dark in your home. Install night lights or motion sensor lights.
        
        
          In the living room
          The risk: Furniture that blocks the flow of traffic; rugs that could slip; loose wall-to-wall carpeting; floor clutter.
          The fixes: Get rid of books, baskets, boxes, electrical cords, newspapers, shoes, and other small items that may get in your path. Rearrange furniture that blocks the flow of traffic, such as ottomans or chairs. Remove loose throw rugs, and if you must keep large area rugs, use double-sided tape to prevent them from slipping. Have wall-to-wall carpeting tightened.
        
        
          In the bathroom
          The risk: Loose throw rugs; slippery floors, showers, and tubs.
          The fixes: Remove throw rugs. Use nonslip mats and treads, which boost traction. Install grab bars near showers, bathtubs, and toilets. Avoid grab bars that ""stick on"" to tile showers with suction, which are less reliable than metal grab bars attached to wall studs. Use a tub seat or a walk-in shower.
        
        
          In the hallway
          The risk: Uneven flooring; throw rugs; lack of support; poor lighting.
          The fixes: Install overhead lighting and night lights, so you can see where you're going, and replace lightbulbs if any are missing or burned out. Install handrails for support, and make sure existing handrails are tightly secured to the wall. Remove throw rugs, and fix any uneven or broken floorboards.
        
        
          Outside the home
          The risk: Crumbling outdoor pathways and steps; slippery decks and patios; poor lighting; lack of support.
          The fixes: Install lights at the door and along pathways. Install handrails. Fix loose bricks, crumbling cement, or rotting pieces of wood on outdoor steps. Add nonslip treads to patios and decks.
          
            
              
                
                  4 risky habits to break
                  Hazards in the home aren't the only things jeopardizing your mobility and independence. Bad habits can be risky, too. Address the following behaviors if you recognize them.
                  
                    1. Ignoring health conditions
                  
                  Poor vision, painful joints, muscle weakness, poor balance, and medication side effects can all contribute to falls. Talk to your doctor about addressing these conditions. Treatment may be as simple as getting a new eyeglasses prescription, a change in a medication dose, or a course of physical therapy.
                  
                    2. Skipping assistive devices
                  
                  Many people think they don't have to use their walker or cane if they just need to go 10 feet, so they use furniture for support. But a piece of furniture doesn't hold up, and people fall. Get your balance evaluated if you can't walk without holding on to furniture. If you've been fitted with a device, use it all the time.
                  
                    3. Getting up too quickly
                  
                  Your reaction time slows as you age. Allow extra time when you get up from the bed or the couch. Take your time. Sit up, count to 10, and then count to 10 when you stand up, before taking a step. This allows your body to adjust to the new positions, and gives you more stability.
                  
                    4. Turning quickly or reaching up
                  
                  Because of age-related stiffness in your spine, simple movements such as reaching up or turning cause your entire body to sway. Widen your stance while turning, and rearrange commonly used items to places below shoulder level.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/skin-in-the-game-two-common-skin-problems-and-solutions-for-men-202111222643,Skin in the game: Common skin problems and solutions for men,"When I was on the junior varsity basketball team in high school, I wasn't surprised when I developed a case of itchy, flaky athlete's foot. After all, I was an ""athlete,"" so I assumed it was a sign of dedication and hard work.
        I was shocked when my mother told me the truth: it was due to poor foot hygiene, not my dribbling skills.
        Fast-forward almost four decades, and I'm much more diligent about skin care. Still, some skin issues plague me at times, like they do many men. Here is a look at two common problems and solutions –– as well as advice to help you avoid getting them.
        Dry skin
        Symptoms of dry skin include scaly patches (with or without redness), itching, and overall dryness. You can get dry skin year-round — from the heavy heat of summer to the bitter cold of winter. Sun exposure damages skin, leaving it thinner and less likely to hold in moisture over time. Also, aging skin produces less of the natural oils that keep skin lubricated.
        Treatment
        If you have dry skin, the first line of defense is a moisturizer that softens and smooths skin with water and lipids (fats). Some moisturizers attract water to the skin and seal it in. Others prevent moisture loss by coating skin with a thick, impermeable layer.
        
          Petroleum jelly. This waxy, greasy substance stops water loss without clogging pores. It can be used by itself but is also an ingredient in many moisturizers and ointments. Because petroleum jelly doesn't contain water, it's best used while the skin is still damp after bathing to seal in moisture.
          Mineral oil. Mineral oil has the same effect but without a greasy feeling. It also should be used while skin is damp.
          Moisturizing lotions and creams. These products contain both water and oils. They're less greasy and more cosmetically appealing than petroleum jelly or oils. Look for moisturizers with at least one of the following ingredients: glycerin, urea, pyroglutamic acid, sorbitol, lactic acid, lactate salts, or alpha hydroxy acids.
        
        Prevention
        Try a few changes to help prevent dry skin:
        
          Add moisture to the air with a humidifier or a pan of water set atop the radiator.
          In the shower or bath, use lukewarm water (hot water can dry the skin by stripping it of natural oils).
          Choose nondrying soaps with no abrasives or irritants. Super-fatted soaps or cleansing bars are less drying than regular, liquid, or antibacterial soaps.
          To retain the water your skin absorbs while showering or bathing, apply jelly, oil, or moisturizer immediately afterward.
        
        Athlete's foot
        Athlete's foot is caused by dermatophytes, a group of fungi on the surface of the skin. Tell-tale signs include intense itching; cracked, blistered, or peeling areas of skin, especially between the toes; and redness and scaling on the soles.
        Dermatophytes thrive in warm, moist environments like pools, showers, and locker rooms where people walk with bare feet. The warm, moist environment of sweaty socks and shoes encourages them to grow.
        Treatment
        If you have athlete's foot, first try an over-the-counter antifungal ointment, cream, or powder, such as clotrimazole (Lotrimin AF, Mycelex, generic), terbinafine (Lamisil AT, Silka,), or miconazole (Lotrimin AF spray, Micatin). It can take weeks for an infection to improve, and recurrences are common. If symptoms don't improve after several weeks, consult a doctor, who may prescribe antifungal pills.
        Prevention
        Keeping feet clean and dry is the best way to ward off athlete's foot. Also, do the following:
        
          Wash your feet well every day, and wear a clean pair of socks after your bath or shower.
          Take time to dry your feet thoroughly (including each toe and especially the web space between the toes) after you bathe, shower, or swim.
          Wear flip-flops or sandals around public pools and in gym locker rooms and showers.
          Wear moisture-wicking socks that absorb sweat.
          Don't wear the same shoes two days in a row. Give shoes a 24-hour break between wearings to air out and dry.",Matthew Solan,"August 22, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heat-rash-how-to-spot-it-and-what-to-do-202308182968,Heat rash: How to spot it and what to do,"The first two weeks of July were the Earth's hottest on human record, and people across the country continue to suffer from lingering, suffocating heat waves. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued repeated warnings and tips about recognizing and preventing heat-related illnesses, like heat stroke, heat exhaustion, and heat cramps.
        But one heat-related illness that people do not always recognize is heat rash.
        ""Heat rash can indicate that your exposure to excessive heat could lead to other serious heat-related issues, if not addressed,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, a dermatologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""While heat rash is not dangerous in itself, sustained exposure to high heat can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, so it's important to note any early signs that your body is struggling with the heat.""
        What are the signs of heat rash?
        Heat rash is also known as miliaria or prickly heat. It is caused when ducts from eccrine sweat glands that lead to the skin's surface are blocked or inflamed.
        Eccrine sweat glands help your body maintain a steady temperature. When your internal temperature rises, these glands release water that rises to the surface of your skin through tiny ducts. There, it quickly evaporates, cooling your skin and the blood beneath.
        However, sweat ducts may get blocked when you sweat excessively in hot temperatures, particularly if skin folds or tight-fitting clothes hinder their function.
        Sweat is then trapped beneath the skin. This triggers inflammation, which leads to the appearance of small, itchy red bumps, similar to tiny pimples or blisters. In people with darker skin tones, these small, itchy bumps may not appear red, but will look slightly darker than surrounding skin.
        Where and when is heat rash likely to occur?
        Heat rash can appear on the neck, scalp, chest, groin, or elbow creases.
        ""Heat rash can occur any time the body sweats, so it is common in hot, humid climates, during hospitalizations, from fever, and during exercise,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        Heat rash also can occur in newborns, as their eccrine sweat glands are not fully developed. In newborns, heat rash looks like very thin blisters or water drops widely distributed on the face, trunk, arms, and legs. Call your pediatrician for advice if you notice a rash like this.
        How can you treat heat rash?
        Heat rash in adults is easy to treat with home remedies. ""The techniques to relieve symptoms also can help prevent heat rash for adults and babies,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        
          Cool down. The first step is to get out of the heat and cool and dry your skin. Use a fan or air conditioner, take a cool shower, or apply cool compresses to the affected areas. It's important to know that some people are more vulnerable to heat, and to make plans to help stay safe when temperatures are dangerously high.
          Prevent irritation. To prevent skin irritation, avoid wearing clothes made from synthetic materials, which can trap heat. (While dry-fit clothing helps to wicks away moisture from the skin, it often can be too tight fitting.) Instead, wear light, loose-fitting cotton clothing that allows airflow over your skin. If a heat rash occurs around your groin area, avoid wearing undergarments until it clears up.
          Try anti-itch products. Use an over-the-counter topical corticosteroid cream or calamine lotion for itching. However, avoid baby powder, oily or greasy moisturizers, and sunscreen, as they can further block sweat ducts.
        
        Heat rash typically goes away within one to two days once you cool down your body. More severe heat rashes can last a week or longer. See your doctor (or follow up with your pediatrician) if a heat rash has not cleared up after a week. Also seek immediate care if you experience pain, intense itching, or the rash appears infected.",Matthew Solan,"August 18, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/leprosy-in-florida-how-worried-should-we-be-202308162966,Leprosy in Florida: How worried should we be?,"The media uproar that swirled a few weeks ago around leprosy in the US drew attention away from ongoing heat and extreme weather that pose far more danger to most of us. But does a single case of a man diagnosed with leprosy in central Florida suggest that anyone anywhere in the US could get leprosy? Might this become the next pandemic? Just how worried should we be?
        Read on to set the record straight about leprosy. (Spoiler alert: there will be mention of armadillos.)
        Why did leprosy make the news?
        In August, one case of leprosy in central Florida was described in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. This report was widely covered by the news media, with headlines like ""CDC confirms leprosy outbreak in Florida: What to know if you're traveling to the state"" (WKYC) and ""Central Florida is a hot spot for leprosy, report says"" (CNN).
        One reason for concern raised by experts was the fact that the man diagnosed had no identifiable risk factors for the disease. That is, he had not traveled to a place where leprosy is common and had no contact with anyone who had the disease. Past research has suggested the organism that causes leprosy can survive in soil. And that raised the possibility that this man's work as a landscaper put him at risk for leprosy.
        What is leprosy?
        Leprosy, or Hansen's disease, is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae bacteria. (That's a close relative of the organism that causes tuberculosis.) This ancient disease, which affects skin, nerves, and linings of the eyes and upper respiratory tract, is described in some of the earliest human writings (including the Old Testament), and genetically identified in archeological remains dating back to 2000 BC.
        Common symptoms of leprosy include:
        
          red and/or thickened patches on the skin
          reduced sensation, numbness, or weakness in the hands or feet
          nonhealing wounds, blisters, and cracks in the skin of the hands or feet.
        
        Left untreated, this may lead to skin deformities. Surgical amputations may be necessary to control skin ulcers that fail to heal or are chronically infected.
        How does leprosy spread?
        Usually, the infection spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets shared during prolonged, close contact. Coughing or sneezing, for example, can release respiratory droplets, which can be breathed in by people who are nearby.
        Some cases of leprosy have been linked to animal contact, such as the nine-banded armadillo and Eurasian red squirrels.
        However, in about a third of cases, no clear risk factor can be identified.
        How common is leprosy?
        For most people in the US, leprosy is not a major health concern. In recent years, about 180 cases of leprosy have been diagnosed annually. Though this represents an uptick from fewer than 100 cases in 1999 and 2000, the disease remains rare in the US.
        Worldwide, it's a different story: according to the World Health Organization, more than 200,000 cases in 120 countries are diagnosed each year. The highest numbers of cases are in Brazil, India, and Indonesia.
        Has leprosy become common in Florida?
        No. There have been about 20 cases per year in Florida since 2015. As is true nationally, this represents an increase from prior years.
        But some experts speculate that leprosy may be endemic now in central Florida, where about 80% of the state's cases are diagnosed. Endemic means there are enough sources of infection (such as infected people or animals) in a particular area to allow the disease to spread, even if no new cases are brought in from elsewhere.
        Since some people with infection have no risk factors for the disease, it's possible leprosy has become endemic there. But that remains unproven.
        Myth versus truth: Common misconceptions about leprosy
        Misunderstanding fuels stigma and discrimination against people who have leprosy. Maybe you've heard some of these falsehoods.
        The myth: Leprosy is extremely easy to spread. In the past, this myth led to isolation of people with leprosy in ""leper colonies"" that quarantined entire communities of people with the infection.
        The facts: About 95% of people are naturally immune to leprosy. And, because spread of infection between people requires close and prolonged contact, it's not nearly as contagious as many other infections. So it's not readily spread by being in a room with an infected person, or by touch. And, within one week of treatment (see below), a person with leprosy is no longer contagious. As a result, isolation from others is unnecessary.
        
          The myth: Leprosy causes parts of the body, such as fingers or ears or the nose, to fall off.
        
        The facts: Body parts do not fall off. Sometimes surgical amputations are needed to treat nonhealing wounds and infections, two complications of longstanding nerve damage related to leprosy.
        
          The myth: There are no treatments for leprosy.
        
        The facts: There are effective antibiotics for leprosy. To cure the infection, people may need to take a combination of different antibiotics for a year or more.
        The bottom line
        Some of the news coverage on the case of leprosy in Florida seems more dire than necessary. In fact, the risk of developing leprosy in central Florida, or elsewhere in the US, remains exceedingly low.
        And it's highly unlikely leprosy will become the next pandemic. However, some experts predict that vulnerable populations in the US, such as homeless people living in close contact with poor hygiene and inadequate medical care, could experience outbreaks of leprosy in the future.
        While risk seems low now, it's a good idea to keep leprosy in mind if you have unexplained rashes or nerve damage, especially if you live in a place where the disease is common or have had contact with an infected person. Otherwise, there's little reason to have leprosy on your short list of health concerns.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-to-prevent-kidney-stones,Preventing kidney stones,"If you've ever had a kidney stone, you surely remember it. The pain can be unbearable, coming in waves until the tiny stone passes through your urinary plumbing and out of the body. Kidney stones are more common in men than in women, and they tend to recur. In about half of people who have had one, kidney stones strike again within seven years without preventive measures.
        Preventing kidney stones is not complicated, but it does take some determination. It means drinking plenty of fluids and following a diet that is low in sodium, with limited animal protein and age-appropriate intake of calcium.
        
          
            
              
                Where do kidney stones get stuck?
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        Causes of kidney stones
        Kidney stones form when certain chemicals become concentrated enough in your urine to form crystals. The crystals grow into larger masses (stones), which may make their way through the urinary tract. If the stone gets stuck somewhere and blocks the flow of urine, it causes pain.
        Most stones occur when calcium combines with one of two substances: oxalate or phosphorous. Stones can also form from uric acid, which forms as the body metabolizes protein.
        To prevent kidney stones, you need to prevent the conditions that make stones more likely to form. Here are the most important steps:
        Drink plenty of water: Drinking extra water dilutes the substances in urine that lead to stones. Strive to drink enough fluids to pass 2 liters of urine a day, which is roughly eight standard 8-ounce cups. It may help to include some citrus beverages, like lemonade and orange juice. The citrate in these beverages help to block stone formation.
        Get the calcium you need: Getting too little calcium in your diet can cause oxalate levels to rise and cause kidney stones. To prevent this, make sure to take in an amount of calcium appropriate to your age. Ideally, obtain calcium from foods, since some studies have linked taking calcium supplements to kidney stones.
        Reduce sodium: A high-sodium diet can trigger kidney stones because it increases the amount of calcium in your urine. A low-sodium diet is therefore recommended for the stone prone. Federal guidelines suggest limiting total daily sodium intake to 2,300 mg. If sodium has contributed to kidney stones in the past, try to reduce daily sodium to 1,500 mg.
        Limit animal protein: Eating too much animal protein, such as meat, eggs, and seafood, boosts the level of uric acid and could lead to kidney stones. A high-protein diet also reduces levels of citrate, the chemical in urine that helps prevent stones from forming. If you're prone to stones, limit your daily meat intake to a quantity that is no bigger than a pack of playing cards. This is also a heart-healthy portion.
        Avoid stone-forming foods: Beets, chocolate, spinach, rhubarb, tea, and most nuts are rich in oxalate, and colas are rich in phosphate, both of which can contribute to kidney stones. If you suffer from stones, your doctor may advise you to avoid these foods or to consume them in smaller amounts.
        For everyone else, particular foods and drinks are unlikely to trigger kidney stones unless consumed in extremely high amounts. Some studies have shown that men who take high doses of vitamin C in the form of supplements are at slightly higher risk of kidney stones. That may be because the body converts vitamin C into oxalate.
        What a doctor can do for you
        Individuals with recurrent episodes of kidney stones should have an evaluation to determine what factors may have contributed to the stones. Based on the tests, your doctor can provide specific dietary advice and, in some cases, medications and dietary supplements.",Unknown,"August 15, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/8-ways-to-get-constipation-relief,8 ways to get constipation relief,"Most healthy adults have bowel movements three times a day to three times a week. Constipation refers to bowel movements that occur less often than expected or when the stool is hard, dry, and difficult to pass. Though constipation may be a common problem, it is still uncomfortable and stressful when it strikes.
        The good news is that most people with simple constipation can get relief with at-home treatments such as diet changes, hydration or judicious use of laxatives. Here are top ways to get constipation relief:
        1. Dietary fiber
        One of the first steps you can take to relieve constipation is to increase your intake of fiber through your diet. Fiber needs vary by age and sex, but generally adults should get 22 to 34 grams of fiber a day.
        There are two different types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Both types of fiber are important for health, digestion, and preventing diseases. But they act differently in the body.
        Soluble fiber absorbs the water in your food. In doing so, it turns to gel, which slows digestion. Some types of soluble fiber may help lower cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. Soluble fiber is found in the following foods:
        
          Oat bran
          Barley
          Nuts
          Seeds
          Beans
          Lentils
          Peas
          Some fruits and vegetables
        
        Insoluble fiber, on the other hand, doesn't absorb water and adds bulk to your stool. It can help food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestine, relieving constipation. Insoluble fiber can be found in foods such as:
        
          Wheat bran
          Vegetables
          Whole grains
        
        You can check the fiber content of common foods and drinks on the USDA food sources of dietary fiber page.
        Tip: Leave the skin on fruits and vegetables to increase fiber.
        2. Fiber supplements
        Because dietary fiber provides a host of health benefits, you should aim for getting as much of your daily fiber as you can through foods. However, only about 5% of the U.S. population achieves the recommended level of dietary fiber consumption.
        For individuals who are not obtaining their daily fiber needs through diet, fiber supplements are a convenient way to enhance a low-fiber diet. Popular fiber supplements include the brand names Metamucil, All-Bran, and Citrucel.
        Fiber supplements vary in their active ingredients. Metamucil's active ingredient is the soluble fiber, psyllium. Citrucel's active ingredient, methylcellulose, is also a soluble fiber. However, the active ingredient in All-Bran is the insoluble fiber, wheat bran.
        Fiber supplements are among the safest ways to promote regular bowel movements, though they do act slowly and can cause gas and bloating. You should drink plenty of fluids when taking supplements.
        Because there are many different types of fiber supplement to choose from, with some offering other health benefits, you should speak with your doctor about the right fiber supplement for you.
        3. Hydration
        Keeping hydrated is an important action to take for constipation relief. Water, other liquids, and foods with a high water content can help fiber work better, making stool softer and easier to pass.
        Good fluid choices include:
        
          Water
          Naturally sweetened fruit juices
          Vegetable juices
          Clear soups
        
        Staying hydrated is good for your overall health and can help you avoid getting constipated in the first place. How much water should you drink? Most people need about four to six cups of plain water each day. But it may be surprising to learn that optimal water intake is an individualized number.
        4. Osmotic laxatives
        The name may sound technical, but osmotic laxatives are a class of medicines that include products you may be very familiar with, such as milk of magnesia.
        These laxatives use natural salts, magnesium salts, or undigested sugars to draw water into the large intestine, softening and loosening the stool. MiraLax is another example of an osmotic laxative.
        5. Stool softeners
        Stool softeners add moisture to stools to make them softer and easier to pass. Docusate is one example of a stool softener.
        Stool softeners are often recommended for people who should avoid straining, such as people who have hemorrhoids or have recently had abdominal surgery.
        6. Lubricants
        Lubricants, such as mineral oil, help stools slide out with more ease. They may be a good choice if your stools feel stuck low in your bowels, if you have an internal tear or ""fissure,"" or if you have pain from hemorrhoids during bowel movements. Mineral oil is taken by mouth and can cause pneumonia if aspirated into the lungs.
        7. Stimulant laxatives
        Stimulant laxatives provide constipation relief by causing the intestines to contract more frequently or more forcefully, encouraging stool to move through the colon. Stimulant laxatives that contain senna, cascara, or bisacodyl, are more aggressive. These medicines may relieve constipation that is severe or has not responded to other treatments.
        Because of side effects, as well as the possibility of the large intestine becoming dependent on their use, stimulant laxatives should only be used as directed and only for brief periods.
        Stimulant laxatives can be taken by mouth or inserted into the rectum as a suppository. When taken as a suppository, stimulant laxatives can work in 15-60 minutes. Taken by mouth, stimulant laxatives can cause a bowel movement in 6 to 8 hours,
        8. Enema
        Enemas are another option for constipation relief. They mechanically flush stool from the rectum and lower part of the large intestine.
        An enema works by loosening the stool in the rectum, thereby triggering the rectal muscles to squeeze as a reaction to their being stretched. A traditional enema is done with a bag of liquid (usually a mixture of salt and water) attached to a plastic tube with a tapered tip. After the tip is inserted into the anus, the enema fluid can be emptied into the rectum. The fluid is then expelled, washing stool out with it.
        When to call your doctor
        If self-care treatments don't work, you should see your doctor for constipation relief. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to treat your constipation.
        If you have fecal impaction (a large lump of dry, hard stool that stays stuck in the rectum), the hard stool may have to be removed by a doctor or nurse using a lubricated, gloved finger inserted in the rectum. This procedure can be painful, so a topical anesthetic is often applied. Some people may need to be sedated.
        Typically, an enema is given after the hard stool is removed. A high-fiber diet, stool-softening medication, or laxative may be recommended to promote regular bowel movements.",Jenette Restivo,"August 10, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/common-celiac-disease-symptoms,Common celiac disease symptoms,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that mainly affects the gastrointestinal tract. In people with celiac disease, an allergic reaction is triggered when gluten (a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley) is ingested. Over time, the immune reactions triggered by gluten inflame and damage small structures on the surface of the intestine.
        Unmanaged celiac disease can cause uncomfortable digestive symptoms, as well as symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Some symptoms result from inflammation in the intestines, while other symptoms stem from a lack of nutrients, due to the failure of the damaged intestine to digest food properly.
        The symptoms of celiac disease vary so widely that there is no such thing as a typical case. Some people with celiac disease experience mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, which can delay a medical diagnosis.
        Digestive symptoms
        Digestive symptoms of celiac disease are more common in children than adults. Children generally develop symptoms only after they start eating foods that contain gluten.
        Digestive symptoms of celiac disease may include:
        
          
            bloating
          
          
            diarrhea
          
          constipation
          gas
          
            lactose intolerance
          
          loose, greasy, bulky, foul-smelling stools
          nausea or vomiting
          abdominal pain.
        
        Non-digestive symptoms
        Some people with celiac disease experience symptoms that affect other parts of the body. Problems associated with celiac disease or caused by poor absorption of nutrients include:
        
          bone or joint pain
          iron-deficiency anemia
          weight loss
          arthritis
          fatigue
          bone loss
          tingling or numbness in the hands or feet
          dermatitis herpetiformis (a skin condition characterized by extremely itchy bumps or blisters)
          depression, irritability, or mood changes
          delayed start or missed menstrual periods
          infertility or repeated miscarriages
          symptoms involving the mouth, such as canker sores
          liver disease.
        
        How long after eating gluten can symptoms start?
        The reaction and reaction time varies among individuals. Some people will have a reaction within two to three hours of gluten consumption. Others may not feel anything until the next day or a few days after, and some not at all.
        Common symptoms after exposure to gluten include:
        
          nausea
          vomiting (very severe in some cases)
          gas/bloating
          cramps
          abdominal pain
          diarrhea
          constipation
          tiredness
          brain fog
          muscle and joint pain.
        
        Diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease
        Celiac disease should not be self-diagnosed. If you suspect you or your child has celiac disease, see a doctor.
        Treatment for celiac disease is focused on eliminating gluten from the diet, which should be done in consultation with a doctor. After a person begins eating a gluten-free diet, symptoms typically improve and may go away. However, if a person consumes small amounts of gluten, symptoms may flare up.",Jenette Restivo,"August 10, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/celiac-disease-diet-avoiding-foods-that-contain-gluten,Celiac disease diet: Avoiding foods that contain gluten,"Celiac disease is a chronic digestive and immune disorder in which consuming foods containing gluten triggers an immune reaction that causes gastrointestinal discomfort and, over time, damages the small intestine. If enough damage is done, the intestine may no longer be able to properly absorb nutrients, leading an individual with celiac disease to become nutrient-deficient. This could affect systems throughout the body.
        For this reason, it's important for people with celiac disease to follow a strict diet that excludes gluten.
        What is the connection between gluten and celiac disease?
        Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. In celiac disease, the immune system mistakenly recognizes gluten as ""foreign.""
        When people with celiac disease eat foods containing gluten, the immune system attacks the gluten when it gets into the small intestine. The attacks damage villi, which are small, fingerlike projections in the small intestine that help the body absorb nutrients from food. As villi become eroded and flattened, they have trouble absorbing nutrients. In the short term, this can lead to diarrhea and other digestive symptoms.
        Left unchecked, the inability of the small intestine to absorb nutrients can lead to malnutrition, weight loss, anemia, osteoporosis, infertility, seizures, and nerve problems.
        Diet and treatment of celiac disease
        While there is no ""cure"" for celiac disease, avoiding gluten can prevent recurring symptoms. A gluten-free diet can also relieve celiac disease symptoms and even allow damage to the small intestine to heal.
        Because avoiding gluten is the only way to prevent symptoms and intestinal damage from celiac disease from returning, people with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet for life.
        Foods to avoid with celiac disease
        If you have celiac disease, you should seek the advice of a doctor or a registered dietitian for ways to maintain a balanced diet while avoiding gluten.
        Many foods can contain gluten — including many you wouldn't expect, like canned soups, sour cream, and cold cuts. That's why a person with celiac disease has to be vigilant about reading labels and asking questions about food ingredients.
        In general, avoid the following foods if you have celiac disease:
        
          Cereals, breads, or other grain products that include wheat, rye, barley, or oats. This includes white or whole-wheat flour (including cookies, crackers, cakes, and most other baked goods), semolina, couscous, bread crumbs, most pastas, and malt.
          Processed cheese, cheese mixes, low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese, or sour cream.
          Dairy products such as yogurt or ice cream that contain fillers or additives.
          Canned soups or soup mixes.
          Creamed vegetables.
          Products that contain modified food starch, food starch, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, stabilizers, or fat replacers or substitutes. (Examples of fat replacers include cellulose, gelatin, dextrins, gums, modified dietary fibers, whey protein, microparticulated egg white, and milk protein.) Check the label for these ingredients.
          Prepared or processed meats.
          Beer, gin, and whiskey.
          Flavored coffee, malted milk, or herbal tea with malted barley.
        
        What happens if you are celiac and keep eating gluten?
        Avoiding gluten is not easy. Gluten is common in foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, and cake.
        Consuming anything containing wheat, barley, or rye, even in small amounts, can trigger a celiac flare-up. Research has shown that the total daily gluten consumption that seems to be safe for most people with celiac ranges from just 10 to 50 milligrams (mg) of gluten; a slice of wheat bread contains 2,000 mg.
        Individuals with celiac disease should be aware of the risk of cross-contact in their food. Cross-contact is when a gluten-free food or food product is exposed to a gluten-containing ingredient or food — making it unsafe for people with celiac disease to eat. Cross-contact can happen at home, in restaurants, and in other food service locations. Cross-contact can occur when the same appliances or cleaning supplies are used for both gluten-containing and gluten-free foods.
        Cross-contact can also occur during the growing, processing, and manufacturing processes. Manufacturers can be contacted to ask if they batch-test their product for gluten, if they know how their raw materials were sourced and produced, and what procedures they go through to prevent cross-contact in the factory.
        What are good foods to eat if you have celiac disease?
        While the list of foods to avoid on a celiac diet seems long, you can follow a gluten-free diet and still enjoy many healthy foods. When you're shopping, look for products marked ""gluten-free.""
        If you have celiac disease, focus on foods you can enjoy that do not contain gluten. These include:
        
          fruits
          vegetables
          meat and poultry
          fish and seafood
          dairy
          beans
          legumes
          nuts
          chia
          corn
          flax
          millet
          potato
          quinoa
          rice
          soy
          tapioca
          wine
          gluten-free oats. (Oats are naturally gluten-free, but processing increases the risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing grains. Therefore, oats without a gluten-free label are not considered safe for individuals with celiac disease.)
        
        What happens if celiac disease is left untreated?
        It is important to adhere to a gluten-free diet if you have celiac disease. If left untreated, celiac disease can lead to severe malnutrition and can put you at risk of serious consequences, including osteoporosis (thin bones), anemia, infertility, liver disease, neuropathy (damaged nerves), and seizures.",Jenette Restivo,"August 10, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/the-4-most-important-types-of-exercise,The 4 most important types of exercise,"Strengthening, stretching, balance, and aerobic exercises will keep you active, mobile, and feeling great.
        
        Exercise is key to good health. But we tend to limit ourselves to one or two types of activity. People do what they enjoy, or what feels the most effective, so some aspects of exercise and fitness may be ignored. In reality, we should all be doing aerobics, stretching, strengthening, and balance exercises. Here, we list what you need to know about each exercise type and offer examples to try, with a doctor's okay.
        1. Aerobic exercise
        Aerobic exercise, which speeds up your heart rate and breathing, is important for many body functions. It gives your heart and lungs a workout and increases endurance. If you're too winded to walk up a flight of stairs, you need to see your doctor for a medical evaluation. If it's just because you are deconditioned, then you will need more aerobic exercise to help condition your heart and lungs and get enough blood to your muscles to help them work efficiently.
        Aerobic exercise also helps relax blood vessel walls, lower blood pressure, burn body fat, lower blood sugar levels, reduce inflammation, and boost mood. Combined with weight loss, it can also lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol levels. Over the long term, aerobic exercise reduces your risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, breast and colon cancer, depression, and falls.
        Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity. Try brisk walking, swimming, jogging, cycling, dancing, or classes like step aerobics.
        
          
            
              
                
                  Marching in place
                
                
                  
                
              
              
                Starting position: Stand tall with your feet together and arms at your sides.Movement: Bend your elbows and swing your arms as you lift your knees.March in a variety of styles:
                
                  March in place.
                  March four steps forward, and then four steps back.
                  March in place with feet wide apart.
                  Alternate marching feet wide and together (out, out, in, in).
                
                
                  Tips and techniques:
                
                
                  Look straight ahead and keep your abs tight.
                  Breathe comfortably, and don't clench your fists.
                
                Make it easier: March slower and don't lift your knees as high.Make it harder: Lift your knees higher, march faster, and really pump your arms.
              
            
          
        
        2. Strength training
        As we age, we lose muscle mass. Strength training builds it back. Regular strength training will help you feel more confident and capable of daily tasks like carrying groceries, gardening, and lifting heavier objects around the house. Strength training will also help you stand up from a chair, get up off the floor, and go upstairs.
        Strengthening your muscles not only makes you stronger, but also stimulates bone growth, lowers blood sugar, assists with weight control, improves balance and posture, and reduces stress and pain in the lower back and joints.
        A physical therapist or certified personal trainer can design a strength training program that you can do two to three times a week at a gym, at home, or at work. It will likely include body weight exercises like squats, push-ups, and lunges, and exercises involving resistance from a weight, a band, or a weight machine.
        It's important to feel some muscle fatigue at the end of the exercise to make sure you are working or training the muscle group effectively.
        
          
            
              
                
                  Squat
                
              
            
            
              
                
                  
                
              
              
                Starting position: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, arms at your sides.Movement: Slowly bend your hips and knees, lowering your buttocks about eight inches, as if you're sitting back into a chair. Let your arms swing forward to help you balance. Keep your back straight. Slowly return to the starting position. Repeat 8-12 times.
                
                  Tips and techniques:
                
                
                  Shift your weight into your heels.
                  Squeeze your buttocks as you stand to help you balance.
                
                Make it easier: Sit on the edge of a chair with your feet hip-width apart and arms crossed over your chest. Tighten your abdominal muscles and stand up. Slowly sit down with control.Make it harder: Lower farther, but not past your thighs being parallel to the floor.
              
            
          
        
        3. Stretching
        Stretching helps maintain flexibility. We often overlook that in youth when our muscles are healthier. But aging leads to a loss of flexibility in the muscles and tendons. Muscles shorten and don't function properly. That increases the risk for muscle cramps and pain, muscle damage, strains, joint pain, and falling, and it also makes it tough to get through daily activities, such as bending down to tie your shoes.
        Likewise, stretching the muscles routinely makes them longer and more flexible, which increases your range of motion and reduces pain and the risk for injury.
        Aim for a program of stretching every day or at least three or four times per week.
        Warm up your muscles first, with a few minutes of dynamic stretches—repetitive motion such as marching in place or arm circles. That gets blood and oxygen to muscles, and makes them amenable to change.
        Then perform static stretches (holding a stretch position for up to 60 seconds) for the calves, the hamstrings, hip flexors, quadriceps, and the muscles of the shoulders, neck, and lower back.
        However, don't push a stretch into the painful range. That tightens the muscle and is counterproductive.
        
          
            
              
                
                  Single knee rotation
                
                
                  
                
                Starting position: Lie on your back with your legs extended on the floor.Movement: Relax your shoulders against the floor. Bend your left knee and place your left foot on your right thigh just above the knee. Tighten your abdominal muscles, then grasp your left knee with your right hand and gently pull it across your body toward your right side.
			Hold 10 to 30 seconds.
			Return to the starting position and repeat on the other side.
                Tips and techniques:
                
                  Stretch to the point of mild tension, not pain.
                  Try to keep both shoulders flat on the floor.
                  To increase the stretch, look in the direction opposite to your knee.
                
              
            
          
        
        4. Balance exercises
        Improving your balance makes you feel steadier on your feet and helps prevent falls. It's especially important as we get older, when the systems that help us maintain balance—our vision, our inner ear, and our leg muscles and joints—tend to break down. The good news is that training your balance can help prevent and reverse these losses.
        Many senior centers and gyms offer balance-focused exercise classes, such as tai chi or yoga. It's never too early to start this type of exercise, even if you feel you don't have balance problems.
        You can also go to a physical therapist, who can determine your current balance abilities and prescribe specific exercises to target your areas of weakness. That's especially important if you've had a fall or a near-fall, or if you have a fear of falling.
        Typical balance exercises include standing on one foot or walking heel to toe, with your eyes open or closed. The physical therapist may also have you focus on joint flexibility, walking on uneven surfaces, and strengthening leg muscles with exercises such as squats and leg lifts. Get the proper training before attempting any of these exercises at home.

                Starting position: Stand up straight with your feet together and your hands on your hips.
                Movement: Lift your left knee toward the ceiling as high as is comfortable or until your thigh is parallel to the floor. Hold, then slowly lower your knee to the starting position.
                Repeat the exercise 3-5 times.
                Then perform the exercise 3-5 times with your right leg.
                
                  Tips and techniques:
                
                
                  Keep your chest lifted and your shoulders down and back.
                  Lift your arms out to your sides to help you balance, if needed.
                  Tighten your abdominal muscles throughout.
                  Tighten the buttock of your standing leg for stability.
                  Breathe comfortably.
                
                Make it easier: Hold on to the back of a chair or counter with one hand.
                Make it harder: Lower your leg all the way to the floor without touching it. Just as it is about to touch, lift your leg up again.",Unknown,"August 8, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/calm-your-anxious-heart,Calm your anxious heart,"Managing anxiety can improve your quality of life and take stress off your heart.
        
        A wave of dread overcomes you—your chest hurts, your heart flutters, and you can't catch your breath. These classic anxiety symptoms are often mistaken for a heart attack—and for good reason. Emotional turmoil triggers the release of stress hormones, which act on the same brain areas that regulate cardiovascular functions such as heart rate and blood pressure.
        A toxic mix
        Anxiety most often travels in the company of its henchmen—stress and depression. In fact, anxiety and depression are likely different expressions of a shared underlying biology. As many as two-thirds of people with anxiety disorders also suffer from depression at some point in their lives, and over half of people with depression also have an anxiety disorder. Long-term, unrelenting stress can be a precursor to both conditions.
        Stress, anxiety, and depression can be viewed as one family of related problems. It's hard to tease them out. For example, two people may have similar biology, but one of them is anxious, while the other is more depressed.
        Heart effects
        The relationship between heart health and depression is well documented. There is mounting evidence for an independent anxiety–heart disease link as well. In particular, people who have generalized anxiety disorder (see ""Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder"") seem to suffer higher rates of heart attack and other cardiac events. The effect is more pronounced in people who already have a diagnosis of heart disease, and the risk rises with the intensity and frequency of anxiety symptoms.
        There are several theories about how constant anxiety of this type may affect the cardiovascular system. Anxiety disorders can change the body's stress response, the combination of hormonal and physiological reactions that helps all animals fight or flee from a real threat. People with anxiety disorders have inappropriate ups and downs that can cause high blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances, or heart attack. A malfunctioning stress response promotes inflammation, which damages the artery linings and sets the stage for the buildup of coronary plaque. People with anxiety also have low levels of omega-3 fatty acids, and lower levels may be linked to a higher risk of heart disease. The presence of anxiety and depression also appears to make platelets ""stickier,"" so blood is more likely to clot.
        The connection between anxiety and heart health also travels in the other direction. A diagnosis of heart problems is likely to raise a person's baseline anxiety. In addition, people who are anxious may also have adopted unhealthy habits (like smoking or overeating) that add to cardiac risk.
        There's still much to be learned about how anxiety affects the heart. But its harmful effects—along with stress and depression—should not be ignored.
        Treating anxiety
        The choice of treatment for anxiety depends on a number of factors, such as its severity, which symptoms are dominant, and other health conditions. The primary approaches for treating anxiety entail talk therapies and medications.
        Very often, doctors recommend a dual approach that combines psychotherapy and medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy, the most studied technique, helps you identify automatic negative thoughts, understand why they aren't rational, and come up with ways to limit destructive thoughts and reinforce positive ones. Depending on an individual's needs, other types of psychotherapy may be recommended. Relaxation exercises, biofeedback, and meditation are other pill-free techniques for managing anxiety.
        Many people find relief by taking antidepressant medicines, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft). These are especially useful in people also burdened by depression. However, when seeking medication for anxiety, be sure to discuss your cardiovascular condition with your doctor to avoid adverse effects and undesirable drug interactions.
        Don't forget regular exercise, after your doctor gives you the go-ahead. It's good for your heart and also helps to boost your mood and calm your nerves.

                  The thyroid gland, which wraps around the windpipe, releases hormones that have wide-ranging effects on the body.
                
              
            
          
        
        
          Too little or too much of this crucial hormone can contribute to heart problems. 
        
        Located at the base your throat, the butterfly-shaped thyroid gland releases hormones that affect every organ in your body—especially your heart. Thyroid hormone influences the force and speed of your heartbeat, your blood pressure, and your cholesterol level. As a result, a malfunctioning thyroid gland can cause problems that masquerade as heart disease or make existing heart disease worse.
        An estimated 6% of people in the United States have thyroid disease. Most of them—about 80%— have an underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism. When thyroid levels drop, all the systems in the body slow down, triggering a range of symptoms that include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and dry skin. But these symptoms are very common in people as they grow older, including those with normal thyroid levels.
        More than half of people with normal thyroid function have symptoms of hypothyroidism. In addition, some people over age 60 with low thyroid levels don't have the classic symptoms. That's why recognizing hypothyroidism can be particularly tricky, he adds. Certain factors make people more likely to have thyroid problems.
        Hypothyroidism: The cardiac connection
        Hypothyroidism can affect the heart and circulatory system in a number of ways. Insufficient thyroid hormone slows your heart rate. Because it also makes the arteries less elastic, blood pressure rises in order to circulate blood around the body. Elevated cholesterol levels, which contribute to narrowed, hardened arteries, are another possible consequence of low thyroid levels.
        Another noncardiac symptom—muscle aches—may also be relevant. Muscle aches can be a symptom of hypothyroidism as well as a side effect of cholesterol-lowering statin medications, a condition known as statin-related myalgia. In fact, research suggests that hypothyroidism is more common in people who can't tolerate statins. Sometimes treating hypothyroidism helps relieve statin-related myalgia.
        Hyperthyroidism: Excess thyroid hormone
        The opposite problem, hyperthyroidism, or too much thyroid hormone, is far less common, affecting less than 1% of the population. But it, too, can harm the heart.
        The classic symptoms include sleeplessness, heat intolerance, excess sweating, weight loss, extreme hunger, and loose bowels. Excess thyroid hormone also causes the heart to beat harder and faster and may trigger abnormal heart rhythms. One is atrial fibrillation, a disorganized rhythm in the heart's upper chambers. A related symptom is palpitations, a sudden awareness of your heartbeat. People with hyperthyroidism may also have high blood pressure. In a person with clogged, stiff heart arteries, the combination of a forceful heartbeat and elevated blood pressure may lead to chest pain or angina.
        
          
            
              
                Who's at risk for thyroid problems?
                The following factors affect your odds of having a thyroid problem:
                
                  The following factors affect your odds of having a thyroid problem:
                  Family history. People whose first-degree relatives (parents or siblings) have an underactive or overactive thyroid face a higher risk of a similar problem.
                  Gender. Women are five to eight times more likely to have thyroid problems than men.
                  Age. The prevalence of hypothyroidism rises with age, especially after age 60.
                  Race. Whites have higher rates of hypothyroidism than Hispanic Americans and African Americans.
                  Health history. Thyroid problems are more likely among people with a personal or family history of certain conditions, including type 1 diabetes, Addison's disease, pernicious anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, premature gray hair, radiation treatments to the head and neck, and vitiligo.",Unknown,"August 8, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-we-reduce-vascular-plaque-buildup,Can we reduce plaque buildup in arteries?,"Cholesterol is a fatty substance that occurs naturally in the body, High blood levels of cholesterol encourage the formation and growth of vascular plaques that put you at risk for heart attack and stroke.
        What causes arterial plaque?
        Plaque forms when cholesterol lodges in the wall of the artery. To fight back, the body sends white blood cells to trap the cholesterol, which then turn into foamy cells that ooze more fat and cause more inflammation. That triggers muscle cells in the artery wall to multiply and form a cap over the area. But the soft plaque beneath the cap is dangerous.
        For example, if your blood pressure spikes, it puts pressure on the thin wall of the plaque, which can break open, form a clot, and cause a heart attack. Most major heart attacks occur when plaques rupture.
        Plaques that gradually enlarge over time are often covered by thick, fibrous caps that can resist breaking apart. They can still block blood flow, causing angina (chest pain brought on by exertion or emotional stress). These blockages can also lead to different type of heart attack.
        Can you unclog your arteries, or reduce plaque buildup?
        Making plaque disappear is not possible, but with lifestyle changes and medication they can shrink and stabilize.
        Doctors especially want to target the softer plaques before they rupture. For example, if you have a 30% blockage in the artery from soft plaque, the goal is to try to suck out the cholesterol from the inside, so the plaque shrivels down to 15% and leaves nothing inside it.
        How do you get the cholesterol out of the plaque? By lowering levels of cholesterol in the blood, where it travels inside particles called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) deposits cholesterol into blood vessel walls.
        The drugs used most often to reduce LDL cholesterol levels are statins — such as atorvastatin (Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor). Statins block the liver enzyme that promotes cholesterol production. Very intensive lifestyle changes have also been shown to shrink plaque.
        Those lifestyle modifications include:
        
          Eating a Mediterranean diet
        
        It can reduce heart disease risk by 30%. It is rich in olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts and fish; low in red or processed meats; and moderate in the amounts of cheese and wine you can consume.
        
          Kicking the habit
        
        Smoking damages the lining of the arteries. Quitting can help raise HDL levels.
        
          Exercising
        
        Aerobic exercise can raise HDL, lower blood pressure, burn body fat, and lower blood sugar levels. Exercise combined with weight loss can also lower LDL levels. Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise.
        Busting the cholesterol myth
        
          Why you can't live without this tricky substance. 
        
        Cholesterol is often vilified as the bad guy, but we need this waxy, fatty substance to make vitamin D, hormones, bile that aids digestion, and the coverings of our cells. The liver produces 75% of the body's cholesterol, but all cells have the ability to make it.
        When cells need more cholesterol, the liver sends it via the bloodstream in packages made of cholesterol on the inside and protein on the outside. These cholesterol-laden particles are known as low-density lipoprotein, or LDL. Too much LDL in the blood can cause cholesterol to lodge in the artery walls and form plaques. That's why LDL is known as ""bad"" cholesterol.
        Whereas LDL particles deposit cholesterol into plaques of atherosclerosis, some high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles help remove cholesterol from plaques. That's why it's often referred to as ""good"" cholesterol.
        
          How much HDL and LDL should you aim for?
        
        An HDL of 60 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or greater is associated with a lower risk of heart disease. Your personal goal for LDL depends on your cardiovascular risk profile. For people who have coronary artery disease or other evidence of cardiovascular disease, the goal is an LDL of less than 70 mg/dL and some doctors are now aiming for an LDL of less than 55 mg/dL.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/top-7-reasons-you-have-a-headache,Top 7 reasons you have a headache,"When a bad headache strikes, you just want it to end. The aching, throbbing pain can be debilitating and result in missed appointments, work, or time with family and friends.
        Regardless of whether you are prone to migraines, tension headaches, or cluster headaches (see ""Is this your headache?""), you may be able to reduce their frequency by identifying what brings them on. Here's a look at the most common triggers for each of these kinds of headaches.
        Stress
        Stress can cause tight muscles in the shoulders and neck, which often leads to tension headaches. When tension headaches become frequent, the pain in shoulder and neck muscles is felt by the brain as pain in the head.
        Hunger itself can trigger a migraine or tension headache. But eating certain foods may trigger migraines. It could be just one type of food — like beans or nuts — or many foods, such as avocados, bananas, cheese, chocolate, citrus, herring, dairy products, and onions. Processed foods with nitrites, nitrates, yellow food dyes, or monosodium glutamate can be especially problematic.
        Alcohol intake
        Alcohol is a common migraine trigger. For some people, a few ounces of red wine are all it takes to provoke a headache, although any kind of alcohol can be a trigger. It's not clear if the alcohol itself is to blame or if another component in the drink causes the problem.
        Environment
        Environmental factors such as bright light, smoke, humidity, intense scents, or cold weather are associated with migraine headaches. People with cluster headaches often note that their headaches occur with specific seasonal changes. 
        Hormones
        Changes in estrogen levels are associated with migraines in women, and women suffer from migraines more often than men. Menstrual cycles may be tied to migraine in younger women. Varying estrogen levels during perimenopause can sometimes start migraines in women who never experienced them before. Estrogen therapy may also be a migraine trigger. Menopause does seem to end migraines in most women.
        Caffeine withdrawal
        If you normally consume caffeine in coffee or tea, stopping intake abruptly may trigger a migraine. This may be because caffeine causes blood vessels to constrict; without caffeine, the blood vessels widen and bulge out with each heartbeat — a chief reason for the pounding pain of migraines.
        Lack of sleep
        A lack of sleep is associated with migraines and tension headaches. For people with migraine, falling asleep can often stop an attack or at least decrease the severity of pain.
        
          
            
              
                
                  Is this your headache?
                
                Here are three common types of headaches and their symptoms.
                
                  Tension headache. Pain often starts in the neck and back and works its way up to feel like a tight band around your head. It often goes away with rest.
                  Migraine headache. Pain typically begins on one side of the head, throbs or pounds, and makes you sensitive to light and sound. It may cause nausea. A migraine can last for hours or days.
                  Cluster headache. A cluster headache feels like a stabbing pain in the eye. It may cause eye tearing or redness, runny nose, or nasal congestion. It may last for a few minutes or hours, go away, and come back several times per day. These headache clusters can occur for months, disappear, and reappear a long time later.
                
              
            
          
        
        What you can do
        Understanding your headache triggers can help you avoid getting headaches in the future. But identifying triggers can be tricky, especially if you have more than one (like several kinds of food). Try keeping a diary to note the day, time, symptoms, and circumstances surrounding a headache (what had you eaten? where did it happen?).
        If avoiding triggers isn't enough to keep headaches at bay, talk to your doctor. There are many prescription medications as well as pill-free treatments (acupuncture, meditation, biofeedback, relaxation therapy) that can help reduce headache frequency.
        And you'll need to go a step further: Make sure you get enough sleep, exercise, eat a healthy diet, limit alcohol intake, and reduce stress. Headaches are a condition of hypersensitivity, so you need balance in your system to fight triggers.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/plyometrics-three-explosive-exercises-even-beginners-can-try-202308022960,Plyometrics: Three explosive exercises even beginners can try,"As a kid, I spent many Saturdays romping around my Florida neighborhood imitating Colonel Steve Austin, better known as The Six Million Dollar Man to avid TV watchers in the 1970s.
        The popular show featured a bionic man — half human and half machine — who could jump from three-story buildings, leap over six-foot-high walls, and bolt into a full 60-mile-per-hour sprint. Naturally, these actions occurred in slow motion with an iconic vibrating electronic sound effect.
        My own bionic moves involved jumping to pluck oranges from tree branches, hopping over anthills, and leaping across narrow ditches while humming that distinctive sound. I didn't realize it, but this imitation game taught me the foundations of plyometrics — the popular training routine now used by top athletes to boost strength, power, and agility.
        What are plyometrics?
        Plyometric training involves short, intense bursts of activity that target fast-twitch muscle fibers in the lower body. These fibers help generate explosive power that increases speed and jumping height.
        ""Plyometrics are used by competitive athletes who rely on quick, powerful movements, like those in basketball, volleyball, baseball, tennis, and track and field,"" says Thomas Newman, lead performance specialist with Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham Center for Sports Performance and Research. Plyometrics also can help improve coordination, agility, and flexibility, and offer an excellent heart-pumping workout.
        Who can safely try plyometrics?
        There are many kinds of plyometric exercises. Most people are familiar with gym plyometrics where people jump onto the top of boxes or over hurdles.
        But these are advanced moves and should only be attempted with the assistance of a trainer once you have developed some skills and muscle strength.
        Keep in mind that even the beginner plyometrics described in this post can be challenging. If you have had any joint issues, especially in your knees, back, or hips, or any trouble with balance, check with your doctor before doing any plyometric training.
        How to maximize effort while minimizing risk of injury
        
          Choose a surface with some give. A thick, firm mat (not a thin yoga mat); well-padded, carpeted wood floor; or grass or dirt outside are good choices that absorb some of the impact as you land. Do not jump on tile, concrete, or asphalt surfaces.
          Aim for just a few inches off the floor to start. The higher you jump, the greater your impact on landing.
          Bend your legs when you land. Don't lock your knees.
          Land softly, and avoid landing only on your heels or the balls of your feet.
        
        Three simple plyometric exercises
        Here are three beginner-level exercises to jump-start your plyometric training. (Humming the bionic man sound is optional.)
        Side jumps
        Stand tall with your feet together. Shift your weight onto your right foot and leap as far as possible to your left, landing with your left foot followed by your right one. Repeat, hopping to your right. That's one rep.
        
          You can hold your arms in front of you or let them swing naturally.
          Try not to hunch or round your shoulders forward as you jump.
          To make this exercise easier, hop a shorter distance to the side and stay closer to the floor.
        
        Do five to 15 reps to complete one set. Do one to three sets, resting between each set.
        Jump rope
        Jumping rope is an effective plyometric exercise because it emphasizes short, quick ground contact time. It also measures coordination and repeated jump height as you clear the rope.
        
          Begin with two minutes of jumping rope, then increase the time or add extra sets.
          Break it up into 10- to 30-second segments if two minutes is too difficult.
          If your feet get tangled, pause until you regain your balance and then continue.
        
        An easier option is to go through the motions of jumping rope but without the rope.
        Forward hops
        Stand tall with your feet together. Bend your knees and jump forward one to two feet. Turn your body around and jump back to the starting position to complete one rep.
        
          Let your arms swing naturally during the hop.
          To make this exercise easier, hop a shorter distance and stay closer to the floor.
          If you want more of a challenge, hop farther and higher. As this becomes easier to do, try hopping over small hurdles. Begin with something like a stick and then increase the height, such as with books of various thicknesses.
        
        Do five to 10 hops to complete one set. Do one to three sets, resting between each set.",Matthew Solan,"August 2, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-lowdown-on-glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load,The lowdown on glycemic index and glycemic load,"What are the facts about the glycemic load of foods? If you have diabetes, you probably know you need to monitor your carbohydrate intake. But different carbohydrate-containing foods affect blood sugar differently, and these effects can be quantified by measures known as the glycemic index and glycemic load. You might even have been advised to use these numbers to help plan your diet. But what do these numbers really mean — and just how useful are they?
        Glycemic index vs. glycemic load
        The glycemic index (GI) assigns a numeric score to a food based on how drastically it makes your blood sugar rise. Foods are ranked on a scale of 0 to 100, with pure glucose (sugar) given a value of 100. The lower a food's glycemic index, the slower blood sugar rises after eating that food. In general, the more processed a food is, the higher its GI, and the more fiber or fat in a food, the lower it's GI.
        But the glycemic index tells just part of the story. What it doesn't tell you is how high your blood sugar could go when you actually eat the food. To understand a food's complete effect on blood sugar, you need to know both how quickly it makes glucose enter the bloodstream and how much glucose per serving it can deliver. A separate measure called the glycemic load does both — which gives you a more accurate picture of a food's real-life impact on your blood sugar. Watermelon, for example, has a high glycemic index (80). But a serving of watermelon has so little carbohydrate that its glycemic load is only 5.
        Glycemic load diet
        Some nutrition experts believe that people with diabetes should pay attention to both the glycemic index and glycemic load to avoid sudden spikes in blood sugar. The total amount of carbohydrate in a food, rather than its glycemic index or load, is a stronger predictor of what will happen to blood sugar. But some dietitians also feel that focusing on the glycemic index and load adds an unneeded layer of complexity to choosing what to eat.
        The bottom line? Following the principles of low-glycemic-index eating is likely to be beneficial for people with diabetes. But reaching and staying at a healthy weight is more important for your blood sugar and your overall health.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/are-fats-so-bad,Are fats so bad?,"For years, fat was a dirty word in the dietary world. After World War II, large studies established links between saturated fat and heart disease. Most dietary experts advised people to reduce their fat intake, not only because of the heart connection, but also because fat has more calories per gram than protein or carbohydrate and was assumed to contribute more to weight gain.
        Many people did so, but they often replaced the lost calories with large amounts of carbohydrates— especially refined carbohydrates. They also stopped eating healthy fats, like olive and canola oils. Instead of helping us slim down, the decline in fat consumption was accompanied by higher rates of overweight and obesity.
        What went awry? As it turns out, the ""all fat is bad"" message was wrong. Foods that contain fat help fill you up, so you stop eating earlier.
        More important, not all fats are alike. Saturated fat, found mainly in meat and dairy foods, contributes to clogged arteries and cardiovascular disease. But monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, found in plants and healthful oils, actually protect your health by improving your cholesterol profile.
        Fat has little direct effect on blood sugar levels. It is a major energy source for your body, and it helps you absorb certain vitamins and nutrients.
        Another type of fat needed for a variety of vital physiological functions is the family of omega-3 unsaturated fats. Your body can't make these on its own; it must get them from food. Good sources of omega-3s include fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines, and mackerel. Flaxseeds, walnuts, wheat germ, canola oil, unhydrogenated soybean oil, and flaxseed oil are also rich in omega-3s.
        Trans fats are the worst fats for your health. These fats are made when hydrogen is added to healthy unsaturated fats to solidify them and make them less likely to spoil. Trans fats raise harmful LDL cholesterol, lower beneficial HDL cholesterol, increase inflammation, and make blood more likely to clot.
        The FDA has ruled that ""partially hydrogenated"" oils, the main source of trans fats in the American food supply, are no longer ""generally recognized as safe.""  By now, most food companies have stopped using them. But to be sure, look for products that have a zero on the ""trans fat"" line in the Nutrition Facts box.",Unknown,"August 2, 2023",1

Quick fixes: ""Use a horseshoe-shaped travel pillow that goes around your neck when you lean back to watch TV. If you lean to the side, use more pillows to fill the gap between your head and shoulders. And change your position every 15 or 20 minutes to give your neck a break, so it doesn't get stiff,"" Evangelista says.
        Leaning forward
        You might lean forward throughout the day, whether that's toward a computer monitor that's hard to see or toward another person during a conversation. If you extend your neck each time, that can strain the muscles and cause pain.
        Quick fixes: If you're going to lean, keep your back straight and tilt forward at your hips. If you can't see your computer monitor well, pull it closer to you or increase the font size. If you have eyeglasses for reading or distance vision, see if they help. If they don't help enough, you can get glasses just for using a computer. If you don't use eyeglasses, get an eye exam: you may need a pair. Similarly, if you lean forward a lot to hear people in conversation, consider getting a hearing test.
        Wearing a flimsy bra
        Wearing a bra with little support makes your muscles and ligaments do all the heavy lifting. For someone with heavy breasts, the extra weight can pull the neck forward and stress the neck and shoulder muscles, leading to neck and back pain.
        Quick fixes: Get a better bra. Make sure both the underwire and middle section of the bra lie flat against your body, the cups aren't too tight or too loose, and the band is level across your back and doesn't ride up. Or try a sports bra or posture bra that brings the weight of the breasts closer to your ribcage and distributes it across your torso.
        Sleeping in risky positions
        Sleeping seems harmless, but some sleep positions pose big risks for the neck. When you sleep on your stomach, for example, you rotate your head to the side. Sleeping on your side without the right support pushes your neck toward your shoulder. Staying in these positions for hours can cause neck muscle strain and pain.

    Living Well with Osteoarthritis: A guide to relieving the pain and caring for your joints


                
                    This report focuses primarily on osteoarthritis — the most common type of arthritis — which affects 27 million Americans. Many people believe it’s a crippling and inevitable part of growing old. But things are changing. Treatments are better, and plenty of people age well without much arthritis. If you have osteoarthritis, you can take steps to protect your joints, reduce discomfort, and improve mobility — all of which are detailed in this Special Health Report, Living Well with Osteoarthritis: A guide to keeping your joints healthy. If you don't have osteoarthritis, the report offers strategies for preventing it.

Quick fixes. Avoid sleeping on your stomach. And if you're a side sleeper, check the support under your neck. ""Lie on your side with your head on your pillow. If you can easily slide your hand in the space between your head and shoulders, you're not getting enough support at night. Get a new pillow to fill the gap. Any material will do,"" Evangelista says.
        Sitting ""comfortably""
        For many people, sitting comfortably means slouching, which is bad for your neck and back. ""Poor posture puts abnormal strain on the spine, including the neck and the ligaments holding it together, and that can cause pain,"" Evangelista says.
        Quick fixes: Sit up straight: pull your chin back, lower your shoulders, and arch your back. If that's challenging at first, sit on the edge of your chair for a few minutes, which makes sitting up straight a little easier, and then sit farther back on the seat. If your budget allows, get an ergonomic desk chair with low-back support, adjustable height, and a thick seat cushion.
        Looking at electronic screens
        We all spend a lot of time looking at electronic devices. For example, you might be looking up at a TV mounted on a wall, or down at a smartphone or laptop. The trouble is that your head is heavy; angling it up or down for a long time leads to muscle strain and pain.
        Quick fixes: Keep TVs, smartphones, and computer screens at eye level. Consider lowering the height of your TV, elevating your computer screen by putting it on a small stand, or raising your smartphone screen by putting it on a stand or a pillow on your lap. ""Wearing a travel pillow around your neck can add neck support,"" Evangelista says.
        Lifting heavy dumbbells
        Evangelista says many people lift dumbbells that are too heavy. ""That throws off your body mechanics. Your trapezius muscles in the back overcompensate. They're connected to the neck, and the overuse can cause neck pain,"" he says.

        Getting stressed
        ""We carry a lot of stress in our necks. We raise our shoulders and tense our muscles,. If you have any underlying neck problems, it irritates them,"" Evangelista says.
        Quick fixes: Practice stress management. Try some deep breathing exercises, go for a quiet walk in nature, or learn how to meditate. ""I've seen people whose neck problems go away when they get stress under control,"" Evangelista says. ""It's an important part of any plan to reduce neck pain.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-almost-last-word-on-alcohol-and-health,The (almost) last word on alcohol and health,"New information has again opened the debate about what role, if any, alcohol plays in health. Is a moderate amount good for your heart? Can you still enjoy the occasional beverage, or should you become a teetotaler as you age?
        Like so much in life, it's complicated.
        ""There's good evidence that, in general, moderate drinkers who average one to two drinks a day tend to live longer,"" says Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition and director of the Program in Cardiovascular Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""Whether that is directly linked with alcohol, other lifestyle factors, or some combination is still being explored.""
        Different findings
        Why might alcohol be healthy? It's thought that moderate intake helps raise levels of ""good"" HDL cholesterol, higher amounts of which are associated with a lower risk for heart disease. Alcohol also may discourage the formation of small blood clots that can lead to heart attacks and stroke.
        Still, new studies have cast doubt on the connection between alcohol and good health.
        For instance, a meta-analysis (that is, a study based on data collected in multiple earlier trials) published in March 2023 in JAMA Network Open concluded that low-volume drinkers (1.3 to 24 grams of alcohol daily, or less than two standard drinks) did not live longer than people who never drank.
        Medium-volume drinking (25 to 44 grams, about two to three daily standard drinks) also didn't offer significant health protection. Rimm is quick to pump the brakes on this and similar conclusions based on data from multiple studies.
        ""New findings do not mean that everything else that came before is wrong,"" he says. ""The problem with these studies is that they combine good and poor research. So, it's difficult to make a conclusion with information where alcohol is assessed so differently. For many studies they completely ignored measuring drinking patterns.""
        Another issue is that most alcohol-related studies are observational — that is, they can show an association, but not cause and effect.
        Other factors linked with alcohol intake may contribute to drinkers' well-being. For instance, a study published in March 2022 in JAMA Network Open found that moderate drinkers had the lowest heart disease risk compared with nondrinkers, suggesting that some alcohol intake may benefit heart health.
        Yet the research team also discovered that light-to-moderate drinkers had healthier lifestyles than abstainers. They were more physically active, ate more vegetables and less red meat, and didn't smoke as much.
        Glass half full
        What seems clear in most research supporting the health benefits of alcohol is that the amount is key. Light to moderate intake remains the best advice.
        The CDC classifies moderate alcohol intake for adult men as two standard drinks or fewer on days when they drink. A standard drink is approximately 12 ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol by volume, or ABV), 8 to 9 ounces of malt liquor (7% ABV), 5 ounces of wine (12% ABV), or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof spirits (40% ABV). (See ""What is a standard drink?"".)
        Of course, most people don't drink daily, and some may go for long periods without alcohol. ""But even occasional drinkers may still receive some benefits,"" says Rimm.
        Does the type of alcohol matter? Not really. Your body reacts to alcohol the same way whether it comes from a California wine, Scotch whiskey, or craft beer. ""The differences between beverages are the percentage of alcohol,"" says Rimm.
        (To more accurately analyze your drink's alcohol content per serving size, use this drink calculator from the National Institutes of Health: /size.)
        Your choice of beverage can have adverse health effects unrelated to the alcohol. For instance, a gin-and-tonic cocktail contains high amounts of sugar, and most beer is high in carbohydrates and calories.
        One part of the alcohol debate everyone agrees on is not drinking too much.
        ""Studies have found that regularly drinking beyond the recommended amount can raise a person's risk for numerous health problems, like liver failure, high blood pressure, heart failure, and several types of cancer,"" says Rimm. Also, avoid regular excessive drinking and binge drinking (consuming five or more drinks on one occasion).
        
          
        
        Last call
        So what is the conclusion? According to Rimm, if you don't drink, there is no reason to begin. If you only occasionally drink, don't increase your intake for health reasons. But for the casual or regular drinker, it's fine to enjoy an alcoholic beverage — in moderation.
        But you should also weigh your alcohol intake with your overall heart health, adds Rimm. For example, if you have high blood pressure, you may want to drink less or abstain from drinking and focus on getting your blood pressure under control.
        ""If you have any health issues, it's best to speak with your doctor about what is the proper amount of alcohol for you,"" says Rimm.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/3-strategies-for-safer-home-workouts,3 strategies for safer home workouts,"Working out at home is convenient, but it comes with risks (especially if you exercise alone) such as muscle strains, falls, and injuries. This was evident during the first year of the pandemic, when COVID-19 risks led many people to exercise at home, and exercise injuries resulting in emergency room visits were up about 50% from the year before, according to some insurance company estimates.
        To reduce your injury risks when exercising at home, focus on three strategies.
        
          1. Create a safe workout space
        
        Your exercise environment is the foundation for exercise safety. Make sure it's well lighted (to prevent falls), well ventilated (to keep the air fresh), and not too hot (so you don't get overheated or dehydrated) or humid. Adding a dehumidifier (about $30 for one that handles a small room) to the space may help dry out humid air, if necessary.
        A safe workout space should also have a level floor and plenty of room to move. ""Your workout space should be wide enough that you can move your arms freely, without touching anything when you're standing, and long enough to accommodate your whole body when you're on the ground for floor exercises,"" says Janice McGrail, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        Keep the floor free of clutter and throw rugs, and remove any nearby furniture with sharp corners.
        
          2. Stock the space with safety essentials
        
        The following items can boost the safety of your workout.
        A large mirror. Maintaining the proper form during exercise is crucial to avoiding muscle strains and sprains. A framed full-length mirror (about $10 at a big-box store) will enable you to see how you're doing. Secure the mirror to the wall to keep it from falling and shattering.
        An exercise mat. A little cushioning underfoot will reduce pressure on your joints and provide a safer landing spot than a hard floor. The mat should be nonslip and about half an inch thick. A set of interlocking exercise foam floor tiles are perfect for the job. Prices for a set start at about $25. (Note: Don't exercise on thick carpet, which may cause your sneakers to get stuck and cause a fall.)
        Supportive sneakers. The most comfortable sneakers you own might not be the safest for exercising. Wear a pair that fits snugly around your heel and midfoot and has a roomy toe box, good support, and soles that aren't too cushioned or beveled (as running shoes are), which may lead to a fall.
        Water. Keep a water bottle nearby, so you can take a few sips in between exercises to stay hydrated.
        A smart speaker. If you exercise alone, you'll need to call for help in case of emergency. A smart speaker that you can call out to is a great option (starting at about $30). Just make sure your workout space has a good Wi-Fi signal. Note: You can also use a smart watch or an alert button, but those can be pricey (hundreds of dollars). Your smartphone can also do the job.
        A carbon monoxide monitor. Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless, potentially deadly gas emitted from combustion engines. If your workout space is in a garage, along with a car, install a carbon monoxide monitor (starting at about $20).

                Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart, your chest lifted, and your shoulders back and down. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arms down at your sides and palms facing forward. Slowly bend your elbows, lifting the dumbbells toward your shoulders. Hold. Slowly lower the dumbbells to the starting position. Repeat 8 to 12 times, take a break for 30 to 90 seconds, and repeat the process again.

          3. Practice safe exercise habits
        
        Remaining aware of exercise risks and practicing safe exercise habits should be part of your routine — just like putting on a seat belt in a car. Here are some suggestions.
        Get your doctor's okay. Make sure you have a green light for your exercise routine if you've been inactive recently, or if you have a chronic condition such as heart disease or poor balance. Start with a simple routine, and increase the difficulty gradually.
        Warm up first. Strained muscles are common exercise injuries. Doing a 5- or 10-minute warm-up first — such as marching in place and moving your arms around — will prime your muscles and body for the demand of your workout.
        Don't push yourself too hard. ""In general, exercise should feel like a challenge or make you feel fatigued, but it should not cause sharp pain. It is okay and even expected for your muscles to feel tired and a bit sore after you exercise, but the soreness should go away in about a day. If you are still sore several days later, that's a sign that you did too much. Next time, use lighter weights or do fewer repetitions,"" McGrail says.
        Carry weights carefully. ""Grasp any weight, even a lighter one, in the middle of the handle to keep it steady so you don't drop it. When picking up heavy dumbbells or kettlebells from the floor, bend at your knees and keep your back straight. When standing up again, use your legs rather than your back, so you don't strain it,"" McGrail says.
        Tread lightly with treadmills. Treadmill accidents at home are common causes of broken bones, head injuries, and friction burns. If you have a treadmill, don't set the speed too fast or raise the incline too high, and change difficulty levels gradually. Take advantage of any safety mechanisms your treadmill has, such as a tether you can wear that automatically stops the machine if you fall. Keep the treadmill unplugged when you're not using it, to protect children who might want to play on it.
        Stretch after a workout. The muscles are warm and ready for stretching. Don't bounce during a stretch, which can cause injury; hold each stretch for about 30 seconds at a time. This will help keep your muscles long and supple and prevent them from being injured during your next workout and your daily activities.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-are-you-coughing-at-night,Why are you coughing at night?,"Some people don't cough during the day, but then start hacking once they're in bed. Several conditions can cause this, and some have a common culprit: gravity.
        Common triggers
        Several health issues are associated with nighttime coughing. These are some of the most common:
        Postnasal drip. Postnasal drip describes a constant trickle of mucus from the upper airways — the sinuses and throat. ""In the daytime, when you're upright, these fluids drain naturally with the help of gravity, and you swallow and clear them. When you lie down, you lose the help of gravity, and mucus collects at the back of the throat. If mucus lands on the vocal cords in the throat, or if you inhale some mucus and it enters the lungs, it triggers a wet cough that produces phlegm or mucus,"" explains Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya, an ear, nose, and throat specialist (otolaryngologist) at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Stomach acid generally is squeezed down into the intestine when the stomach contracts, or is pulled down by gravity. However, when the circular muscle between the stomach and the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) fails to tighten properly, acid can squirt back up, irritating the lining of the esophagus and structures in the throat. This backwash is called reflux. When you lie down, acid doesn't flow naturally into the intestine and can reflux even more easily. ""When acid gets on the vocal cords, you start to cough. In severe cases, acid gets into the windpipe and causes wheezing,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. GERD can cause a dry cough that may or may not be accompanied by a burning feeling (heartburn) or pain in your chest.
        Medication side effects. Some drugs — for example, ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril, others) or enalapril (Vasotec), which are used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease — can cause a frequent, dry cough as a side effect. ""In the daytime it might feel more like a need to clear your throat. At night, it's much worse,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says.
        Heart failure. Heart failure is the term for a gradual decline in the heart's ability to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. ""When the heart isn't pumping well, fluid backs up and seeps into other tissues. In the daytime, when you're upright, gravity forces the fluid into the lower extremities. When you lie down, some fluid builds up in the lungs, which makes you cough,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. ""A dry cough at night may be one of the first signs of heart failure.""
        What you should do
        When a new nighttime cough lasts more than a few weeks, see your doctor to rule out the most dangerous causes, like heart failure. Your doctor can also review your prescriptions for potential side effects that might lead to a cough, and swap out a medication if necessary.
        Those causes aren't too hard to suss out. ""But it can take a bit of trial and error to figure out if GERD or postnasal drip is causing nighttime coughing. I'll typically recommend a month of treatment for one or the other, depending on symptoms, and see if the person gets better,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says. ""If one avenue doesn't work, we can try the other. It's better than doing an expensive diagnostic test that requires anesthesia.""
        GERD treatment involves dietary modifications (avoiding foods and drinks that seem to make your GERD symptoms worse) plus drugs that suppress acid, such as omeprazole (Prilosec).
        For postnasal drip, treatment involves medication that either thins mucus secretions (so they flow more easily and don't go in wrong places) or dries up mucus production (to decrease the volume of secretions).
        Other things you can do
        In addition to medical treatment, these strategies might help reduce nighttime coughing:
        Sleep on a wedge pillow. The elevation helps you swallow secretions better and makes it harder for stomach acid to reflux.
        Use a room humidifier. ""This is especially helpful in the winter, when dry air makes secretions thicker. A humidifier can break them up and thin them out,"" Dr. Bhattacharyya says.
        Stay upright after eating. Wait an hour or two before you lie down.
        Keep cough drops handy. If you wake up coughing, sit up and (when possible) suck on a cough drop to calm an irritated throat.
        Try some honey. Have a teaspoon of honey, or put some in a cup of decaffeinated tea. Some people find that honey can soothe a sore throat and suppress a cough. And at the very least, it can be a comforting treat.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/move-of-the-month-pull-down,Move of the month: Pull-down,"Using stretchy bands (known as exercise bands or resistance bands) can be a good way to ease into strength training. This simple exercise targets the large, flat muscle that stretches across the middle and lower back (the latissimus dorsi) and the large muscles on the front of the upper arms (the biceps).
        Starting position (A): Stand tall with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Hold a band overhead with your arms extended and your hands about 12 to 18 inches apart.
        Movement (B): Over a count of three, bend your elbows slightly and pull your hands down, stretching the band, to about shoulder level. Hold for one count, then over a count of three, slowly raise your arms back overhead to the starting position, resisting the pull of the band. Do eight to 12 repetitions, rest for 30 to 90 seconds, and repeat that set once or twice.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Don't arch your back, and keep your abdominal muscles tight.
          Keep your shoulders down and back, away from your ears.
          Keep your wrists straight, in line with your arms.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/does-coffee-help-or-harm-your-heart,Does coffee help or harm your heart?,"Many people can't imagine starting their day without a cup or two of coffee. Despite its popularity, however, coffee has been a bit controversial when it comes to heart health.
        ""The thinking about coffee's effects on the heart has swung in both directions,"" says Dr. J. Michael Gaziano, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. In the 1960s, coffee was considered a risk factor for coronary artery disease, although later research suggested that only heavy coffee consumption (more than five or six cups a day) might harm the heart. But people who drink excessive amounts of coffee often differ in many other ways from those who enjoy modest amounts, Dr. Gaziano notes.
        A java jolt?
        Because coffee contains caffeine, a stimulant, people have long wondered whether drinking coffee might ""jazz up"" the heart, triggering palpitations (the odd sensation of a skipped, missed, or strong heartbeat) or atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm problem marked by a rapid, irregular heartbeat).
        However, people who drink moderate amounts of coffee (one to three cups per day) actually appear to have a lower risk of atrial fibrillation, according to a 2019 study co-authored by Dr. Gaziano. Those who drank either more or less coffee were no more or less likely to develop atrial fibrillation, the study found.
        Like a lot of dietary research, that study was observational: people reported what they consumed and researchers tracked their health over many years. But a new study took a different approach — it directly measured the short-term effects of drinking coffee (see ""The coffee connection: More steps, less sleep, possible palpitations?"").
        
          
            
              
                The coffee connection: More steps, less sleep, possible palpitations?
                Many coffee drinkers appreciate the energizing buzz from a morning cup of joe. But does that boost have any short-term effects on the heart or other heart-related behaviors or risk factors — namely, exercise, sleep, and blood sugar levels?
                To find out, researchers put wearable sensors on volunteers for a two-week period. Their study, the Coffee and Real-time Atrial and Ventricular Ectopy (CRAVE) trial, was published March 23, 2023, in The New England Journal of Medicine. (Atrial and ventricular ectopy refers to premature contractions of the heart's upper or lower chambers. People typically experience these as strong, fast, or irregular heartbeats, known as palpitations.)
                Who: 100 healthy men and women, average age 39.
                What: Participants wore three separate devices: one that tracked activity levels and sleep, one that measured blood sugar, and one that monitored heart rhythm. They were also tested for common genetic variants that affect how quickly people metabolize caffeine.
                How: Researchers directed participants to drink as much caffeinated coffee as they wanted for two days and to activate the heart monitor after every cup they drank. They were then to abstain from coffee for two days. They repeated this cycle for 14 days.
                Key findings: On the days people drank coffee, they took an average of 1,000 extra steps per day. But they slept about 36 fewer minutes per night, on average. Coffee drinking had no apparent effect on blood sugar levels. And while coffee consumption did not increase premature atrial contractions, it did appear to slightly increase the incidence of premature ventricular contractions. Genetic differences in caffeine metabolism had no meaningful effects on any of these outcomes.
              
            
          
        
        Steps and sleep
        ""This new trial provides an important piece of the puzzle,"" says Dr. Gaziano. One finding — that people took more steps on coffee-drinking days — upholds other research showing that caffeine can slightly enhance physical performance. On the other hand, caffeine's adverse effects on sleep are also well known, and insufficient sleep is increasingly recognized as a risk to cardiovascular health.
        It's hard to know whether the extra exercise balances out the decreased shut-eye people may get from drinking coffee. Most people know how they react to coffee and adjust their intake accordingly, says Dr. Gaziano, who enjoys a daily cup that contains half decaffeinated coffee.
        Limitations of the study
        But like all studies, the new study has limitations. For instance, it included only relatively young, healthy coffee drinkers. So the findings may not apply to older people, who tend to be more likely to have palpitations. In fact, people who avoid coffee (and so weren't part of the study) may avoid the beverage because they notice it triggers palpitations.
        Other heart-related effects
        The study also discovered that drinking coffee led to a slight increase in premature ventricular contractions. These brief rhythm disruptions (which can feel as though the heart is pounding or flip-flopping) are common and usually harmless, especially in healthy people. However, people with heart disease who notice persistent, odd heart rhythms should talk to their doctor.
        Earlier research has investigated coffee's effects on other common heart-related risks. Although drinking coffee raises blood pressure, the effect is temporary and doesn't make you more likely to develop high blood pressure; it may even lower your risk. Unfiltered coffee, such as French press coffee and espresso, contains compounds that may raise harmful LDL cholesterol. But the effect is likely trivial compared with the rest of your diet, especially if you drink no more than two cups of unfiltered coffee daily.
        ""The question I have is, what is the overall impact on the outcome I care most about, which is cardiovascular disease?"" says Dr. Gaziano. When you look at the evidence as a whole, coffee doesn't seem to have a positive or negative effect, he says. If you like coffee, enjoy up to a few cups per day — as long as it's not interfering with your sleep. And don't dump a lot of cream and sugar into your coffee, since that adds saturated fat and empty calories, he adds.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/feeding-body-and-soul,Feeding body and soul,"Feeling battered by years of dieting? You've seemingly tried everything to lose weight: low-calorie, low-sugar, low-fat, low-carb — and frankly, low-satisfaction — regimens that left you worse off and worn out.
        If the description fits, you may be drawn to an entirely different approach. Called intuitive eating, the decades-old concept is designed to help people stuck in the cycle of dieting build a better relationship with food. Fundamental is the notion that our bodies intrinsically know what, when, and how much to eat to stay nourished. But a lifetime of relentless messaging — from orders to ""clean your plate"" to parades of stick-thin models — have stopped many of us from listening to that inner voice.
        Intuitive eating rejects the rules and restrictions baked into a diet mentality, which often backfires, leading to yo-yo weight loss and gain. Indeed, evidence suggests about 80% of people who lose significant amounts of weight will regain some or all of it within a year. Instead, intuitive eating encourages us to simply eat when hungry and stop when full. It also takes into account your satisfaction — enjoying the foods you eat — which, ironically, may lead to weight loss.
        ""Gaining and losing weight for years and years can be counterproductive and is a hard way to live,"" says Emily Blake, a dietitian at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Intuitive eating is a framework that integrates mind and body and encourages you to trust in your own ability to feed yourself.""
        Balanced approach
        Another key principle of intuitive eating is rejecting the idea that foods are inherently ""good"" or ""bad."" No longer are pizza, pasta, and burgers on the naughty list. Likewise, salads and fruit aren't ""better.""
        ""What people find over time is they end up craving a balance of foods,"" Blake says. ""You'll start trusting yourself much more with the ability to eat what feels good to you physically without any emotional distress or guilt. Once you take the morality out of food, you start noticing that while you do crave less-nutritious foods at times, you also often crave fruits and vegetables.""
        On the flip side, some people misconstrue intuitive eating as a food free-for-all, says dietitian Nancy Oliveira, manager of the Nutrition and Wellness Service at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        ""When people have food freedom, some may choose more ultra-processed, 'craveable' foods,"" Oliveira says. ""It's a little tricky. It does help you have a better relationship with food over all, but you have to pair that with common sense and solid nutritional information. You have to know that eating potato chips all day long will not help you feel better in the long run.""
        Hungry vs. full
        For many trying to adopt intuitive eating, a weighty challenge is reacquainting themselves with natural cues that signal hunger or fullness — and responding accordingly. ""Most people recognize hunger pangs, but a lot of people struggle with fullness,"" Blake says. ""It's not really the American way to recognize being full.""
        Maybe it's easy to pinpoint that your rumbling stomach or lightheadedness means you need to eat, pronto. But feeling full isn't the same as realizing you're bursting and queasy from overeating.
        ""Sometimes we use the term 'comfortably un-hungry,'"" Oliveira says. ""You feel mentally satisfied because you chose exactly what you wanted to eat, and you feel better afterward, with more energy.""
        To gauge your fullness, Blake suggests choosing a check-in point during your meal — for example, when you're halfway through — and taking a moment to assess your hunger/fullness level. If you think you might be full, put your plate in the refrigerator. ""If you're still hungry 20 minutes later, you can have more—it's not a big deal,"" she says. ""This helps you become more comfortable with those cues. It's like building a muscle, but you're building a skill—it's going to take a while to get there.""
        Mind-body benefits
        Intuitive eating might result in weight loss, especially if listening to hunger and fullness cues leads you to eat less. A 2019 research review in the journal Obesity Reviews incorporated 10 studies that tracked the eating habits of nearly 1,500 people. Participants who followed an intuitive eating plan lost about the same amount as those on conventional weight-loss diets, and lost more weight than those who didn't change their eating habits.
        But Blake and Oliveira emphasize that weight loss isn't the goal of intuitive eating. Instead, learning to respect your body's ""set point"" — where your weight naturally falls when you're feeding it adequately and allowing for flexibility with food and movement — may be more realistic. A 2021 study in the International Journal of Eating Disorders suggests intuitive eating is linked with better self-esteem and body image.
        ""If people have a tough relationship with food stemming from a long history of dieting, they can feel better emotionally,"" Blake says. ""This also makes it easier to accept where their body is in terms of weight.""
        
          
            
              
                4 nutrition myths that can derail healthy eating
                Despite an explosion of science-backed nutrition information in recent years, certain dietary myths just won't quit. But these misconceptions can stop us from incorporating necessary nutrients into our meals, derailing a healthy diet, says Nancy Oliveira, a dietitian at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
                Social media is largely to blame, she says. Before the deluge of nutritional ""advice"" on Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms, people turned more readily to government guidelines and other trusted sources of health information. ""Now all these voices are saying, 'You can't eat certain things.' It totally confuses people,"" Oliveira says. ""It misleads and distracts them from what really matters.""
                Oliveira dishes on which myths seem most pervasive and why they're wrong:
                Myth: Plant-based milks are healthier than dairy. Soy, oat, almond, and other plant milks are a great option if you're lactose-intolerant or don't like cow's milk. But a cup of the latter contains about 10 grams of protein and 25% of our recommended daily calcium, while plant milks tend to have far less protein. Oliveira recommends examining labels, since milk of any kind may be fortified with protein, calcium, and vitamin D. ""If those nutrients are important to you, be sure to double-check, as amounts can vary among brands,"" she says.
                Myth: Avoid all carbs. Carbohydrates are an important component of a healthy diet, but the type of carbs matters. Eat fewer refined carbs — such as those in cakes, cookies, chips, and white breads — which lead to blood sugar spikes. Complex carbs from whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits keep us fuller longer and deliver a steadier fuel supply. ""There are good carbs, and our bodies need them,"" Oliveira says.
                Myth: Fresh fruits and vegetables are healthier than frozen. Produce starts losing nutrients at the moment it's harvested. But freezer versions are typically flash-frozen, preserving vitamin levels and preventing quick spoilage.
                Myth: Fat is bad. Decades after a low-fat craze began in the '90s, some people still believe all types of fat are verboten. But saturated fat — which comes from animal products such as red meat—is the less-healthy, artery-clogging choice. Replacing saturated fats in your diet with unsaturated fats from foods such as avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish helps protect heart health by raising levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol. Your body's cholesterol levels rise from eating a lot of fat, particularly saturated fat, but eating cholesterol itself doesn't have nearly the same impact. Beware of labels that say ""no cholesterol"" — this could be a plant-based food that actually has a lot of saturated fat.
              
            
          
        
        Tips for success
        Intrigued? Oliveira and Blake offer these tips to incorporate intuitive eating into your lifestyle.
        Be mindful during meals. This means chewing slowly, pausing between bites, and avoiding distractions such as screens.
        Stop feeling guilty. ""I don't care if you eat pepperoni pizza for every meal for an entire week,"" Blake says. ""Don't beat yourself up for any of your choices.""
        Keep a food journal, but skip the calorie counting. Track when you feel hungry and full, when and what you eat, and how you feel. ""You're shifting focus from nutrient and calorie content to why and what you're eating, and that's useful self-reflection,"" Oliveira says.
        Check your emotions. If you feel like eating shortly after your last meal, ask yourself if you're truly hungry, or if you're bored or stressed. This can stem from emotional eating. ""Maybe you need a nice cup of tea, a warm bath, or a walk instead,"" Oliveira says.
        Don't focus on weight loss. ""If you're focused on the scale, you're not going to listen to your body,"" Oliveira says. ""At least for a month, just focus on your body's signals.""
        Stay fueled. You're more likely to binge on cookies, for example, if you don't eat enough during the day and then come home to a waiting box of them. ""Part of intuitive eating is making sure you're eating enough over all so you're not trying to practice these principles while starving,"" Blake says.
        Seek support. Work with a registered dietitian or health coach for added insight.
        Be patient. Learning to trust your body's signals again takes time. ""There's going to be a lot of trial and error where you feel intuitive eating isn't working,"" Oliveira says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/keep-midday-naps-to-less-than-30-minutes,Keep midday naps to less than 30 minutes,"The health benefits of taking afternoon naps are well documented. They can improve mood, reduce fatigue, and increase alertness. But how long should they last? A study in the May 2023 issue of Obesity suggested the ideal duration is less than 30 minutes.
        The observational study included 3,275 healthy adults. Baseline health measurements were taken, and participants completed a questionnaire on their napping habits and other lifestyle factors like diet and sleep. The results found that compared with people who did not nap, those who took midday naps lasting 30 minutes or longer had a higher body mass index and levels of cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure. By contrast, those who had shorter naps (less than 30 minutes) did not share these risks and were even less likely to have elevated blood pressure than those who never napped.
        According to the researchers, some of these risks may be the result of long naps disrupting daily circadian rhythms, which can lead to insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes). Another possible connection could be overeating, as many people who napped for longer than 30 minutes reported feeling hungry and craving sweet foods afterward.
        Does it matter how often you nap? All afternoon nappers, no matter how long they slept, averaged about four naps per week, but the researchers found no link between frequency and higher health risks. So, enjoy your afternoon naps, but keep them under 30 minutes, and don't nap too late in the afternoon, as it could interfere with your night's sleep.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/try-this-swinging-with-kettlebells,Try this: Swinging with kettlebells,"Want to give your workouts a lift? Pick up a kettlebell. This versatile exercise tool resembles a cannonball with a handle on top and ranges in weight from 5 to 30-plus pounds. Kettlebells function similarly to dumbbells, and can substitute for them in traditional exercises like bicep curls, lunges, and squats. But the signature kettlebell move is the swing. Swings target usually weak muscle groups like those in the back of the thighs, the buttocks, the hips, and the lower back. They also can improve your posture, by engaging the core muscles. Here is how to do a swing:
        1. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and knees slightly bent. Hold a kettlebell with both hands and an overhand grip, arms extended down in front of you so the kettlebell hangs between your legs.
        2. Push your hips back then straighten your legs as you swing the kettlebell to the chest or eye level.
        3. Let the weight swing back down between your legs as you bend your hips and slightly bend your knees. This returns you to the starting position. Swing up again, and continue to repeat this back-and-forth swinging motion.
        Have a trainer demonstrate how to execute a proper swing before trying it yourself. Begin with a light weight and do up to 10 swings at first and progress from there.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/when-to-worry-about-your-memory,When to worry about your memory,"Ever had those ""senior moments""? You misplace your phone (which was just in your hand). You lose your train of thought during a conversation. You forget directions five minutes after being told. You can't remember the day, but then it pops into your head.
        These memory slips can be embarrassing and stressful, but are they normal mental lapses — or early signs of dementia?
        ""The brain is like any other part of the body, and over time, it may not function as well,"" says Ana Trueba Yepez, a psychologist with the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital. ""Brain regions involved with memory — like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex — can shrink, which makes it more difficult to multitask, stay focused, and hold on to information.""
        The good news is that these kinds of memory lapses are not automatic red flags for dementia. ""These episodes can be alarming, but for the most part, they are not something to worry about,"" says Trueba Yepez.
        Look for warning signs
        Senior moments may come and go. It's when they become more frequent or severe or if new cognitive issues emerge that they may signal a problem.
        For example, during conversations, you now have difficulty following conversations. Or you cut off people when they talk or begin discussing something unrelated to the conversation. Another warning sign is when memory lapses begin to interfere with daily life. For instance, you miss scheduled appointments, forget to pay bills, or fail to take regular medication. You may also have difficulty making decisions and forget regular grooming.
        ""Many times, people are not aware that memory issues have worsened,"" says Trueba Yepez. ""If you suspect any changes, no matter how innocent, it's best to ask family or friends to look for and point out changes in your memory, with examples.""
        Still, even these changes are not an automatic indicator of dementia. Sometimes, other factors like diet, alcohol use, medication, and mental problems (such as depression and anxiety) affect your memory. ""Many times, these issues show up in other ways besides memory problems, such as eating more unhealthy foods, showing less interest in your favorite activities, and not keeping up with hygiene and personal appearance,"" says Trueba Yepez.
        
          
            
              
                Manage your memory with DANCERS
                Enhance your memory and protect against dementia with DANCERS:
                D: Disease management. Control your weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels.
                A: Activity. Cardio exercise improves oxygen and blood flow to the brain.
                N: Nutrition. Poor nutrition leads to poor brain health. Adopt a plant-based diet.
                C: Cognitive stimulation. The more you engage your brain, the more likely you can retain memory.
                E: Engagement. Social isolation is linked to lower cognitive function.
                R: Relaxation. Your brain needs downtime. Do relaxing activities like yoga, meditation, or reading.
                S: Sleep. Sleep is when your brain cleans out toxins. Get seven to nine hours of sleep per night.
              
            
          
        
        Seeking help
        A primary care doctor is your first point of contact if you, or someone else, suspects a problem. As scary as it may seem to confront changes in memory, there are many benefits to taking a proactive approach, including these:
        Ruling out other causes. A medical evaluation can help determine if symptoms are related to a condition, like depression, anxiety, or insomnia. Other factors also can affect memory, such as an infection, a new medication, or an unintended interaction between a prescription drug and an over-the-counter product. Addressing the underlying problem may lead to improved memory.
        Discovering a problem early. Memory issues could be related to a series of tiny strokes that produce only subtle symptoms, such as short episodes of confusion. In these episodes, small arteries in the brain become narrowed or clogged with fatty deposits, decreasing blood flow. ""The brain damage is often so small and subtle that most people don't notice it or shrug it off,"" says Trueba Yepez. It's important to spot this problem as early as possible to prevent it from progressing to a condition called vascular dementia. Certain medications, such as statins and low-dose aspirin, and lifestyle changes may help prevent further cognitive decline.
        Getting help sooner. If your doctor may refer you for a neuropsychological evaluation to assesses other cognitive skills, such as attention, executive function, and language. If you are diagnosed with early dementia, it's best to catch it sooner than later, so you can begin to manage the condition.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sleep-problems-may-raise-the-risk-of-stroke,Sleep problems may raise the risk of stroke,"Sleep problems such as snoring, snorting, or getting too much or too little sleep may significantly raise the odds of having a stroke, a new analysis suggests.
        The international study, published online April 5, 2023, by Neurology, involved nearly 4,500 people (average age 62). About half of the group had already experienced a stroke. Participants were asked about their sleep behaviors over the prior month, including how many hours they usually slept, impaired sleep quality, and napping habits, as well as snoring, snorting, and other breathing problems during sleep. Too little sleep was defined as less than five hours nightly, while too much sleep was defined as more than nine hours.
        Each of the sleep symptoms raised stroke risk, but participants who reported five or more symptoms were five times likelier to have had a stroke compared with those who had no sleep issues. The results held even after the researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect stroke risk, such as smoking, physical activity level, depression, and alcohol consumption. The results suggest sleep problems should be factored into stroke prevention efforts, the study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/9-gerd-symptoms-to-know,9 GERD symptoms to know,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic medical condition that occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus — the tube connecting the mouth and stomach. This usually happens because the ringlike muscles that prevent backflow don't work properly.
        Common symptoms of GERD
        Two of the most common symptoms of GERD are heartburn and regurgitation. Many people experience both symptoms. However, some people can experience one without the other.
        Heartburn
        Heartburn can feel like a sharp, painful burning in the upper abdomen or middle of the chest, behind the breastbone. This is the most common symptom of GERD, and can rise up from the lower tip of the breastbone toward your throat. Heartburn may be worse when you eat, bend over, or lie down.
        Regurgitation
        Regurgitation is the backflow of stomach contents through your esophagus and into your throat or mouth. This may cause you to taste food or stomach acid.
        Other symptoms of GERD
        While chronic heartburn and regurgitation are common symptoms of GERD, you may experience one or more less common symptoms of the disease. Not all adults with GERD experience heartburn or regurgitation.
        Other symptoms of GERD may include:
        
          
            nausea
          
          difficulty swallowing (food sticks going down) or pain while swallowing (as food goes down)
          recurring sour or bitter taste in the mouth
          chronic cough
          hoarseness
          sore throat
          chest pain, or tightness in your chest or upper abdomen that may wake you up in the middle of the night.
        
        What health conditions can be mistaken with GERD?
        Pain that feels like heartburn also can be a symptom of a heart attack. In fact, the classic symptom of both heartburn and heart disease is discomfort in the center of the chest.
        Of the over eight million emergency room visits for chest pain each year, severe heartburn (GERD) accounts for over half the cases in which actual heart problems are ruled out.
        While heartburn is more likely to appear after a large or spicy meal, heart attacks are more common after physical exertion or stress. But if you're unsure, seek medical help right away.
        When should I see a doctor about GERD?
        You should see a doctor if you think you have GERD, or if your symptoms don't get better with over-the-counter medicines such as antacids or lifestyle changes. By seeing your doctor early, the physical cause of GERD can be treated, and more serious problems avoided.
        Always see a doctor if you have symptoms that could indicate GERD complications or other serious health problems, such as:
        
          chest pain
          loss of appetite
          persistent vomiting
          problems swallowing or pain while swallowing
          signs of bleeding in the digestive tract, such as
	vomit that contains blood or looks like coffee groundsstool that contains blood or looks black and tarry
          unexplained weight loss.
        
        If you think you may be having a heart attack, go to the emergency room.
        Up to 20% of the US population has GERD. GERD is more common among older adults, obese persons, and pregnant women.",Jenette Restivo,"July 31, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/gerd-diet-foods-to-avoid-to-reduce-acid-reflux,GERD diet: Foods to avoid to reduce acid reflux,"One of the most effective lifestyle changes you can make to prevent the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is to ensure your diet and eating habits do not trigger symptoms.
        Foods to avoid for GERD
        While people with acid reflux were once instructed to stick to bland foods, that's no longer the case. There are many healthy and delicious foods you can eat if you have GERD, as well as many interesting ways to prepare them.
        Still, some foods are more likely to trigger reflux and heartburn. Reflux-triggering foods include:
        
          Fatty and fried foods, which linger longer in the stomach, making it more likely that stomach acid leaks back up into the esophagus, causing uncomfortable GERD symptoms.
          Spicy foods, citrus, tomato sauces, and vinegar, which may intensify heartburn.
          Chocolate, caffeine, onions, peppermint, carbonated drinks, and alcohol, which are all common heartburn triggers.
        
        If you eat any of these foods regularly, try eliminating them to see if doing so reduces your reflux. Then you can try adding them back one by one.

        When making food choices, some foods have been found to be less reflux-triggering. The following foods may help you ease or avoid symptoms.
        
          Non-citrus fruits. While you should avoid citrus fruits, you can enjoy non-citrus fruits such as bananas, melons, apples, and pears, among others.
          Vegetables. Try to eat your vegetables raw. While tomato sauce may bother you, a fresh tomato may not.
          Lean meats. Lean meats that are grilled, poached, broiled, or baked are your best options. Try using fresh herbs, rather than spices, to make them flavorful.
          Oatmeal, whole-grain bread, rice, and couscous. These are all good sources of healthy complex carbs and fiber.
          Unsaturated fats from plants and fish. Replace saturated fats and trans fats with oils such as olive, sesame, canola, sunflower, and safflower; avocados; nuts and seeds; soybean; and fatty fish such as salmon and trout.
        
        Best GERD eating habits
        Besides specific types of foods, changes to eating habits can also help to prevent repeated bouts of heartburn and acid reflux.
        
          Eat smaller, more frequent meals.
          Do not lie down after eating. This means no naps right after lunch. When you're standing or sitting, gravity helps keeps acid in the stomach, where it belongs.
          Do not eat during the three to four hours before you go to bed. So, no late suppers or midnight snacks.
          Avoid vigorous exercise for a couple of hours after eating. A strenuous workout can send acid into your esophagus.
          If you're taking medication to help control your symptoms, it's probably okay to have a ""trigger"" food occasionally. But you should generally avoid foods that once caused heartburn.",Jenette Restivo,"July 31, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/exercise-and-your-arteries,Exercise and your arteries,"More than 300 years ago, the great English physician Thomas Sydenham observed, ""A man is as old as his arteries."" It's as true today as it was then. And in a 21st-century update on 17th-century wisdom, we might add that your health is only as good as your arteries, since these blood vessels carry vital oxygen-rich blood to all your body's tissues.
        Today we also know that regular exercise is one of the best ways to maintain artery health.
        Your arteries
        Doctors used to think of arteries as passive conduits for blood, working for your body the way a garden hose works for your lawn. Wrong! In fact, arteries are complex structures with crucial regulatory functions, and they are in the front line of the battle for cardiovascular health.
        Every artery has three layers in its wall. The inner layer, or intima, is composed of a thin layer of endothelial cells that are in direct contact with the bloodstream. The middle layer, or media, is composed chiefly of smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers. The outermost layer, or adventitia, is made up of supporting tissues that are dense and strong in larger arteries but nearly absent in the delicate blood vessels of the brain.
        Endothelial cells have a crucial role in vascular health, and exercise has an important effect on endothelial cells. If all the endothelial cells in your body were placed side by side, they would cover a football field; together, they weigh more than three pounds.
        Among other things, endothelial cells produce a molecule called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has two crucial functions. It keeps the arterial lining smooth and slippery, preventing white blood cells and platelets from latching on and causing damaging inflammation and artery-blocking blood clots. In addition, it relaxes the smooth muscle cells of the artery wall's middle layer, preventing spasms and keeping arteries open.
        Movement improves artery health
        Exercising muscles need more blood. And in response to regular exercise, they actually grow more blood vessels by expanding the network of capillaries. In turn, muscle cells boost levels of the enzymes that allow them to use oxygen to generate energy. More oxygen-rich blood and more efficient metabolism: It's the formula that explains why people who exercise regularly enhance their endurance and strength.
        To find out if exercise can affect arterial aging, scientists in Italy studied four groups of healthy people: young exercisers, young non-exercisers, elderly exercisers, and elderly non-exercisers. Comparing sedentary youths with sedentary senior citizens, they found that age took a substantial toll on endothelial function and nitric oxide production. But in people who exercised regularly, age had a much smaller effect; endothelial function still declined over the years, but there was a much smaller and more gradual drop in nitric oxide production. Indeed, exercise helped keep arteries young.
        The Italian researchers studied people who biked, ran, or swam at very high levels. But you don't have to be a triathlete to help your arteries stay young; just 2–3 miles of brisk walking nearly every day is a giant step in the right direction.
        And it's never too late to start. Scientists from the University of Colorado enrolled 20 sedentary men with an average age of 53 in an exercise program that consisted primarily of walking. At the end of three months, the men had improved their endothelial function so much that they achieved results similar to those of middle-aged and older men who had exercised for years. True, the Colorado volunteers were all healthy, but similar studies of patients with coronary artery disease have demonstrated that exercise can produce important gains in endothelial function, even in people who already have atherosclerosis.",Unknown,"July 31, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/preventing-sudden-heart-death-in-children-4-questions-can-help-202107092540,Preventing sudden heart death in children and teens: 4 questions can help,"It's incredibly rare for a child or teen to die suddenly because of a heart problem, but it's a horrible tragedy when it does, especially because often it could have been prevented — if someone had just asked the right question.
        We tend to think about sudden deaths like these in athletes, since we commonly hear about them happening on a playing field — and because most of the prevention efforts have been aimed at athletes. But they absolutely can happen in children and teens who aren't athletes, according to a 2021 policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics. The guidance it offers helps primary care pediatricians better screen their patients for the heart problems that can lead to sudden death. Here's what parents need to understand and do.
        What might cause sudden cardiac arrest or death in children or teens?
        There are several heart conditions that can lead to a risk of sudden death. They include
        
          Cardiomyopathies. These are problems with the muscle of the heart. There are a few different kinds, but the kind most likely to lead to sudden death is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick.
          A problem with a coronary artery. The coronary arteries bring oxygenated blood to the heart muscle. If there is a problem with one or both arteries, the heart muscle may not get that needed blood supply. Called an anomalous coronary artery, this is the second leading cause of sudden death after hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
          Problems with the electrical conduction system of the heart. This is the system that causes the heart to contract and move blood through the body. Problems with this conduction system can lead to an arrhythmia — and the heart may not be able to move blood well or at all.
          Congenital heart disease. When children are born with a heart defect, it puts them at higher risk of arrhythmia, either because of the defect itself or the surgery that was done to treat it.
          Aortopathies. This is the medical term for having something wrong with the aorta that might lead it to balloon (aneurysm) and split open. (The aorta is the main blood vessel leading from the heart to the rest of the body.) Marfan's syndrome is one condition that can cause this, but there are others as well.
        
        Four important screening questions can help identify cardiac risk
        Many of these conditions can and do go unrecognized for years. However, the AAP says that these four questions can help identify which children may be at risk:
        
          Have you ever fainted, passed out, or had an unexplained seizure suddenly and without warning, especially during exercise or in response to sudden loud noises such as doorbells, alarm clocks, or ringing telephones?
          Have you ever had exercise-related chest pain or shortness of breath? Most of the time, this is just from a pulled muscle or asthma. But it may be related to the heart, especially if the pain feels like pressure; radiates to the neck or arm; is associated with sweating, nausea, or fainting; or happens with exercise, straining, or stress.
          Has anyone in your immediate family (parents, grandparents, siblings) or other more distant relatives (aunts, uncles, cousins) died of heart problems or had an unexpected sudden death before age 50? (This includes unexpected drownings, unexplained car accidents in which the relative was driving, and sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS.)
          Are you related to anyone with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, Marfan syndrome, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), or anyone younger than 50 years with a pacemaker or implantable defibrillator?
        
        The last question underlines the importance of knowing details of your family history. We don't always like to pry, but knowing the details can be crucial for the health of others in the family. So don't be afraid to ask family members about the exact diagnosis they have been given by a doctor — and then share that diagnosis with your doctor. This is true of all health problems, not just heart problems. Of course, some people may not have access to their family health information.
        How often should this screening be done?
        Ideally, according to the AAP, your child's doctor should ask these questions at routine checkups at least once every three years, or on entry to middle or junior high school and on entry to high school. If the answer is yes to any of the questions, the child should be referred to a cardiologist (or to a cardiologist that specializes in arrhythmias) for further evaluation. Until they are cleared, they shouldn't participate in sports.
        Families don't need to wait for a pediatrician to ask the questions, though. If the answer to any of them is yes, or might be yes, talk to your child's doctor right away. You could literally save your child's life.","Claire McCarthy, MD","July 29, 2023",1

However, today we are increasingly realizing that different systems of the body are interconnected and cannot be completely understood in isolation. The brain-gut connection is one very important example of this phenomenon.
        Anatomy of the brain-gut connection
        What exactly is the connection between brain and gut? The brain sends signals to the digestive, or gastrointestinal (GI), tract via the sympathetic (""fight or flight"") nervous system and the parasympathetic (""rest and digest"") nervous system. The balance of signals from these two inputs can affect the speed at which food moves through the digestive system, absorption of nutrients, secretion of digestive juices, and level of inflammation in the digestive system.
        The digestive system also has its own nervous system, the enteric nervous system, consisting of approximately 100 million nerve cells in and around the GI tract. The enteric nervous system receives inputs from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems but can also function independently of them.
        The enteric nervous system is also intimately interconnected with millions of immune cells. These cells survey the digestive system and convey information, such as whether the stomach is bloated or whether there is infection in the GI tract or insufficient blood flow, back to the brain. Thus, the brain and GI system communicate with one another in both directions.
        Effects of stress and negative emotions on the gut
        Because of this strong brain-gut connection, stress and a variety of negative emotions such as anxiety, sadness, depression, fear, and anger can all affect the GI system. These triggers can speed up or slow down the movements of the GI tract and the contents within it; make the digestive system overly sensitive to bloating and other pain signals; make it easier for bacteria to cross the gut lining and activate the immune system; increase inflammation in the gut; and change the gut microbiota (the types of bacteria that reside in the gut). That's why stress and strong emotions can contribute to or worsen a variety of GI conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and food allergies and sensitivities.
        The negative changes in the GI system can then feed back on the brain, creating a vicious cycle. For example, new research is demonstrating that increased gut inflammation and changes in the gut microbiome can have profound effects throughout the body and contribute to fatigue, cardiovascular disease, and depression.
        Mind-body approaches to GI ailments
        Given this strong mind-body/brain-gut connection, it should come as no surprise that mind-body tools such as meditation, mindfulness, breathing exercises, yoga, and gut-directed hypnotherapy have all been shown to help improve GI symptoms, improve mood, and decrease anxiety. They decrease the body's stress response by dampening the sympathetic nervous system, enhancing the parasympathetic response, and decreasing inflammation.
        Other integrative approaches
        We've also learned that certain kinds of foods can trigger specific reactions in the gut of sensitive individuals. In those cases, specific diets, such as low-FODMAP for IBS or avoiding acidic foods for GERD, can be helpful for managing symptoms. Diet also profoundly affects the gut microbiome. For example, eating a more plant-based diet with few refined carbohydrates and little or no red meat often leads to a healthier microbiome. These dietary changes in turn reduce intestinal inflammation and may help reduce systemic symptoms such as fatigue or depression and the risk of cardiovascular disease.
        Although each person's situation is unique, a combination of integrative approaches can be helpful for reducing GI symptoms and reestablishing both a healthy gut and a healthy mind.","Michelle Dossett, MD, PhD, MPH","July 26, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/treating-constipation-with-biofeedback-for-the-pelvic-floor-2019051616638,Treating constipation with biofeedback for the pelvic floor,"Constipation is often clinically defined as having three or fewer bowel movements a week. Sometimes this is about expectations; people generally feel like they're not ""healthy"" if they don't have a bowel movement every day. But three bowel movements a week can be normal for some people, especially if that has been their pattern for a long time.
        There are many other factors that affect how people perceive bowel movements. According to the Rome IV criteria of constipation often used in research, frequency alone doesn't explain all complaints of constipation. Patients complaining of two or more of the following also qualify for a diagnosis of constipation:
        
          feelings of incompletely evacuating (not getting everything out)
          straining
          lumpy or hard consistency of the stool
          sensation of blockage
          using a finger to dislodge the stool.
        
        When constipation is a problem, there are two main reasons for it: slow movement of the colon and pelvic floor dysfunction. Treatment for slowed movement of the colon is usually laxatives and drugs to move your colon. But getting your pelvic floor evaluated is worthwhile, because a diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunction typically involves nondrug treatment.
        Pelvic floor dysfunction
        The pelvic floor is a muscular bowl that encompasses the rectum, bladder, and (for women) the uterus. There is a complex interaction among these different organs. In the act of defecating, or having a bowel movement, the anal sphincter (the group of muscles at the end of the rectum) has to relax, and the abdominal muscles need to contract.
        A common analogy I give is that it's like getting toothpaste out of a tube. When you want the toothpaste to come out, you loosen the cap and press on the tube. However, if you leave the cap on or even tighten it, pressing is not going to get the toothpaste out. In the same way, some people who have constipation fail to relax, or actually tighten, their anal sphincter, while using their abdominal muscles to contract the colon when they are trying to defecate. This leads to feelings of incompletely evacuating; hard, small stools; or even feeling like you have to use your finger to get the stool out.
        These uncoordinated pelvic floor dynamics are usually diagnosed with a test called anorectal manometry, which uses a thin tube to measure pressures, sensations, and reflexes in the rectum and anal sphincter.
        Biofeedback-based physical therapy to treat pelvic floor dysfunction
        The good news is that treatment typically does not involve medications. Instead, treatment involves physical therapy in the form of biofeedback. Currently, the best way to undergo physical therapy is in a private setting, with the help of a trained physical therapist who coaches you on the dynamics of defecating. During these sessions, the physical therapist inserts a probe into your anal sphincter and places sticky pads on your abdomen, to detect the movement of your anal sphincter and abdominal wall as you simulate defecation.
        By doing this, you receive feedback (either visual or verbal) on what you are doing with your abdominal wall muscles and anal sphincter during a bowel movement. The physical therapist will lead you through breathing exercises, as well as muscle strengthening and relaxation exercises, in order to help you retrain the movement and coordination of your pelvic floor.
        There are currently no devices available for at-home training, but such devices are undergoing research and development.
        The physical therapist will also discuss dietary recommendations including increased water and fiber consumption, positioning techniques (like using a Squatty Potty), or massaging your abdomen to stimulate the gut.
        The usual time commitment is about four to eight sessions, one session a week. Like physical therapy for your shoulder or your back, learning what you have done in physical therapy takes time and also practice at home. Some people understand and incorporate these techniques right away, and others take more time and practice.
        Retraining your body to change the way you have a bowel movement takes time. But it could potentially help with all of the symptoms of constipation.","Judy Nee, MD","July 26, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/hemorrhoid-help-preventing-and-treating-flare-ups,Hemorrhoid help: preventing and treating flare-ups,"The best way to keep hemorrhoid flare-ups at bay is to maintain healthy lifestyle habits. Preventing constipation is key. Make sure your diet always includes enough fiber to promote healthy bowel movements, and be mindful about staying well hydrated. If you need help with your water intake, keep a water bottle by your side at all times as a reminder to drink. Jazz up your water with a slice of lemon, lime, or orange.
        Also, regular exercise supports good bowel function, so if you do not exercise on a regular basis, this is a good time to begin. Don't try to immediately reach the goal of at least 150 minutes per week of exercise. Begin with short periods of walking. Over time, you can increase your speed and duration of activity. Get your doctor's okay if you have any reservations about exercising or you plan to begin a vigorous routine.
        There are other simple, everyday habits you can develop to help with relief when a hemorrhoid flare-up arises. For example:
        Less strain, more gain. Don't delay bowel movements during flareups. Always go when you feel the urge, as putting off bowel movements can cause stool to back up, leading to increased pressure and straining, which aggravates your hemorrhoids. Also, try not to sit on the toilet for long periods; this tends to make hemorrhoids push out and swell up. A way to make going to the bathroom easier—and faster—is to elevate your feet with a step stool as you sit on the toilet. This changes the position of the rectum in a way that could allow for easier passage of stools.
        Keep the area clean. After every bowel movement, clean the anal area with a witch hazel pad, a soothing baby wipe, or a cotton cloth soaked in warm water. Be thorough but gentle. Aggressive rubbing and scrubbing, especially with soaps or other skin cleansers, can irritate the skin and make your hemorrhoids worse. Applying petroleum jelly or aloe vera gel to the anal area can soothe irritation after a bowel movement.
        Take a soft seat. Sitting on a cushion rather than a hard surface helps reduce the swelling of existing hemorrhoids and prevents the formation of new ones.",Unknown,"July 26, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/take-control-of-your-heartburn,Take control of your heartburn,"A muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) separates the esophagus from the stomach. Normally, the LES works something like a gate. The muscle relaxes when you swallow, opening the passage between the esophagus and stomach and allowing food to pass into the stomach. When the sphincter tightens, it closes the passage, keeping food and acidic stomach juices from flowing back into the esophagus. In people with acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD), the LES relaxes when it shouldn't or becomes weak and doesn't close tightly. Either problem allows the contents of the stomach to rise up into the esophagus. The LES is controlled by various nerves and hormones. As a result, foods, drugs, and certain emotions such as anxiety or anger can impair its function, causing or worsening acid reflux. The following factors are under your power to change:
        
          Certain foods. Coffee, tea, cocoa, cola drinks, and other caffeine-containing products loosen the LES and stimulate gastric acid production. Mints and chocolate, often served to cap off a meal, can make things worse by relaxing the LES. Fried and fatty foods contribute to heartburn. Some people say that onions and garlic give them heartburn. Others have trouble with citrus fruits or tomato products, which irritate the esophageal lining. 
          Eating patterns. How you eat can be as important as what you eat. Skipping breakfast or lunch and then consuming a huge meal at day's end can increase pressure in the stomach and the possibility of reflux. Lying down soon after eating will make the problem worse.
          Smoking. Smoking can irritate the entire gastrointestinal tract. In addition, frequent sucking on a cigarette can cause you to swallow air. This increases pressure inside the stomach, which encourages reflux. Smoking can also relax the LES.
          Overweight and obesity. Being overweight or obese increases the odds of having GERD and experiencing heartburn. Actually, any weight gain increases the risk of frequent GERD symptoms. In addition, eating larger meals distends the stomach, pushes the contents up toward the esophagus and loosens the LES.
          Certain medications. Some prescription drugs can add to the woes of heartburn. Oral contraceptives or postmenopausal hormone preparations containing progesterone are known culprits. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) can irritate the stomach lining. Other drugs—such as alendronate (Fosamax), used to prevent and treat osteoporosis—can irritate the esophagus. And some antidepressants, bronchodilators, tranquilizers, and calcium-channel blockers can contribute to reflux by relaxing the LES.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/living-with-lactose-intolerance,Living with lactose intolerance,"Food intolerance and food allergies often produce similar symptoms, but they're not the same. If dairy products leave you feeling gassy and bloated or cause diarrhea or nausea, you may have either condition.
        What's the difference? A dairy allergy is an immune system response to milk protein. In addition to feeling bloated or causing diarrhea, symptoms of a dairy allergy can include hives, wheezing, vomiting, cramps, and skin rashes. Dairy intolerance results from inadequate levels of lactase, the enzyme that breaks down milk sugar. While lactose intolerance can cause a lot of discomfort, it isn't life threatening, while a milk allergy can be.
        The severity of lactose intolerance varies. For some people, consuming any dairy product causes their digestive tracts to rebel. Others can enjoy yogurt, ice cream, or even an occasional glass of milk.
        The most successful approach to coping with lactose intolerance is to first avoid all dairy products. If you are lactose intolerant and love milk in all its forms, try experimenting with small amounts of dairy. In general, yogurt, cheese, and sour cream may be easier to tolerate because they contain less lactose than milk. However, several studies suggest that many people who are lactose intolerant can consume the equivalent of eight ounces of milk with no ill effects, and somewhat more when the lactose-containing food is part of a meal.
        Supplements containing enzymes produced by lactose-digesting bacteria (Lactaid, Lactrase, others) can be taken as tablets or added to foods. Some milk products (Lactaid) to which lactase has been added may contain little or no lactose, and they may taste sweeter than untreated products, because the milk sugar has already been broken down. 
        The response to these products is highly individual. What works for your will depend on the amount of lactase your body produces, the type of intestinal bacteria that inhabit your colon, and the product itself. Finding the right approach for you can be a trial-and-error process. While this may take some time and expense, experimenting isn't likely to be harmful.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/11-stomach-soothing-steps-for-heartburn,11 stomach-soothing steps for heartburn,"Heartburn, that uncomfortable burning sensation that radiates up the middle of the chest, is the most common digestive malady. It's the result of a condition known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), often called acid reflux, in which stomach acid leaks upward from the stomach into the esophagus.
        While heartburn should not be ignored, there are many stomach-soothing steps you can try before going to a doctor. These can help cool your symptoms and prevent bigger problems later on. 
        
          Eat smaller meals, but more often. A full stomach puts pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a valve-like muscle that keeps stomach acid from backing up into the esophagus.
          Eat in a slow, relaxed manner. Wolfing down your food fills your stomach faster, putting more pressure on the LES.
          Remain upright after meals. Lying down increases pressure on the LES, which makes acid reflux more likely.
          Avoid late-night eating. Eating a meal or snack within three hours of lying down to sleep can worsen reflux and heartburn symptoms. Leave enough time for the stomach to clear out.
          Don't exercise immediately after meals. Give your stomach time to empty; wait a couple of hours after eating before exercising.
          Tilt your torso with a bed wedge. Raising your torso up a bit with a wedge-shaped cushion reduces the pressure on the LES and may ease nighttime heartburn. Wedges are available from medical supply companies. Don't just prop your head and shoulders up with pillows, which can actually worsen reflux.
          Stay away from carbonated beverages. They cause belching, which promotes reflux of stomach acid.
          Find the foods that trigger your symptoms and avoid them. Some foods and drinks increase acid secretion, delay stomach emptying, or loosen the LES — conditions that set the stage for heartburn. Common offenders include fatty foods, spicy foods, tomatoes, garlic, milk, coffee, tea, cola, peppermint, and chocolate.
          Chew sugarless gum after a meal. Chewing gum promotes salivation, which neutralizes acid, soothes the esophagus, and washes acid back down to the stomach. Avoid peppermint flavors, which may trigger heartburn.
          Check your medications. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of the medications you take could worsen acid reflux or inflame the esophagus. For example, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline loosen the LES and tetracyclines such as doxycycline can cause esophageal inflammation.
          Lose weight if you need to. Being overweight puts more pressure on the stomach (and the LES).
        
        If changing your eating habits and other preventive steps don't get heartburn under control, talk with your doctor. He or she can advise you on which medications to try and recommend additional follow up if necessary.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-a-multivitamin-improve-your-memory-202307242957,Can a multivitamin improve your memory?,"We're bombarded with advertisements that tout all sorts of health benefits for vitamins and supplements, including improved memory. A May 2023 study of older adults suggests that a daily multivitamin can do just that — improve your memory enough such that it can function as if you were three years younger.
        So, should you take that daily multivitamin? Let's take a close look at the study.
        Who took part in this multivitamin study?
        This research is part of a larger study examining the effects of a multivitamin and/or cocoa (the main ingredient in chocolate) on cardiovascular and cancer outcomes. A prior sub-study found that a daily multivitamin improved thinking and memory — at least when evaluated with cognitive testing completed by phone.
        For this study, 3,562 participants were willing and able to perform some tests of thinking and memory on a home computer. Half received a multivitamin; the other half received a placebo.
        The participants identified as 93% white, 2.5% African American, and 1.4% Hispanic, so the results may not be generalizable. They were also well educated: more than half had completed college. In both groups, the average age was 71.
        How did the researchers test memory?
        The investigators evaluated the participants' thinking and memory at baseline and after one, two, and three years.
        For the memory test, participants were asked to memorize 20 words shown consecutively on a computer screen. Immediately after viewing these words, they had to type in as many words as they could remember (this was the primary measure of memory). Fifteen minutes later, they also typed in all the words they recalled (a secondary measure of memory).
        Other secondary measures included:
        
          a novel object discrimination test (is this object the same or different from one recently shown?)
          an executive control test (in an array of nine arrows, is the central arrow red or blue?).
        
        The participants repeated all of the tests one, two, and three years later.
        What were the results of this study?
        The two groups differed in immediate recall at year one:
        
          Those who took a placebo went from immediately recalling an average of 7.21 words at baseline to 7.65 words (a difference of 0.43 words)
          Those who took a daily multivitamin group went from 7.10 words at baseline to 7.81 words (a difference of 0.70 words).
        
        This result was statistically significant. Additionally, these small effects held up at years two and three. By year three, the placebo group immediately recalled an average of 8.17 words and the multivitamin group immediately recalled 8.28 words.
        No differences occurred between the two groups on secondary memory and executive function tests.
        How can a multivitamin improve memory?
        The authors note that low levels of vitamins B12 and D have been linked to cognitive decline and dementia. In a subset of participants who had their blood drawn, the levels of these vitamins did rise in the multivitamin group.
        It seems plausible that a few of the 3,562 participants had low levels of these or other vitamins that are important for thinking and memory. In the placebo group, the few who had vitamin deficiencies would likely show less improvement in memory after their baseline tests, or a small decline. By contrast, those few participants in the multivitamin group with deficiencies would have them corrected by the supplements and, therefore, would perform relatively better.
        Although this is just speculation, it would explain the small but seemingly real results — results that replicate the researchers' prior study, which used a telephone cognitive test to show thinking and memory benefit from a daily multivitamin.
        It's also worth noting that practice on memory tasks — the so-called practice effect — could contribute to small improvements shown from baseline to year one and year three.
        Should you take a multivitamin to improve your memory?
        The authors admitted that the effect of the multivitamin on immediate memory was small and may not be noticeable. However, they pointed out that this small effect could be important at the level of an entire population.
        My opinion? You shouldn't bother taking a multivitamin to try to improve your immediate recall of 20 words from 8.17 to 8.28 words. But it is worth speaking with your doctor about whether you could have a vitamin deficiency in B1, B6, B12, D, or any other important vitamins. I see several patients in my clinic every week who have startlingly low levels of vitamin D and B12. Your doctor may want to measure these levels. Or they may suggest simply taking a multivitamin daily.
        If, after reading this article, you've decided to take a multivitamin, please check with your doctor or pharmacist about which one would be best for you. Make sure that they review any other vitamins, supplements, and medications you take to avoid rare but serious interactions.","Andrew E. Budson, MD","July 24, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/understanding-triglycerides,Understanding triglycerides,"Q.
          I just got the results of my lipid profile. My cholesterol is high, but so are my triglycerides. What exactly are triglycerides, and how are they different from cholesterol?
        
        A. Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in the bloodstream. They consist of three fatty acid chains linked by a molecule called glycerol.
        When you eat food, enzymes in your gut break down fats into their component fatty acids, which are then reassembled to create triglyceride particles. These fatty particles can't move freely through the watery bloodstream. So they combine with cholesterol and protein to form lipoproteins. Your lipid profile lists two of these lipoproteins: low-density lipoprotein (better known as LDL cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (also called HDL cholesterol).
        But there are actually several other types of lipoproteins, including some that contain mainly triglycerides. Triglycerides can provide energy to fuel your body, while the extras are deposited in fat tissue. After a very heavy, fatty meal, your bloodstream may contain so many triglyceride particles that a blood sample may have a milky tint. But within a few hours, they're mostly cleared out. When you need energy between meals, hormones release the stored triglycerides into the bloodstream.
        Your liver also converts carbohydrates into triglycerides. When you eat extra calories — especially from carbohydrate-rich foods such as sweets and white bread — your liver churns out extra triglycerides. Other things that can raise blood levels of triglycerides include being overweight or obese, smoking, or heavy drinking. Certain medical conditions —including diseases affecting the liver, kidneys, or thyroid, and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes — can also lead to high triglycerides.
        For healthy adults, normal triglyceride levels are under 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Values of 151 to 200 mg/dL are considered borderline high; those 201 to 499 are high, and those 500 and higher are very high (and increase the risk of inflammation of the pancreas gland, called pancreatitis). Growing evidence suggests that above-normal triglyceride levels can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease independent of cholesterol levels.
        To get your triglycerides back into a normal range, start with lifestyle changes. Aim for a healthy weight, get regular exercise, and eat more whole, unprocessed grains. Eat fewer refined carbohydrates, and cut back on saturated fat from meat. Ideally it's best to avoid alcohol, but at the minimum, limit it to no more than one drink on any given day.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/looking-for-a-mellow-form-of-exercise-try-tai-chi,Looking for a mellow form of exercise? Try tai chi,"This ancient Chinese practice may help lower blood pressure and offer other heart-related benefits.
        
        
          
        
        Tai chi is a slow, flowing form of exercise that's sometimes described as ""meditation in motion."" The practice involves a series of choreographed moves with evocative descriptions, such as ""grasp the sparrow's tail"" or ""wave hands like clouds."" As your body moves, your mind has to focus. But tai chi also encourages relaxation, which helps ease stress.
        Those features are all important aspects of mind-body therapies, many of which seem to benefit heart health, says Dr. Gloria Yeh, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""On a simple level, tai chi is a very accessible form of exercise,"" she says. The movements are easy to adapt to different levels of intensity, and you can even do certain movements while seated in a chair. Tai chi doesn't require fully extending or stretching your joints, so it's also fine for people who are not so flexible.
        A gateway exercise
        Tai chi can be a good gateway exercise for people who cannot or will not engage in more conventional exercise. Even people who are out of shape can do tai chi, which can help build strength and confidence, both physically and mentally. And if you practice more vigorously or sink deeper into the poses, tai chi can provide a moderate aerobic workout.
        But the meditative aspects of tai chi that teach body awareness, slowing down, and stress management are also important, says Dr. Yeh, who directs the Mind-Body Research program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. People prone to heart disease can benefit from holistic approaches that address their overall well-being, she adds.
        Protecting the heart
        Studies exploring the health benefits of tai chi — which also include reduced pain and improved mood — date back to the 1950s. Tai chi may help lower cholesterol levels and dampen inflammation, both of which are linked to better heart health. But the best evidence seems to be for improving blood pressure, according to a 2008 review of 26 studies co-authored by Dr. Yeh in the journal Preventive Cardiology. In people with high blood pressure, systolic blood pressure (the first number in a blood pressure reading) fell seven to 32 points, while diastolic pressure (the second number) fell by two to 18 points.
        Healing the heart
        Tai chi may be a promising addition to cardiac rehabilitation, a multiweek program of structured exercise paired with lifestyle and nutrition education. Cardiac rehab, which is covered by Medicare, improves quality of life and survival after a serious heart-related problem, procedure, or surgery. But according to the American Heart Association, only about a quarter of eligible Medicare recipients participate in these programs. Studies by Dr. Yeh and others suggest that for people who decline cardiac rehab, tai chi can help them ease into exercising more, losing weight, and enjoying a better quality of life. As this research continues to grow, tai chi may become a more popular option in conjunction with cardiac rehab, says Dr. Yeh. Many academic medical centers, including Harvard Medical School, have integrative medicine programs that offer tai chi classes.
        Getting started with tai chi
        You also can find local tai chi classes at martial arts studios, community centers, health clubs, Y's, and senior centers. Costs vary widely, ranging from about $7 to $18 for an hourlong class. Wear loose, comfortable clothing, and supportive shoes like sneakers (or no shoes, if you prefer). During the class, the instructor will demonstrate graceful, slow arm and leg movements, often done with a slight bend in the knees. ""You might learn to let go of extra muscle tension, take deep breaths, and pay attention to how your body feels,"" says Dr. Yeh.
        You can learn tai chi from a watching a DVD, which you can also use to practice at home. But going to a class has certain advantages. It may be easier to grasp the concepts with a live instructor with whom you can interact, and being in a group provides both camaraderie and motivation.
        For more detailed information, check out the Harvard Medical School Special Health Report An Introduction to Tai Chi (/tai). The electronic version includes links to videos demonstrating the moves. World Tai Chi Day is celebrated on the last Saturday of April with free classes around the world; see www.worldtaichiday.org.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/conquering-your-salt-habit,Conquering your salt habit,"Your need salt — sodium chloride — to survive. Your body needs sodium to transmit nerve impulses, contract muscle fibers, and, along with potassium, to balance fluid levels in all your cells.
        The body is so good at holding on to this vital mineral that you need to consume only a tiny amount of it each day. Too much sodium sets off a cascade of physiological changes that can raise blood pressure. Over time, uncontrolled high blood pressure can stress the heart and blood vessels, which can lead to stroke or heart attack.
        
          Simple ways to control sodium
        
        The Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health teamed up with the Culinary Institute of America to create two dozen science-based strategies for cutting back on salt — without compromising the flavor of the foods you enjoy. Here are five of those tips.
        
          Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables. Our bodies need more potassium than sodium. But most Americans' diets are just the opposite, which can contribute to high blood pressure. Fruits and vegetables are naturally low in sodium, and many fruits and vegetables are good sources of potassium. Filling your plate with them will boost your potassium and shift the sodium-potassium balance in your favor.
          
          Embrace healthy fats and oils. Unfortunately, the big low-fat and no-fat product push in the 1990s wasn't rooted in sound science. Many well-meaning product developers cut both the good and bad fats out of formulations, and in order to maintain consumer acceptance of their products, they were forced to increase levels of sugar and sodium. So skip most fat- free salad dressings and other similar products, and you'll be doing your blood pressure a favor.
          
          Stealth health. The average person can't detect moderate changes in sodium levels, including reductions of up to as much as 25%. Many food manufacturers and restaurant companies have already made or are in the process of making substantial cuts in sodium — some all at once and some over time — that their customers will not be able to detect.
          
          Retrain your taste buds. We can shift our sense of taste to enjoy foods with lower levels of sodium. One key to success: make the changes gradually and consistently over a period of time, rather than trying to cut back by a large amount all at once. Try this trick: combine a reduced-sodium version of a favorite product (like vegetable soup, for example) with a regular version in proportions that gradually favor the reduced-sodium version.
          
          Watch out for hidden sodium. ""Fresh"" and ""natural"" meats and poultry may be injected with salt solutions as part of their processing, and manufacturers are not required to list the sodium content on the label. Some foods that are high in sodium may not taste especially salty, such as breakfast cereals, bakery muffins, energy drinks, and sports drinks.",Unknown,"July 24, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/can-a-salt-substitute-cause-high-potassium-levels,Can a salt substitute cause high potassium levels?,"Ask the doctorI'm trying to eat less salt and was thinking about trying a salt substitute. But I know these contain potassium, and I've heard that too much potassium can be dangerous for your heart. What do you recommend?First, remember that at least 75% of the sodium in the average American diet comes from processed foods, such as cold cuts and cured meats, pizza, burgers, and sandwiches. So in many cases, changing the contents of your saltshaker doesn't make that big a difference. A more effective strategy is to include more fruits and vegetables in your diet.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/they-found-colon-polyps-now-what,They found colon polyps: Now what?,"Follow-up exams at the right time are essential to prevent cancer from developing.
        
        Colorectal cancer is one of the most preventable forms of cancer—if you are screened for hidden warning signs while you are still healthy. Screening finds precancerous growths on the colon wall, called polyps, which the doctor can then remove.
        They are not cancer, and most of them have not started to change into cancer. If you get them at the precancerous phase, they don't have a chance to grow and turn into cancer.
        But you will need to come back for follow-up testing to see if more polyps turn up in the future. Here is what to expect.
        What are polyps?
        A colonoscope, the flexible device used to inspect the colon, can grab and snip off polyps if they are relatively small. The timing of follow-up depends on what kind of polyps the doctor finds, how many, and how big they are.
        Hyperplastic polyps: These polyps are not precancerous. Doctors generally remove them anyway, just to be safe.
        Adenomas: Many colon polyps are the precancerous type, called adenomas. It can take seven to 10 or more years for an adenoma to evolve into cancer—if it ever does. Overall, only 5% of adenomas progress to cancer, but your individual risk is hard to predict. Doctors remove all the adenomas they find.
        Sessile serrated polyps: Once thought harmless, this type of adenoma is now known to be risky. These are also removed.
        When to return for follow-up
        After polyps are removed, you will need to return for an additional colonoscopy. There is a 25% to 30% chance that a repeat colonoscopy will find additional polyps. How soon you need to return for follow-up depends largely on the size of the polyps found in the first exam.
        If the colonoscopy finds one or two small polyps (5 mm in diameter or smaller), you are considered at relatively low risk. Most people will not have to return for a follow-up colonoscopy for at least five years, and possibly longer.
        If the polyps are larger (10 mm or larger), more numerous, or abnormal in appearance under a microscope, you may have to return in three years or sooner.
        If the exam finds no polyps, you can usually wait 10 years for the next screening if you are at average risk for colon cancer. 
        
          
            
              
                
                  How a colon polyp progresses to cancer
                
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        Get the best exam you can
        Whenever you have a colonoscopy, you should have the highest quality exam possible so the doctor can find all the polyps. During the colon-cleansing ""prep"" before the colonoscopy, follow the instructions to the letter. Eating a low-fiber diet for four to five days may improve the quality of the prep. That's because fiber gets stuck in the nooks and crannies of the colon wall and can block the doctor's view. For colonoscopy to prevent cancer, the doctor must find and remove as many precancerous growths as possible.
        Reducing your risk
        After polyp removal, certain steps may lower your risk of colon cancer:
        Eat less meat: Eat a healthy diet, with minimal red meat—especially processed or cured meats. Studies suggest that people with meat-rich diets tend to have higher rates of colon cancer.
        Aspirin: Some research suggests that taking aspirin may reduce overall colon cancer risk, but the evidence is not definite. If you need to take aspirin for your heart, then it may offer some protection for the colon.
        Calcium: Research has also linked a calcium-rich diet to lower colon cancer risk, but this, too, is uncertain. If you are already eating a healthy calcium rich diet to preserve bone health, you might get an extra ""bump"" of cancer prevention.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/3-surprising-risks-of-poor-posture,3 surprising risks of poor posture,"America, we have a posture problem. Whether it's the result of sitting at a desk all day, looking down at a smartphone, or lounging on a couch, poor posture is dogging people of all ages. And health experts are worried. ""It's a common and important health problem among Americans, and it can lead to neck pain, back problems, and other aggravating conditions,"" says Meghan Markowski, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Other posture-related problems
        While back and neck conditions top the list of potential posture woes, there are many others — such as poor balance, headaches, and breathing difficulties. ""Researchers are also looking into whether posture affects mood, sleep, fatigue, and jaw alignment,"" Markowski says.
        Three other problems linked to poor posture may surprise you.
        1. Incontinence. Poor posture promotes stress incontinence — when you leak a little urine if you laugh or cough. ""Slouching increases abdominal pressure, which puts pressure on the bladder. The position also decreases the ability of the pelvic floor muscles to hold against that pressure,"" notes Markowski, who specializes in helping people overcome bladder, bowel, and pelvic floor problems.
        2. Constipation. Poor posture on a toilet — hunched over with your knees lower than your hips — can promote constipation. ""That position closes the anus somewhat and makes it harder for the abdominal muscles to help move feces out,"" Markowski says. Constipation is characterized by fewer than three bowel movements per week; hard, dry stools; straining to move the bowels; and a sense of an incomplete evacuation.
        3. Heartburn and slowed digestion. Slouched posture after a meal can trigger heartburn caused by acid reflux (when stomach acid squirts back up into the esophagus). ""Slouching puts pressure on the abdomen, which can force stomach acid in the wrong direction,"" explains Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""And some evidence suggests that transit in the intestines slows down when you slouch. In my opinion, it probably does play a small role.""
        What you can do
        Markowski recommends seeing a physical therapist if you suspect you have poor posture that is causing problems for you. The therapist will customize a program of exercises and stretches to improve your core muscle strength and flexibility. The core muscles (in the abdomen, pelvic floor, and back) support the spine.
        The goal is a neutral, upright spine position — not flexed too far forward or backward.
        A neutral spine is also important when it's time to move your bowels. ""Keep your back straight and lean forward at the hips. Keeping your knees higher than your hips — by placing your feet on a footstool — mimics a squatting position, which is best for helping to open the anus so you can pass feces without straining,"" Markowski says.
        To reduce the risk of stress incontinence leakage, Markowski recommends strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. ""We teach people how to control their pelvic muscles when they cough,"" she says. ""The proper neutral spine alignment will also help minimize abdominal pressure.""

        Some general posture pointers
        To attain the neutral spine position, Markowski advises you to put your shoulders down and back, pull your head back, and engage your core muscles. ""Bring your belly button in toward your spine, as if you're zipping up a snug pair of jeans. This will help to engage the transverse abdominis muscle, which acts like a corset around the spine,"" Markowski explains.
        Other tips: Use a low back (lumbar) support pillow to remind you to sit upright in a chair, and change your position every 30 to 60 minutes. ""We don't want people in fixed postures for hours at a time,"" Markowski says. ""Be vigilant, and good posture will contribute to many aspects of health.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what-to-eat-when-you-have-chronic-heartburn,What to eat when you have chronic heartburn,"Avoid spicy foods, and keep some dazzle in your diet with low-fat sauces and fresh herbs.
        
        
          
        
        The fiery feeling of heartburn is the last way you want to remember a great meal. But when your doctor says you have chronic heartburn caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (see ""What is GERD?""), you may worry that a bland and disappointing menu is in your future. But the foods that trigger your heartburn may or may not be on the usual lists. That's why keeping a journal to determine which foods cause symptoms helps.
        Common culprits
        Some foods and ingredients may intensify heartburn, such as spicy foods, citrus, tomato sauces, and vinegar.
        Fatty and fried foods linger longer in the stomach, making it more likely that stomach acid leaks back up into the esophagus.
        Other common heartburn triggers include chocolate, caffeine, onions, peppermint, carbonated drinks, and alcohol.
        What's for dinner?
        You can still enjoy lean meats, fish, poultry, vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains. The trick is making them flavorful. If spices bother you, try using only small amounts, and be mindful of blends that contain cayenne or chili powder. Or use fresh herbs instead. Fresh herbs are less concentrated and may be less irritating. Instead use fresh parsley, oregano, and basil.
        Another tip: roast your food. This makes vegetables sweeter. The natural sugars come out and caramelize. Carrots, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, squash, and Brussels sprouts work well. Broiling, saut'ing, or grilling food also brings out intense flavor.
        Eat vegetables raw. Tomato sauce may bother you, but a fresh tomato may not.
        Use sauces but cut the fat. Blend low-fat yogurt with cucumber and basil, or saut' mushrooms in a little olive oil. Or make a pesto. Blend basil, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and a dash of olive oil or water. Use a tablespoon of it on food.
        Breakfast and lunch
        Avoid fatty meats like ham or bacon. Oatmeal is a great option. Throw in bananas, raisins, and maybe a hint of cinnamon. Other possibilities: low-fat yogurt with fruit or nuts, any kind of eggs, whole-grain toast, or a side of chilled whole grains like quinoa mixed with fruit or topped with a dollop of yogurt.
        For lunch, think salads with protein such as chicken or beans. But maybe use a yogurt-based dressing, to avoid vinegar and citrus.
        
          
            
              
                What is GERD?
                One of the most common causes of heartburn is called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, the tube connecting the mouth and stomach, usually because the ring-like muscles that prevent backflow stop working properly. In addition to heartburn, GERD may cause nausea, a sour taste in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, a sore throat, coughing, and tightness in the chest.
                Medications to treat GERD reduce stomach acid. Antacid pills and liquids have been around the longest. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole (Prilosec) or lansoprazole (Prevacid), and H2 blockers, such as cimetidine (Tagamet) or famotidine (Pepcid), are available over the counter.
                Don't fool yourself into thinking medication allows you to frequently eat foods that once caused heartburn. If medication controls your symptoms, then it's probably okay to have a 'trigger' food occasionally. But if you do that too often, the heartburn will return. You can limit and perhaps avoid medication to control GERD symptoms by losing weight if necessary, eating smaller meals and avoiding food triggers (see accompanying article).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heartburn-vs-heart-attack,Heartburn vs. heart attack,"The symptoms of these two health problems may overlap — and sometimes, so do the treatments.
        
        During your regular after-dinner walk around the neighborhood, you feel a painful sensation in the center of your chest. Could it be your heartburn flaring up again, or something more serious?
        Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), often called acid reflux. Acid from the stomach bubbles up into the esophagus, causing a painful burning just behind the breastbone. Not surprisingly, it's often mistaken for a heart attack. In fact, of the over eight million emergency room visits for chest pain each year, severe heartburn accounts for over half the cases in which actual heart problems are ruled out.
        Chest pain caused by insufficient blood flow to the heart (angina) or a heart attack is often described as a feeling of tightness, constriction, or pressure, rather than a burning sensation (see ""Heartburn or heart attack?""). But it's not always easy to tell the difference. ""Chest discomfort brought on by exercise is more likely to be a heart-related problem,"" says Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, cardiovascular specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. But you can also have angina that's not related to physical activity, she notes. If you have any symptoms you're not sure about, see a doctor. And call 911 if you feel chest tightness, have trouble breathing, break into a sweat, turn pale, or become very weak.
        GERD and heart disease are both common, and many people take medications to prevent or treat both conditions.
        
          
            
              
                Heartburn or heart attack?
                The symptoms of heartburn may mimic those of angina or a heart attack (or vice versa). If you're uncertain, don't hesitate to get to an emergency room for an evaluation as soon as possible.

        Avoiding clots
        Many people take daily, low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks, which works by discouraging the formation of blood clots. Doctors prescribe clopidogrel (a more potent clot-preventing drug) with aspirin, mainly for people who receive stents, the tiny metal mesh tubes placed in clogged blood vessels to improve blood flow. But there's a downside. ""Aspirin can increase the risk of bleeding from the stomach and the intestines, both by directly irritating the stomach lining and by making existing areas of irritation more prone to bleeding,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. Taking clopidogrel with aspirin can further increase that risk.
        Preventing bleeding
        People with heartburn often take proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). They include over-the-counter drugs such as omeprazole (Prilosec) and prescription drugs such as pantoprazole (Protonix). These drugs reduce the release of acid from the stomach lining. In addition to causing heartburn, excess stomach acid can also cause bleeding sores (ulcers) in the stomach; these, too, are treated with PPIs, among other drugs.
        Thanks to these stomach-protecting effects, doctors sometimes prescribe PPIs for people who take drugs that increase the risk of bleeding — even if they don't have heartburn.
        ""I usually recommend PPIs for people who are taking long-term aspirin or clopidogrel if they have ever had a bleeding stomach ulcer or are at high risk of developing one,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. Factors that can boost your odds include an infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria and routine use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Motrin, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox, others).
        Clopidogrel concern?
        Some research suggests a possible problem with taking both a PPI and clopidogrel. Two popular PPIs, omeprazole and esomeprazole (Nexium), inhibit a liver enzyme that helps convert clopidogrel to its active form. In theory, this could make clopidogrel less effective for heart attacks and stroke prevention. But large clinical studies have not revealed any meaningful differences. Still, anyone with lingering concerns about a possible interaction could take a different PPI, such as pantoprazole, which does not affect the liver enzyme.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/natural-ways-to-relieve-constipation,Natural ways to relieve constipation,"A few at-home tips can help you avoid the need for harsh laxatives.
        
        We often make light of constipation, but it's no laughing matter. When you can't go to the bathroom for days on end, you feel bloated and miserable. Straining day after day can also lead to more serious problems, like hemorrhoids or even prolapse (bulging) of rectal tissue.
        An estimated 40% to 60% of older adults regularly deal with constipation, although the aging process itself is not to blame. It's what goes along with aging. It's things like less physical activity, which helps the bowels move more regularly. It's the medications many older adults take.
        Constipation causes
        One of the biggest factors in constipation is diet. Eating high-fiber foods, such as raw fruits and vegetables and whole grains, helps to keep you regular. Drinking enough fluid is essential too. The fiber holds the water in the bowel so it can mix with the stool and make it softer.
        If you're getting plenty of fiber and fluids and you're still not regular, one of these constipation causes may be to blame:
        
          medicines such as narcotic pain relievers, antidepressants, aluminum-containing antacids, blood pressure medications, drugs for Parkinson's disease, and iron supplements
          lack of exercise
          regularly ignoring the urge to have a bowel movement
          diseases such as diabetes or an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism).
        
        Getting going again
        Laxatives may seem like the quickest and simplest solution, but they're not a good idea If people go right to stimulant laxatives, there is a risk that they'll become physically dependent on them.
        Before taking any laxative, try these diet and lifestyle tips for managing constipation:
        
          Stay hydrated. Drink at least four to six glasses of fluids a day. Water and fruit juices are best for preventing constipation. Limit caffeinated beverages such as soda and coffee, which can actually leach more fluid from your body.
          Bulk up on fiber. Try to get at least 25 grams of fiber daily from your diet. Good food sources include Brussels sprouts, apples, figs, bran cereal, and black beans.
          Get on a daily schedule. The longer stool sits in your intestines, the harder it becomes, and the more difficult it is to push out. That's why having a regular bowel habit is important. Because the emptying reflex works best after a meal, a useful habit is to head to the bathroom after breakfast and see if you get the urge.
          Try not to strain. It could lead to hemorrhoids, anal fissures (tears in the skin around the anus), or rectal prolapse (when part of the intestinal lining pushes out through the anal opening). Add more fiber and fluid to your diet or try a stool softener to make bowel movements easier.
        
        If you simply can't go and you want to try a laxative, start with the osmotic type (such as MiraLAX or Geri Care). The osmotic laxatives are reasonably safe. They work gently by pulling water into your intestines, making the stool softer and easier to pass.
        If you've tried everything and you still aren't regular, see your doctor, who can evaluate you for a medical problem. Call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of a bowel obstruction, which can include abdominal pain, vomiting, a swollen belly, or the complete inability to have a bowel movement.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/what-to-do-about-gallstones,What to do about gallstones,"Gallstones are one of the most common digestive problems treated in women.
        
        More than 25 million people in the United States have gallstones, and 65% to 75% of them are women. Fortunately, for most people, gallstones are ""silent"" — they don't cause major symptoms. When they do act up, there are effective ways to address the problem.
        What are gallstones?
        Gallstones begin with bile, a substance that helps with the digestion of fats and the absorption of certain vitamins. Bile is made in the liver and carried to the gallbladder, a small, pear-shaped organ that concentrates and stores it. The fat in food triggers the release of a hormone that causes the gallbladder to contract and release bile into the intestine.
        Gallstones are solid lumps that develop when the stored bile crystallizes. Most are less than an inch in diameter, but they can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball. Most gallstones are composed mainly of cholesterol. The rest — known as pigment stones — are made of calcium salts and bilirubin, a breakdown product of red blood cells.
        Cholesterol stones form when liquid bile in the gallbladder contains more cholesterol than the bile salts can dissolve. Cholesterol stones may also develop if the gallbladder doesn't contract and empty as it should. Pigment stones are associated with certain medical conditions, including liver disease, some types of anemia, and infection of the bile ducts.
        
          
            
              
                
                  Gallstone trouble
                
                
                  
                
                Gallstones cause problems when they block any of the ducts carrying bile from the liver or gallbladder (or digestive enzymes from the pancreas) to the small intestine.
              
            
          
        
        Why are women at greater risk?
        It's the effect of female hormones. Estrogen increases cholesterol in the bile, and progesterone slows the emptying of the gallbladder. That may explain why the risk for women, relative to men, decreases with age. Before age 40, women are diagnosed with gallstones almost three times more often than men are (pregnancy, for example, increases the risk), but by age 60, their risk is just slightly greater. Estrogen therapy increases the risk, especially when taken as a pill rather than a patch. Oral contraceptive pills also increase the risk slightly, but only in the first decade of use.
        Obesity is another risk factor because bodies with more fat produce more estrogen. Paradoxically, rapid weight loss also increases the risk, because very low-calorie diets interfere with bile production and therefore cause more crystallization of cholesterol. Gallstones are so common after weight-loss surgery that patients may be advised to have their gallbladders removed at the same time. Gallstones are also more likely to occur in people with diabetes or any condition that decreases gallbladder contractions or intestinal motility, such as a spinal cord injury. Finally, there's some evidence for genetic vulnerability to gallstone formation.
        What are the symptoms?
        Most people who have gallstones don't know it. Their gallstones stay silent and may only be discovered incidentally, through an ultrasound or CT scan performed for other reasons. Symptoms arise mainly when stones pass through a bile duct or obstruct it, causing biliary colic — better known as a gallbladder attack. These attacks occur when the gallbladder contracts (usually in response to a fatty meal) and presses the stones so as to block the gallbladder duct. The main symptom is pain, usually in the right upper or middle abdomen (just below the rib cage), which builds to greatest intensity within an hour and can persist up to several hours. It can be either sharp and knifelike or a deep ache; sometimes it radiates to the back or the right shoulder. There may also be nausea and vomiting. The pain subsides as the gallbladder relaxes.
        A stone lodged in a duct can also cause more serious problems, including acute cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), or cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts in the liver). Any of these conditions can cause severe pain and other symptoms, including jaundice, high fever, chills, and vomiting. Treatment usually requires hospitalization and often surgical removal of the stone.
        If you think you're having a gallbladder attack, your clinician will probably order several blood tests and an abdominal ultrasound (after you fast for at least eight hours). Ultrasound is particularly helpful in diagnosing acute cholecystitis because it also picks up any thickening of the gallbladder wall and indicates the presence of fluid, which may suggest inflammation. Other diagnostic techniques include cholescintigraphy, a radioactive injection used to view a possible blockage of the cystic duct; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the bile ducts; endoscopic ultrasonography, which introduces an ultrasound device through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine) to get images of the area; and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which uses a scope inserted through the mouth to the duodenum to view the biliary ducts.
        How are gallstones treated?
        Typically, gallstones are treated only if they cause symptoms. For recurrent gallbladder attacks, the most effective treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder, or cholecystectomy. In the past, the standard procedure was surgery requiring a five-inch incision and a hospital stay of up to a week. This approach has largely been replaced by laparoscopic cholecystectomy, in which the gallbladder is removed with instruments inserted through small incisions in the skin. This procedure requires only an overnight hospital stay and a week of recovery at home. However, there's a slight risk of injuring the bile ducts, and in a small percent of cases, the surgeon may have to switch to an open surgery with a larger incision because of complications.
        You can easily live without a gallbladder. The liver produces enough bile for normal digestion. When the gallbladder is removed, bile simply flows directly into the small intestine through the common bile duct. When no food is present, loose stools may result, but you can treat that with a bile acid–binding medication, such as cholestyramine (Questran).
        Medical options
        If you can't or don't want to undergo surgery and your gallstones are small, one option is to take ursodiol (Actigall, Urso), a naturally occurring bile acid that helps dissolve cholesterol stones when taken by mouth two to four times a day. It's also used to prevent the formation of gallstones in people who are losing weight quickly. Ursodiol dissolves only those gallstones made of cholesterol, and it may take several months before it has an effect.
        Drug therapy is occasionally combined with lithotripsy, in which sound waves from outside the body are used to break gallstones into pieces that dissolve more easily or are small enough to safely pass through the bile duct. Unfortunately, stones are likely to recur after medical treatment.
        How can I reduce my risk for gallstones?
        There's no proven way to prevent gallstones, but eating a well-balanced diet, maintaining a normal weight, and exercising regularly (at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week). Avoiding fatty foods won't prevent or get rid of gallstones, but it may reduce the frequency of attacks.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/healthy-gut-healthy-heart,"Healthy gut, healthy heart?","The gut is known as the ""second brain,"" as it produces many of the same neurotransmitters, chemicals released by nerves needed for communication with other nerves and tissues. The gut and brain are also connected through a joint partnership called the gut-brain axis that links biochemical signals both to and from the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system.
        But what about the gut and the heart? Do they have a similar connection?
        Research suggests there might be a link, but that it travels in one direction — from the gut to the heart — and that keeping your gut healthy can be another means to protect against heart disease.
        The gut-heart connection
        The gut is the primary home to trillions of microbes, collectively known as the human microbiota. These microbes help with digestion, manufacture certain nutrients, and release substances that have wide-ranging health effects.
        ""There's a complex interplay between the microbes in our intestines and most of the systems in our bodies, including the vascular, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, all of which are linked with cardiovascular health,"" says Dr. Stanley Shaw, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Since diet plays a significant role in the composition of gut microbiota, what you feed your gut can therefore affect heart health — for better and for worse.
        One way the gut does this is with metabolites, substances the gut microbiota creates when breaking down food. One particular gut metabolite, trimethylamine (TMA), forms when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a substance strongly connected with forming artery-clogging plaque.
        Research has shown that people with high TMAO levels in their blood are more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those with lower levels. Since red meat is a main source of TMA, cutting back can stop the gut from making too much TMAO.
        In fact, a study in the September 2022 issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found that among nearly 4,000 people ages 65 and older, those who ate an average of 1.1 servings of red meat per day had a 22% higher risk of heart disease compared with those who ate less.
        The researchers pointed out that about 10% of this added risk could be attributed to increased levels of TMAO as well as two other metabolites — gamma-butyrobetaine and crotonobetaine — which also are made by gut bacteria from components in red meat.
        Fiber at work
        Fiber also helps support the gut and thus the heart. According to some estimates, fiber-rich diets can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as 30%. Fiber in the small intestine binds fat and cholesterol, decreasing absorption and lowering blood cholesterol levels.
        But the gut's microbiota also helps out. Fiber gets broken down by bacteria in the colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds interact with specific receptors on cells that regulate blood pressure, better control blood sugar and body weight in people with diabetes, and dampen inflammation — all of which can improve heart health.
        Other supporting foods
        It's unclear whether eating other foods that improve gut microbiota — for example, probiotics (beneficial bacteria) found in yogurt and fermented foods (sauerkraut, miso, tempeh) — can also support heart health.
        The best advice for helping your gut help your heart is to follow a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean diet or similar eating patterns. These involve limiting red meat and eating plenty of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, all of which can have favorable effects on the gut,"" says Dr. Shaw. ""And if your gut is healthy, there is a greater chance your heart is healthy, too.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/stomachs-growl-noses-run-and-yawning-is-contagious-ever-wonder-why-202307192955,"Stomachs growl, noses run, and yawning is contagious: Ever wonder why?","There are certain things our bodies do so often and so automatically that we barely notice them. Yawning, growling stomachs, and runny noses are good examples. Each is a universal part of our daily human experience.
        But did you ever wonder why? Below are a few things we know and a few we suspect.
        Why do you yawn?
        Perhaps you associate yawning only with being tired or bored. While we don't know exactly why people yawn, there's no shortage of theories. Yawning may
        
          stretch out our lungs and nearby tissues, preventing tiny airways in the lungs from collapsing
          distribute a chemical called surfactant, a gooey liquid that coats the tiny air pockets in the lungs and helps keep them open
          help prepare our bodies for transitions between wakefulness and rest: For example, yawning often occurs after a period of relaxation and when awakening from sleep. And it may serve as an internal signal that it's time to sleep, or time to take a break from activities (such as driving).
          play a role in maintaining proper brain temperature: Our brain functions best within a narrow range of temperatures. Some experts believe yawning can help cool the brain through complex effects on nearby circulation and the sinuses.
        
        It's also unclear why yawning is contagious. In the animal kingdom, it's common to see contagious yawning among members of a group, perhaps as a signal for collective behavior (such as moving from activity to rest).
        Why does your stomach growl?
        That rumbling in your stomach is known medically as borborygmi — an excellent Scrabble word if you have the right letters. We usually assume it reflects hunger. And it's true that the experience of hunger can make itself heard in anticipation of a meal.
        But your stomach may also growl after a meal, when the stomach and intestines propel liquids and food through the digestive tract. Stress can also trigger stomach rumbling.
        What's causing all that noise — and is it ever a problem? It may be due to gas moving around in response to muscular contractions of the intestinal walls. Occasionally, noises from the abdomen may be a sign of an intestinal infection or other trouble. If you're experiencing other symptoms, such as pain or fever, check in with your doctor. But the vast majority of noises are harmless and a sign that your gut is working normally.
        Why does your nose run?
        Sometimes it can seem like your nose is running for no reason. But there are some well-known triggers, such as:
        
          Infection. When you have a cold, mucous membranes produce more mucus as part of your defense system: more mucous flowing out means fewer germs getting in.
          Allergies. Pollen, ragweed, or other triggers stimulate immune cells that produce histamine. Histamine opens up blood vessels just beneath the mucous membranes, and that leads to increased production and release of fluid and mucus. As with infection, this response may be helpful to dilute the offending trigger and rid it from the area.
          Cold, dry air. The inside surface of the nose is covered with mucous membranes that warm and humidify air well before it reaches the lungs. When you inhale dry, cold air through your nose, these membranes humidify the air by secreting water and mucus.
          Spicy foods. Spices like capsaicin act as an irritant to the sinuses and mucous membranes, which release fluid in response.
        
        The bottom line
        Some of the most common everyday human experiences are also some of the least understood. There are many other examples, of course: Why are we ticklish? What purpose do hiccups serve? What's the deal with brain freeze? Perhaps topics for another day.
        It may seem like a leap of faith, but it's likely there are very good reasons for the way our bodies work — even when we don't know what those reasons are.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","July 19, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-irritable-bowel-syndrome-the-same,Are inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome the same?,"Ask the doctors
        
          Q.
          I was recently diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. Is this the same thing as inflammatory bowel disease?
        
        A. No, they are not the same. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to two conditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which are caused by a malfunctioning immune system. In these diseases, the immune system misfires, causing the lining of the digestive tract to become chronically inflamed and irritated. Both can lead to long-term digestive tract damage. In Crohn's disease, this inflammation can occur anywhere in the digestive tract, while colitis affects only the colon and the rectum. IBD triggers a number of symptoms, including abdominal pain and cramping, fevers, ­diarrhea, and bloody bowel movements, among others.
        While people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may experience some of the same symptoms as people with IBD, there is no obvious inflammation within the digestive tract. The underlying cause of IBS is unknown, but symptoms may arise due to uncoordinated intestinal contractions that affect bowel movements and hypersensitive nerves in the gut. People with IBS commonly have diarrhea, constipation, or both, as well as abdominal pain and cramping. While IBS can cause significant distress and discomfort for those affected, people don't typically experience severe complications as a result of the condition or need to have surgery. It's most often managed through lifestyle change or medication.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-gut-brain-connection,The gut-brain connection,"Pay attention to your gut-brain connection – it may contribute to your anxiety and digestion problems
        
          
        
        The gut-brain connection is no joke; it can link anxiety to stomach problems and vice versa. Have you ever had a ""gut-wrenching"" experience? Do certain situations make you ""feel nauseous""? Have you ever felt ""butterflies"" in your stomach? We use these expressions for a reason. The gastrointestinal tract is sensitive to emotion. Anger, anxiety, sadness, elation — all of these feelings (and others) can trigger symptoms in the gut.
        The brain has a direct effect on the stomach and intestines. For example, the very thought of eating can release the stomach's juices before food gets there. This connection goes both ways. A troubled intestine can send signals to the brain, just as a troubled brain can send signals to the gut. Therefore, a person's stomach or intestinal distress can be the cause or the product of anxiety, stress, or depression. That's because the brain and the gastrointestinal (GI) system are intimately connected.
        This is especially true in cases where a person experiences gastrointestinal upset with no obvious physical cause. For such functional GI disorders, it is difficult to try to heal a distressed gut without considering the role of stress and emotion.
        
          Gut health and anxiety
        
        Given how closely the gut and brain interact, it becomes easier to understand why you might feel nauseated before giving a presentation, or feel intestinal pain during times of stress. That doesn't mean, however, that functional gastrointestinal conditions are imagined or ""all in your head."" Psychology combines with physical factors to cause pain and other bowel symptoms. Psychosocial factors influence the actual physiology of the gut, as well as symptoms. In other words, stress (or depression or other psychological factors) can affect movement and contractions of the GI tract.
        In addition, many people with functional GI disorders perceive pain more acutely than other people do because their brains are more responsive to pain signals from the GI tract. Stress can make the existing pain seem even worse.
        Based on these observations, you might expect that at least some patients with functional GI conditions might improve with therapy to reduce stress or treat anxiety or depression. Multiple studies have found that psychologically based approaches lead to greater improvement in digestive symptoms compared with only conventional medical treatment.
        
          Gut-brain connection, anxiety and digestion  
        
        Are your stomach or intestinal problems — such as heartburn, abdominal cramps, or loose stools — related to stress? Watch for these and other common symptoms of stress and discuss them with your doctor. Together you can come up with strategies to help you deal with the stressors in your life, and also ease your digestive discomforts.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/dont-take-back-pain-sitting-down,Don't take back pain sitting down,"Sitting down is supposed to be a way to relax after a long day on your feet. But for many people, sitting for any length of time is painful. It aggravates pain in the back instead of relieving it.
        What causes lower back pain when sitting?
        Although the specific reason for back pain often cannot be identified, muscle spasms are probably the most common cause. While there isn't proof from medical studies that sitting leads to more spasms, people often report tighter and more painful back muscles with prolonged sitting.
        A long car ride is a typical example. Sometimes people attribute the pain to the jarring and bouncing around that occurs on the road, but often it's just pressure from sitting that triggers the problem.
        If you experience lower back pain when sitting, the problem could be one of several common conditions, says Dr. Steven J. Atlas, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        Herniated discs
        Herniated discs refers to a problem with one of the discs that act as pads between the vertebrae in your back. In particular, a disc can become herniated, meaning it develops a bulge that can pinch a nearby spinal nerve, causing pain.
        ""There have been some studies that measured the amount of pressure on the discs,"" says Dr. Atlas. ""Not surprisingly, the pressure is lowest when you're lying down."" But there is more pressure on the discs when you're sitting than when you're standing.
        ""In fact, if I come into the exam room and a patient is standing, rather than sitting, my suspicion that the person has a disc herniation goes up a lot,"" he says.
        Sciatica
        Disc problems can cause back pain alone, but when the pain moves into the legs, this may be the nerve pain known as sciatica. Sciatica sometimes occurs when a herniated disc pinches one of your sciatic nerves. These are the longest nerves in your body, running from the lower back into each leg.
        People with sciatica typically report a burning pain that involves the lower back, the leg, and sometimes the foot.
        When lower back pain is eased by sitting
        There is one common condition in older women that is eased by sitting. This is a type of arthritis of the lower back called spinal stenosis.
        ""In cases where the arthritis is severe enough to pinch nerves going to the buttocks and legs, people often report that the pain is better when sitting than standing. This is because when you sit, you bend forward a little bit at the lower back, and this may spread out the arthritic bones enough to relieve the pain temporarily,"" says Dr. Atlas. Pain relief may also occur when you lean forward while using a shopping cart or a walker.
        
          
            
              
                When to see a doctor
                In most cases, you should be able to manage back pain by yourself. Modify your activity and slowly work toward regaining function, says Dr. Steven J. Atlas, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
                However, you should see a doctor if the pain isn't improving after you've modified your activity for a few weeks. (It can take up to four to six weeks to see improvement in sciatica from a herniated disc.)
                You should see a doctor right away if your pain is extremely severe, if it gets better but comes back, or if it occurs after an injury — such as falling down a flight of stairs, being in a car accident, or slipping on a patch of ice. That's different from back pain that begins during the course of regular movements, says Dr. Atlas. In other words, if your back starts to hurt when you lean over to tie your shoe, that's not an injury.
              
            
          
        
        How to relieve the pain
        If you're experiencing back pain when sitting, your impulse may be to lie down and then try to slowly progress back to sitting, says Dr. Atlas. But this is the wrong approach. You should lie down to relieve the pain, but the goal should be not to return to sitting, but rather to regain your ability to stand and move.
        ""The goal isn't to get into the chair. The goal is to start moving. Walking is better than sitting,"" he says. Movement is often the best medicine when it comes to relieving pain.
        Treating back pain
        If you can't manage your back pain yourself and opt to see a doctor, it's likely she or he will order treatments that follow a course similar to what you can do at home.
        ""There has been a shift away from medical intervention for back pain and an increased emphasis on treatments that don't focus on medication,"" says Dr. Atlas. ""There is also an increased appreciation that even medicines such as acetaminophen have risks, particularly in older adults.""
        A typical course of treatment starts with activity modification, progressing to exercise. ""For patients with severe symptoms, the first line of therapy might be manual treatment, such as massage, chiropractic, or physical therapy,"" says Dr. Atlas.
        Preventing problems
        Movement is the best way to ward off back pain. Regular physical activity can make the back stronger to reduce future episodes of pain. Exercises should focus on increasing strength and improving range of motion — as well as ensuring balance on both sides of the body, as some back pain can start when one side of the body is stronger than the other.
        In addition, whenever possible, avoid prolonged sitting. If you sit at a desk in the office all day, get up periodically — at least every 30 minutes — and walk around. Walk to get a drink of water or to pick up your mail. Take breaks throughout the course of the day to prevent future bouts of pain.
        Simple exercises for a healthy back
        Some simple exercises (done with the approval of your doctor) can help keep back pain at bay. These exercises build not only strength, but also flexibility.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-gut-healthier-aging,"Healthy gut, healthier aging","Support beneficial microbes in the gastrointestinal tract with these healthy lifestyle habits.
        
        
          
        
        Trillions of microbes — bacteria, viruses, fungi — call your gut home. They do more than just help you digest food. They fight harmful pathogens; make vitamin K and other important chemicals; affect the way medications work; and may influence your immune system, heart health, and cancer risk. It also appears gut microbes may play a role in healthy aging and longevity. The genes of all your gut microbes are collectively called the gut microbiome.
        Encouraging findings
        In a study published online Feb. 18, 2021, by Nature Metabolism, scientists observed that older adults whose mix of gut microbes changed the most over time lived longer than those people with less change in their gut microbiome.
        The study didn't prove that an eclectic microbiome directly caused people to live longer. However, such a microbiome was also associated with lower cholesterol levels, faster walking speeds, and higher levels of beneficial blood chemicals — all factors that lengthen the life span.
        How do you make your gut microbiome more diverse and achieve health benefits? It mainly comes down to lifestyle factors. Indeed, one of the reasons that a healthy lifestyle may protect your health is through the impact of your lifestyle on your microbiome.
        Eat a healthy diet
        Eating the right foods is one of the best ways. Your gut microbes like to eat, too, and their favorite foods are the ones that are healthiest for us: fruits, vegetables (especially dark, leafy greens), legumes (beans, peas), and whole grains (quinoa, whole wheat, brown rice). ""Those foods contain fiber. Our bodies don't break down fiber for food; fiber passes through to the gut and microbes feed on it. It gives them a good environment to grow,"" explains April Pawluk, strategic program manager at the Harvard Chan Microbiome in Public Health Center.
        But when you eat an unhealthy diet with lots of processed, fatty, sugary foods, it makes it harder for helpful microbes to survive. ""In the absence of diversity-promoting nutrients like fiber in our diets, the genes of our gut microbiome can produce chemicals that could increase our risk for developing different diseases,"" Pawluk says.
        Exercise
        Exercising appears to promote gut microbiome diversity, but the way it works is a matter of speculation, ­Pawluk says. Several ways are plausible. ""It could be that exercise changes the rate at which material moves through the intestines. Or perhaps exercise reduces inflammation in the gut. Or exercise might alter our appetite, and alter the way that our bodies process the food we eat. All of these could affect the microbiome environment,"" Pawluk says.
        Get a dog
        Dogs are always tracking things in from outside — like dirt, grass, and insects — exposing their human families to more microbes. That might help counteract the effect of a modern world on the microbiome.
        ""Over the past century, there's been a decrease in the diversity of the human microbiome, possibly because of sanitation and modern medicine,"" Pawluk says. ""Studies looking at young children growing up in a house with a pet show their microbiome becomes more diverse and they have less risk of allergies. We don't know if this helps older adults, but it wouldn't hurt.""
        Don't smoke
        Cigarettes contain lots of chemicals and toxins that are harmful to the whole body, including your gut and its residents. ""Smoking can kill some microbes and decrease microbe diversity. Smoking also puts physical stress on the body, including microbes. And when microbes are under stress, they change their function; they sense that they're in a bad situation and in some cases attack each other — or us. That can cause imbalance in the gut microbiome,"" Pawluk says.
        Consider probiotics
        One last suggestion that may affect the gut microbiome is to ingest colonies of ""good"" bacteria known as probiotics, which come in pills or powders or occur naturally in fermented foods (such as yogurt, kefir, and sauerkraut). ""The intention is to boost the amount of beneficial bacteria in the gut,"" Pawluk says. ""If you've recently taken antibiotics, which kill both harmful and beneficial bacteria, probiotics may help re-establish a diverse microbiome. The thing is, if you already have a diverse gut microbiome, adding more of one species probably isn't going to promote any significant change.""
        But Pawluk says there's no evidence probiotics are harmful, especially when they come from food. And there are many reasons why you might want to eat healthy probiotic-rich foods like yogurt, which has lots of calcium, or try any of the lifestyle habits we've laid out here. They all benefit health in numerous ways.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/want-probiotics-but-dislike-yogurt-try-these-foods-202107142918,Want probiotics but dislike yogurt? Try these foods,"The top item on my grocery list is always yogurt: unsweetened, organic, made with almond milk. I'm always afraid I'll run out since I use it all the time. I put two tablespoons in every smoothie, switch it out for mayo, and nothing beats a cool cup on a hot day as an afternoon snack.
        Besides healthy doses of calcium and protein, yogurt is a prime source for probiotics, the ""good"" live bacteria and yeasts. Why are these helpful? Having a proper balance of bacteria in your gut improves digestion, blocks dangerous organisms that can cause infections, and boosts your immune system. It also helps your body absorb vital nutrients from food.
        What to know about probiotics
        Unlike vitamins, there is no recommended daily intake for probiotics, so there is no way to know which type of bacteria or quantities are best. The general guideline is to add some foods with probiotics to your daily diet.
        Hundreds of ingestible bacteria are classified as probiotics. The two found in most probiotic foods are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, each of which contains various strains. On food labels, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are often abbreviated as L. or B. and then combined with name of a specific strain. So, the strain acidophilus within the Lactobacillus bacteria is written as L. acidophilus.
        Probiotics in yogurt
        This brings us back to yogurt, which often contains L. acidophilus.
        Yogurt is a popular probiotic food because it's widely available, and there are different ways to consume it. Some brands include a Live & Active Cultures (LAC) seal from the International Dairy Foods Association to verify probiotic content. Otherwise, look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label. (Also, many fruit or sweetened varieties have too much sugar, so check labels for that, too.)
        Looking beyond yogurt for probiotics
        What if you are not a yogurt enthusiast, or simply want more options? Luckily, many other foods also serve up a good dose of good bacteria. They come in various flavors and textures, so odds are you will find a few to your liking.
        Kefir. This yogurtlike drink has a tart flavor, with a thinner consistency than yogurt. The beverage is usually made with dairy milk, but also comes in non-dairy alternatives, like coconut water, coconut milk, and rice milk. Kefir also comes in fruit and vegetable flavors, or you can add flavors yourself like cinnamon, vanilla, and pumpkin spice. It is also an excellent base for smoothies.
        Kimchi. Kimchi is a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish made with a mix of garlic, salt, vinegar, and chili peppers. It's often served alone or mixed with rice or noodles. You can also add it to scrambled eggs or on top of potatoes. You can find it at most grocery stores or Asian markets.
        Kombucha. This fermented tea drink has a tangy-tart flavor. Kombucha contains caffeine comparable to some other tea drinks. Some brands have added sugar, so check the label and avoid anything with more than 5 grams of sugar per serving.
        Miso. A popular paste in Japanese cuisine, miso is made from soybeans fermented with brown rice. It has a strong, salty flavor, and a little goes a long way. Use it as a dipping sauce, spread over your toast, or add it to marinades for fish, meats, and vegetables.
        Pickles. Not every type of pickle will do. Look for brands brined in water and sea salt instead of vinegar.
        Sauerkraut. Sauerkraut is pickled cabbage and may be an acquired taste. (I am a fan thanks to my German-born grandmother, who made me Reuben sandwiches as a kid.) Use it as a hot dog topper, mix it into salads, or combine it with your regular side vegetables. Always choose raw or non-pasteurized sauerkraut. It contains more probiotics than commercial sauerkraut, which loses much of its bacteria from pasteurization.
        Tempeh. Tempeh is a cake made from fermented soybeans, with a firmer texture than tofu. It is a popular meat substitute — try it as a veggie burger patty, or add to pasta sauce. Tempeh often comes precooked and ready to eat, but some brands may need cooking.",Matthew Solan,"July 18, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/common-causes-of-constipation,Common causes of constipation,"Many factors can dispose a person to constipation. Some can easily be prevented by changing habits and lifestyle, but often the reason(s) are not so obvious.
        Following are the more common causes of constipation:
        Lack of exercise. People who exercise regularly generally don't develop constipation. Basically, the colon responds to activity. Good muscle tone in general is important for regular bowel movements. The abdominal wall muscles and the diaphragm all play a crucial role in the process of defecation. If these muscles are weak, they're not going to be able to do the job as well. But exercise is not a cure-all. Increasing exercise to improve constipation may be more effective in older people, who tend to be more sedentary, than in younger people.
        Opioids. The digestive tract has receptors for opioids, and constipation can occur (or worsen) when people take opioid pain medications. Opioid-induced constipation occurs in roughly 90% of cancer patients taking opioids for pain and 40% of people taking opioids for chronic noncancer pain.
        Other medications. Constipation is a side effect of many prescription and over-the-counter drugs. These include antacids that contain aluminum, antispasmodics, antidepressants, tranquilizers and sedatives, bismuth salts, iron supplements, diuretics, anticholinergics, calcium-channel blockers, and anticonvulsants.
        Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some people who suffer from IBS have sluggish bowel movements, straining during bowel movements, and abdominal discomfort. Constipation may be the predominant symptom, or it may alternate with diarrhea. Cramping, gas, and bloating are also common.
        Over use of laxatives. Laxatives are sometimes used inappropriately, for example, by people suffering from anorexia nervosa or bulimia. But for people with long-term constipation, the extended use of laxatives may be a reasonable solution. In the past, long-term use of some laxatives was thought to damage nerve cells in the colon and interfere with the colon's innate ability to contract. However, newer formulations of laxatives have made this outcome less common.
        Changes in life or routine. Traveling can give some people problems because it disrupts normal diet and daily routines. Aging often affects regularity by reducing intestinal activity and muscle tone. Pregnancy may cause women to become constipated because of hormonal changes or because the enlarged uterus pushes on the intestine.
        Ignoring the urge. If you have to go, go. If you hold in a bowel movement, for whatever reason, you may be inviting a bout of constipation. People who repeatedly ignore the urge to move their bowels may eventually stop feeling the urge.
        Not enough fiber and fluids in the diet. A diet too low in fiber and fluids and too high in fats can con-tribute to constipation. Fiber absorbs water and causes stools to be larger, softer, and easier to pass. Increasing fiber intake helps cure constipation in many people, but those with more severe constipation sometimes find that increasing fiber makes their constipation worse and leads to gassiness and discomfort.
        Other causes. Diseases that can cause constipation include neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, or multiple sclerosis; metabolic and endocrine disorders, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease; bowel cancer; and diverticulitis. A number of systemic conditions, like scleroderma, can also cause constipation. In addition, intestinal obstructions, caused by scar tissue (adhesions) from past surgery or strictures of the colon or rectum, can compress, squeeze, or narrow the intestine and rectum, causing constipation.

          Q.
          My partner just got diagnosed with a hiatal hernia. What is it, and is it dangerous?
        
        A. Hiatal hernias are very common. They occur when part of the stomach pokes through a natural gap (called a hiatus) in the diaphragm, which is a muscle separating your chest from your abdomen. Normally the esophagus connects with the stomach through this hole, but in some cases, the upper part of the stomach slides upward through the hiatus. The most common cause is weakened musculature that surrounds the hiatus, which can be aggravated by straining during bowel movements, intense coughing, pregnancy, or heavy exertion.
        While many people who have a hiatal hernia have no symptoms, acid reflux is common. The hernia can change the position and function of the lower esophageal sphincter — a circular muscle at the base of the esophagus that normally keeps acid inside the stomach. The sphincter does not always close when it should, allowing irritating stomach acid to escape into the esophagus, which can cause heartburn.
        The good news is that most people with a hiatal hernia don't need treatment, and fewer than 5% of people with a hiatal hernia need surgery to fix the problem. If you are experiencing acid reflux symptoms, such as heartburn, it may be helpful to eat smaller meals and avoid eating within two hours of bedtime at night. If your doctor thinks it's necessary, you may also want to take an antacid.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/the-impact-of-stress-on-your-gut,The impact of stress on your gut,"Given how closely the gut and brain interact, it might seem obvious that the pair often influence each other. Some people feel nauseated before giving a presentation; others feel intestinal pain during times of stress. In any case, emotional and psychosocial factors play a role in functional gastrointestinal disorders.
        Treating the whole body
        Stress-related symptoms felt in the gastrointestinal tract vary greatly from one person to the next, and treatment can vary as well. For example, one person with gastroesophageal reflux disease might have an occasional, mild burning sensation in the chest, while another experiences excruciating discomfort night after night. As the severity of symptoms varies, so should the therapies, medications, self-help strategies, or even surgeries used to relieve them.
        Many people have mild symptoms that respond quickly to changes in diet or medications. If your symptoms do not improve, your clinician may ask you more questions about your medical history and perform some diagnostic tests to rule out an underlying cause. For some people, symptoms improve as soon as a serious diagnosis, like cancer, has been ruled out. Your doctor may also recommend symptom-specific medications.
        But sometimes these treatments are not enough. If symptoms persist, it's common to experience psychological distress.
        Some people are reluctant to accept the role of psycho-social factors in their illness. But it's important to know that emotions cause genuine chemical and physical responses in the body that can result in pain and discomfort.
        Cognitive behavioral therapy and stress reduction techniques such as meditation and relaxation therapies can help manage pain and improve other symptoms in ways that are different from how drugs act. The goal of all therapies is to reduce anxiety, encourage healthy behaviors, and help people cope with the pain and discomfort of their condition.

          Q.
          I'm trying to add more probiotics into my diet. Is cheese a good source?
        
        A. Probiotics, good bacteria that can contribute to gut and overall health, can be found in some types of cheese as well as in dietary supplements, fermented foods, and yogurt. Typically, probiotics are in cheeses that have been aged but not heated afterward. This includes both soft and hard cheeses, including Swiss, provolone, Gouda, cheddar, Edam, Gruyère, and cottage cheese.
        Adding probiotics to your diet can potentially improve your health by helping to foster the growth of good bacteria inside your gut. Your gut contains some 100 trillion bacteria, but in some cases, the balance between the helpful and harmful bacteria falls out of balance. When this occurs, experts believe it may be linked to a host of conditions, such as allergies, mood disorders, and arthritis. Eating foods that contain probiotics, such as cheese, can help restore this natural balance. The only caution when it comes to cheese is to not overdo it. Cheese tends to be high in calories, saturated fat, and sodium.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/looking-out-for-diverticulitis-202108162572,Looking out for diverticulitis,"Most people don't have much in common with Pope Francis. But about 200,000 Americans each year can say they share an experience with the head of the Catholic Church: they had surgery for diverticulitis.
        Although Pope Francis recovered well from his procedure in July, it shed light on this potentially serious condition of the colon. If you have questions about why diverticulitis occurs, the most common signs of this condition, and how it is treated, read on.
        What is diverticulitis?
        Diverticulitis arises from a condition called diverticulosis, which occurs when weak areas in the inner wall of the colon bulge outward and form tiny pouches. Many people get diverticulosis as they age. In fact, diverticulosis affects about 58% of US adults over age 60. Getting enough fiber in your diet can help protect against diverticulosis.
        Most people are unaware they even have this condition. Often the diagnosis of diverticulosis is first mentioned in a report when a person has a colonoscopy or had an abdominal CT scan for another reason. Diverticulosis doesn't cause symptoms, but people who have irritable bowel syndrome or who are prone to constipation, bloating, and abdominal discomfort after eating are more likely to have it.
        ""While diverticulosis is very common, only a small percentage of people who have it will ever develop diverticulitis caused by inflammation or infection of one of the pouches,"" says Dr. Matthew Hamilton, a gastroenterologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Know the signs of diverticulitis
        The most common symptoms of diverticulitis are abdominal pain (usually on the lower left side) and fever. The pain is distinct and sharp, and may strike over a few hours. Other symptoms may include a combination of loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating and cramping, and not passing gas or stool.
        A mild case of diverticulitis that causes only minimal pain in the lower abdomen can resolve on its own within a day or two. However, you should seek immediate medical attention if your symptoms are not going away or you are feeling worse, such as having increasing pain, fever, bloody stools, or abdominal bloating with vomiting.
        Treatment depends on whether you have uncomplicated or complicated diverticulitis. Your doctor can determine this by using a combination of blood tests and imaging studies, such as a CT scan.
        How is uncomplicated diverticulitis treated?
        As the name implies, uncomplicated diverticulitis is the less serious of the two. It means that the inflammation or infection is confined to one section of the colon, and that there is no evidence of complicating factors.
        Uncomplicated diverticulitis is typically treated at home with oral antibiotics. You'll also be prescribed ""bowel rest"" for a few days, which often includes a clear liquid diet. This gives your bowel a chance to rest and heal, and may reduce pain. Additionally, you'll follow a low-fiber diet (about 10 to 15 grams of fiber a day) until your symptoms improve.
        Some people may need to be hospitalized to receive intravenous (IV) antibiotics. A hospital stay is more likely if you're 65 or older or have other medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
        People usually begin to feel improvement from treatment after about three days. If you feel well enough and the symptoms have subsided, you can gradually resume your regular diet.
        If symptoms haven't responded to antibiotics after a week, you probably will undergo CT scans and other tests to see if you have complicated diverticulitis.
        How is complicated diverticulitis treated?
        Complicated diverticulitis means you have a specific complication that requires a longer course of IV antibiotics, and possibly surgery.
        Pope Francis had scarring in a segment of colon where he previously had diverticulitis, which had caused a narrowing in the colon called stenosis. In a case like this, the unhealthy part of the colon is removed, and the remaining colon is then reconnected.
        Other types of complications that may occur during an active diverticulitis infection include:
        
          Abscess. A diverticular abscess is a collection of pus (a fluid that can form at the site of infection) outside of the intestinal wall. If the abscess doesn't get better with antibiotics, a doctor will need to drain the pus using a needle, under guidance through images on a CT scan.
          Perforation. Diverticulitis can cause a hole in the colon that allows bowel contents to spill into the abdominal cavity. If you have a perforation, your abdomen may feel tender to touch, hard, or enlarged. Surgery repairs the hole. Sometimes part of the colon around the hole must be removed.
          Fistula. A fistula is an abnormal connection between the inflamed and infected segment of the colon and adjacent organs, such as other parts of the intestine or the bladder. Surgery consists of colon resection and removing the fistula.
        
        Can diverticulitis be prevented?
        Eating a high-fiber diet and managing stress may lower the risk of developing pouches in the colon known as diverticula. So it makes sense that these lifestyle interventions might help make diverticulitis less likely to occur. However, once you have diverticulosis, there is no proven way to prevent one of the diverticula from becoming infected or inflamed.",Matthew Solan,"July 18, 2023",1

What does that mean?However, it's also possible that some older people and their families just don't recognize the resulting changes as being caused by a stroke. Sometimes, these strokes cause temporary balance problems or clumsiness in an arm or leg that people attribute to another cause. In addition, people can experience a series of silent strokes, which can manifest as memory lapses or subtle changes in mood. When people experience a number of silent strokes over time, it can lead to a condition called multi-infarct dementia.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/why-you-should-move-even-just-a-little-throughout-the-day,Why you should move — even just a little — throughout the day,"Sitting for long, uninterrupted periods of time may leave you more prone to cardiovascular problems.
        
        
          
        
        How much time do you spend sitting each day? If you're like most people, more than half of your waking hours are spent parked on a chair or sofa. Even if you dedicate at least 30 minutes a day to structured exercise (such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming), it's still important to get up and move for at least a few minutes, many times throughout the day.
        ""The more you sit, the more your large muscles are not using glucose, the body's main energy source. Uninterrupted sitting can cause blood sugar levels to rise, triggering the release of insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar,"" says Dr. Hicham Skali, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Over time, sedentary habits cause the body to become less sensitive to insulin. The resulting insulin resistance promotes inflammation, a key player in the buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries, he explains.
        Preliminary evidence from studies in rats suggests that sedentary behavior may change the activity of dozens of genes, including the gene responsible for making lipoprotein lipase (LPL). This enzyme helps break down fat so it can be used for energy or stored in the body. When rats were prevented from moving, LPL levels decreased, a change that may also contribute to raising heart disease risk, Dr. Skali explains.
        Don't just sit there
        The evidence about the harms of uninterrupted sitting (and the benefits of breaking it up) has been piling up for years, aided by tools such as fitness trackers that reveal people's typical activity patterns. Here are just a few examples of supportive studies:
        
          More than 2,600 people ages 60 and older reported their typical sitting habits (including a weekday and weekend) and were followed for nine years. Those who sat for an average of about three hours a day were 33% less likely to die of cardiovascular disease during the follow-up period than people who sat for an average of about seven hours a day.
          Among 8,000 people followed for 10 years, those who did light activity instead of sitting for 30 minutes each day had a 17% lower risk of dying in that period, even if they split up that half-hour of activity into periods as brief as a minute each.
          In more than 5,600 women followed for five years, reducing sedentary time by one hour per day was linked to a 26% lower risk of heart disease. Again, the hour of non-sedentary time didn't have to occur all at once. Short, light-intensity interruptions to sitting were just as effective.
        
        Making the moves
        There are many ways you can add short bursts of movement to your daily routine. Whenever you notice you've been sitting for a while, do a short set of exercises — say five to 10 squats or leg lifts, Dr. Skali suggests. You can also keep a stretchy exercise band near your favorite chair to get some arm exercises in as well. Here are some other ideas:
        Set a reminder. Many fitness trackers feature alerts that remind you to get up at least once an hour. But you can also use a smartphone or a regular kitchen timer; use it during periods when you tend to sit for long stretches.
        Take care of your chores less efficiently. Put your groceries or other purchases in small bags and make multiple trips from your car to your home. Stand up while folding laundry, and put just a few items of clothing away at a time to get more steps in.
        Pace or tidy up during phone calls. Whenever you're on the phone, stand up. Try to walk back and forth or in circles while you talk. Or use a hands-free headset and do some light housework while you chat.
        Move a little while you watch TV. The average American watches close to five hours of television a day, and that amount increases as people age. At least once an hour, stand up and march in place, swing your arms, or do some easy stretches.
        Take the long way. Whenever you drive somewhere, park in a spot farther from the door to get in some extra steps. Take the stairs instead of the escalator or elevator, even if you climb only one or two of the total flights.

There are no cell phones or GPS gadgets to help, just good old brainpower fueled by a sense of adventure as you wind through leafy trees and dappled sunlight.
        This is not an excursion to a campsite or a treasure hunt. It's a navigation sport called orienteering — a fun way to get outside, exercise, and maybe even help fight cognitive decline, according to a 2023 study.
        What is orienteering?
        Orienteering combines map and compass reading with exercise. Competitors (""orienteers"") race against a clock to reach checkpoints in outdoor settings that can range from city parks to remote areas with mountains, lakes, rivers, or snowy fields.
        ""You can go out in a group or on your own. You get a very detailed map and navigate your way to checkpoints that record your time electronically,"" says Clinton Morse, national communications manager with Orienteering USA, the national governing body for the sport in the United States.
        Because orienteers are racing the clock, they might run on trails, hike up hills, or scramble around boulders. That's for foot-orienteering events. There are also orienteering events with courses geared for mountain biking, cross-country skiing, or canoeing.
        How might orienteering affect thinking skills?
        A small 2023 study published online in PLoS One found a potential link between orienteering and sharp thinking skills.
        Researchers asked 158 healthy people, ages 18 to 87, about their health, activities, navigation abilities, and memory. About half of the participants had varying levels of orienteering experience. The other participants were physically active but weren't orienteers.
        Compared with study participants who didn't engage in orienteering, those who were orienteers reported
        
          having better navigational processing skills (recognizing where objects were, and where participants were in relation to the objects)
          having better navigational memory skills (recalling routes and landmarks).
        
        The study was observational — that is, not a true experiment — and thus didn't prove that orienteering boosted people's thinking skills. But the link might be plausible.
        ""Aerobic exercise releases chemicals in the brain that foster the growth of new brain cells. And when you use a map and connect it to landmarks, you stimulate growth between brain cells,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, lecturer in neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief of cognitive and behavioral neurology at VA Boston Healthcare System.
        Where can you find orienteering opportunities?
        There are about 70 orienteering clubs across the United States, and many more around the world (the sport is extremely popular in Europe). To find an orienteering event in your area, use the club finder tool offered by Orienteering USA.
        How can you get started with orienteering?
        People of all ages and athletic levels can take part, because orienteering courses vary from local parks to wilderness experiences. Costs are about $7 to $10 per person for local events, or $25 to $40 per person for national events, plus any travel and lodging expenses.
        To make orienteering easy at first, Morse suggests going with a group and taking things slowly on a short novice course. ""You don't have to race,"" he says. ""Some people do this recreationally to enjoy the challenge of completing a course at their own pace.""
        The trickiest part is learning to read the map. Morse's advice:
        
          Turn the map as you change directions. Hold the map so that the direction you're heading in is at the top of the page. For example, if the compass indicates that you're heading south, turn the map upside down, so the south part is on top and easier to follow.
          Create a mental image of what the map is telling you. If there's a fence along a field on the map, build a picture of it in your mind so you can recognize it when you see it, even if you haven't been there before.
        
        Tips for safe and enjoyable orienteering events:
        
          Dress appropriately. Wear comfortable clothes including long pants, good walking shoes, and a hat.
          Lather up. You'll be outside for at least an hour, and you'll need sunblock and possibly tick and bug spray depending on the terrain. Preventing tick bites that can lead to Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses is important in many locations.
          Bring some essentials. Pack water, a snack, sunblock, bug spray, and your phone. (Keep the phone turned off unless you need to call for help.)
          Use good judgment. Know that the shortest route on the map won't always be the best, since it might take you up a hill or through thick vegetation. It might be better to go around those areas.
        
        Once you learn the basics of orienteering, you can make it more physically challenging (and a better workout) by going faster and trying to beat your previous times, or by signing up for a more advanced course that's longer and requires more exertion and speed.
        And no matter which event you take part in, enjoy the adventure. ""You're not just following a path, you're solving puzzles while being immersed in nature,"" Morse says. ""It's a great way to experience the outdoors.""",Heidi Godman,"July 10, 2023",1

Two-thirds were taking statins, mostly simvastatin (Zocor) or atorvastatin (Lipitor). The group participated in a walking event in which they trekked either 18, 25, or 31 miles on each of four consecutive days. Muscle pain, fatigue scores, and levels of enzymes associated with muscle injury were measured before and after the event. The researchers found that pain, fatigue, and enzyme levels increased similarly for all participants whether or not they took statins or had existing muscle pain.
        According to the researchers, the new findings suggest that the drugs won't exacerbate usual pain symptoms from moderate-intensity exercise.

        Movement: Step back onto the ball of your left foot, bend your knees, and lower into a lunge. Your right knee should align over your right ankle, and your left knee should point toward (but not touch) the floor.
        Keep your spine neutral when lowering into the lunge, and don't lean forward or back.
        Push off your back (left) foot to stand up and return to the starting position. Repeat, stepping back with your right foot to do the lunge on the opposite side.
        To make it easier, don't use weights, or place a hand on a chair or table for stability. For more of a challenge, use heavier dumbbells.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/exercise-may-improve-atrial-fibrillation,Exercise may improve atrial fibrillation,"For people with atrial fibrillation (afib), a program of supervised and home-based exercise may reduce the severity and frequency of their symptoms, new research finds.
        For the study, published April 2023 in JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology, researchers randomly assigned 120 people with occasional or ongoing symptomatic afib to an exercise group or a control group. The 60 people in the exercise group were offered one-on-one exercise sessions featuring high-intensity interval training. These sessions were held once weekly for three months and then every other week for an additional three months. Participants also got personalized recommendations for doing moderate to vigorous physical activity (such as brisk walking, swimming, and cycling) at home. The 60 people in the control group received two educational sessions about exercise benefits and were encouraged to do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week.
        After six months, people in the exercise group had less severe afib symptoms than those in the control group. After 12 months, 24 people in the exercise group were free of afib, versus just 12 in the control group. The benefits probably reflected many factors, including exercise-induced improvements in heart and nervous system functioning, the authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/some-obesity-related-brain-changes-similar-to-those-with-alzheimers,Some obesity-related brain changes similar to those with Alzheimer's,"Some brain changes in people with obesity appear similar to those that occur in people with Alzheimer's disease, a new analysis suggests.
        For the study, published online Jan. 31, 2023, by the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, researchers reviewed brain scans from more than 1,300 people: 341 people with Alzheimer's — the most common cause of dementia — and 341 people with obesity, as well as 682 people without either condition. In people with either Alzheimer's or obesity, the scans revealed similar thinning in brain regions responsible for learning, memory, and judgment. Cognitive tests taken by participants with obesity — defined as a body mass index of 30 or higher — did not reveal clear mental deficits, but the researchers noted that these tests might not detect small changes in thinking ability related to brain changes.
        The study was observational, meaning it can't prove obesity causes brain regions to shrink. But earlier studies have also found a link between other brain changes, such as blood vessel damage and a buildup of abnormal proteins, and obesity. People with obesity may be able to stem cognitive decline if they get closer to a healthy weight, study authors said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/taming-travelers-tummy,Taming traveler's tummy,"Travel is meant to transport you far from the same-old, same-old. But when you're not eating the same foods and sleeping on the same schedule (or even in the same time zone), the ripple effects on digestion can be fierce.
        With more nerve cells than many parts of the central nervous system, including the spinal cord, our gut knows when we're off our routine, says Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Our bodies, including our gastrointestinal tract, respond to circadian rhythms — day-and-night cues,"" he says. ""Your colon will sleep when you sleep and wake up when you do. If those times are shifted by travel and changing time zones, digestion can get thrown off.""
        Factor in heavy meals, too much alcohol, or dehydration from flying, and ""it's sort of a perfect storm to cause digestive problems,"" Dr. Staller says. ""Even the stress of travel itself can trigger them."" The result? Diarrhea, constipation, and indigestion — the trifecta of travelers' tummy troubles — can potentially derail your trip.
        Foodborne dangers
        Travel took a hiatus during the pandemic, but today's packed airplanes, rental car shortages, and booked-solid hotels signal a turnaround. According to U.S. Travel Association predictions, pent-up demand will fuel a surge over the next few years in all types of travel, including to destinations across the globe.
        Far-off locales, however — especially in developing countries — pose the biggest threat of delivering an unpleasant souvenir dubbed traveler's diarrhea. Its abdominal cramps and loose stools stem from eating or drinking germ-laden foods and beverages. Traveler's diarrhea affects an estimated 30% to 70% of travelers, according to the CDC. It can occur anywhere, but the highest-risk destinations are in most of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America.
        The condition typically results from poor hygienic practices in food handling and preparation or a lack of refrigeration. You're also more likely to get it if you're an older adult or — as with traveler's tummy in general — if you already have a digestive problem, such as irritable bowel syndrome, that changes how you eat or eliminate food.
        Microbes aren't the only culprit. ""Some people get so-called adjustment diarrhea, when they haven't ingested anything that's infectious but they're adjusting to new foods or spices,"" Dr. Staller says.
        Keep digestion humming
        The first step in warding off traveler's tummy is to learn from past mistakes, especially if you're prone to digestive upsets. ""The tendency is to arrive somewhere new and embrace it in all aspects,"" Dr. Staller says. ""Instead, keep your food choices more in line with things you eat at home, drink plenty of water, and eat moderate portions.""
        Beyond that, Dr. Staller offers additional strategies to keep indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation at bay:
        Plan ahead. Scope out restaurants and menus beforehand to make sure at least one item seems both palatable and easy to digest. ""This is more difficult, though, if you're more of a spontaneous traveler or staying in someone's home,"" he says.
        Assemble a ""control kit."" Rather than scrambling to purchase remedies in unfamiliar locations, bring along a variety of over-the-counter products to counteract digestive woes on the road. Good choices include antacids (such as Tums) for heartburn; bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate) for indigestion or diarrhea; docusate sodium (Colace, Surfak), psyllium (Metamucil), or bisacodyl (Dulcolax) for constipation; and loperamide (Imodium) for diarrhea. But don't use loperamide if you also have signs of infection such as fever or blood in your stool, Dr. Staller says. Instead, see a doctor.
        Pack familiar snacks. Whether that's granola bars, nuts, trail mix, or dried fruit, these items should be filling. ""There's no one-size-fits-all recommendation, but pick things you might eat at home as a quick snack or even a meal substitute in case you notice that everything at your location is going to disagree with you,"" he says.
        Eat street food with caution. Local delicacies or food truck cuisine are more apt to contain harmful bacteria, especially in developing regions. ""This isn't fun, because some of the tastiest food is street food,"" Dr. Staller says. ""But if you indulge, know you're taking that risk. If you're easily derailed by digestive issues, street food is a no-go.""
        Skip local water and ice. ""In the developing world, assume the water isn't safe unless it's from a bottle,"" he says. Instead, drink only what comes in cans or bottles.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/menopause-marketing-hype-vs-truth,Menopause marketing: Hype vs. truth,"Nestled just inches apart in the cosmetics section of a big-box retailer are two little pots of night cream, both made by the same manufacturer. One label is magenta, the other teal. ""Wake up to skin that looks refreshed and less tired,"" promises the magenta version, labeled ""menopause skin care."" Meanwhile, the teal-clad ""advanced overnight cream"" — presumably meant for everyone else — pledges that ""fine lines and wrinkles [will] appear visibly reduced.""
        A closer look reveals both night creams contain nearly identical active ingredients. But the menopause edition costs $5 more for the same amount — 25% more than the standard anti-aging version. So what's the real difference? Aside from labeling and price, not much — meaning skin care brands may be quietly fleecing women at a vulnerable point, when worries over changing looks and vitality merge with hot flashes and hide-and-seek periods.
        ""If you're taking virtually the same product, changing the label's colors and wording to make it more appealing to midlife women, and selling it at a higher price, that's predatory,"" says Dr. Jan Shifren, director of the Midlife Women's Health Center at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        ""A brand could just be putting a 'menopause' label on a product when a lot of these products contain the same tried-and-true ingredients that are anti-aging for everyone,"" agrees Dr. Arianne Shadi Kourosh, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General. ""There could be hype in the labeling.""
        Major spending power
        It's no mystery why a plethora of ""menopause skin care"" products have popped up on store shelves in recent years. The trend coincides with a wave of aging women who may feel flush with extra cash as they burn their mortgages and finish paying children's college tuition. Nearly 63 million American women were 50 or older in 2021 — roughly 20% of the U.S. population — and older adults are projected to outnumber children for the first time in U. S. history in 2034, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
        So, while anti-aging lotions and potions have been marketed for decades, the $49 billion beauty industry now sees dollar signs in midlife women at the height of their earning and buying potential, Dr. Shifren says. Women over 50 boast a combined spending power of $15 trillion and control 95% of household purchasing decisions, according to AARP.
        ""We're living longer, we're aging better, we're healthier, and we're wealthier,"" Dr. Shifren says. ""Everyone has realized midlife women are a large group of consumers with money to spare, and it's caught the attention of these product makers.""
        ""But midlife women need to know they're a target now,"" she adds. ""We have to stay in a state of 'buyer beware,' or companies will try to take advantage of us.""
        
          
            
              
                What does ""clean beauty"" really mean?
                Are you more tempted to buy a beauty product if it claims to be clean? The notion of ""clean beauty,"" ironically, is quite murky, a Harvard dermatologist says.
                Consumers expect clean beauty products — part of a $7 billion global market that encompasses everything from lotions and soaps to hair care and makeup — to be free of harmful substances. But the ""clean"" moniker denotes nothing about the purity of the ingredients, says Dr. Arianne Shadi Kourosh, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.
                ""There is no legal or official definition of clean beauty,"" Dr. Kourosh says. ""It's a term that's been used and misused by marketers from every section of the industry to the point where it has no meaning anymore.""
                The clean beauty movement came of age in recent years in parallel with ""clean eating,"" but the latter has far more substance. ""Clean eating has more structure to it, because people are trying to eat whole foods that are unprocessed and don't come in boxes,"" she says. ""That's a little clearer.""
                Some beauty products claim they're ""clean"" when they're merely fragrance-free or hypoallergenic. But even fragrance-free products can contain pleasantly scented preservatives that legally skirt that definition. Other labels declare an item is ""vegan,"" ""cruelty-free,"" or ""green."" But while those individual claims might pass muster, often marketers are attempting to gain favor with various interest groups, Dr. Kourosh says.
                ""They're appealing to people's identity politics, using their sensibilities to sell products when the product isn't held to any standards,"" she add. ""There's no accountability, because the FDA doesn't regulate skin care products.""
                If you're clear-eyed but still interested in what clean beauty products can offer you, drill down on what you're seeking — whether it's something hypoallergenic, for example, or sourced in an environmentally conscious way. ""You need to be clear on your goals first,"" she says, ""then do your research and consult with a dermatologist to get an idea of the ingredients you're looking for behind these nebulous and meaningless labels.""
              
            
          
        
        Menopause skin basics
        Staying ahead of potentially deceptive skin care marketing first requires understanding what happens to women's skin as we age. As the largest organ, the skin joins virtually every other body part in chronicling the effects of falling estrogen levels as menopause approaches.
        Estrogen fuels the production of oil and other substances that moisturize and protect the skin. When levels drop, skin can't hold moisture as effectively, leading to dryness, dullness, and irritation. Estrogen decline also coincides with diminishing production of collagen, a type of protein that makes skin firmer.
        Beyond that, many women in perimenopause and beyond develop new or worsening cases of rosacea, a chronic inflammatory skin condition marked by redness and rashes that usually arise on the nose and cheeks, Dr. Kourosh says. Why now? Because flushing related to hot flashes causes tiny blood vessels in the face to dilate or makes redness more obvious.
        But over-the-counter skin creams typically can't make a big dent in rosacea symptoms, she says — only medications or in-office procedures such as laser treatments can. ""Skin care is only going to take you so far,"" she notes.
        This is also true for anti-aging products in general, since most of the changes our face registers over decades — wrinkles and sagging among them — are treatable but not preventable. ""We can slow it down, but not stop it,"" Dr. Kourosh says. ""Some of these forces are going to happen no matter what. Working with a trusted dermatologist through the process can help women navigate it more smoothly.""
        Beneficial ingredients
        Nothing will turn back the clock. But certain active ingredients in beauty products can confront aging skin's biggest nemeses:
        
          Broad-spectrum sunscreen is a product in its own right but also is incorporated into many moisturizers and foundations. Sun exposure speeds up chronological skin aging and leads to age spots.
          Alpha-hydroxy acids exfoliate dead skin cells and reveal smoother skin underneath.
          Retinols and retinoids are forms of vitamin A. They ramp up skin cell turnover, combating fine lines and sun damage.
          Hyaluronic acid draws water to the skin and ""traps"" it in cells to retain moisture.
          Ceramides strengthen the skin's barrier to keep moisture from escaping.
          Moisturizers improve skin's smoothness, softness, and flexibility. Common individual ingredients include glycerin, shea butter, aloe vera, and various natural oils such as coconut, sunflower seed, jojoba, tea tree, and grapeseed.
        
        While using these ingredients can't hurt, don't expect menopause miracles — no matter what a label says, Dr. Kourosh says. Unlike medications, the FDA doesn't approve over-the-counter skin care products before they're sold.
        ""I'm not aware of skin care products that are going to be game changers for the problems of menopause,"" she says. ""They may help a little bit, but they contain the same anti-aging ingredients that people use throughout adulthood. And while certain skin care products, like retinols and moisturizers, can be helpful, they're not necessarily going to do the trick for everyone.""
        Caveat emptor
        If you're perusing skin care shelves and considering ""menopause skin care"" products, Harvard experts offer two main pieces of advice:
        Cast a critical eye. Examine the product's ingredients rather than its claims. Does it contain something different from what you're already using? ""Until someone proves that the needs of midlife women's skin are different and designs a product that meets those needs in a different way than for younger women — and no one has done that, to the best of my knowledge — you should probably stick with products you used in the past and not pay more for the same thing,"" Dr. Shifren says. ""If you found a moisturizing cream that worked well for a long time, there's no reason to now buy one whose label says it's perfect for menopause.""
        Get back to basics. Including skin care in your self-care regimen is fine. But nothing is better for maintaining your skin and overall vitality than getting adequate sleep, staying hydrated, and working with a dermatologist to target your individual needs, Dr. Kourosh says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/power-up-your-walking-routine,Power up your walking routine,"Little can soothe us like the sound and feel of our feet hitting the ground, again and again, while we walk. Long the most popular form of movement among American adults, walking gained fresh appeal during the pandemic, when more than two-thirds of physically active adults reported it became their preferred exercise.
        Several years downstream, however, maybe those endless loops around the neighborhood or track are feeling a little humdrum. Or maybe you need more than comfort from your walking routine. That's a sign to kick it up a notch, says Dr. Lauren Elson, a physiatrist (doctor who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation) at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Network.
        There's no question regular walks are better than staying in your chair, but stepping up your regimen can pay off in key ways — even if it just means you stick with it. ""We know all the problems associated with sitting that walking counteracts, but anything that's not inspiring can be difficult to keep doing,"" Dr. Elson says. ""There's almost no good reason not to walk.""
        Pace counts
        A wealth of research supports walking's many health benefits, suggesting it improves circulation and heart health, strengthens bones and immune response, helps control weight, and lowers the risk of dementia. But a new analysis suggests it's not just the activity that matters, but the pace.
        Published online Sept. 12, 2022, by JAMA Internal Medicine, the study — which collected health data on more than 78,000 people (average age 61, 55% women) from 2013 to 2015 — found that their risk of heart disease, cancer, and premature death dropped by 10% over the following seven years for every 2,000 steps they logged each day, with the benefit peaking at 10,000 daily steps. But participants who walked more briskly — about 80 steps per minute — reaped greater benefits, lowering their health risks more than slower-walking peers.
        Walking can still fall short, Dr. Elson says, since it works primarily the legs but not many other muscles or body areas. ""Adding a bit of oomph to your walking routine could make it more efficient and add some core strength,"" she says.
        Ways to step it up
        With a dash of creativity and flexible thinking, you can easily power up your walking routine. Dr. Elson suggests considering the following strategies:
        Walking poles transform a legs-only activity into a full-body workout. There are multiple types, which go by such names as trekking poles and Nordic walking poles. Some are designed with rubber tips to grip the pavement, while others are pointed to add traction on trails. Using them works your arms, back, and shoulders, burning more calories in the process. ""Walking poles can prevent stability problems and also help with lower-body discomfort,"" she says. ""And because of that cross-body action, they add a little bit of core strength as well.""
        High-intensity bursts of speed increase heart rate, breathing, and muscle action for short, defined periods. Try alternating five minutes of your typical walking pace with 30-second intervals of speed walking, skipping, jogging, or sprinting. Repeat as desired. Also known as high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, this pattern ""definitely improves your cardiovascular fitness more than straight walking,"" Dr. Elson says.
        Resistance exercise ""breaks"" strategically break your stride while boosting overall strength. Rotating five-minute periods of walking with squats, pushups, or other resistance exercises ""is a great way to not quite do HIIT, but to supplement cardiovascular exercise with strength and power work,"" she says. These types of activities are best saved for a park or backyard, as they're more difficult to squeeze in on a sidewalk.
        Music, podcasts, or books on tape engage your brain while you add to your step count. Cranking up your favorite tunes can motivate you to walk to the beat, and exercise can also seem easier when you're focused on your playlist. Dr. Elson makes her walks perform double duty by listening to audiobooks. ""It's a chance to kill two birds with one stone,"" she says. ""If I don't have time to sit and read, I can at least get in some 'reading' while I exercise."" Pay extra attention to cars, however.
        Weighted backpacks enable you to firm up your leg muscles and give your heart and lungs an extra workout while walking. Fill a well-padded backpack with light weights — between five and 10 pounds to start — of dumbbells, books, or cans. But this tweak should only be attempted by seasoned walkers with no joint or muscle problems, which might be aggravated by the extra load. ""Don't start a walking regimen doing this right away,"" she says. ""View this as a higher-intensity option.""

          My daughter heard on social media that taping our mouths closed during sleep could improve snoring and lessen bad breath. Is this true?
        
        A. Unfortunately, social media is rife with so-called medical advice that has no basis in science, and this sounds like yet another example. While intentional nose breathing during waking hours can offer many benefits — including slowing breathing, filtering allergens, and easing anxiety — taping your mouth while sleeping to achieve this can prove risky, leading to hampered breathing, disrupted sleep, or skin irritation. There's no research to support the measure, which, in certain cases, could significantly reduce a person's oxygen levels while sleeping.
        If you find you consistently can't breathe through your nose while sleeping, you may have some type of nasal obstruction, such as a deviated septum or a nasal polyp. (Research has linked nasal obstruction with snoring.) You may also have allergies, asthma, or sleep apnea (meaning you briefly and repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping). Talk to your doctor, who may suggest tests to pinpoint the problem's cause.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/exercises-to-try-in-the-pool-right-now,Exercises to try in the pool right now,"Pools are ideal spots for playing, cooling, and relaxing, and they're also great for exercising. Water resistance makes the heart and muscles work hard. Our buoyancy in water takes pressure off the joints, making movement less painful than it might be on land. And exercising in water always provides a soft landing if you lose your balance. Many people swim laps to take advantage of these benefits. You can also do a series of exercises as you would in a home workout routine.
        We've provided some exercises to help get you started on a water workout. You'll find even more in the Harvard Special Health Report Aqua Fitness (/af).
        Like any workout, you'll need to do a warm-up beforehand (such as walking in the water), and some stretches afterward (on land).
        Keep these tips in mind for the pool exercises in between.
        To make an exercise easier: ""Go into slightly deeper water, where there's more buoyancy and support,"" says Jessica Hildebrandt, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, and former competitive swimmer and water polo player.
        To make an exercise harder: ""Create more resistance: move faster or keep your fingers together like paddles. Or while water walking, hold a kickboard vertically in front of you to create resistance,"" Hildebrandt says.
        To jog without touching the pool bottom: Wear a pool belt in deep water. The belt is a floatation device that lets you move your arms and cycle your feet as if you're jogging through the water.
        To avoid soreness: Take it easy at first. ""The water supports you, so you feel good and can do more than you're used to. But you can overdo it without realizing it,"" Hildebrandt says. ""Start with easier exercises and shorter durations, or do less than you feel up to. If you're not sore the next day, you'll know it was the right amount of exercise for you. From there you can gradually increase the intensity.""
        Jumping jacks
        
          
          
        
        Stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Jump, separating your feet as you raise your arms out to the sides. Keep your hands below the surface. Jump, bringing your feet back together and your arms down to your sides. Repeat as many times as you can in 60 seconds.
        Pendulum
        
          
        
        Stand on your right leg with your left leg lifted out to the side. Extend your arms diagonally down and to the right. Jump off your right foot, swing it out to the side, and land on your left foot, while swinging your arms to the left. Repeat, swinging your arms and legs to the opposite sides. Continue jumping and alternating directions for 60 seconds.
        Double kickbacks
        
          
        
        Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms at your sides. Jump up and bend your knees, bringing both feet toward your buttocks. Lower your feet back to the pool bottom. Let your arms swing naturally as you jump. Repeat as many times as you can in 60 seconds.
        Twists
         
        Stand with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Jump, while twisting your upper body to the right and your lower body to the left.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/protect-your-skin-from-serious-burns,Protect your skin from serious burns,"It takes only a moment to suffer a burn at home. It can be as simple as brushing against a sizzling skillet on the stove or getting into a bath that's too hot — a particular risk for people with decreased sensation in their feet. Understanding common causes of burns can help you prevent them. And learning what to do immediately, if they happen, is crucial.
        Common burn causes
        ""There are several common causes of burns, particularly in older people, and most are clearly preventable,"" says Dr. Colleen Ryan, staff surgeon at the Sumner Redstone Burn Center at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital and Shriners Children's ­Boston. Here are some examples.
        Explosions. Explosions are common among people who smoke while using a home oxygen tank.
        Clothes that catch fire. ""This often occurs when someone wearing sleeves reaches over a flame on a gas stovetop. For years, it was the leading cause of death in women admitted to our hospital with burns. Now it occurs in men, too,"" Dr. Ryan says.
        Hot water scalds. You can be burned by hot tap water in about three seconds if your water heater is set at 140°, or 25 seconds if it's set at 130°. But it takes nine minutes if the temperature is set at 120°. A study published online March 7, 2023, by the journal Injury Prevention found that from 2016 to 2018, such scalds caused more than 52,000 visits to the emergency department and killed more than 100 people.
        Fires at home. These might be caused by unattended candles or carelessness while smoking.
        Burn classifications
        Doctors describe burns based on how deep they penetrate the skin surface.
        First-degree burns are considered superficial. They involve only the top layer of skin (the epidermis), are red and painful, and usually clear up in a few days. ""The epidermis can regenerate itself, so if it is injured, it can fully regenerate and doesn't scar,"" Dr. Ryan says. For example, a sunburn is usually a first-degree burn.
        Second-degree burns look like first-degree burns initially, but then develop blisters. The burns involve both the epidermis and the deeper layer of the skin (the dermis) and are very painful while they are open and exposed to air. They take longer to heal and are replaced with scar tissue.
        A third-degree burn occurs when the epidermis and dermis are destroyed. This is common in delicate areas like the back of a hand. The burnt area itself is painless because the nerves have been killed, but pain often arises from adjacent skin. ""These burns heal very slowly over time, and only if they are very small and the skin can grow from the edges,"" Dr. Ryan says. ""Otherwise, they do not close without surgery.""
        What to do if you're burned
        There's no time to lose when you suffer a burn. For a minor burn on a small area of skin, Dr. Ryan advises running cool water over it for 20 minutes, which can help limit damage. Then apply petroleum jelly or antibiotic cream (such as Neosporin or Bacitracin), all available over the counter, and cover the burn with a bandage.
        If a blister develops, don't pop it. Dab antibacterial cream on it, cover it with a bandage, and get to your doctor as soon as you can.
        For a second-degree burn that's larger than a deck of cards, get to your doctor immediately or go to an emergency room. ""And if you have a first- or second-degree burn on a large area of the body, perhaps from a bathing accident, don't immerse yourself in cool water. That might cause hypothermia. Stay warm and call 911 immediately,"" Dr. Ryan says.
        Call 911 for second-degree burns to the face, hands, feet, or genitals, and for all third-degree burns. The treatment they receive in the first hours is critical.
        And keep in mind that open burns, especially deep second-degree burns and all third-degree burns, are at risk for becoming infected. Your doctor may prescribe dressings and ointments to prevent infection and promote healing. Or you might be referred to a hospital burn center.
        Preventing burns
        These steps can help you stay safe:
        
          If you have an oxygen tank in your home, keep it maintained and make sure any smoking (if it must take place) occurs far from the tank.
          When cooking, use side-by-side burners rather than front and back burners. Don't wear loose sleeves near a stove. Use a microwave when possible. And consider getting an induction stove, which heats cookware with a magnetic field.
          Don't set your water heater above 120°. Consider checking the temperature of your bath water with a thermometer before getting into it.
          Be especially careful when children are near. Put an ice cube into hot soup, allow heated baby formula to cool, unplug treadmills that can cause friction burns, and turn off or block fireplaces. ""Preventing even one burn,"" Dr. Ryan says, ""is a better outcome than anything I can fix.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/understanding-statin-intensity,Understanding statin intensity,"Q.
          I'm 71 and have taken 20 milligrams (mg) of atorva­statin (Lipitor) since 2010, after an angiogram showed a 90% blockage of a small coronary artery. But I've never had angina or a heart attack. My LDL is 70 mg/dL. Should I switch to 20 mg of rosuvastatin (Crestor), which I understand is a higher-intensity statin?
        
        A. You're correct — a 20-mg dose of rosuvastatin is considered high-intensity statin therapy. Before getting into my advice, let me first explain what we mean by statin intensity.
        Currently, there are eight different cholesterol-lowering statins on the market, each available in different dosages. In general, the higher the dosage, the more they lower your LDL cholesterol. However, some statins (especially rosuvastatin) lower LDL cholesterol better than others. So experts have classified statin therapy into three categories (low, moderate, or high intensity) based on how much they can lower LDL. As you can see by the table below, a statin can fall into more than one intensity category, depending on the dosage. For example, 10 or 20 mg of atorvastatin daily is considered moderate intensity, while 40 to 80 mg is high intensity.
        The choice of a statin depends on a person's risk. For someone with high LDL but no other risk factors or evidence of coronary artery disease, moderate-intensity therapy makes sense. But for someone like you, with known coronary artery disease, the guidelines recommended high-intensity therapy, as several trials have documented a lower risk of heart attack and stroke for people on high-intensity therapy compared with moderate-intensity therapy.
        The guidelines also recommended lowering LDL by 50% or aiming for an LDL of less than 70 mg/dl. Since you are close to that goal and have not had a heart attack, stroke, or other major cardiovascular problem, switching to rosuvastatin is not essential. However, all trials of cholesterol-lowering medications have found that lower is better for LDL. Because rosuvastatin is the most potent statin, switching could provide more protection for you.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/dont-bomb-the-bowel-with-laxatives,Laxatives: What to know about choosing the right one,"Occasional irregularity is a fact of life, but you can minimize it with some basic steps. You should be sure you are eating a fiber-rich diet, drinking adequate fluids, and staying physically active.
        But when you have constipation, the best laxative is the gentlest and safest option, like a bulk-forming laxative. If laxatives don't work, ask for help. You should see your doctor and discuss it if you are constantly needing to take laxatives.
        How do stool softeners work?
        Stool softeners work by softening stools to make them easier to pass. They can be in capsule, tablet, liquid, and syrup form and are usually taken at bedtime. Be sure to take stool softeners exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
        First choice: bulk-forming laxatives
        Bulk-forming laxatives draw water into stool, making it softer and easier to pass. But don't expect instant gratification: these can take a half-day to several days to provide relief. They are safe to use daily. They contain various ingredients, and you may have to try more than one to find the product that helps you with minimal side effects, such as flatulence and bloating. They may be marketed as laxatives or as fiber supplements.
        For stuck stools...
        Stool softeners add moisture to stools to make them softer and easier to pass. Mineral oil, a lubricant, helps stools ""slide on by"" if the stools feel stuck low in your bowels, if you have an internal tear or ""fissure,"" or if you have pain from hemorrhoids during bowel movements.
        Don't take mineral oil at the same time as stool softeners. Take 1 tablespoon at breakfast or lunch. But don't use it for more than a few days, because mineral oil interferes with absorption of some vitamins and if inhaled it can cause pneumonia. Consider wearing a protective pad in your undergarments to absorb any leakage.
        Other laxative options
        If stool softeners aren't providing enough help, the osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX or a generic version) is good next step. These products hold water in stool to soften it and increase bowel movements. Common side effects are gas, bloating, and nausea.
        Another option that works for some people is diet candies containing the sweetener sorbitol. These essentially trigger a mild case of the runs. You may experience bloating and gas along with the laxative effect, however.
        Another option would be a magnesium-based laxative, such as milk of magnesia or magnesium citrate. These are members of a larger class of laxatives called saline osmotics, which draw water into the bowels and trigger bowel movements. The active ingredients include magnesium, sulfate, citrate, and phosphate.
        But don't take more than the recommended amounts of these laxatives, or use them long-term, because they can throw off your chemistry. Combined with an underperforming kidney or heart failure, saline osmotic laxatives can be dangerous.

        Stimulant laxatives
        Stimulant laxatives such as senna and bisacodyl trigger contractions in the bowels that push the stool along. But if you take stimulant laxatives too often, you could become dependent on them to have a bowel movement at all — possibly because the bowel has stopped functioning normally.
        When to talk to a doctor
        If you find yourself trying one laxative after another, see your doctor for an evaluation. Additional testing can lead to better therapy and rule out any possible serious malfunctions. And if it is just constipation, your doctor can offer other medications to you that may be more helpful than over-the-counter laxatives.

IBD is a condition that causes inflammation along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The two main types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis:


	Crohn's disease: inflammation can occur anywhere along the GI tract (from the mouth to the anus)
	Ulcerative colitis: typically affects the large intestine (colon) only.


IBD can cause diarrhea, bloody stool, weight loss, and abdominal pain, and is typically diagnosed with blood and stool tests, imaging, and colonoscopy. A diagnosis of IBD may increase the risk of developing anxiety or depression, and can also have an impact on sexual health. People with IBD may require long-term medical treatment or surgery for their condition.

The starting point: Talking to your doctor

Talking to your medical team about IBD and sexual health may not be easy. This may depend on how comfortable you feel disclosing your LGBTQ+ identity with your health care providers. Ideally, you should feel comfortable discussing sexuality with your medical team, including what types of sexual partners and activities you participate in and how IBD may affect this part of your life.

Be aware that health care providers may not be able to address all LGBTQ+-specific concerns. Optimal care for people with IBD who identify as LGBTQ+ is not fully understood. However, this is an active area of research.

How might medicines for IBD affect sexual health?

Many effective IBD medications subdue the immune system to decrease inflammation. These immunosuppressive medicines may raise your risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV, chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhea.

What you can do: Discuss these concerns with your doctor so you can take appropriate protective measures. This might include:


	ensuring that your vaccinations, such as hepatitis B and HPV, are up to date.
	engaging in sex using barrier protection to prevent STI transmission.
	taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This safe and effective medicine helps prevent the spread of HIV. Ask your primary care doctor or gastroenterologist if PrEP is appropriate for you.


How might surgery for IBD affect sexual health?

For some people with IBD, gut inflammation is severe enough to require surgery to remove part of the intestine. For example:


	Abscesses or fistulas (abnormal connections between two body parts) sometimes form when someone has Crohn's disease around the anus. This may require surgical treatment.
	Active inflammation in the rectum or anus may make sex painful, particularly for people who engage in anal receptive sex.
	We don't yet know whether anal receptive sex is safe for people who have had surgery to remove the colon and create a J-pouch, which is formed from small intestine to create an internal pouch that enables normal bowel movements.


What you can do: Discuss your concerns with your gastroenterologist and colorectal surgeon.

If you engage in anal sex, you may be confused about whether it is safe to do so. While you may feel uncomfortable discussing this concern and others with your doctor, try to be as honest and open as you can. That way, you'll receive the best information on how to engage in safe and enjoyable sex after an IBD diagnosis or surgery.

What else to consider if you are transgender

People with IBD who are transgender may have additional concerns to address.

For example, there may be a risk for sexual side effects from gender-affirming surgery. These procedures may include vaginoplasty (surgical creation of a vagina) for transgender females, or phalloplasty (surgical creation of a penis) for transgender males. The safety of these procedures in people with IBD is not currently well understood.

What you can do: If you identify as transgender, ask your doctor if any gender-affirming surgeries you've had or medicines you take, such as hormones, might affect your IBD, recommended treatments, or sexual health.

If you're considering gender-affirming surgery, discuss your options with your medical team. Be aware that gender-affirming surgery may be more challenging, or may not be advisable, for people with complex or active IBD. It's important to discuss your specific risks with your doctor when pursuing gender-affirming care. Having access to a team of physicians, including a surgeon and a gastroenterologist, may improve outcomes.

The bottom line

Try to talk to your gastroenterologist about how your sexual practices and gender identity may affect — and be affected by — your IBD. A conversation like this may feel uncomfortable, but being candid about your symptoms and concerns will help you receive the best possible care.

Often, a multidisciplinary approach to care is helpful. Your health care providers, including your gastroenterologist and surgeon, may suggest seeing additional specialists.

Much remains unknown about sexual health and practices in LGBTQ+ people with IBD. While more research is needed, open communication on the impact of medications, surgery, and other aspects of living with IBD can do a lot to improve your quality of life.","Andrew Eidelberg, MD","June 28, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/mud-runs-dirty-challenging-next-level-fun-202306262948,"Mud runs: Dirty, challenging, next-level fun","Remember childhood summers when you climbed monkey bars, swung from ropes, and jumped over streams? Rain just added to the fun, leaving you soaked and muddy.
        You can relive those adventures by signing up for a mud run. These outdoor team events focus on navigating through military-inspired obstacle courses and getting good and dirty in the process.
        Tough Mudder and Spartan races are the most well-known mud races. But similar mud runs are available in most states. Some offer shorter distances and levels of difficulty. Others are designed just for women, kids, or families.
        How do mud runs work?
        Usually these events follow the same basic concept: participants traverse a course that covers anywhere from three to 10 miles (or longer), and tackle 10 to 25 obstacles.
        While some mud races can be done solo, most are designed as team-oriented events. Teams are often coed and consist of five to 10 people. There is no time limit, but depending on the distance and number of obstacles, most teams complete the course in anywhere from less than an hour to three-plus hours.
        The obstacles are challenging enough that most people need help — physically and emotionally — to navigate over, under, and across them. This is where a ""we're-all-in-this-together"" comradery comes into play.
        What sort of obstacles are featured in mud runs?
        Common obstacles include
        
          climbing over spider web-like cargo nets
          scaling walls of various heights
          swinging from ropes with handles
          keeping your balance while walking across beams or logs
          carrying logs or sandbags
          slithering under barbed wire.
        
        And then there's all the mud. Be prepared to trudge through sticky mud pits, crawl through muddy tunnels, and shoot down mud-slick slides.
        What are the health benefits of a mud run?
        According to Dr. Aaron Baggish, founder of the Cardiovascular Performance Center at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital, the benefits of these events come from how they are constructed.
        ""Obstacle racing combines large-muscle, whole-body resistance exercises superimposed on a long-distance endurance race,"" he says. ""They are a snapshot of all-around conditioning, as you need strength, stamina, and mobility.""
        Besides the physical benefits, mud races offer psychological challenges, and the emotional rewards, of conquering tasks that require planning, coordination, and strategy.
        How can you prepare for a mud run?
        Mud races require strenuous exercise, so discuss your safety and capabilities with your doctor before signing up for an event. While almost anyone of any age can participate in these events, they require a certain level of conditioning to complete and to reduce the risk of experiencing injury.
        ""Training for obstacle races incorporates many aspects of fitness and performance,"" says Dr. Baggish. ""So it's best to prepare with a coach or trainer who understands the fundamental skills needed to complete these races.""
        Whether or not you work with a trainer, you'll want to focus on:
        
          Aerobic fitness. While you won't consistently run as you do in a traditional road race, such as a 5K or a half marathon, you do have to hustle from obstacle to obstacle. ""Optimal training for such obstacle races involves a combination of steady-state aerobic base training like jogging or cycling, coupled with interval work that simulates the start-and-stop nature of competition,"" says Dr. Baggish.
          Grip strength. You will have to grab, hold, and pull yourself against gravity. Exercises that can help include pull-ups and farmer carries (where you hold dumbbells or kettlebells in each hand while you walk back and forth). Good form is essential during these exercises to help you avoid injury. Remember to start low when working with weights and go slow.
          Plyometrics. Many obstacles require explosive jumps and quick movements. Exercises like box jumps, burpees, and jump squats can help replicate these moves.
        
        How to stay safe in the mud
        While being physically prepared can help reduce the risk of injury, you should take other precautions to stay safe. For instance:
        
          Choose your race depending on level of fitness. Be sure you know what you're getting into before you go.
          Wear lightweight, moisture-wicking clothing. Avoid cotton, which gets heavy with mud and sweat.
          Wear a headband, protective eyewear, or visor to keep mud out of the eyes.
          Wear long shorts or pants that cover your knees to prevent scraping, or opt for knee pads.
          Consider gloves to protect your hands and provide extra grip.
          Cover your feet with petroleum jelly or an anti-chafing cream before putting on socks to protect wet feet from chafing and blisters.
          Tie shoelaces tightly (but not so tight that they cut off circulation). Mud creates suction and you can quickly lose a shoe.
          Pace yourself. Walk or take a break when needed.
        
        Where can you find a mud run?
        It depends on the level of challenge that you seek. Are you ready for a Tough Mudder or Spartan race? Looking for a family first mud run, or a Muddy Princess or Muddy Kids event?
        These additional sites also can help you find mud races in your area:

        Even if you're rolling your eyes at these words, you might still be seeking to lighten your load and feel, well, happier, day to day. Below we offer three easily applied physical and emotional strategies from the field of positive psychology that could help you head in the right direction.
        Choose the happiness option that appeals most or seems easiest first. Try each one for a week. Then assess whether one or more of these steps increased your daily happiness quotient — and keep doing it!
        
          Get out and get active
        
        Fresh air and exercise is a powerful mood-lifting combination. Walking, biking, running, and other aerobic activities release mood-boosting hormones that can reduce stress and confer a sense of well-being.
        Also, when your muscles contract in a repetitive pattern, as they do when you are walking, swimming, or doing activities such as yoga, it bumps up levels of a brain chemical called serotonin, one of four key feel-good hormones. Higher levels of serotonin are associated with better mood. In fact, one study found that just 90 minutes a week of activity provided mood improvements similar to an antidepressant. When combined with medication, exercise can even help mood disorders that have been resistant to other treatments.
        How much movement should you strive for? Ideally, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five days a week, or a vigorous 20 minutes three times a week. But if you can't do that much, remember that some is always better than none. Even a quick 10-to-15-minute walk can elevate your mood, at least in the short term. Bonus points if you find a park or hiking trail to enjoy your walk since time spent in greenspace is a mood-booster, too.
        
          Dive into small daily pleasures
        
        Little annoyances can spoil the best day — you misplace your keys, stub your toe, or encounter a grouchy coworker. But the reverse is true as well. Studies show that taking the time to appreciate small, pleasurable moments can make you feel happier.
        So, focus on small daily events the same way you would big ones like a wedding day, the birth of a child, or a relaxing vacation. After all, it's those little moments that make up most of your life.
        Savor time spent gardening (yes, potted plants count) or sitting in a sunny window with a cup of fragrant tea. Crank up energizing music. Laugh with family or friends over a good meal. Crawl under soft blanket with a good book or podcast to enjoy. Also, celebrate tiny milestones and achievements, a project well done, or a daily goal met. Make a conscious effort to pause and enjoy small pleasures like these every day.
        
          Lighten the heavy burden of choice
        
        It may sound like a dream to have endless options, but in truth having lots of choices can generate more worry. Happiness does depend partly upon choices — after all, it would be highly stressful not to have any control over your life.
        However, research has found that people given more options have more opportunity for regret. Do you wish you'd chosen a different insurance carrier, outfit, cellphone plan, dessert? Would another selection have been better? This is why people who run meditation or spiritual retreats often limit selections. Not having to make numerous decisions all day long can be freeing.
        A simple exercise can help you ease the choice burden. Decide that if a decision won't bring major consequences, you'll limit the amount of time you give yourself to pick, or you'll give yourself fewer options. Don't allow yourself to second-guess the decision once it's made. Save the heavy deliberations for bigger, more consequential issues. However, even when making these choices, try to avoid looking back.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096,How much protein do you need every day?,"Protein is essential to good health. The very origin of the word — from the Greek protos, meaning ""first"" — reflects protein's top-shelf status in human nutrition. You need it to put meat on your bones and to make hair, blood, connective tissue, antibodies, enzymes, and more. It's common for athletes and bodybuilders to wolf down extra protein to bulk up. But the message the rest of us often get is that our daily protein intake is too high.
        How much protein do I need a day?
        The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is a modest 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or 0.36 grams per pound. The RDA is the amount of a nutrient you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements. In a sense, it's the minimum amount you need to keep from getting sick — not the specific amount you are supposed to eat every day.
        To determine your daily protein intake, you can multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36, or use this online protein calculator.
        Daily protein intake for women
        For a 50-year-old woman who weighs 140 pounds woman and who is sedentary (doesn't exercise), that translates into 53 grams of protein a day.
        During pregnancy, protein needs of women go up. Experts recommend 75 to 100 grams of protein a day for the developing fetal tissue, as well as the enlarging placental,, breasts, and blood supply. You should check with your doctor on your specific protein needs.
        Protein: Is more better?
        For a relatively active adult, a daily protein intake to meet the RDA would supply as little as 10% of his or her total daily calories. In comparison, the average American consumes around 16% of his or her daily calories in the form of protein, from both plant and animal sources. But is that too much?
        For some people, there may be potential benefits of higher daily protein intake to preserve muscle mass and strength. How and when you consume protein might also influence its effectiveness. Some studies described in the summit reports suggest that protein is more effective if you space it out over the day's meals and snacks, rather than loading up at dinner like many Americans do.
        However, over the last several years, the public health message has shifted away from desired percentages of protein, fats and carbohydrates. For example, the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans emphasize the importance of eating healthier protein rich foods rather than concentrating on specific amounts of daily protein.
        For daily protein intake, think ""protein package""
        Research on how much protein is the optimal amount to eat for good health is ongoing, and is far from settled. The value of high-protein diets for weight loss or cardiovascular health, for example, remains controversial.
        Before you start ramping up your daily protein intake, there are a few important things to consider. For one, don't read ""get more protein"" as ""eat more meat."" Beef, poultry, and pork (as well as milk, cheese, and eggs) can certainly provide high-quality protein, but so can many plant foods — including whole grains, beans and other legumes, nuts, and vegetables. The table below provides some healthier sources of protein.
        It's also important to consider the protein ""package"" — the fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that invariably come along with protein. Aim for protein sources low in saturated fat and processed carbohydrates and rich in many nutrients.
        One more thing: If you increase protein, dietary arithmetic demands that you eat less of other things to keep your daily calorie intake steady. The switches you make can affect your nutrition, for better or for worse. For example, eating more protein instead of low-quality refined carbohydrates, like white bread and sweets, is a healthy choice — though how healthy the choice is also depends on the total protein package.
        ""If you are not eating much fish and you want to increase that — yes, that might improve the overall nutrient profile that would subsequently improve your health,"" says registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""But I think the data are pretty strong against significantly increasing red meat, and certainly processed meat, to get protein.""
        If weight loss is your main concern, trying a higher-protein diet is reasonable, but don't expect it to be a panacea. ""Patients come to me all the time asking if more protein will help them in weight loss,"" McManus says. ""I tell them the verdict is still out. Some studies support it, some studies don't.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ringworm-what-to-know-and-do-202306212942,Ringworm: What to know and do,"The first thing to know about ringworm is that there are no worms involved.
        This generally harmless skin infection is caused by a fungus. The fungus causes a raised rash usually shaped like a ring, almost as if a worm was curled up under the skin (but again: no worms are involved).
        The medical name for ringworm is tinea corporis.
        Are there other types of tinea infections?
        There are many different kinds of tinea skin infections, named in Latin for the part of the body they affect, such as the
        
          scalp (tinea capitis)
          groin (tinea cruris)
          feet (tinea pedis)
          body (tinea corporis).
        
        Tinea infections can look a bit different depending on what part of the body they affect, but they are usually pink or red and scaly.
        How do you get ringworm?
        Tinea infections, particularly ringworm (tinea corporis), are very common. People catch them from other infected people and also from infected animals, particularly dogs and cats. They can also spread from one part of the body to another.
        What does ringworm look like?
        It usually starts as a pink scaly patch that then spreads out into a ring. The ring (which is not necessarily perfectly round) usually spreads wider with time. It can sometimes be itchy, but most of the time doesn't cause any discomfort.
        There are other rashes that can have a ringlike shape, so it's always important to check in with your doctor, especially if the ring isn't scaly. But most ringlike rashes are tinea.
        How is ringworm treated?
        Luckily, tinea corporis and the other kinds of tinea are very treatable. Most of the time, an antifungal cream does the trick.
        When the rash is extensive (which is rare) or doesn't respond to an antifungal cream (also rare), an antifungal medication can be taken by mouth.
        As is the case with many other germs these days, there are some drug-resistant cases of tinea related to overuse of antifungal medications. But the vast majority of fungal infections go away with medication.
        What should you do if you think a family member — or a pet — has ringworm?
        If you think someone in your family has ringworm, call your doctor. The sooner you get started on treatment, the better.
        If someone in the family has been diagnosed with ringworm, make sure that others don't share clothing, towels, or sheets. Have everyone wash their hands frequently and well.
        If your pet has a scaly rash, call the vet. Vacuum the areas your pet frequents, and have everyone wash their hands after touching the pet.
        Can you prevent ringworm?
        To prevent tinea corporis and other kinds of tinea:
        
          Keep skin clean and dry.
          Change clothes (particularly socks and underwear) regularly.
          Wash your hands regularly (this helps prevent all sorts of infections).
          If your child plays contact sports, make sure they shower after practice, keep their uniform and gear clean, and don't share gear with other players.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/health-warnings-on-exercise-equipment-should-you-worry-202306192943,Health warnings on exercise equipment: Should you worry?,"There are warnings just about everywhere you look: The coffee you're about to drink is hot! Construction ahead! This product may contain peanuts!

In many cases, the reasons for these warnings are clear. But sometimes warnings raise more questions than they answer. When I was at the gym recently, these warnings on the exercise bike and treadmill were hard to miss in a bright red font:


	Obtain a medical exam before beginning any exercise program.
	Overexercise may result in serious injury or death.
	If you feel faint, dizzy, or have pain stop exercising immediately.


What exactly did the warning writers mean by ""any exercise program""? What constitutes overexercise? Does having any pain anywhere mean you should stop working out?

Finally, I wonder: might these warnings cause unnecessary worry that actually discourages people from exercising?

Is it safe to start exercising without checking with a doctor?

A doctor's approval isn't necessary for most of us. Most people can safely begin a low-intensity exercise program and slowly increase their efforts over time. Choose activities that would allow you to carry on a conversation, such as:


	using light weights that are easy for you to lift
	walking at a leisurely pace
	biking at a leisurely pace (less than 5 mph)
	stretching and balancing activities
	light housework or yard work.


If you're starting at a low fitness level, make small increases in your workout over time. For example, if you start out walking 10 minutes a day, add one minute to your walk every week or two. Once you're walking 20 minutes a day, try picking up the pace a bit.

Who should be careful about exercising?

Of course, exercise is riskier if you have certain health conditions. It makes sense to ask a health care professional to make exercise recommendations if you're concerned about your health or have any of these conditions:


	Coronary artery disease, including symptoms of angina or a previous heart attack. Exercise that's too much too soon could stress the heart and trigger a heart attack or dangerous heart rhythm. Lower-intensity workouts (such as short walks at a comfortable pace) may be preferable, at least until it's clear that you can tolerate more.
	Exercise-induced asthma. Your doctor may recommend inhaled treatment to open up airways in your lungs just before or during exercise.
	Muscle disease, such as a metabolic myopathy. Your doctor may discourage you from engaging in certain exercises, such as sprinting or long-distance running.
	Back pain. Low impact exercise, such as biking or swimming, may be a better choice for people with back pain than higher-impact options, such as jogging or basketball.


If exercise is so good for you, why the warnings?

Let's review possible reasons for certain warnings:


	Having a medical examination before starting an exercise program might uncover a condition that makes exercise risky. The best example is probably coronary artery disease, which could trigger a heart attack during intense exercise. Fortunately, sudden heart problems during exercise are relatively rare (though you might think otherwise based on TV and movies, including an episode from the Sex and the City reboot).
	Overexercise is not a well-defined medical term. But it's true that suddenly exercising at high intensity when you're not used to it might be hazardous.
	Stopping exercise if you're feeling faint or dizzy presumably refers to concerns about severe dehydration or other causes of low blood pressure.
	Warnings about pain could refer to chest pain that might be a sign of heart trouble. Or it could be a warning about a type of severe muscle damage called rhabdomyolysis (which may complicate prolonged or intense exercise).


Of course, it's also possible these warnings have little to do with your health and everything to do with lawyers! That is, the equipment manufacturers might hope these warnings will ward off lawsuits from people who suffer a medical problem while using their equipment.

Are these warnings helpful?

Probably not.

All the warnings, alerts, and cautions in our everyday lives can become background noise. Despite red letters and bold fonts, warnings like these are easily overlooked.

Nor do they add much. My guess is that most people experiencing significant dizziness or pain during a workout will stop what they're doing even without reading a warning label. And serious medical conditions arising during exercise are rather rare, so the impact of warning everyone about them is likely small.

The bottom line

Don't be overly alarmed by alerts slapped on exercise equipment. True, it's best not to drop weights on your foot or exercise way too hard or long. If you are worried about workout risks or have been advised to be especially careful about exercising, it's reasonable to talk about it with your doctor.

But that conversation isn't necessary for most people, including those with well-controlled chronic illness such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or coronary artery disease. In fact, regular exercise helps treat many illnesses.

Exercise is among the most important things you can do to improve your health. And inactivity is a generally a much bigger risk than exercising.

So, if you see warnings on the gym equipment at your next workout, keep this in mind: there are much riskier things to worry about. Like hot coffee.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","June 19, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/apple-cider-vinegar-diet-does-it-really-work-2018042513703,Apple cider vinegar for weight loss: Does it really work?,"Apple cider vinegar has been used medically for centuries. And while there are many claims of presumed health benefits of apple cider vinegar, weight loss is among the latest. The ""apple cider vinegar weight loss diet"" (sometimes called the apple cider vinegar detox) has been a trending weight loss topic for a few years. But does it work?
        What is the apple cider vinegar diet?
        Apple cider vinegar comes from apples that have been crushed, distilled, and then fermented. It can be consumed in small quantities or taken as a supplement. Its high levels of acetic acid, or perhaps other compounds, may be responsible for its supposed health benefits. Although recommendations for dosing vary, most are on the order of 1 to 2 teaspoons before or with meals.
        Does apple cider vinegar help you lose weight?
        Studies in obese rats and mice suggest that acetic acid can prevent fat deposition and improve their metabolism. The most widely quoted study of humans is a 2009 trial of 175 people who consumed a drink containing 0, 1, or 2 tablespoons of vinegar each day. After three months, those who consumed vinegar had modest weight loss (2 to 4 pounds) and lower triglyceride levels than those who drank no vinegar.
        Another small study found that vinegar consumption promoted feeling fuller after eating, but that it did so by causing nausea. Neither of these studies (and none I could find in a medical literature search) specifically studied apple cider vinegar.
        One 2018 study randomly assigned 39 study subjects to follow a restricted calorie diet with apple cider vinegar, or a restricted calorie diet without apple cider vinegar, for 12 weeks.  While both groups lost weight, the apple cider vinegar group lost more. As with many prior studies, this one was quite small and short-term.
        In all, the scientific evidence that vinegar consumption (whether of the apple cider variety or not) is a reliable, long-term means of losing excess weight is not compelling.
        Even among proponents of apple cider vinegar for weight loss or other health benefits, it's unclear when to drink apple cider vinegar (for example, whether there is particular time of day that might be best) or how much apple cider vinegar per day is ideal.
        Apple cider vinegar benefits
        For thousands of years, compounds containing vinegar have been used for their presumed healing properties. It was used to improve strength, for detoxification, as an antibiotic, and even as a treatment for scurvy.
        While no one is using apple cider vinegar as an antibiotic anymore (at least, no one should be!), apple cider vinegar might help lower blood sugar levels after a meal by changing how foods are absorbed from the gut. A number of studies suggest that vinegar might prevent spikes in blood sugar in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes by blocking starch absorption — perhaps that's a topic for another day.
        Is there a downside to the apple cider vinegar diet?
        For many natural remedies, there seems to be little risk, so a common approach is ""why not try it?"" However, for diets with high vinegar content, a few warnings are in order:
        
          Vinegar should be diluted. Its high acidity can damage tooth enamel when sipped ""straight"" — consuming it as a component of vinaigrette salad dressing is a better way.
          It has been reported to cause or worsen low potassium levels. That's particularly important for people taking medications that can lower potassium (such as common diuretics taken to treat high blood pressure).
          Vinegar can alter insulin levels. People with diabetes should be particularly cautious about a high vinegar diet.
        
        Should you try the apple cider vinegar diet for weight loss?
        If you are trying to lose weight, adding apple cider vinegar to your diet probably won't do the trick. Of course, you'd never suspect that was the case by the way it's been trending on Google health searches. But the popularity of diets frequently has little to do with actual evidence. If you read about a new diet (or other remedy) that sounds too good to be true, a healthy dose of skepticism is usually in order.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-your-heart-rate-is-telling-you,What is a normal heart rate?,"A healthy heart doesn't beat with the regularity of clockwork. It speeds up and slows down to accommodate your changing need for oxygen as your activities vary throughout the day. A ""normal"" heart rate varies from person to person. However, an unusually high resting heart rate or low maximum heart rate may signify an increased risk of heart disease or other medical condition.
        Your resting heart rate
        When you are at rest, your heart is pumping the lowest amount of blood to supply the oxygen your body's needs. Although the official normal resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, the range for most healthy adults is between 55 and 85 beats per minute.
        However, other factors can affect your resting heart rate, such as
        
          stress
          anxiety
          hormones
          medication
          physical activity level.
        
        
          
            
              
                How to take your pulse
                
                  
                
                One simple thing people can do is to check their resting heart rate. It's a fairly easy to do, and having the information can help down the road. It's a good idea to take your pulse occasionally to get a sense of what's normal for you and to identify unusual changes in rate or regularity that may warrant medical attention.
                
                  Although you may be able to feel your blood pumping in a number of places — your neck, the inside of your elbow, and even the top of your foot — your wrist is probably the most convenient and reliable place to get a good pulse.
                  Press your index and middle fingers together on your wrist, below the fat pad of your thumb.
                  Feel around lightly until you detect throbbing. If you press too hard you may suppress the pulse.
                  You can probably get a pretty accurate reading by counting the number of beats in 15 seconds and multiplying that number by four.
                
                The best time to get your resting heart rate is first thing in the morning, even before you get out of bed.
              
            
          
        
        What is a good resting heart rate?
        There is no specific good resting heart rate. Well-trained athletes can have numbers in the 40s. But a heart rate that slow for the average person would be concerning and should prompt a call to your doctor's office, especially if you felt weak, lightheaded, or short of breath.
        On the other end of the scale, a resting heart rate that is consistently above 90 beats per minute is also something your doctor should be aware of. Although it is still formally still normal, it could be a clue of something amiss, but not necessarily a serious problem.
        Your maximum heart rate
        The rate at which your heart is beating when it is working its hardest to meet your body's oxygen needs is your maximum heart rate. Your maximum heart rate plays a major role in setting your aerobic capacity — the amount of oxygen you are able to consume.
        Several large observational studies have indicated that a high aerobic capacity is associated with a lower risk of heart attack and death. And a small, controlled trial demonstrated that men and women with mild cognitive impairment who raised their aerobic capacity also improved their performance on tests of memory and reasoning.
        Similar to resting heart, your maximum heart rate also depends on multiple factors. As people age, average maximum heart rate falls. A commonly used formula to determine your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age in years.
        
          
        
        How exercise affects heart rate
        Vigorous exercise is the best way to both lower your resting heart rate and increase your maximum heart rate and aerobic capacity. Because it's impossible to maintain a maximum heart rate for more than a few minutes, physiologists have advised setting a percentage of your maximum heart rate as a target during exercise.
         If you're starting an exercise program, you may want to set your target rate at 50% of maximum, and gradually increase the intensity of your workout until you reach 70% to 80%.
        However, if you don't exercise regularly, you should check with your doctor before you set a target heart rate. Some medications — particularly beta blockers — can lower your heart rate. Your doctor can help you set realistic goals.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/irregular-sleep-patterns-linked-to-atherosclerosis,Irregular sleep patterns linked to atherosclerosis,"Go to sleep at 11 p.m. one night, and 2 a.m. the next? You may want to rethink that pattern. A study published online Feb. 15, 2023, by the Journal of the American Heart Association suggests that sleep irregularity — night-to-night variations in sleep duration and timing (when you sleep) — are linked to atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in the arteries). Researchers from Harvard and other institutions asked a diverse group of more than 2,000 people (average age 69), without any known atherosclerosis, to wear sleep trackers and keep sleep diaries for one week. Participants also underwent assessments of artery plaque and one night of sleep testing. Scientists found that people with the most variation in sleep duration (more than two hours a night in a week) and sleep timing (more than 90 minutes in a week) were more likely to have atherosclerosis, compared with people whose sleep was the most consistent. This is an observational study, and we can't make definitive conclusions about cause and effect. But we already know that other sleep problems, such as interrupted sleep and poor sleep quality, are associated with cardiovascular disease. So the connection is plausible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/coping-with-recurring-vertigo,Coping with recurring vertigo,"Attacks of vertigo can be terrifying, temporarily disabling, and dangerous — increasing the risk of falls and injuries. An attack feels like the world is spinning around you or moving in some way. ""It could feel like you are rocking on the deck of a ship, bouncing on a pogo stick, or standing in an elevator that drops a few inches,"" says Dr. Steven Rauch, medical director of the Balance and Vestibular Center at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        Vertigo flare-ups can last anywhere from minutes to months, depending on the cause. For many people, attacks of vertigo recur periodically. Fortunately, there are ways to end an episode and reduce suffering, and you may be able to prevent vertigo from coming back.
        Why it happens
        Recurring vertigo usually is caused by a disorder involving the vestibular (balance) system, which includes several tiny, fluid-filled canals — called the semicircular canals — inside your ears. There are several vestibular disorders.
        Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). In this condition, tiny crystals in the inner ear can become dislodged when you do a particular movement, such as putting your head back to use eye drops. The loose crystals then bump around inside the semicircular canals, which normally help the brain sense the position and movement of the head. The loose crystals send confusing signals to the balance center in the brain. ""The first day an episode hits, you may be woozy and dizzy all day long,"" Dr. Rauch says. ""Then, within 48 hours, vertigo happens only when you change your position — lie down, sit up, roll over, or move your head up or down. Once you stay in a new position, the crystals land in one place, and the vertigo stops.""
        Cervical vertigo. Some types of vertigo occur because of problems in the neck (the cervical part of the spine). ""Your neck muscles are part of your balance system. They send information to the brain about your alignment and movement,"" Dr. Rauch says. ""Certain problems, such as neck arthritis or a whiplash injury, can affect communication between the neck and brain, and send abnormal signals that create the illusion of motion.""
        Movements that trigger cervical vertigo are unpredictable. ""One time it might happen because you turn your head to the right. The next time it might happen because you look down to the left,"" Dr. Rauch says.
        Meniere's disease. In this condition, another small canal inside the ear becomes swollen, for uncertain reasons. It causes not only attacks of vertigo but also nausea, a sensation of fullness or ringing in the ear, and hearing loss. The attacks typically last longer than the vertigo of BPPV. ""The attacks come out of the blue and last anywhere from 20 minutes to 12 hours,"" Dr. Rauch says.
        Vestibular migraine. When you think of migraines, you think of headaches. But pain is just one aspect of migraines. Migraines disturb the way the brain processes sensory information, causing sensitivity to light, touch, sounds, or smells. ""And it turns out that about 30% of people with migraines get dizzy spells. We call that vestibular migraine. It doesn't always come with headaches, especially in women who've gone through menopause,"" Dr. Rauch says. ""If every time you get dizzy you also can't stand bright light, or sound is unbearable, that's a migraine.""
        Treatment
        Although it's relatively common to feel momentarily dizzy or unbalanced, sudden attacks of vertigo — where the world around you is moving or spinning — are much less common. When you experience true vertigo for the first time, take it as a warning. If it comes on suddenly and is accompanied by sudden difficulty with speech, weakness on one side of the body, or confusion, go to the emergency room to get checked for a stroke.
        Otherwise, see your doctor to rule out temporary causes of vertigo, such as a medication side effect. If vertigo persists, you may need to see an ear, nose, and throat doctor, who can determine if a balance-related disorder is to blame. Getting a vestibular disorder under control with medication may be the first step in treatment.
        Physical therapy
        Physical therapy tailored for balance disorders is another helpful aspect of treatment. ""We teach you to feel comfortable with movement,"" says Kathy Joy, a Massachusetts Eye and Ear physical therapist. ""A typical program can include relaxation and breathing techniques, so you don't panic when vertigo starts; exercises to help you feel more grounded in movement, such as tai chi, in which you slowly shift weight from one side of your body to the other; and soft tissue release — a form of massage — on tight areas in the neck.""
        The therapist might also show you exercises to retrain the ear to tolerate head movements. Here's one example: ""Stand up straight, feel your feet on the ground, and practice slowly turning your head to each side for a few seconds,"" Joy says. ""Repeat this five to 10 times.""
        Maneuvers for BPPV
        When BPPV strikes, a simple maneuver to reposition loose crystals in the ear can reduce or eliminate symptoms. ""There are a number of different types of maneuvers, and each one includes a series of positions done while sitting or lying down,"" Joy says. ""Of all of them, the Epley maneuver is the gold standard. Your doctor may give you a diagram to try it at home. But be careful. If you don't do it correctly, the loose crystals may wind up in the wrong place and worsen vertigo. It's best to have a clinician or physical therapist guide you through it the first time.""
        Once you're comfortable with the maneuver, you can try it at home (if your doctor says it's safe) at the first sign of vertigo. It might be helpful to watch a video about it for guidance (there are many on YouTube). Just make sure the expert in the video is a credentialed physical therapist.
        It also helps to avoid positions that trigger BPPV flare-ups, such as yoga positions that turn you upside down or put you flat on your back.
        These approaches and others aren't a guarantee that vertigo won't return. ""But they may help you avoid an episode,"" Joy says. ""And they'll help restore your equilibrium so you can get back to doing the things you love.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-best-sun-protective-clothing,The best sun-protective clothing,"Summer officially starts this month, and in addition to using a strong sunscreen when you go outside, it's a good idea to wear sun-protective clothing. That's not just any hat or long-sleeved shirt in your closet; sun-protective clothes are made of materials that effectively shield your skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays.
        Protective fabrics
        Loosely woven fabrics of summer (such as gauze and linen) do very little to keep UV radiation from reaching your skin. The best defense comes from tightly woven fabrics with high thread counts, in dark or bright colors (which absorb light). Examples include polyester, nylon, lightweight wool, or canvas.
        Many clothing manufacturers now use high-tech fabrics for sun-protective garments. High-tech fabrics offer at least as much protection as regular densely woven fabrics, and maybe more. Often these fabrics wick away moisture and dry quickly. Some are even embedded with chemicals used in sunscreens (such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide). Note, however, that such chemical protection may last for only a limited amount of wash cycles, such as 20 to 40.
        UPF protection
        You'll know for sure if clothes are sun-protective if they have an Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) rating on the label. That's a measure of how much UV radiation penetrates the fabric.
        ""Look for a UPF rating of 50, which should block about 98% of the sun's rays. It's comparable to sunscreen with a sun protection factor [SPF] of 30, so wearing the clothes is consistent with actually putting sunscreen on,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Can you skip sunscreen if you're wearing UPF-rated clothes? ""Yes, but only for areas covered by the clothes,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""Any exposed skin still needs sunscreen, such as your neck, ears, hands, and feet.""
        And keep in mind that all clothes, UPF-rated or not, provide less UV protection when they get wet or if they're stretched and light can peek between the fibers. ""So make sure clothing fits loosely. And it's not a bad idea to wear a waterproof sunscreen beneath sun-protective clothes if you know you'll be perspiring a lot or going into water,"" Dr. Waldman says.
        Options and costs
        If you're looking to buy UPF-rated clothing, you'll find a wide range of options to shield every inch of your skin, including hats, scarves, gloves, face masks, neck gaiters, shirts, hoodies, dresses, skirts, shorts, pants, leggings, shawls, swimwear, unitards, and more.
        Which items do you really need? ""The more skin you cover, the better, especially if you're doing yard work or going to the beach,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""A hat, long-sleeved shirt, and pants are preferable. That can be a challenge on a really hot day, so make sure the fabric feels breathable and has moisture-wicking properties.""
        UPF-rated clothing can be pricey. A man's long-sleeved tee from some of the largest retailers (such as Coolibar Sun Protective Clothing, Columbia Sportswear Company, Lands' End, or L.L. Bean) goes for about $50. Brimmed hats for men and women also start at about $50.
        To save some money, Dr. Waldman recommends using a laundry aid that adds sun-protective chemicals to densely woven clothes you already own (dry-fit nylon or polyester-blend tees are good candidates). The laundry aid is called Rit SunGuard, and it can give clothes a UPF of 30. ""It's a powder. You just throw it in with normal washing, and it lasts for 20 washes. The clothes look the same,"" Dr. Waldman says.
        A word about hats
        You need a hat that protects more than just the crown of your head from UV rays, and that means you need a wide brim. ""A lot of people fall short by using a baseball cap. But it doesn't cover the ears, the chin, or the back of the neck. So get as wide a brim as possible, at least three inches,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""If you're not wearing a hat with a wide brim, apply sunscreen on exposed areas. And that goes for when you wear bike helmets, too. They have slits that allow for sunburns.""
        A hat's materials and construction are also important considerations. ""You don't want a lot of mesh or large holes in the hat, because UV rays can reach your skin. The best material would be canvas, polyester, or nylon. They'll provide more protection than a straw hat,"" Dr. Waldman says.
        Remember why you're doing this
        Taking the time to wear protective clothes outside has a big payoff for your skin. ""Even one sunburn can result in skin cancer in a few years,"" Dr. Waldman says. ""If you can cover up and avoid burning now, you'll be better off later.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/try-this-build-better-biceps,Try this: Build better biceps,"As a kid, showing muscle meant flexing your biceps. This ""mirror muscle"" (what man hasn't checked out his biceps in the bathroom?) is still important as you age. Strong biceps help with lifting, holding, and carrying heavy objects.
        The old-school curl is still the best exercise for building biceps. Use a pair of light dumbbells (about 10 pounds each). You also can use soup cans, full plastic water bottles, or any other easy-to-hold item that feels like an appropriate weight.
        Include biceps curls with your regular workouts, or do them on their own a few days per week. (And remember to check your progress in the mirror.)
        Starting position: Stand tall with your feet about shoulder-width apart, chest lifted, and shoulders back and down. Hold dumbbells down at your sides with your palms facing inward.
        Movement: Keeping your elbow close to your side, slowly bend one arm and bring the dumbbell toward your shoulder. As you lift, rotate your forearm, so your palm faces up. Hold at the top. Slowly lower the dumbbell, straightening and rotating your arm back to the starting position. That's one rep.
        Follow a 4–2–4 tempo, meaning you take four seconds to lift the weight, pause for two seconds at the top, and then take four seconds to lower.
        Do eight to 12 reps with one arm and repeat the movement with the other arm. This completes one set. Rest for 30 to 90 seconds and do another set.
        To make the curl easier, sit in a chair or use lighter weights. If the last few reps are easy, increase the weight.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/walking-advice-from-a-master-walker,Walking advice from a master walker,"Dr. Alan Poisner, 88, was a latecomer to the world of competitive walking. He took up racewalking at age 50, and over the past 38 years has become one of the country's most decorated master-level walkers. He has won five gold medals representing the United States in international competitions and has competed in 14 National Senior Games, where he holds several records. A medical researcher, Dr. Poisner also has a long career exploring the physiology of walking, especially among older adults.
        It's safe to say, Dr. Poisner walks the walk. So, we asked him to share his advice and wisdom about walking for health and fitness — from beginning a routine, to staying motivated, to elevating your workouts. Here are his suggestions.
        Choose a time. Like other new health habits, it's best to set aside a specific time and day(s) of the week to walk for fun or fitness. ""Some prefer mornings to free up later hours, but I enjoy the afternoon, when my body has been warmed up by usual routine activities. Whatever you choose, you do not need to be obsessive. Make it part of your daily activity. You'll be surprised how much you miss walking if you have to skip a regular session.""
        Vary your settings. Dr. Poisner likes different locations depending on his workout goal. ""For pleasure walks, I enjoy non-urban trail-like settings to experience new areas. For structured workouts, I often use a treadmill or an indoor or outdoor track that helps me better measure distance and pace.""
        Shake it up. Walks measured by time (20 to 30 minutes) or distance (1 to 2 miles) are ideal for most beginners, but you can eventually add structured workouts. Two of Dr. Poisner's favorite workouts are intervals and ladders.
        For intervals, you first walk at a comfortable pace. Then, for a short period (for example, 30 seconds to two minutes) walk at a faster pace, where your breathing is a bit labored but you can still talk. Then slow to a comfortable pace to let your heart rate recover. Repeat the pattern of fast pace and recovery for 10 to 15 minutes.
        For ladders, you begin walking at an easily maintained pace for a few minutes. Then, gradually increase the pace every one to two minutes until you reach a pace that is difficult to maintain. You then gradually slow the pace back to your starting speed. ""This is most easily done on a treadmill, but it can also be done outside by monitoring your pace with a fitness watch or your breathing."" (You can find more sample workouts for all levels at www.racewalking.org and www.racewalk.com.)
        Hydrate. Approach walking as any other cardio activity, and take in enough fluid. ""I hydrate before and after walking. If the walk is an hour or more, I carry a water bottle and drink regularly.""
        Take it slow. When beginning a walking program, don't be in a rush to increase speed or distance, which can lead to injury. ""Focus on weekly, incremental increases in duration and intensity.""
        Join a group. There is often strength in numbers. ""Walk on your own, but try to enlist some companions or join a local walking club to make it easier to maintain the discipline of daily walking.""
        Sign up for a race. ""I entered many road races with no competitive walking division over the years. I did it just for the camaraderie, the chance to exercise, and often to support a charitable cause."" To begin, look for races offering 5K (3.1 miles) or 1-mile ""fun run"" categories.
        Get swinging. Walking can be a full-body workout if you engage your arms while you walk. ""I focus on swinging my arms in a natural form so that the motion and location of my arms is the most efficient.""
        Have fun. ""I tell new walkers that there are two rules: don't hurt yourself, and have fun. If walkers follow these rules, they will enjoy this activity for many years.""

A new study by Harvard researchers suggests that one in five people with cardiovascular disease or diabetes declines to take a recommended statin drug.
        The study, which spanned 19 years, included more than 24,000 people who had suffered a stroke or had heart disease, vascular disease, diabetes, or very high cholesterol. Over all, about two-thirds of people advised to take statins eventually started them, but the other third never did. Over the entire course of the study, women were more likely than men to never start a statin.
        Published in the February 2023 issue of JAMA Network Open, the study also found harmful LDL cholesterol levels were higher in people who declined to take statins, thereby further increasing their risk of cardiovascular disease. The study authors are planning additional research to understand the reasons behind ""statin refusal.""

        The Harvard-led study, published online Feb. 6, 2023, by JAMA Internal Medicine, analyzed data from more than 32,000 women in the Nurses' Health Study II. They reported information about their lifestyle in 2015 and 2017 as well as their COVID-19 status from April 2020 through November 2021. More than 1,900 participants were infected with the virus during that time, and 44% of those developed long COVID, with symptoms persisting beyond four weeks after the initial infection.
        Women who practiced five or six of a list of healthy lifestyle habits — including weight control, not smoking, regular exercise, adequate sleep, high-quality diet, and moderate alcohol consumption — were 49% less likely to develop long COVID compared with women who practiced none. Of the six lifestyle factors, healthy body weight and adequate sleep (defined as seven to nine hours nightly) were most strongly linked with lower risk.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-is-my-heart-rate-high,Why is my heart rate high?,"Q.
          As expected, my heart rate rises when I exercise. But sometimes it seems elevated for no apparent reason. Why might this happen?
        
        A. When at rest, the average adult's heart beats between 60 and 100 times each minute. Your heart can speed up for many different reasons — including, as you've noted, physical activity. Other triggers are also temporary, such as stress, smoking, or caffeine or alcohol use. Certain medications, including those that treat colds, asthma, mood disorders, and high blood pressure, can also elevate your heart rate.
        But a higher-than-normal heart rate can also result from a serious health condition such as anemia, overactive thyroid, or heart disease. Seek immediate medical care if your heart rate seems high and you're also short of breath, dizzy, lightheaded, or weak, or if you have chest pain. In the absence of urgent symptoms, make an appointment to talk to your doctor about what else might be contributing to a higher heart rate.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/managing-stress-and-eating-leafy-vegetables-may-protect-the-brain,Managing stress and eating leafy vegetables may protect the brain,"Scientists continue to examine what causes people's brain health to decline. While natural aging and genetics are part of the equation, lifestyle factors can play a significant role. Two recent studies further explored this connection by looking at how stress and diet might affect cognitive function and protect against Alzheimer's disease.
        One study found that perceived stress — the degree of stress people feel about their life — was linked to poor cognitive health among older adults. Researchers recruited more than 24,000 people (average age 64). They measured stress and cognitive function with the Perceived Stress Scale and the Mini-Mental State Examination. The results showed that people who scored highest on the stress level scale were more likely to have low cognitive test scores. The reverse was also true — lower stress levels went hand in hand with higher test scores. The results were published online March 7, 2023, by JAMA Network Open.
        In another study, published online March 8, 2023, by Neurology, researchers explored whether certain dietary habits may lower the risk of Alzheimer's. The researchers analyzed data on 581 people from the Rush Memory and Aging Project cohort, a prospective study of older adults who agreed to undergo annual evaluations and to donate their brain at death. Participants reported on their dietary habits and completed annual food questionnaires.
        The researchers found that people who regularly followed plant-based diets had lower amounts of beta-amyloid buildup in their brains, a marker for Alzheimer's. Among this group, people with the highest intake of green leafy vegetables — seven or more weekly servings — had less buildup than those who ate only one or two servings a week.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-to-get-rid-of-warts,How to get rid of warts,"Warts are generally harmless and often disappear on their own over time, but they're unsightly. And some, like those found on the soles of the feet, can make walking and exercise painful. Wart removal can be a challenge, but fortunately, the most effective treatments are the least invasive.

        What do warts look like?
        Warts grow in the epidermis, the upper skin layer. A typical wart has a raised, rough surface. (Some, like those on the face, may be smooth and flat.) The center of a wart may be flecked with dark dots; these are capillaries that supply it with blood.
        What causes skin warts
        Warts occur when skin cells grow faster than normal because they are infected with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Among the 150 strains of HPV, about 10 cause cutaneous (skin) warts, including common, plantar, and flat warts (see ""Common types of skin warts,"" below).
        All of us come into contact with HPV repeatedly — when we shake hands or touch a doorknob, for example — but only some of us develop warts, and that's hard to explain. Children and people with immune system abnormalities are particularly vulnerable. For reasons that aren't entirely clear, so are people in certain occupations, such as meat, fish, and poultry handlers. But the most likely explanation is that some people are simply more prone to warts than others.
        Certain other HPV strains cause genital and anal warts. They are transmitted through sexual contact. Some specific types of HPV can cause cellular changes in the cervix and anus that can become cancerous. But the HPV strains that cause skin warts have rarely been linked to skin cancer.

        How to treat skin warts
        Studies indicate that about half of warts go away on their own within a year, and two-thirds within two years, so ""watchful waiting"" is definitely an option for new warts. But some experts recommend immediate treatment to reduce the amount of virus shed into nearby tissue and possibly lower the risk of recurrence. If you prefer not to wait it out, you have several treatment options:
        At-home remedies for treating skin warts
        
          
            Salicylic acid
          
        
        
          You can treat warts at home by applying salicylic acid, available without a prescription.
          Concentrations range from 17% to 40% (stronger concentrations should be used only for warts on thicker skin).
          Before applying the salicylic acid, be sure to soak the wart in warm water.
          File away the dead warty skin with an emery board or pumice stone, and apply the salicylic acid.
          Repeat the process daily or even twice a day.
          Salicylic acid is rarely painful. If the wart or the skin around the wart starts to feel sore, you should stop treatment for a short time.
          It can take many weeks of treatment to have good results, even when you do not stop treatment.
          Continuing treatment for a week or two after the wart goes away may help prevent recurrence.
        
        
          Duct tape
        
        
          Low-risk, low-tech approach.
          You can leave the duct tape on overnight for about one month or until the wart is gone.
          Alternatively, keep the duct tape on for five to seven days, then remove it. You may need to repeat the cycle.
          Some studies suggest that silver duct tape works better because it is stickier.
          Why duct tape works isn't clear — it may deprive the wart of oxygen, or perhaps dead skin and viral particles are removed along with the tape.
          Some people apply salicylic acid before covering the wart with duct tape. But be very careful to only apply the salicylic acid on the wart itself and let if fully dry before putting tape over it.
        
        In-office treatments for skin warts
        
          Freezing
        
        
          Also called cryotherapy.
          A clinician swabs or sprays liquid nitrogen onto the wart and a small surrounding area. The extreme cold (which may be as low as –321 F) burns the skin, causing pain, redness, and usually a blister.
          Getting rid of the wart this way usually takes three or four treatments, one every two to three weeks; any more than that probably won't help.
          After the skin has healed, apply salicylic acid to encourage more skin to peel off.
          Some individual trials have found salicylic acid and cryotherapy to be equally effective, with cure rates of 50% to 70%, but there is some evidence that cryotherapy is particularly effective for hand warts.
        
        
          Other agents
        
        
          Warts that don't respond to standard therapies may be treated with prescription drugs.
          The topical immunotherapy drug imiquimod (Aldara) may be used to treat skin warts. Imiquimod is thought to work by causing an allergic response and irritation at the site of the wart.
          In an approach called intralesional immunotherapy, the wart is injected with a skin-test antigen (such as for mumps or Candida) in people who have demonstrated an immune response to the antigen.
          Other agents that may be used to treat recalcitrant warts are the chemotherapy drugs fluorouracil (5-FU), applied as a cream; and bleomycin, which is injected into the wart.
          All these treatments have side effects, and the evidence for their effectiveness is limited.
        
        
          Zapping and cutting
        
        
          The technical name for this treatment is electrodesiccation (or cautery) and curettage.
          Using local anesthesia, the clinician dries the wart with an electric needle and scrapes it away with a scooplike instrument called a curette.
          This usually causes scarring (so does removing the wart with a scalpel, another option).
          It's usually reserved for warts that don't respond to other treatments and should generally be avoided on the soles of the feet.
        
        Ask your dermatologist if you are unsure about the best way to treat a wart.
        Frequently asked questions
        How do warts go away naturally?
        The body's immune system fights the viruses that cause warts. Over time, the warts disappear on their own. Studies have found that warts in children and teenagers disappeared after one year in half of the cases. However, the amount of time it takes for warts to go away depends on the type of the virus, the type of wart, and the health of the person.
        Are warts contagious?
        Skin warts aren't highly contagious. They can spread from person to person by direct contact, mainly through breaks in the skin. Theoretically, you can also pick up warts from surfaces such as locker room floors or showers, but there's no way to know how often this occurs.
        Warts on one part of the body can be spread to other areas, so it's important to wash your hands and anything that touches your warts, such as nail files or pumice stones.
        A wart virus infection is different from a bacterial infection such as strep throat, which can be caught, treated, and eradicated because it progresses in a distinct, reliable pattern. The ways of warts are much less predictable.
        The wart virus resides in the upper layer of the skin, and who knows where or when you picked it up? The virus could have been there for years. Then it makes a wart for reasons we don't understand. And when the wart goes away, you can still find the virus in the epidermis.
        When to see your clinician
        Some skin cancers resemble warts at first. If you have a wart that doesn't change much in size, color, or shape, you probably don't need to see a clinician. But if you're in your 50s and develop new warts, consult a dermatologist. Be suspicious of any wart that bleeds or grows quickly.",Unknown,"May 24, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/exercise-an-effective-prescription-for-joint-pain,Exercise: An effective prescription for joint pain,"Joint pain can rob you of life's simple pleasures—you may no longer look forward to walking your dog, gardening, or chasing a tennis ball across the court. Even the basics of getting through your day, like getting into the car or carrying laundry to the basement, can become sharp reminders of your limitations.
        Keep on moving
        It is tempting to avoid the motions that cause you pain. But limiting your movements can weaken muscles and make compound joint trouble worse.
        And actually movement— in the form of the right exercises performed properly —can be a long-lasting way to subdue ankle, knee, hip, or shoulder pain. For some people, the right exercise routine can even help delay or sidestep surgery.
        Your goal should be to pair gentle, targeted joint workouts with a simple walking routine. Your doctor should advise you before you begin a new exercise program.
        Simple stretching tips
        If you start targeted joint exercises, these simple stretching tips are important to any workout:
        
          Warm up first. Muscles stretch more easily when warm. Try doing warm-ups before a workout, or take a warm shower or bath first.
          Feel no pain. Stretch only to the point of mild tension, never to the point of pain. If a stretch hurts, stop doing it. Reset your position carefully and try again. With time and practice, your flexibility will improve.
          Breathe. Breathe comfortably when stretching.
          Practice often. You'll see the best gains if you do gentle stretching frequently—several times a day on as many days of the week as possible.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/9-ways-to-relieve-acid-reflux-without-medication,9 at-home treatments for acid reflux,"If you are sounding a little hoarse and have a sore throat, you may be bracing for a cold or a bout of the flu. But if you've had these symptoms for a while, they might be caused not by a virus but by a valve — your lower esophageal sphincter.
        That's the muscle that controls the passage between the esophagus and stomach, and when it doesn't close completely, stomach acid and food flow back into the esophagus. The medical term for this process is gastroesophageal reflux; the backward flow of acid is called acid reflux. Acid reflux can cause sore throats and hoarseness, and may literally leave a bad taste in your mouth.
        What is GERD?
        When acid reflux produces chronic symptoms, it is known as gastroesophageal reflux disorder, or GERD. Symptoms of GERD can include:
        
          heartburn — pain in the upper abdomen and chest — is the most common symptom of GERD
          regurgitation, or stomach contents coming back up through your esophagus and into your throat or mouth, which may cause you to taste food or stomach acid
          chest pain
          nausea
          problems swallowing or pain while swallowing
          symptoms of complications in the mouth, throat, or lungs, such as chronic cough or hoarseness.
        
        Three conditions — poor clearance of food or acid from the esophagus, too much acid in the stomach, and delayed stomach emptying — contribute to acid reflux.
        If not treated, GERD can lead to more serious health problems. In some cases, you might need medicines or surgery. However, many people can improve their symptoms of GERD through self-care and lifestyle changes.
        How to get rid of acid reflux
        If you've been having repeated episodes of heartburn — or any other symptoms of acid reflux — you might try the following:
        1. Eat sparingly and slowly
        When the stomach is very full, there can be more reflux into the esophagus. If it fits into your schedule, you may want to try what is sometimes called ""grazing"" — eating small meals more frequently rather than three large meals daily.
        2. Avoid certain foods
        People with acid reflux were once instructed to eliminate all but the blandest foods from their diets. But that's no longer the case. We've evolved from the days when you couldn't eat anything.
        But there are still some foods that are more likely than others to trigger reflux, including:
        
          mint
          fatty foods
          spicy food
          tomatoes
          onions
          garlic
          coffee
          tea
          chocolate
          alcohol.
        
        If you eat any of these foods regularly, you might try eliminating them to see if doing so controls your reflux, and then try adding them back one by one. 
        3. Don't drink carbonated beverages
        They make you burp, which sends acid into the esophagus. Drink flat water instead of sparkling water.
        4. Stay up after eating
        When you're standing, or even sitting, gravity alone helps keeps acid in the stomach, where it belongs. Finish eating three hours before you go to bed. This means no naps right after lunch, and no late suppers or midnight snacks.
        5. Don't move too fast
        Avoid vigorous exercise for a couple of hours after eating. An after-dinner stroll is fine, but a more strenuous workout, especially if it involves bending over, can send acid into your esophagus.
        6. Sleep on an incline
        Ideally, your head should be six to eight inches higher than your feet. You can achieve this by using extra-tall bed risers on the legs supporting the head of your bed. If your sleeping partner objects to this change, try using a foam wedge support for your upper body. Don't try to create a wedge by stacking pillows. They won't provide the uniform support you need.
        7. Lose weight if it's advised
        Increased weight spreads the muscular structure that supports the lower esophageal sphincter, decreasing the pressure that holds the sphincter closed. This leads to reflux and heartburn.
        8. If you smoke, quit
        Nicotine may relax the lower esophageal sphincter.
        9. Check your medications
        Some — including postmenopausal estrogen, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-inflammatory painkillers — can relax the sphincter, while others — particularly bisphosphonates like alendronate (Fosamax), ibandronate (Boniva), or risedronate (Actonel), which are taken to increase bone density — can irritate the esophagus.",Unknown,"May 22, 2023",1

        High triglycerides
        Your body needs some triglycerides. However, high triglycerides in your blood is linked to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke.
        Until recently, triglycerides tended to get less attention when looking at cardiovascular risk compared to LDL and HDL cholesterol levels. There's no question that extremely high levels (1,000 mg/dL or more) spell trouble and can lead to acute pancreatitis.
        What level of triglycerides is dangerous?
        But what about treating lower levels of triglycerides? Recent evidence suggests you should work to reduce triglyceride levels if they are higher than normal, especially if you have heart disease or have other risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure or smoking.

        Triglycerides can be one of the signs of metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk for having a heart attack or stroke.
        People with metabolic syndrome are several times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. The risk of eventually developing diabetes is even greater.
        A syndrome is, by definition, a group of signs and symptoms that occur together because of an underlying condition. For metabolic syndrome, that group includes abdominal obesity (as measured by waistline), high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low HDL cholesterol — and, yes, high triglyceride levels.
        Triglycerides and HDL
        Triglycerides and HDL are metabolically connected and are often inversely related: As triglycerides go up, HDL tends to go down — and vice versa. But that isn't always so. People can have ""isolated"" high triglycerides without low HDL levels, and research is now showing that high triglycerides are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, no matter what the HDL is.
        What causes high triglyceride levels?
        Factors that can raise your triglyceride level include:
        
          Being overweight or having obesity
          Diabetes
          Cigarette smoking
          Excessive alcohol use
          Certain medicines
          An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
          Some genetic disorders
        
        How to lower high triglyceride levels
        Many of the steps you should take to lower triglycerides are the same ones you should take to protect your heart and health overall. Your doctor will advise you of measures you can take to lower high triglycerides. Some of these steps may include:
        
          Exercise regularly
          Lose weight
          Avoid sugar/refined carbs
          Limit alcohol intake
          Quit smoking
          Get enough sleep
          Manage stress levels.
        
        How to lower triglyceride levels with medication
        If you're taking a statin to lower your LDL, one side benefit may be reduced triglyceride levels. Depending on the dose, statins can lower triglycerides by 20%–40%.
        The omega-3 fats in fish and fish oil capsules are another triglyceride-lowering option. For a very high triglyceride level, your doctor can prescribe a high-dose omega-3 medication.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/swimming-and-skin-what-to-know-if-a-child-has-eczema-202305152935,Swimming and skin: What to know if a child has eczema,"Swimming is a great activity for children. It's good exercise, it's an important safety skill, and it can be a good way to get outside and get some fresh air and sunshine.
        But for children with eczema — also known as atopic dermatitis — swimming can be complicated. Here's how parents can help.
        What is eczema?
        Eczema is an allergic condition of the skin. It can be triggered by allergies to things in the environment, like pollen or cats, as well as by allergies to food. It can also be triggered when chemicals or other things irritate the skin, or when the skin loses moisture, or by excessive sweating.
        Swimming and sun may be helpful for eczema
        Swimming in a chlorinated pool can actually be helpful for eczema. Bleach baths, which are a commonly recommended eczema treatment, essentially make the bathtub like a swimming pool.
        It also can be good for eczema to get some sun and be in the water. The trick is to optimize the benefits while preventing the possible problems.
        What to do before and after swimming when a child has eczema
        Here are some suggestions for parents:
        
          If you'll be outside, make sure you use sunscreen, preferably one with zinc oxide or titanium. Look for formulations for sensitive skin and avoid anything with fragrance. Consider using UV-protectant swimwear or shirts, especially if embarrassment about rashes is a problem.
          Put on an emollient before swimming, especially in a chlorinated pool. A good grease-up before swimming can protect the skin. Don't overdo it on the palms or soles; you want your child to be able to hold on to things, and you don't want them to slip and fall. Talk to your doctor about the best emollient for your child.
          If you are swimming in a pool for the first time, you might want to try a briefer swim than usual to be sure the chemicals aren't too irritating. If possible, avoid going in a pool right after chlorine has been added.
          Plan to change and shower right after swimming, using a mild soap or body wash without fragrance. Dab the skin dry with a clean towel (don't use the one you used while swimming) and reapply emollient.
          Look for silicone-lined swim caps and goggles, as they may be less irritating than rubber or other plastics. Be sure to rinse all swim gear after use.
          If your child's eczema is very inflamed, or is infected, it might be best to avoid swimming until it is better — or at least to get your doctor's advice.
        
        What else should you consider?
        Be aware that some children and teens with eczema are embarrassed by it and don't like to wear bathing suits that show a lot of skin. Follow your child's lead on this.
        If your child has frequent flares of eczema, or severe eczema, talk to your doctor about whether using regular topical steroids might help — and whether you should use them before swimming. If you are headed on a vacation where your child will be swimming often, or just headed into a time of year with lots of possible swimming, talk to your doctor about the best strategies to keep your child's skin healthy.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-useful-is-the-body-mass-index-bmi-201603302500,How useful is the body mass index (BMI)?,"Do you know your BMI? Increasingly, people know theirs, just as they know their cholesterol level.
        If you don't know your BMI, you can use a BMI calculator available online, including this one at Harvard Health Publishing. All you need is your height and weight. Or, you can calculate it yourself, using this formula:
        BMI = (weight in pounds x 703) / (height in inches x height in inches).
        So, now that you know your BMI, is it worth knowing? What are you going to do with it?
        What your BMI means
        To understand what your BMI means, it's useful to take a step back and understand what it's measuring and why it's measured.
        BMI is a calculation of your size that takes into account your height and weight. A number of years ago, I remember using charts that asked you to find your height along the left side and then slide your finger to the right to see your ""ideal weight"" from choices listed under small, medium, or large ""frame"" sizes.
        These charts came from actuarial statistics, calculations that life insurance companies use to determine your likelihood of reaching an advanced age based on data from thousands of people. These charts were cumbersome to use, and it was never clear how one was to decide a person's ""frame size.""
        BMI does something similar: it expresses the relationship between your height and weight as a single number that is not dependent on frame size. Although the origin of the BMI is over 200 years old, it is fairly new as a measure of health.
        What's a normal BMI?
        A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 25; a person with a BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight; and a person with a BMI over 30 is considered obese. A person is considered underweight if the BMI is less than 18.5.
        As with most measures of health, BMI is not a perfect test. For example, results can be thrown off by pregnancy or high muscle mass, and it may not be a good measure of health for children or the elderly. So then, why does BMI matter? In general, the higher your BMI, the higher the risk of developing a range of conditions linked with excess weight, including
        
          diabetes
          arthritis
          liver disease
          several types of cancer (such as those of the breast, colon, and prostate)
          high blood pressure (hypertension)
          high cholesterol
          sleep apnea.
        
        According to the WHO, nearly three million people die yearly worldwide due to being overweight or obese. In addition, independent of any particular disease, people with high BMIs often report feeling better, both physically and psychologically, once they lose excess weight.
        Should we stop giving so much ""weight"" to BMI?
        Maybe. Research suggests that BMI alone frequently misclassifies metabolic health, which is linked to how much fat a person has and how it is distributed. And, BMI may be particularly unreliable during pregnancy, for athletes, and the elderly.
        Actually, this should come as no surprise. BMI, as a single measure, would not be expected to identify cardiovascular health or illness; the same is true for cholesterol, blood sugar, or blood pressure as a single measure. And while cardiovascular health is important, it's not the only measure of health! For example, the study mentioned above did not consider conditions that might also be relevant to an individual with an elevated BMI, such as liver disease or arthritis. In addition, BMI may be more useful at predicting future rather than current health. Those who are healthy and overweight or obese are more likely to develop diabetes or other negative health consequences over time, according to studies such as this one and this one.
        And there's another problem: current BMI definitions of overweight or obesity were based largely on white populations. Yet body composition, including percent body fat or amount of muscle mass, can vary by race and ethnic group. So, BMI may help predict health status among people who are white, but may be less accurate for people in other racial and ethnic groups.
        For example, defining obesity by standard measures of BMI tends to overestimate risk in Black individuals and underestimate it for those of Asian descent. This may lead to suboptimal counseling and treatment, and may ultimately increase healthcare disparities. The World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health recommend different BMI cutoffs for overweight and obesity in people of Asian descent. Changes are being recommended for BMI cutoffs for other ethnic groups as well.
        The bottom line
        As a single measure, BMI is clearly not a perfect measure of health. But it's still a useful starting point for important conditions that become more likely when a person is overweight or obese. In my view, it's a good idea to know your BMI. But it's also important to recognize its limitations.

I'm now uneasy about taking this amount and plan to cut back to 1,000 mg daily. Is this the right vitamin C dose? Will my body be startled by the abrupt change?
        A. Cutting back on daily vitamin C is a wise decision. You've been taking much more vitamin C than you need.
        Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, plays a role in many vital functions, including metabolism and immunity. We can't make vitamin C in the body, so we need to get it from dietary sources. It's found in high concentrations in many fresh fruits and vegetables (see the chart); it's also available in most multivitamins and as a single-ingredient supplement.

        In large population studies, people who eat lots of fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C appear to have a reduced risk for various types of cancer, including cancers of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, colon, and lung. But it's not clear that these benefits come specifically from vitamin C. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study found that a combination of vitamins, including vitamin C, helped slow the progression of macular degeneration, an age-related eye disease that causes vision loss. But we don't know what benefits, if any, are conferred by vitamin C in particular.
        Many people take vitamin C supplements in unnecessarily high doses to prevent or treat various conditions for which its effectiveness is unproved. The vitamin C supplements have variously been touted for preventing cardiovascular disease and osteoarthritis, staving off sunburn, and improving the appearance of wrinkles. None of these purported benefits have been verified in scientific studies.
        Perhaps the best-known and most widely promoted use of high-dose vitamin C is to prevent or treat the common cold. The bulk of the evidence shows that high-dose vitamin C will, at most, shorten a cold by one day. In ordinary circumstances, vitamin C appears to have no preventive value, although a few studies have reported a 50% reduced risk of developing colds among people taking vitamin C in extreme circumstances — for example, skiers, marathon runners, and soldiers working in sub-Arctic conditions.
        The recommended vitamin C dosage per day for healthy women is 75 mg per day and for men it's 90 mg per day. For adults, the tolerable upper intake level (UL) — the highest daily intake likely to pose no risks — is 2,000 mg per day.
        Vitamin C is water-soluble, so any excess is usually excreted in the urine rather than stored in the body. It's safe in almost any amount from foods, and supplements in recommended amounts are also regarded as safe for most people. In some people, very high doses can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and heartburn.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/lifestyle-changes-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-attacks,Lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of gout attacks,"Lifestyle measures, such as dietary changes, can help lower levels of uric acid, the chemical that causes gout by forming crystals that deposit in joints. However, for most people, changes in diet alone are not enough to prevent gout. To reduce uric acid levels enough to stop attacks, medication is usually needed. Still making changes in what you eat can lead to fewer gouty flares.
        In the past, doctors often handed their patients a list of foods high in purines and instructed them not to eat those foods. By itself, that hasn't been shown to be particularly helpful.
        More recently, experts have begun thinking about diet differently. Instead of trying to figure out which individual foods you should avoid, the focus is on following a healthy diet and trying to lose weight if you're overweight or obese. Just losing weight can lower uric acid levels. Drinking plenty of fluids is also helpful. It's also important to limit sweetened drinks and alcohol, as these can increase uric acid levels.
        In general, a healthy diet emphasizes plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and legumes. Whole grains are preferred over processed grains. Intake of fat, especially saturated fat (found in red meat), should be reduced. Lean sources of protein, including chicken, turkey, fish, and tofu, are better choices than beef or pork.
        Fish, which contains omega-3 fatty acids, is part of a healthy diet. But some seafood also contains high amounts of purines. People with gout don't have to steer completely clear of fish. But try to limit the amount of shellfish, sardines, and anchovies you eat, because they have the highest amounts of purines. A better choice is flaky white fish, such as cod, tilapia, or flounder.
        One pattern of healthy eating is the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. One study found that people following the DASH diet for eight weeks lowered their uric acid levels 0.25 mg/dL on average. The higher the starting uric acid level, the greater the decline.
        There are a few foods people with gout should limit as much as possible or avoid entirely. And some foods may be beneficial. For example, multiple studies have found lower uric acid levels among people who consume low-fat dairy products.
        Studies have found that vitamin C may lower uric acid levels. People with gout may be helped by adding citrus fruits and other foods rich in vitamin C (such as strawberries and peppers) to their diet. Some evidence suggests that eating cherries can reduce gout attacks and improve pain. These findings are not conclusive, but there's no harm in adding cherries to your diet.
        Remember: You aren't to blame for gout because you overdid the steak and lobster dinners or drank too much alcohol. Gout is a chronic form of arthritis caused by the effects of too much uric acid in the bloodstream. Certain factors can raise your risk of gout and contribute to triggering gout attacks. These include certain foods and alcohol. But just eliminating purine-rich foods and alcohol is not enough to prevent attacks for most people with gout. Medications are used to treat an acute attack, and you can take other medications over the long term to prevent further attacks. When it comes to diet, focus on an overall healthy eating pattern, drink plenty of fluids, and try to lose excess weight.

A randomized study published in the January 2023 issue of The Lancet Planetary Health found all of those benefits when participants grew their own produce. The trial involved about 300 people (average age 41) who wore activity monitors and took occasional surveys about their diet and health. None of them had kept a garden for at least two years. Half of the participants were given an introductory gardening course, seeds, and community garden plots to work in for one year. The other participants were told not to do any gardening for a year. Compared with non-gardeners, gardeners ate about two more grams of fiber each day (a 7% increase in their fiber intake), reported greater reductions in stress and anxiety, and did about six more minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per day (about 40 minutes per week). All of those changes are linked to better health, such as lower risks of cancer and other chronic diseases.

But few studies have looked at healthy lifestyle effects on memory in particular, and none have considered the effects on memory in people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. Now a study from China offers insight. The study, published online Jan. 25, 2023, by BMJ, involved more than 29,000 people without dementia (average age 72). Participants initially underwent cognitive testing as well as genetic testing for genes known to raise risk for Alzheimer's, and reported how well they stuck to six healthy lifestyle habits (eating a healthy diet, exercising, not smoking, not drinking alcohol, being socially active, and engaging in brain-challenging activities). Participants were followed for 10 years, periodically reporting their lifestyle habits and undergoing cognitive testing. At the end of the study, people who stuck to at least four healthy habits showed significantly slower memory decline than people who didn't practice any healthy habits. This was true even among people with Alzheimer's-related genes. The habits associated with the biggest effects were diet, cognitive activity, exercise, and social contact. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that a healthy lifestyle protected memory. But a healthy lifestyle has many health benefits, and you'll only win by improving yours.

But that walk is loaded with cardiovascular health benefits — maybe even more than you'd get from an hour of brisk walking or Nordic walking, suggests a small, randomized study published online Feb. 6, 2023, by BMJ Open Sport and Exercise Medicine. Researchers asked 25 healthy, experienced golfers (men and women ages 65 or older) to complete three different types of exercise within a five-day period (just one activity per day). The exercises included one 18-hole round of golf on foot (pulling golf clubs), one hour of brisk walking, and one hour of Nordic walking (which involves the use of poles). On exercise days, participants ate identical breakfasts and snacks; had their blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol measured before and after exercise; and wore activity trackers. All three activities lowered blood pressure and levels of blood sugar and cholesterol. But golf seemed to have slightly more effect on blood sugar and cholesterol, at least in the short term. Scientists speculate it's because of the game's long duration (three to four hours) and the extra energy required to drag heavy clubs around a golf course. In fact, golfing burned more than twice as many calories as the walking activities. Because the study was small, a larger, longer-term study would be needed to confirm the results.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/get-more-out-of-your-daily-walk,Get more out of your daily walk,"You already go for a walk every day, which is great for overall health. Regular, brisk walking helps lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, control blood pressure, strengthen muscles, burn calories, and lift mood. Walking can also help ward off high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.
        And you can get even more health benefits by adding a few simple upgrades to your daily walk.
        Improve your balance
        Your sense of balance is based in the brain. ""The brain integrates information from your inner ear organs, vision, and nerve endings and feelings in the feet, muscles, and joints, all the way up the spine,"" says Dr. Steven Rauch, medical director of the Balance and Vestibular Center at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear.
        To maintain good balance, you need to put it to work regularly. Taking a daily brisk walk is good practice. If walking is easy for you, Dr. Rauch suggests making it a little harder, to get even more practice and potentially get better at balancing. For example, during a walk you could periodically take about 10 steps walking heel-to-toe. ""The narrower your base of support when standing, the trickier it is to maintain your balance,"" Dr. Rauch says.
        Other ideas: Turn sideways and take 10 side steps. Or keep walking forward, but turn your head slowly left and then right, a few times in a row. Why? ""If you're walking in a certain direction but turn and look in a different direction, or aim your ears in a different direction, you're not giving the usual visual or auditory feedback to the brain, and it challenges your balance,"" Dr. Rauch says.
        Promote healthy bones and muscles
        The more gentle stress we place on our bones, the stronger they'll become. The reason: exerting force on the bones stimulates them to add cells, which speeds up the process of building bone mass. Weight-bearing exercise is a standard way to strengthen your bones, and walking is a weight-bearing activity. Weight lifting is also a good way to strengthen bones. You can combine the two activities for extra oomph by wearing a weighted vest on your walk.
        Get one that allows you to adjust the amount of weight you'll carry, such as a vest that has removable weights. You can find them for about $40 or more online or at sporting goods stores. How much weight should you carry in the vest? ""Start with 5 pounds. After two weeks, increase the weight to 7.5 pounds. Two weeks, later, move up to 10 pounds. But don't wear the vest if it makes it hard to walk or if you experience any pain or soreness after wearing it,"" suggests Vijay Daryanani, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        Make your heart work harder
        Walking at a brisk pace is a moderate-intensity activity that makes your heart and lungs work harder. The exertion activates changes in your muscles, metabolism, blood vessels, and brain that contribute to improved heart health.
        Your heart and lungs work even harder (and get even more benefit) with vigorous activity — the kind that makes it difficult to talk while working out, such as playing tennis or jogging. But check with your doctor before starting a program of vigorous activity.
        One way to make your heart work harder on a walk is by adding arm movements. About 10 minutes into a 30-minute walk, begin raising your arms up and down repeatedly in any way that feels comfortable — such as straight out in front of you (like a sleepwalker in old movies), above your head (like a referee signaling a touchdown), or out to the sides (like you're flying). Try to maintain the arm activity as long as possible, up to 10 minutes. Then continue your walk for another 10 minutes.
        Another way to make your heart work harder on your walk is by adding high-intensity interval training (HIIT). HIIT involves brief bouts of strenuous exercise. It's associated with equal or greater improvements in blood pressure and blood sugar compared with moderate-intensity exercise. But, again, check with your doctor.
        During a walk, that would mean periodically breaking into a run for about 30 to 60 seconds. The easier this becomes, the longer the high-intensity intervals can last. Eventually, you may be able to walk for five minutes, then run for five minutes, alternating the activities for about 30 minutes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-you-be-tested-for-sleep-apnea,Should you be tested for sleep apnea?,"Getting a good night's sleep on a regular basis is essential for cardiovascular health. That means everyone — especially people with heart problems — should address any issues that keep them from getting at least seven hours of restorative sleep every night. One common problem is obstructive sleep apnea, a condition marked by brief pauses in breathing, often triggering loud snoring, grunts, gasps, and choking noises.
        These repeated breathing disruptions cause your heart rate and blood pressure to rise, putting stress on your heart and circulation. ""Somewhere between 40% and 80% of people with cardiovascular disease may have sleep apnea,"" says Dr. Sogol Javaheri, a sleep specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Yet sleep apnea frequently goes undetected and untreated. Why?
        Often, people don't realize they are periodically gasping for air throughout the night unless a bed partner or family member notices. In addition, many people with sleep apnea (particularly those who have cardiovascular disease) don't report excessive daytime sleepiness, one of the most common symptoms of the disorder, says Dr. Javaheri. ""Some people are so accustomed to sleep deprivation that they don't realize they're sleepy,"" she says.
        Causes, risks, and other symptoms
        Sleep apnea occurs when tissue in the tongue or throat temporarily narrows or blocks the airway during sleep, sometimes as many as 100 times an hour. While people of all ages and sizes can develop sleep apnea, it's most common in older people and those who are overweight or obese, as well as people with heart problems, hard-to-control blood pressure, and diabetes.
        One way that doctors assess the likelihood of sleep apnea is with the STOPBANG questionnaire (see box). Other symptoms that may be caused by sleep apnea include nighttime restlessness; trouble with concentration or memory; mood changes; morning headaches; vivid, strange, or threatening dreams; and nighttime waking to urinate.

        Diagnosing sleep apnea
        If you think you might have sleep apnea, check with your doctor about an evaluation. If possible, start with a sleep specialist (or ask for a referral to one), as these experts are often better able to navigate insurance issues and recommend appropriate, timely testing and treatment. In the past, diagnosing sleep apnea always required an over-night stay in a sleep lab. Today, home-based tests (which are more convenient and less expensive) are the norm. They're recommended for people whose symptoms suggest they have moderate to severe sleep apnea and who have no other significant medical problems.
        For a home sleep study, you'll get a small, lightweight monitor; a belt you slip around your midsection; a small finger clip; and a sensor to place under your nose. These devices measure your oxygen saturation (the amount of oxygen in your blood), heart rate, and airflow, as well as the movements of your chest and abdomen and your position while you sleep. If you need to use the bathroom, you just take the equipment with you.
        Treating sleep apnea
        Lifestyle changes that can improve sleep apnea include
        
          losing weight if needed
          avoiding alcohol within three hours of bedtime
          not taking medications that relax your muscles in the evening
          treating nasal congestion with medications or home remedies
          sleeping on your side or elevating your head.
        
        People with moderate to severe apnea often need positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, which uses a small machine to deliver pressurized air through a mask covering your nose (and sometimes your mouth) to keep your airway open as you sleep. Even people with mild sleep apnea who feel sleepy during the day may benefit from PAP, which can help people feel more alert and rested and may also improve their mood and quality of life, says Dr. Javaheri.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/yoga-a-flexible-way-to-enhance-heart-health,Yoga: A flexible way to enhance heart health,"We tend to think of exercise as movement that either raises your heart rate (aerobic exercise) or builds muscles (strength training). But two other factors — flexibility and balance — are also important for a well-rounded fitness program, especially for older adults. A yoga practice has the potential to target all four factors at the same time. What's more, a recent study suggests that yoga has modest yet positive effects on several factors linked to cardiovascular health (see ""How yoga may help your heart"").
        ""The reason behind these benefits isn't entirely clear, but we believe that multiple, simultaneous mechanisms are probably at play,"" says Dr. Darshan Mehta, medical director of the Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. Yoga is more than simply stretching and moving into poses — it weaves together three interconnected threads: physical postures, controlled breathing, and meditation. Together, they help cultivate the relaxation response, which trains your body to be less reactive during times of stress.
        
          
            
              
                How yoga may help your heart
                To explore how yoga may affect cardiovascular health, a team of researchers pooled data from studies of yoga done over the past few decades. Their findings, reported in the May 2023 Current Problems in Cardiology, are summarized below.
                When: The analysis combined results from 64 randomized controlled trials of yoga published from 1989 to 2022. Most were done in Southeast Asia.
                Who: The analysis included nearly 17,000 people in all, roughly half of whom performed yoga. Those in control groups did other types of gentle exercise, stretching, or no exercise. Their average age was 56.
                Key findings: Compared with those in control groups, people who did yoga had systolic blood pressure values (the first number in a reading) that were 4.5 points lower and levels of harmful LDL cholesterol that were 7.6 points lower, on average. Yoga was also linked to slightly lower HbA1c levels (a measure of average blood sugar over the past few months) and a small drop in body mass index.
              
            
          
        
        How yoga helps
        The relaxation response not only slows the heart rate and lowers blood pressure, it may also tamp down inflammation and promote favorable changes in blood vessel function that protect the heart. As a mind-body practice, yoga encourages people to slow down and be more mindful about heart-healthy behaviors, such as eating well and getting enough sleep, says Dr. Mehta. Those habits — along with positive emotions that some forms of yoga aim to inspire, such as compassion and gratitude — may also help foster cardiovascular health.
        Finding your fit
        Think you can't do yoga because you aren't flexible? ""By practicing yoga, you become more flexible — that's another reason to do it,"" says clinical social worker and yoga teacher Laura Malloy, director of yoga programs at the Benson-Henry Institute. If you're new to yoga, seek out a beginner or ""gentle"" class, especially if you're over 65 or have any medical conditions. Several forms are well suited to beginners, such as Hatha yoga, which features gentle, smooth movements that are integrated with your breathing. Iyengar is similar but places more emphasis on body alignment and balance and uses props such as straps, blankets, and blocks. Yin yoga, which is done mostly sitting or lying down, encourages people to go deeper into poses by holding them longer.
        Another option is chair yoga, practiced sitting in a chair or standing using a chair for support. It's good for older people or anyone who feels less steady or has trouble getting up from the floor, says Malloy. Though gentle, chair yoga still provides results. ""After I teach a 20-minute chair yoga class, I've heard people say ""Wow, that made such a difference in how I feel!'"" says Malloy. (You can try one of her 30-minute instructional videos here: health.harvard.edu/cy.
        You can find classes at dedicated yoga studios as well as at health clubs, community or senior centers, or even hospitals. Costs range from about $15 to $20 per class. Yoga of the Heart, a form of yoga designed for specifically for people with heart disease, is taught by instructors trained and certified by Nischala Joy Devi, who developed the yoga portion of the Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease, an evidence-based, integrated lifestyle program for heart patients.

Extra-virgin olive oilDrizzle it over a salad, or use it to saut' an assortment of colorful vegetables; either way, this oil has a proven track record when it comes to your heart health. Olive oil is loaded with monounsaturated fatty acids, which can help lower your ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. Extra-virgin olive oil is also rich in antioxidants, which work in your body to prevent damage caused by unstable molecules called free radicals that can harm cells, including those that make up the walls of your arteries. When the arterial walls are damaged, it's easier for fatty deposits to stick and form blood-blocking plaques, says Fung. So, keeping them healthy should be a priority.",Unknown,"May 1, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/winning-the-skin-game,Winning the skin game,"The saying goes that the past always comes back to haunt you. Nowhere is this more apparent than with your skin. ""As you get older, the sun damage to your face and neck you experienced when you were younger shows up as dry skin, wrinkles, and age spots,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, a dermatologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        While much of this sun damage occurred in the past, you can take steps now to reverse some of it. ""Adopting a daily skin care routine is the best way to treat existing skin problems, maintain healthy skin, and protect against future harm,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        You don't need to follow an elaborate process. Keep it simple, and focus on three steps: wash, moisturize, and apply sunscreen. Then do it every day.
        Step 1: Wash
        Wash your face and neck twice a day — when you wake up and before bedtime. (You can do this once daily if your skin tends to be dry, and preferably in the evening so you sleep with clean skin.)
        ""Avoid using regular bar soap,"" says Dr. Waldman. ""It strips the skin of its outer layer and makes it harder to keep in moisture, which can lead to dry skin."" Instead, choose an over-the-counter product labeled as a gentle cleanser for sensitive skin. Avoid products that contain sulfates or are labeled ""foaming,"" as they can be drying. Also, don't use facial scrubs with small particles, which can irritate the skin.
        Massage a pea-sized amount of the cleanser onto your damp face and neck for about 20 seconds, or the amount of time it takes to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice, and then rinse with warm water. ""If you don't have oily skin, washing only with warm water also can work,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        
          
            
              
                Give your skin an A — and maybe a B
                Another way to help restore aging skin is to use a lotion or cream that contains a retinoid, a compound derived from vitamin A. Retinoids increase collagen (the most abundant protein in the body) and help strengthen skin and restore elasticity. ""Regular application can improve the appearance of wrinkles, sun spots, and overall skin texture,"" says dermatologist Dr. Abigail Waldman with Brigham and Women's Hospital.
                Choose over-the-counter anti-aging creams or lotions with retinol as the active ingredient, or get a prescription for a stronger retinoid from your doctor. Take it slow, as these products can irritate the skin if overused. Dr. Waldman suggests an every-three-day routine at first. Use a pea-sized amount over your entire face before bedtime. Retinoids make skin sensitive to light, so don't use them during the daytime. ""Monitor how your skin reacts, and look for redness, significant peeling, or irritation,"" says Dr. Waldman. ""As your skin builds tolerance, increase applications to every night.""
                Oral nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3, has protective effects against ultraviolet damage caused by sun exposure. Research has shown it can lower the risks of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma — the two most common skin cancers — in people vulnerable to skin cancer. Speak with your doctor or dermatologist about whether you are a candidate.
              
            
          
        
        Step 2: Moisturize
        After washing, while your skin is still damp, apply a moisturizing lotion or cream. (People with oily skin can skip this step.) ""Moisturizing recreates the skin's outer barrier to prevent moisture from escaping and to stop foreign substances from getting in,"" says Dr. Waldman. Use a dollop for your entire face and another for your neck, and massage in until fully absorbed.
        Choose a lotion or cream that contains fewer than 10 ingredients or is labeled for sensitive skin. ""Fewer ingredients mean fewer chemicals or additives, especially fragrances that could irritate skin,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        Key ingredients to look for include hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, glycolic acid, and squalene, which help keep skin hydrated. Vitamin C and azelaic acid can help lighten dark spots.
        Step 3: Apply sunscreen
        Finally, apply sunscreen to your face, especially under the eyes, as well as your entire neck and ears. ""Sunscreen not only guards against skin cancer and the aging effects from sun exposure but also helps to prevent brown spots and to keep existing ones from worsening,"" says Dr. Waldman.
        Use sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Avoid spray sunscreens, which contain alcohol that can burn. For efficiency, a combination moisturizing and sunscreen product also works well.
        ""The best sunscreen is the one you enjoy wearing, so experiment until you find one that has a pleasant smell and texture and is easy to apply,"" says Dr. Waldman. When you're outside for an extended period, make sure to reapply your sunscreen every two hours.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/6-natural-ways-to-lower-blood-pressure,6 natural ways to lower blood pressure,"Taking medication to lower high blood pressure is a proven way to reduce your risk for heart disease. But adopting lifestyle changes may let you maintain healthy readings and perhaps even avoid drug therapy. ""Unless a person's blood pressure is very high, medication most often does not start immediately,"" says Dr. Howard LeWine, editor in chief of Harvard Men's Health Watch. ""For people with elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension, the first order of business is to get serious about modifying their lifestyle.""
        By the numbers
        Normal blood pressure is defined as a reading of less than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Elevated pressure means systolic blood pressure (the first number in a reading) is 120 to 129 mm Hg with a diastolic pressure (the second number) of less than 80 mm Hg. People who have consistent readings of 130 to 139 for systolic pressure or 80 to 89 for diastolic pressure are said to have high blood pressure (stage 1 hypertension).
        ""But your target numbers may differ based on your health and individual goals, as determined in consultation with your doctor,"" says Dr. LeWine.
        Healthy lifestyle habits are the cornerstone of managing blood pressure, whether or not you require medication. A lifestyle approach to management also helps people feel more in control of their health.
        ""Understandable, sometimes people are reluctant to start a drug because they don't want to be dependent on medication,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""And this resistance can provide extra motivation for making the necessary changes."" Still, don't be discouraged if your doctor wants you to begin taking a low dose of medication. Once you reach your blood pressure goals, maintaining a healthy lifestyle may mean you can take a drug holiday (with your doctor's approval). ""And even if you still need medication, your healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent dose increases or additional blood pressure drugs,"" says Dr. LeWine.
        The big six
        Six lifestyle changes have the most significant influence on blood pressure, according to Dr. LeWine. They include the foundation for healthy living — diet, exercise, and weight control — as well as limiting sodium and alcohol and managing stress.
        ""While all of these are important, don't try to change them all at once,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""In consultation with your doctor, you first want to concentrate on the one or two most important modifications, based on what's likely to have the greatest impact.""
        Diet. While most experts advocate plant-based diets to help lower blood pressure numbers, a recent study found that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet may have the most significant impact. The researchers found that adopting the DASH diet could prevent an estimated 15,000 annual heart attacks and strokes among men with high blood pressure. DASH emphasizes fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, nuts, seeds, and grains and limits consumption of red meat, sodium, and sugar-sweetened foods and drinks.
        Exercise. Guidelines call for a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. A reasonable starting goal is 20 to 30 minutes every other day. Any kind of exercise is always better than nothing. But if you need motivation, join a walking club or sports league (like golf, bowling, basketball, or pickleball), hire a personal trainer, or sign up for fitness classes at a gym or community center. You can also increase your daily movements, like walking for five minutes every hour, doing two sets of five to 10 push-ups on the floor or against the kitchen counter, or 20 minutes of yoga or stretching.
        Weight. While it's natural for men's weight to increase somewhat with age, even five to 10 pounds over their ideal number can raise blood pressure. ""In fact, for overweight men, every pound lost could lower systolic blood pressure by up to 1 mm Hg,"" says Dr. LeWine. Your doctor can determine your target weight for your age and body type. Investing in a healthy diet and increasing exercise can help reduce weight.
        Sodium. ""People with high blood pressure sometimes have a significant improvement by avoiding sodium,"" says Dr. LeWine. Processed foods account for much of the sodium that people consume. These include foods like canned vegetables and soups, frozen dinners, lunch meats, instant and ready-to-eat cereals, salty chips, and other packaged snacks. Cut back on these items, or select low-sodium options.
        Alcohol. Drinking more than moderate amounts of alcohol can raise blood pressure. Guidelines says men should consume no more than two standard drinks per day, with a single drink defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits. However, cutting back on alcohol as much as possible is ideal.
        Stress. Reducing stress is also a priority. Stress can lead to chronic inflammation that damages artery walls, making them less elastic. In addition, ongoing stress can trigger the adrenal glands to release hormones that raise blood pressure. ""Uncontrolled stress often manifests as poor sleep, overeating, and physical inactivity,"" says Dr. LeWine. To manage stress, practice relaxation breathing and meditation, or perhaps just set aside time every day to do whatever you wish, even if it's nothing at all.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/sleep-apnea-may-lead-to-weaker-bones-and-teeth,Sleep apnea may lead to weaker bones and teeth,"People with sleep apnea — meaning they briefly and repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping — are more likely to have low bone density, a small new analysis suggests.
        The study, published online Nov. 11, 2022, by The Journal of Craniomandibular and Sleep Practice, used a type of imaging called cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) to measure bone density in the head and neck of 38 adults undergoing orthodontic treatment, half of whom had sleep apnea. The researchers found that participants with apnea had significantly lower bone density in the head and neck than those who didn't have the condition.
        Sleep apnea can trigger low oxygen levels and inflammation in the body, which may interfere with the continual cycle of bone breakdown and renewal, researchers said. This could ultimately lower bone density levels, increasing the risk of broken bones and causing teeth to become loose.
        Screening tests for bone density are an important part of routine care for many people, including all women 65 and older.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/junk-food-addiction-more-common-in-women,Junk food addiction more common in women,"Nearly one in five older women showed signs of addiction to highly processed foods and drinks over the past year, a higher proportion than in men, a new nationally representative poll indicates.
        The survey, part of University of Michigan's National Poll on Healthy Aging, was published online Jan. 30, 2023. It involved 2,163 people, ages 50 through 80, who were questioned online or by phone in July 2022. Participants answered 13 questions gauging addictive behaviors and thoughts related to highly processed foods such as sweets, salty snacks, sugary drinks, and fast food. These addiction indicators include intense cravings, inability to cut down on consumption, and signs of withdrawal. To meet the definition of addiction to highly processed food, participants had to report experiencing at least two of 11 symptoms, as well as significant distress or problems related to eating, at least twice a week.
        About 13% of survey respondents reported symptoms of addiction. But women were more likely than men (18% vs. 8%) to report these symptoms, especially women in the 50 to 64 age range (22%). The proportion was even higher in women who said they were overweight or their physical or mental health was fair or poor. Highly processed foods release a dopamine surge in the brain's reward system, potentially leading to addiction; indeed, survey respondents reported eating highly processed foods not only because they were hungry, but for pleasure.
        These findings are concerning because diets containing a significant amount of highly processed foods contribute to diabetes, heart disease, and even certain types of cancer.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-humble-gallbladder,The humble gallbladder,"In the hierarchy of digestive organs, you might first list the stomach, liver, or colon. But there's a pear-shaped sac tucked under your liver that barely gets a second thought: the lowly gallbladder.
        This small but mighty organ plays an important role in helping us digest food, but we often don't acknowledge it unless something goes wrong — which happens in about 15% of American adults, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Yet gallbladder disease — which includes stones, inflammation, infection, or blockage — can lead to excruciating pain or even life-threatening complications down the line.
        The gallbladder essentially serves as a storage room for bile, squeezing the fluid into the small intestine to help digest the fats we consume. It makes sense, then, that the organ might struggle when our diet is heavy in fatty or fried foods. We can live without a gallbladder, but it can't stay in peak performance mode without diligent care, says Dr. William Brugge, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        ""I think people generally try to ignore their gallbladder,"" Dr. Brugge says. ""It doesn't have as squeamish a reputation as the colon or rectum, but it's down there on the list.""
        
          
            
              
                Tactics to promote gallbladder health
                Keeping your gallbladder healthy involves a similar approach to keeping the rest of your body in optimal shape. These familiar suggestions include:
                Eat more fruits and vegetables. They're rich in nutrients such as vitamin C, folic acid, and magnesium, which may lower the risk of gallbladder disease. Fiber-filled fruits and vegetables also don't strain the gallbladder, since they contain little or no fat.
                Favor lean proteins. Opting for poultry, lean meat, and fish dishes that are baked or broiled — not fried — can lower your gallstone risk. Limit or avoid full-fat dairy products and red or processed meats.
                Maintain a healthy weight. Overweight or obesity can make you prone to gallstones.
              
            
          
        
        Risk factors
        Aside from a high-fat diet, other risk factors for gallbladder disease include overweight or obesity, a family history of gallbladder issues, Native American or Latino heritage, and being 40 or older. Women are twice as likely as men to develop gallstones, which top the list of gallbladder problems. Extra estrogen, particularly during pregnancy, slows the gallbladder's ability to empty, letting bile pool, Dr. Brugge says.
        Gallstones develop when bile or related fluids form hardened stonelike lumps that can grow and multiply. Attacks of agonizing pain result when gallstones get larger or block bile ducts. Other symptoms include pain between the shoulder blades, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, bloating, indigestion, and sweating. About a quarter of people diagnosed with gallstones each year need treatment, which is usually surgery.
        ""After eating a particularly heavy or fatty meal, you may have severe pain — far more than gas or cramps — that might last for an hour or two,"" Dr. Brugge says.
        Serious complications
        Because bile ducts connect the gallbladder to other digestive organs, these surrounding structures can also suffer complications from gallbladder disease. Problems include cholangitis (bile duct inflammation), cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), and pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
        But the most dangerous complication, Dr. Brugge says, is gallbladder inflammation called cholecystitis. It results from a gallstone getting stuck in the gallbladder, which becomes infected and causes searing pain. ""It's a pretty dramatic illness,"" he says. ""The gallbladder can rupture or leak infected bile, and the infection can spread through the body. It can be fatal.""
        New evidence suggests gallstones may also raise the risk of developing cancers of the liver, bile duct, and pancreas. A study published online June 17, 2022, by the British Journal of Cancer tracked more than 115,000 women and nearly 50,000 men for up to 30 years, asking about their history of gallstones at the study's start and every other year afterward. Compared with people without gallstones, those who got them were 60% more likely to develop liver cancer, more than four times as likely to develop bile duct cancer, and 13% more likely to develop pancreatic cancer.
        Gallbladder cancer itself is relatively rare, diagnosed in about 12,200 Americans each year. ""It's very deadly, but not very common,"" Dr. Brugge says.

          I've had a nail-biting habit for as long as I can remember. But now a new friend is telling me my nibbling could actually harm my health. Is that true?
        
        A. Your friend is correct. Think about it this way: how many things do you touch every day, whether doorknobs, money, or even your phone? Our fingertips are germ collectors even when we don't bite our nails. But this habit makes you especially vulnerable to dirt and grime that can collect in nailbeds, since nibbling leaves cuticles and skin ragged and creates tiny fissures in your skin that germs can pass through. By putting your nails into your mouth, you're carrying germs for a variety of illnesses that range from the common cold to salmonella infection. You can also develop an infection in the skin around your nails or under a nailbed itself.
        Admittedly, it's not easy to quit biting your nails, but it's important to do so. Try to find ways to occupy your mouth and hands — say, by chewing gum or drinking water, or doing needlework or drawing — so you're less tempted to nibble on your nails.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/supplements-for-three-common-conditions,Supplements for three common conditions,"Certain herbs, vitamins, minerals, and other compounds may help control cholesterol, blood pressure, and anxiety.
        
        
          
        
        High cholesterol, high blood pressure, and anxiety are three common conditions that are often treated with medication. But sometimes people can't tolerate those drugs or are reluctant to use them. In these instances, dietary supplements may be an option.
        Studies have shown that some herbs, vitamins, minerals, and other substances, alone or in combination with traditional treatments, may be effective in treating these conditions, and are largely safe to use — provided your doctor approves.
        High cholesterol
        Vitamin D3. If you cannot tolerate a statin medication and have a low vitamin D level, a vitamin D3 supplement could help. After taking the supplement, some people are then able to tolerate statins when they couldn't in the past.
        Phytosterols. Phytosterols (also called plant stanols or sterols) are derived from the cell membranes of plants and can be taken in pill form. They are also found naturally in foods such as nuts, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Studies show that phytosterol supplements can lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by up to 14% in people taking 2,000 to 3,000 milligrams (mg) a day. When choosing a product, look for a quality seal (see ""Worried about supplement safety? Here's what you should consider""), and also look for a product that contains phytosterol esters.
        Red yeast rice. Red yeast rice supplements are made from a type of yeast that is grown on white rice. Red yeast rice has long been used in Chinese medicine. But a recent study comparing red yeast rice to a low dose statin found the statin was much more effective at lowering LDL cholesterol levels. If you still decide to use it, look for a high-quality product, because red yeast rice can contain a dangerous contaminant, citrinin, which is a toxin produced by fungus that can cause food poisoning, kidney damage, and immune system problems.
        
          
            
              
                Worried about supplement safety? Here's what you should consider
                While some supplements are potentially helpful (or at least harmless), a lack of regulatory oversight of these products means that others might be ineffective or dangerous, or might contain hazardous contaminants. Identifying the safe choices requires a little detective work. Before taking a supplement, always talk to your doctor to make sure that it's safe for any medical conditions you may have and that it won't interact with any medications you are taking.
                Although supplement makers must follow FDA rules for good manufacturing practices, the agency does not require testing the estimated 9,000 products on the market to make sure they do contain the ingredients they claim, and don't contain contaminants, such as dangerous bacteria, arsenic, cadmium, or lead. This means there is no guarantee that any particular product is effective or safe. To add a degree of protection, look for products that have voluntarily gone through quality testing, which is certified by a seal on the packaging. Some good ones to look for are those from U.S. Pharmacopeia, ConsumerLab.com, and NSF International.
              
            
          
        
        High blood pressure
        Magnesium citrate or glycinate. Some people are deficient in the mineral magnesium. But blood tests aren't good at detecting total magnesium levels inside the body, because much of your body's magnesium is stored within cells. Many people find the deficiency only after a nutritionist analyzes their diet. In those individuals, supplements can boost magnesium levels and help reduce high blood pressure when taken along with traditional blood pressure treatments. It typically takes up to six weeks for the supplements to show an effect. However, not everyone should take magnesium, particularly those with kidney disease, so be certain to consult with your doctor before taking it.
        Lycopene. An antioxidant supplement that may also help reduce high blood pressure is lycopene, which gives vegetables like tomatoes their red hue. While tomato-based products, including canned sauces, contain lycopene, those foods often have a lot of sodium. So, it's better in many instances to opt for a supplement. Look for one that also contains tomato extract for an added benefit. Typically, people need to take 15 to 25 mg of lycopene daily to see a reduction in blood pressure.
        Anxiety
        Chamomile extract. This extract, which comes from a flower, has long been used as a therapy for anxiety. Anxiety often goes hand in hand with sleeplessness, so it's no surprise that chamomile is also often recommended as a sleep aid. Many people drink chamomile tea, but taking a supplement may be more convenient (and require fewer late-night trips to the bathroom if taken before bed).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-running-cause-arthritis-202304262930,Does running cause arthritis?,"When I took up running in college, a friend of mine scoffed at the idea. He hated running and was convinced runners were ""wearing out"" their joints. He liked to say he was saving his knees for his old age.
        So, was he onto something? Does running really ruin your joints, as many people believe?
        Runners can get arthritis, but is running the cause?
        You may think the answer is obvious. Surely, years of running (pounding pavements, or even softer surfaces) could wear out your joints, much like tires wear out after you put enough miles on them. And osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, usually affects older adults. In fact, it's often described as age-related and degenerative. That sounds like a wear-and-tear sort of situation, right?
        Maybe not. Sure, it's easy to blame running when a person who runs regularly develops arthritis. But that blame may be misguided. The questions to ask are:
        
          Does running damage the joints and lead to arthritis?
          Does arthritis develop first and become more noticeable while running?
          Is the connection more complicated? Perhaps there's no connection between running and arthritis for most people. But maybe those destined to develop arthritis (due to their genes, for example) get it sooner if they take up running.
        
        Extensive research over the last several decades has investigated these questions. While the answers are still not entirely clear, we're moving closer.
        What is the relationship between running and arthritis?
        Mounting evidence suggests that that running does not cause osteoarthritis, or any other joint disease.
        
          A study published in 2017 found that recreational runners had lower rates of hip and knee osteoarthritis (3.5%) compared with competitive runners (13.3%) and nonrunners (10.2%).
          According to a 2018 study, the rate of hip or knee arthritis among 675 marathon runners was half the rate expected within the US population.
          A 2022 analysis of 24 studies found no evidence of significant harm to the cartilage lining the knee joints on MRIs taken just after running.
        
        These are just a few of the published medical studies on the subject. Overall, research suggests that running is an unlikely cause of arthritis — and might even be protective.
        Why is it hard to study running and arthritis?
        
          Osteoarthritis takes many years to develop. Convincing research would require a long time, perhaps a decade or more.
          It's impossible to perform an ideal study. The most powerful type of research study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Participants in these studies are assigned to a treatment group (perhaps taking a new drug) or a control group (often taking a placebo). Double-blind means neither researchers nor participants know which people are in the treatment group and which people are getting a placebo. When the treatment being studied is running, there's no way to conduct this kind of trial.
          Beware the confounders. A confounder is a factor or variable you can't account for in a study. There may be important differences between people who run and those who don't that have nothing to do with running. For example, runners may follow a healthier diet, maintain a healthier weight, or smoke less than nonrunners. They may differ with respect to how their joints are aligned, the strength of their ligaments, or genes that direct development of the musculoskeletal system. These factors could affect the risk of arthritis and make study results hard to interpret clearly. In fact, they may explain why some studies find that running is protective.
          The effect of running may vary between people. For example, it's possible, though not proven, that people with obesity who run regularly are at increased risk of arthritis due to the stress of excess weight on the joints.
        
        The bottom line
        Trends in recent research suggest that running does not wear out your joints. That should be reassuring for those of us who enjoy running. And if you don't like to run, that's fine: try to find forms of exercise that you enjoy more. Just don't base your decision — or excuse — for not running on the idea that it will ruin your joints.","Robert H. Shmerling, MD","April 26, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-snuff-really-safer-than-smoking-202304172913,Is snuff really safer than smoking?,"Snuff is a smokeless tobacco similar to chewing tobacco. It rarely makes headlines. But it certainly did when the FDA authorized a brand of snuff to market its products as having a major health advantage over cigarettes. Could this be true? Is it safe to use snuff?
        What did the FDA authorize as a health claim?
        Here's the approved language for Copenhagen Classic Snuff:
        If you smoke, consider this: switching completely to this product from cigarettes reduces risk of lung cancer.
        While the statement is true, this FDA action — and the marketing that's likely to follow — might suggest snuff is a safe product. It's not. Let's talk about the rest of the story.
        What is snuff, anyway?
        Snuff is a form of tobacco that's finely ground. There are two types:
        
          Moist snuff. Users place a pinch or a pouch of tobacco behind their upper or lower lips or between their cheek and gum. They must repeatedly spit out or swallow the tobacco juice that accumulates. After a few minutes, they remove or spit out the tobacco as well. This recent FDA action applies to a brand of moist snuff.
          Dry snuff. This type is snorted (inhaled through the nose) and is less common in the US.
        
        Both types are available in an array of scents and flavors. Users absorb nicotine and other chemicals into the bloodstream through the lining of the mouth. Blood levels of nicotine are similar between smokers and snuff users. But nicotine stays in the blood for a longer time with snuff users.
        Why is snuff popular?
        According to CDC statistics, 5.7 million adults in the US regularly use smokeless tobacco products — that's about 2% of the adult population. A similar percentage (1.6%) of high school students use it as well. That's despite restrictions on youth marketing and sales.
        What accounts for its popularity?
        
          Snuff may be allowed in places that prohibit smoking.
          It tends to cost less than cigarettes: $300 to $1,000 a year versus several thousand dollars a year paid by some smokers.
          It doesn't require inhaling smoke into the lungs, or exposing others to secondhand smoke.
          Snuff is safer than cigarettes in at least one way — it is less likely to cause lung cancer.
          It may help some cigarette smokers quit.
        
        The serious health risks of snuff
        While the risk of lung cancer is lower compared with cigarettes, snuff has plenty of other health risks, including
        
          higher risk of cancers of the mouth (such as the tongue, gums, and cheek), esophagus, and pancreas
          higher risk of heart disease and stroke
          harm to the developing teenage brain
          dental problems, such as discoloration of teeth, gum disease, tooth damage, bone loss around the teeth, tooth loosening or loss
          higher risk of premature birth and stillbirth among pregnant users.
        
        And because nicotine is addictive, using any tobacco product can quickly become a habit that's hard to break.
        There are also the ""ick"" factors: bad breath and having to repeatedly spit out tobacco juice.
        Could this new marketing message about snuff save lives?
        Perhaps, if many smokers switch to snuff and give up smoking. That could reduce the number of people who develop smoking-related lung cancer. It might even reduce harms related to secondhand smoke.
        But it's also possible the new marketing message will attract nonsmokers, including teens, who weren't previously using snuff. A bigger market for snuff products might boost health risks for many people, rather than lowering them.
        The new FDA action is approved for a five-year period, and the company must monitor its impact. Is snuff an effective way to help smokers quit? Is a lower rate of lung cancer canceled out by a rise in other health risks? We don't know yet. If the new evidence shows more overall health risks than benefits for snuff users compared with smokers, this new marketing authorization may be reversed.
        The bottom line
        If you smoke, concerns you have about lung cancer or other smoking-related health problems are justified. But snuff should not be the first choice to help break the smoking habit. Commit to quit using safer options that don't involve tobacco, such as nicotine gum or patches, counseling, and medications.
        While the FDA's decision generated news headlines that framed snuff as safer than smoking, it's important to note that the FDA did not endorse the use of snuff — or even suggest that snuff is a safe product. Whether smoked or smokeless, tobacco creates enormous health burdens and suffering. Clearly, it's best not to use any tobacco product.
        Until we have a better understanding of its impact, I think any new marketing of this sort should also make clear that using snuff comes with other important health risks — even if lung cancer isn't the biggest one.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/quick-start-guide-to-an-antiinflammation-diet,Quick-start guide to an anti‑inflammation diet,"There are no complicated rules to follow. Just be mindful of general dos and don'ts.
        
        
          
        
        Chronic inflammation — a state of persistent activation of the immune system — is an important part of many diseases, and diet is a big contributor to inflammation. It would make sense, then, to follow what's becoming known as the ""anti-inflammation diet."" Just one problem: ""There isn't 'one' diet, although many people love to throw that term around. The diet in general is almost as much about what you don't eat as what you do eat,"" says Eric Rimm, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        For a quick start, let's boil it down to some dos and don'ts.
        Don't eat these
        Stay away from ""ultra-processed"" foods, which include just about anything that comes in a package — like microwaveable dinners, hot dogs, chicken nuggets, dehydrated soups, baked goods, sugary cereals, processed meats, biscuits, and sauces.
        These foods have little nutritional value. Worse, they're high in salt, added sugars (which can spike your blood sugar), and saturated fat (which can increase your ""bad"" LDL cholesterol). All of these ingredients are associated with promoting inflammation in the body. ""The biggest offender is anything with added sweeteners, whether that means cane sugar or any compounds used to add sweetness,"" Rimm says.
        A report published in December 2019 in Nature Medicine notes that sugars, grains, and extra salt in ultra-processed foods can change the bacteria in your gut, damage the gut's lining, and switch on inflammatory genes in cells. Other studies have linked ultra-processed foods to shorter life spans, cancer, heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes.
        Inflammation-promoting foods include white breads, cereals, white pasta, and other products made with refined flours, as well as white rice. ""White flour leads directly to a pro-inflammatory state,"" Rimm says.
        Other offenders include soda, juices, cookies and other baked goods, butter, cheese, ice cream, coconut products, candy, salad dressings, jarred tomato sauces, and processed and cured meats.
        Do eat these
        To fight inflammation, go for whole, unprocessed foods with no added sugar: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes (beans, lentils), fish, poultry, nuts, seeds, a little bit of low-fat dairy, and olive oil. ""To these, many people add herbs and spices like cinnamon, ginger, and turmeric. There are a few studies that suggest modest benefits,"" Rimm says.
        How do they help? ""It's believed that antioxidants in brightly colored fruits and vegetables [cooked tomatoes, carrots, squash, and broccoli] may lessen the effect of free radicals, which damage cells,"" says Liz Moore, a registered dietitian at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Other food components that may help fight inflammation include
        
          fiber found in fruits, vegetables, and especially legumes and whole grains such as barley, oats, and bran
          omega-3 fatty acids found in fish (such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna), vegetable oils (flaxseed and canola), walnuts, flaxseeds, and leafy green vegetables (spinach and kale)
          polyphenols (plant chemicals) found in berries, dark chocolate, tea, apples, citrus, onions, soybeans, and coffee
          unsaturated fats found in almonds, pecans, walnuts, flaxseeds, pumpkin and sesame seeds, and plant oils (olive, peanut, canola).
        
        The evidence that trying to minimize inflammation through dietary changes reduces the risk of diseases ""is strongest for arthritis, gastrointestinal and heart health, and possibly auto­immune diseases,"" Moore says.
        Making the shift
        Don't try to suddenly switch to a new eating style. ""Start by slowly making changes so that these become more of a lifestyle shift rather than 'going on a diet,'"" Moore says. ""Try to eat fewer foods that come from packages and more that come from the ground.""
        Apply that approach to each meal. For breakfast, you might have a fruit smoothie or oatmeal with a few berries; for lunch, a salad of dark leafy greens with colorful vegetables topped with beans, nuts, and seeds; for dinner, a lean protein and more colorful vegetables, with fruit for dessert. The more color and variety you add to a meal, the more natural inflammation-fighting compounds you'll consume.
        If you're more comfortable following a particular diet plan, consider a Mediterranean diet or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet; they follow lots of the dos and don'ts we've outlined.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/time-to-try-intermittent-fasting,Time to try intermittent fasting?,"If you need to lose weight, a diet that focuses mainly on when (not what) you eat may be a good way to shed pounds and improve your cardiovascular health.
        
        
          
        
        Anyone who's tried different weight-loss diets is probably familiar with their pitfalls. Low-calorie diets often leave you tired, hungry, and cranky. Low-carb or ""keto"" diets can cause cravings and constipation. Low-fat diets are also tough to follow and, contrary to popular belief, they do not seem to prevent cardiovascular disease.
        Another diet trend, intermittent fasting, takes a different approach. Rather than limiting what you eat, this diet limits when you eat (see ""What is intermittent fasting?""). For some people, that change may be easier to manage, says Dr. Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        Short-term studies suggest that people stick to intermittent fasting diets as well as or better than they do to other diets. And according to a 2019 review article in the journal Nutrients, intermittent fasting promotes weight loss and may reduce risk factors linked to heart disease, including diabetes, high blood pressure, unhealthy blood lipid levels, and inflammation.
        ""However, we don't have much evidence about how well this diet works over the long term,"" says Dr. Rimm, noting that there are just two long-term studies of intermittent fasting, each lasting a year. Nor are there large populations of people who've followed this eating pattern for years. That's in contrast to two other diets linked to a healthy heart and healthy body size — the Mediterranean diet and a vegetarian diet.
        
          
            
              
                What is intermittent fasting?
                Intermittent fasting restricts when or how much you eat — and sometimes both. One variation, time-restricted eating, involves eating only during a certain time window, usually eight hours, over a single day. For example, you would eat only during the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and then fast during the other 16 hours.
                The other approaches, alternate-day and whole-day fasting, actually don't involve strict fasting. Instead, you choose two or more days during the week when you cut way back on the food you eat, limiting yourself to just 400 to 600 calories per day. On the other days of the week, you follow your normal eating pattern. In one popular version, the 5:2 diet, you eat normally for five days, then restrict your calories on two non-consecutive days. With alternate-day fasting, you eat a calorie-restricted diet every other day.
              
            
          
        
        An evolutionary advantage?
        Still, people who are overweight or obese might want to give intermittent fasting a try. In addition to its apparent heart-related benefits, this diet has some unique aspects that might explain its success, says Dr. Rimm. First, the strategy makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint. As early humans evolved, food supplies were alternately abundant and scarce. We also evolved in sync with the natural day-night cycle. So our metabolism adapted to function best with periods of hunger and eating during the day and sleeping at night. Many studies show that nighttime eating is closely linked to weight gain and diabetes, and one even found a higher risk of heart attack among men who snacked in the middle of the night compared with those who didn't.
        Second, intermittent fasting highlights some of the positive aspects of other diet strategies while avoiding their downsides. ""People who try whole or alternate-day fasting quickly realize how many calories are in certain foods. That helps them choose foods that are more filling but lower in calories,"" says Dr. Rimm. But because they're not constantly counting calories and feeling deprived every day, the diet is easier to maintain.
        Burning stored fat
        Periodic fasting triggers the same fat-burning process that occurs during a low-carbohydrate or keto diet. Keto is short for ketosis, the metabolic process that kicks in when your body runs out of glucose (its preferred energy source) and starts burning stored fat. Your body may go into ketosis after just 12 hours of not eating, which many people do overnight before they ""break fast"" with a morning meal. (A midnight snack obviously sabotages this process.) A keto diet keeps you in ketosis for much longer time periods because you avoid carbohydrates, which supply glucose. Instead, fat becomes the preferred fuel source.
        But some nutrition experts worry that keto diets — which typically include hefty amounts of meat and eggs — may be hard on the heart. Intermittent fasting is likely a healthier option, especially if you eat a balanced diet that includes whole grains, nuts, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, which are rich in nutrients known to lower heart disease risk.
        However, intermittent fasting diets typically don't specify what foods you should eat. ""As a nutritional epidemiologist, that makes me a little uncomfortable,"" Dr. Rimm admits. Eating burgers and French fries five days a week and a single breakfast sandwich on your low-calorie day wouldn't be healthy, he says. But with any diet, it's often a good idea to ease into the changes. You could start by trying a 5:2 diet or time-restricted eating. Once you start losing weight, you can gradually introduce more healthy foods, he suggests.
        Don't expect fast results, however. With intermittent fasting, people tend to lose weight fairly slowly — about a half a pound to 1 pound per week. But when it comes to losing weight, slow and steady is more successful and sustainable over the long term.
        Before you try intermittent fasting
        If you want to give intermittent fasting a try, make sure to discuss it with your doctor first, says Dr. Rimm. Skipping meals and severely limiting calories can be dangerous for people with certain conditions, such as diabetes. Some people who take medications for blood pressure or heart disease also may be more prone to imbalances of sodium, potassium, and other minerals during longer-than-normal periods of fasting.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/what-does-a-healthy-diet-look-like,What does a healthy diet look like?,"What's the healthiest way to eat? It depends on whom you ask. Many medical and nutrition experts claim to know the ""perfect"" way to eat for health, yet some of these dietary advocates disagree with each other in some fundamental ways. So, who's right . . . and who's wrong?
        The truth is that there is no single way to eat for good health. As a species, humans are quite similar on a genetic level, yet as individual specimens we can be amazingly diverse. That's why some people may feel great on a vegan diet while others prefer a paleo diet— two dietary patterns that would appear to be polar opposites. The paleo diet includes meat but excludes grains and legumes, while the vegan diet includes grains and legumes but excludes meat and other ani­mal products.
        How can both diets work? When planned well, each diet includes lots of vegetables and minimizes highly processed foods. Those are the common denominators of a healthy diet. From there, you can fill in the blanks to suit your tastes and your unique physiological needs by adding your choice of high-quality fats (nuts, seeds, avocados, olive oil, fatty fish), carbohydrates (whole grains, fruit, starchy root veg­etables), and plant- or animal-based protein (legumes, soy, fish, lean sustainably raised meat, poultry, eggs, dairy). It takes a varied diet to get the vitamins, min­erals, fiber, and phytochemicals required for optimal health, but there are many combinations of foods that can get you to that goal.
        While everyone needs carbohydrates, fat, and pro­tein, there is no ""magic"" ratio that you should be striv­ing for, as long as you avoid extremes. In fact, a number of recent studies have found that the quality of the food you eat—particularly emphasizing whole foods over processed food—is more important than whether it's low-fat, low-carb, or somewhere in between.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/11-foods-that-can-help-lower-your-cholesterol,11 foods that can help lower your cholesterol,"Focus on fiber-rich foods and avoid saturated fats.
        
        If your cholesterol level has crept up over the years, you may wonder whether changing your diet can help. Ideally, your total cholesterol value should be 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or lower. But it's the harmful LDL cholesterol value that experts worry about the most. Excess LDL builds up on artery walls and triggers a release of inflammatory substances that boost heart attack risk.
        ""To prevent heart disease, your LDL should be 100 mg/dL or lower,"" says Dr. Jorge Plutzky, director of preventive cardiology at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. But many Americans have LDL values that are less than optimal (100 to 129 mg/dL) or borderline high (130 to 159 mg/dL).
        If you fall into either of those categories, you may be able to nudge down your LDL to a healthier level by changing what you eat, particularly if your current diet could use some improvement. However, most people with higher LDL values likely will also need to take a cholesterol-lowering drug, such as a statin, says Dr. Plutzky.
        Dietary directives
        Avoiding foods that are high in cholesterol isn't the best way to lower your LDL. Your overall diet — especially the types of fats and carbohydrates you eat — has the most impact on your blood cholesterol values. ""As the American Heart Association has noted, you'll get the biggest bang for your buck by lowering saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fat,"" says registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        That means avoiding meat, cheese, and other high-fat dairy products such as butter, half-and-half, and ice cream. Equally important is replacing those calories with healthy, unsaturated fats (such as those found in vegetable oils, avocados, and fatty fish) rather than refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta, and white rice. Unlike healthy fats, these starchy foods aren't very filling, and they can trigger overeating and weight gain.
        The other big problem with refined carbs? They're woefully low in fiber, which helps flush cholesterol out of the body (see ""The fiber factor"").
        
          
            
              
                The fiber factor
                Your body can't break down fiber, so it passes through your body undigested. It comes in two varieties: insoluble and soluble. Fiber‑containing foods usually feature a mix of the two.
                Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water. While it doesn't directly lower LDL, this form of fiber fills you up, crowding other cholesterol-raising foods out of your diet and helping to promote weight loss.
                Soluble fiber dissolves in water, creating a gel. This gel traps some of the cholesterol in your body, so it's eliminated as waste instead of entering your arteries.
                Soluble fiber also binds to bile acids, which carry fats from your small intestine into the large intestine for excretion. This triggers your liver to create more bile acids — a process that requires cholesterol. If the liver doesn't have enough cholesterol, it draws more from the bloodstream, which in turn lowers your circulating LDL.
                Finally, certain soluble fibers (called oligosaccharides) are fermented into short-chain fatty acids in the gut. These fatty acids may also inhibit cholesterol production.
              
            
          
        
        The ""best"" foods
        The following 11 foods are good sources of fiber or unsaturated fat (or both). But they're not in any particular order and are simply suggestions. Most whole grains, vegetables, and fruits are good sources of fiber. And most nuts and seeds (and the oils made from them) provide monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats.
        1. Oatmeal. This whole grain is one of the best sources of soluble fiber, along with barley (see ""Grain of the month,"" at right). Start your day with a bowl of steel-cut or old-fashioned rolled oats, topped with fresh or dried fruit for a little extra fiber.
        2. White beans. Also called navy beans, this variety ranks highest in fiber content. Try different types of beans as well, such as black beans, garbanzos, or kidney beans, which you can add to salads, soups, or chili. But avoid prepared baked beans, which are canned in sauce that's loaded with added sugar.
        3. Avocado. The creamy, green flesh of an avocado is not only rich in monounsaturated fat, it also contains both soluble and insoluble fiber. Enjoy this fruit sliced in salad, pureed into dip, or mashed and spread on a slice of whole-grain toast.
        4. Eggplant. Although not everyone's favorite, these deep purple vegetables are one of the richest sources of soluble fiber. One idea: oven-roast or grill whole eggplants until soft and use the flesh in a Middle Eastern dip called baba ghanoush.
        5. Carrots. Raw baby carrots are a tasty and convenient snack — and they also give you a decent dose of insoluble fiber.
        6. Almonds. Among nuts, almonds are highest in fiber, although other popular varieties such as pistachios and pecans are close behind. Walnuts have the added advantage of being a good source of polyunsaturated, plant-based omega-3 fatty acids.
        7. Kiwi fruit. Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to peel these fuzzy, brown fruits. But to avoid the skin, slice one in half and scoop out the inside with a spoon for an easy, fiber-rich, sweet snack.
        8. Berries. Because these fruits are packed with tiny seeds, their fiber content is higher than most other fruits. Raspberries and blackberries provide the most, but strawberries and blueberries are also good sources.
        9. Cauliflower. This cruciferous veggie not only provides fiber, it can also serve as a substitute for white rice. Just shred or whirl in a food processor until it resembles rice, then sauté with a little olive oil until tender.
        10. Soy. Eating soybeans and foods made from them, such as soy milk, tofu, and tempeh, was once touted as a powerful way to lower cholesterol. More recent analyses showed the effect is modest, at best. Still, protein-rich, soy-based foods are a far healthier choice than a hamburger or other red meat.
        11. Salmon. Likewise, eating cold-water fish such as salmon twice a week can lower LDL by replacing meat and delivering healthy omega-3 fats. Other good fish options include chunk light canned tuna and tinned sardines.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/the-thinking-on-flavonoids,The thinking on flavonoids,"These plant chemicals, found in most fruits and vegetables, may play an important role in cognitive fitness and dementia prevention.
        
        
          
        
        Science already touts the heart-health benefits of plant-based diets like the Mediterranean, MIND, and DASH diets. Now researchers have turned their attention to how plant-based eating also may prevent dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.
        And one class of nutrients in plants continues to stand out: flavonoids. ""The more we learn about flavonoids' role in health, the more we find that they may have far-reaching potential in helping to protect an aging brain,"" says Dr. Tian-Shin Yeh, a researcher in the area of diet and cognitive function with Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        Class in itself
        Flavonoids are phytochemicals commonly found in plant foods. They have six subclasses: anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, flavanones, flavones, flavonols, and polymers.
        A variety of fruits and vegetables contain flavonoids. Some of the highest amounts are in berries, apples, citrus fruit (oranges, lemons), grapes, spinach, legumes, kale, broccoli, soybeans, onions, tea, cocoa, and wine. (See ""Flavonoids and food."") Some foods contain only one subclass of flavonoids, while others have several.
        Researchers believe flavonoids may help the brain in several ways. For instance, studies suggest they reduce cell-damaging free radicals and soothe inflammation. ""Some studies have suggested flavonoids may offer protective effects for brain cells,"" says Dr. Yeh. Some early-stage animal studies have shown that flavonoids can block beta-amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, a trademark of Alzheimer's.
        Flavonoids also may enhance brain blood flow. ""Some studies found flavonoid intake is inversely related to cardiovascular disease, and what is good for the cardiovascular system is also good for the brain,"" says Dr. Yeh.

        Many factors in play
        Large human studies of flavonoids are still in their early phases, but initial findings show promise. One of the most substantial to date was a recent study linking high flavonoid intake and a lower risk of Alzheimer's and related dementias (conditions with symptoms similar to Alzheimer's). The results were published online April 22, 2020, by The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
        Using data from the Framingham Heart Study, researchers looked at the dietary habits of almost 3,000 people, average age 59, without any signs of dementia. Over 20 years, people with the highest daily intake of flavonoids (about 297 milligrams) had a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's or a related dementia than those who ate the smallest amounts (about 123 milligrams).
        Still, the link between flavonoids and brain health might be a matter of coincidence. ""It may take a team effort from all kinds of nutrients, but flavonoids may be one of the main players,"" says Dr. Yeh.
        Color coordination
        So, to protect your brain from dementia, should you load up your plate with as many flavonoid-rich foods as possible? Not really, according to Dr. Yeh.
        She says that the standard advice to follow a plant-based diet as much as possible still applies, and eating a variety of colors is a good idea. ""The more colors and types of food you can put on your plate for every meal, the better,"" she says.
        How much is enough? Dr. Yeh says although there is still no definite recommended daily intake for flavonoids, aiming for the suggested five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day is a good goal.
        ""This breaks down to at least two cups of fruit and three cups of vegetables,"" she says. ""That should be a good start to give you the flavonoids your body — and brain — may need.""

        For the last half of the 20th century, most major health organizations, including the American Heart Association, recommended a low-fat diet. 
        Yes, they did, but the message has changed dramatically. Now, the American Heart Association, the federal dietary guidelines, and other nutrition authorities have shifted away from advising people to limit the total amount of fat in their diets. ""Instead, the focus is on an overall healthy dietary pattern. That means an eating style that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans, along with only modest or small amounts of meat, dairy, eggs, and sweets,"" says Dr. Eric Rimm, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        The reality is that eating more whole or minimally processed, plant-based foods will naturally lower your intake of fat, especially saturated fat. Found mainly in meat and dairy products, saturated fat can boost levels of harmful LDL cholesterol, a key contributor to heart disease. But simply cutting back on all types of fat does not necessarily translate into a diet that lowers cardiovascular risk.
        Low-fat diet fails
        Starting in the 1980s, when food manufacturers and consumers cut the fat from their products and diets, they replaced it with refined carbohydrates. People filled up on bread, pasta, low-fat chips and cookies, and low-fat sweetened yogurt. Eating lots of these highly processed carbohydrates floods your bloodstream with sugar, triggering a release of insulin to clear the sugar from your blood. But that can push your blood sugar too low, leaving you hungry again after just a few hours, which encourages overeating and weight gain. What's more, a steady diet of these unhealthy carbs can eventually impair your body's ability to respond to insulin, which can lead to diabetes. Both obesity and diabetes are closely linked to a heightened risk of heart disease.

But eating too many refined carbs wasn't the only problem. Avoiding unsaturated fats — those found in nuts, seeds, olives, avocados, and fish — isn't necessary. Not only do these foods make your meals more satisfying and tasty, unsaturated fat promotes cardiovascular health.
        What about ultra-low-fat diets?
        Some physicians advocate an ultra-low-fat diet, which includes just 10% of calories from fat. This diet excludes all animal-based products (such as meat, poultry, dairy, and fish), as well as refined carbohydrates (including white flour, white sugar, and even fruit juice). But it also shuns some healthier unsaturated fats, including added oils and high-fat, plant-based foods such as avocados and nuts. Small studies have shown that this eating pattern may actually reverse the buildup of cholesterol-clogged plaque in the arteries.
        At least some of that benefit may stem from the abundant fiber and other nutrients in the diet's copious amounts of vegetables, beans, and whole grains, all of which are fairly scarce in the typical American diet. The only problem with an ultra-low-fat vegan diet is that it's very challenging for most people to stick to over the long term. ""If you are among the 1% of people who can, may the Force be with you,"" says Dr. Rimm.
        For everyone else, a Mediterranean-style diet offers the best of both worlds — a plant-centric diet that's not overly restrictive (see ""Simple steps to a Mediterranean-style eating plan""). ""The Mediterranean diet doesn't require extreme eating habits that make it difficult to socialize with other people,"" he says. What's more, he adds, it tastes good and has the best evidence from long-term clinical studies for lowering a person's risk of heart disease.
        
          
            
              
                Simple steps to a Mediterranean-style eating plan
                To ease into this eating style, look over these suggestions from registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Choose one, try it for a week, then gradually add more changes over time, she advises.
                Switch from whatever fats you use now to extra‑virgin olive oil. Start by using olive oil when cooking, including in salad dressings. Try swapping olive oil for butter on crusty bread.
                Have salad every day. Choose crisp, dark greens and whatever vegetables are in season.
                Go nuts. Instead of a bag of chips or cookies, have a handful of raw nuts as a healthy snack.
                Add more whole grains to your meals. Experiment with bulgur, barley, farro, brown rice, and whole-grain pasta. Select dense, chewy, country-style bread without added sugar or butter.
                Add a variety of vegetables to your menus. Add an extra serving of vegetables to both lunch and dinner, aiming for three to four servings a day. Try a new vegetable every week.
                Eat at least three servings of legumes a week. Options include lentils, chickpeas, pinto beans, and black beans.
                Eat less meat. Choose lean poultry in moderate, 3- to 4-ounce portions. Save red meat for occasional consumption or use meat as a condiment, accompanied by lots of vegetables, as in stews, stir-fries, and soups. Eat more fish, aiming for two servings a week. Both canned and fresh fish are fine.
                Cut out sugary beverages. Replace soda and juices with water.
                Eat fewer high-fat, high-sugar desserts. Fresh fruit or poached fruit is best. Aim for three servings of fresh fruit a day. Save cakes and pastries for special occasions.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-foods-that-fight-high-cholesterol,5 foods that fight high cholesterol,"Your diet clearly plays a role in determining your cho­lesterol levels. In fact, changing what you eat can lower your cholesterol and improve the composition of the armada of fats floating through your bloodstream. Fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and ""good fats"" are all part of a heart-healthy diet. But some foods are particularly good at helping bring down cholesterol.
        How? Some cholesterol-lowering foods deliver a good dose of soluble fiber, which binds cholesterol and its precursors in the digestive system and drags them out of the body before they get into circulation.
        Others provide polyunsaturated fats, which directly lower LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol. And those with plant sterols and stanols keep the body from absorbing cholesterol. Here are five of those foods:
        
          Oats. An easy way to start lowering cholesterol is to choose oatmeal or an oat-based cold cereal like Cheerios for breakfast. It gives you one to two grams of soluble fiber. Add a banana or some strawberries for another half-gram.
          Beans. Beans are especially rich in soluble fiber. They also take a while for the body to digest, meaning you feel full for longer after a meal. That's one reason beans are a useful food for folks trying to lose weight.
          Nuts. Studies show that eating almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and other nuts is good for the heart. Eating two ounces of nuts a day can slightly lower LDL, on the order of 5%. Nuts also have additional nutrients that protect the heart in other ways.
          Foods fortified with sterols and stanols. Sterols and stanols extracted from plants interfere with the body's ability to absorb cholesterol from food. Companies are now adding them to a wide variety of foods. They're also available as supplements. Getting two grams of plant sterols or stanols a day can lower LDL cholesterol by about 10%.
          Fatty fish. Eating fish two or three times a week can lower LDL in two ways: by replacing meat, which has LDL-boosting saturated fats, and by delivering LDL-lowering omega-3 fats. Omega-3s reduce triglycerides in the bloodstream and protect the heart by helping prevent the onset of abnormal heart rhythms.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tips-to-cheat-safely-on-your-healthy-diet,Tips to cheat safely on your healthy diet,"Here's a formula to enjoy foods you love during the holiday season and all year through.
        
        
          
        
        For many people, this ""season of wonder"" includes wondering if you can cheat on a healthy diet. How much can you indulge in rich, salty, or sugary holiday cuisine without risking weight gain, heart and blood pressure problems, or high blood sugar?
        ""Some people are more sensitive than others to salt, saturated fat, or added sugars. We sometimes see diet affecting blood pressure or cholesterol in as little as a few weeks after people splurge,"" says registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        That makes dietary cheating a bit risky. But for generally healthy people, McManus says there is a formula that allows you to bend the rules this holiday season and beyond.
        First, the healthy guidelines
        Ideally you should always follow a healthy eating plan, such as a Mediterranean-style diet. In addition, you need to limit the following.
        Added sugars. Eating too much sugar can cause repeated blood sugar spikes and increase your risk for diabetes. Limit intake to no more than 24 grams per day for women and 36 grams for men.
        Salt. In some people, consuming too much salt can increase blood pressure. Healthy people should limit intake to 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day.
        Saturated fat. Eating too much of this type of fat — found in red meat and full-fat dairy products — can increase ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and raise your risk for heart disease. McManus advises limiting saturated fat to 7% of your daily calories. To figure out how many grams of saturated fat that would be, take 7% of your daily calories and divide it by nine (one gram of fat has 9 calories). For example, if you're eating 1,500 calories a day: .07 times 1,500 equals 105; 105 divided by 9 is about 12 grams of saturated fat.
        What about calories?
        Daily calorie needs depend on many factors, including your age, activity level, body composition, overall health, and weight goals (such as weight loss).
        If you're a healthy person who exercises 30 minutes per day, you can estimate how many daily calories you need to maintain your current weight by multiplying your weight (in pounds) by 15.
        For example, if you weigh 130 pounds, multiply 130 by 15. The answer — 1,950 — is the number of calories you need per day to stay at 130 pounds. Eating more could lead to weight gain; eating less could lead to weight loss.
        Bending the rules
        While a good diet is crucial for health, bending the rules on occasion probably won't hurt. A tip you can try is the 90-10 rule. ""Eat a healthy diet 90% of the time and splurge 10% of the time,"" McManus says. ""Eating three meals a day for a week means 21 total meals: avoid splurging for more than two of those meals.""
        What about doing a 90–10 plan every day during the holidays, devoting 10% of your daily calories to unhealthy holiday foods? That's probably more likely to lead to bad habits. ""If you occasionally go slightly over the daily guidelines for calories, salt, added sugar, and saturated fat intake, it's probably not going to be a problem,"" McManus says. ""But making every meal a little unhealthy, by design — that's likely to cause problems.""
        Pitfalls
        Knowing that you can cheat a little might tempt you to push the 90-10 rule beyond its limits. For example:
        You might overdo a cheat meal. We know for sure that a regular diet that's unhealthy can, over time, increase your long-term risk of developing heart disease. But it may also be true that a big, unhealthy meal can cause immediate risks. Let's say you binge on a juicy steak, mashed potatoes, and a hot fudge sundae. That rich meal contains 47 grams of saturated fat, 32 grams of mostly added sugars, 1,330 calories, 70 grams of carbohydrates, and 2,555 mg of sodium.
        Some small studies suggest eating a heavy meal increases the risk for a heart attack. Theoretically, a large, unhealthy meal does lead to various biochemical changes in the body, such as increases in triglyceride levels, which could contribute to an elevated risk for heart attack in the hours following the meal.
        You gain weight and keep it on. Maybe you'll exceed the dietary guidelines for the entire holiday season and tell yourself you'll compensate for it in January and February. Unfortunately, studies of what actually happens in the post-holiday period find that many people weigh more in March than before the holidays: January and February didn't fully correct for the holiday splurging. Perhaps you get used to indulging and then can't break that habit. Perhaps once you gain weight, your body resets your metabolism to a higher weight, so you get hungry more easily.
        ""Unless you're putting a lot of effort into maintaining weight loss, you can return to the previous baseline weight,"" McManus explains. ""Biology isn't on our side, and old behaviors are still there. We may slide back into our previous ways, and calories will go up and exercise will go down. So weight drifts back up.""
        What you can do
        Try to follow a healthy diet on most days, and allow yourself the pleasure of occasionally indulging.
        ""For the holiday season, you may want to enjoy a few particular dishes, meals, or events,"" McManus suggests. ""Plan ahead for that. But also plan how you'll be eating when you're not overindulging.""
        Carry that idea through to January and then each month after that. Don't bargain with yourself; try to maintain an even style of healthy eating, with occasional cheating on your diet. You'll wind up feeling satisfied that you get to enjoy the foods you love, and you may have more success maintaining your weight goals.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/stand-up-for-your-health,Stand up for your health,"As we lead more sedentary lives, it's important to combat the effects of too much sitting. Research has linked sitting for long periods of time with a number of health concerns such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.
        Fortunately, you can lower your risk of these conditions simply by standing and moving more— even if you already exercise. That's because routine movement during the day adds on to those benefits.
        The risks of sedentary lifestyles
        In an American Cancer Society study of 123,000 middle-aged adults, researchers found that women who sat the most had a 34% greater risk of dying from any cause over the 14 years of the study compared with those who sat the least. For men, the increase was 17%.
        When exercise was factored in, the difference was even starker. The most sedentary women, who neither moved nor exercised a lot, were almost twice as likely to die during the study period as those who moved and exercised the most. The most sedentary men were 50% more likely to die than their more active counterparts.
        Similarly, other studies have concluded that routine, everyday movement has benefits, whether for heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or weight loss. The importance of movement for health is so well-established that some doctors advise their patients to use sitting ""in moderation.""
        Sitting and your health
        Why does prolonged sitting have such harmful health consequences? One explanation is that it relaxes your largest muscles. When muscles relax, they take up very little sugar (glucose) from the blood, raising your risk of type 2 diabetes.
        In addition, the enzymes that break down blood fats (triglycerides) plummet, causing levels of the ""good"" cholesterol, HDL, to fall, too. The result is a higher risk of heart disease.
        Benefits of everyday movement
        By contrast, everyday movement not only reduces your risk of major ailments, but also helps burn more calories. Dr. James Levine at the Mayo Clinic coined the term ""non-exercise activity thermogenesis,"" or NEAT, to refer to the energy you burn through ordinary activities that you don't think of as exercise. These are activities such as fidgeting, carrying the laundry upstairs, dancing around the house to your favorite tune, or even standing while you talk on the phone.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/at-home-dental-care-true-or-false,At-home dental care: True or false?,"Try these true-or-false questions to learn more about how to best care for your teeth and mouth.
        
          #1. If your gums are bleeding, you're brushing too hard.
        
        True, sometimes. Bleeding gums are usually a sign of gum disease, but over-vigorous brushing can cause gums to bleed as well. Pregnancy, poorly fitting dentures, and some medications, such as anti-clotting drugs, can also contribute to bleeding gums. However, if you're brushing correctly (see the next question for tips!), healthy gums generally will not bleed.
        
          #2. It doesn't matter how I brush, as long as I brush for two minutes.
        
        False. One of the better ways to brush is to move your toothbrush in a circle. This is called the Modified Bass Technique. This circular motion picks up the plaque on your teeth and sweeps it out while other ways of brushing only move the plaque and push it against other surfaces. To use the Modified Bass Technique, hold your brush at a 45-degree angle to the gum line. Let the bristles reach just beneath the gum line.
        Regardless of the technique you use, it's also possible to brush too hard. This can damage your gums and wear away tooth enamel. Gentle pressure is all that's needed to remove debris and plaque.
        Two minutes of brushing is ideal, though. If it helps, set a timer. Use a fluoride toothpaste, and floss at least once a day. Brushing and flossing before bed is especially important in order to remove food particles from your mouth before you sleep.
        
          #3. There's no single ""right way"" to floss.
        
        False. For effective flossing, wrap the floss around the middle finger of each hand, leaving a section in the middle that's several inches long. Use your thumbs and index fingers to hold that section. Gently work the floss into the space between two teeth and press it against one of the teeth cre­ating a C-shape, sliding it up and down a few times. Then press against the other tooth, repeat, and move to the next space. These motions lift away the plaque. Make sure to move gently around the gums to avoid placing damaging pressure on them.
        
          #4. Electric toothbrushes are often more effective than manual ones.
        
        True. With proper use, a manual toothbrush should be as effective as an electric toothbrush, but most people don't brush long enough or use correct brushing techniques.
        Research has found that electric toothbrushes are better at removing plaque and reducing the risk of gingivitis. One review by Cochrane, an independent review organization, found a ""moderate benefit"" for using an electric toothbrush over a manual one. And one 11-year study published in 2019 found that people who used electric toothbrushes had lower rates of tooth loss, as well as healthier gums and less plaque, compared with people using manual toothbrushes.
        
          #5.  Mouthwash can be used instead of brushing and flossing.
        
        False. The American Dental Association (ADA) says: ""Using a mouthwash does not take the place of optimal brushing and flossing."" This doesn't mean that mouthwash is useless, however. It can fight bad breath, and the ADA notes that some mouthwashes help reduce the risk of gum disease and tooth decay, but only if used as part of a daily oral hygiene routine.
        Over-the-counter mouthwashes may be targeted toward prevent­ing decay (fluoride rinses), bad breath, mouth sores, or gum disease. Prescription mouthwashes can help treat gum disease, dry mouth, mouth sores, or dry socket. Most mouthwashes prescribed for gum disease con­tain chlorhexidine, which is also in some over-the-counter mouthwashes in lower concentrations. Talk with your dentist to decide which mouthwash is best for you.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/clean-eating-the-good-and-the-bad,Clean eating: The good and the bad,"Clean eating has been a trend for the past decade, although there's no official definition of just what ""clean eating"" means. In fact, it's more a dietary approach than a specific diet, although quite a number of cookbooks have spun off of this trend.
        The foun­dation of clean eating is choosing whole foods and foods in their less processed states—choosing from vegetables, fruits, whole grains, pulses (beans, lentils, and peas), dairy, nuts, seeds, and high-quality animal and plant proteins. When possible, food choices are organic and based on what's in season in your geo­graphic region. When choosing packaged foods with a label, foods with shorter ingredient lists are preferred, and added sugars are limited.
        So far, so good. However, the movement can go to extremes. Many clean-eating advocates aim to avoid all traces of added sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, preservatives, artificial colors and flavors, and other additives—a position that might be admirable but is too stringent for most people. In many cases, a cult­like extremism is encouraged by wellness bloggers and celebrities who have no nutrition qualifications or evidence to back up some of their promises, including claims that their version of clean eating will change your life or cure your health issues.
        Increasingly, food companies are picking up on the trend, using language in their marketing like ""food should be clean"" and ""don't eat ingredients you can't pronounce."" This not only taps into safety fears, but it implies that if food isn't ""clean,"" it's dirty, or that if it's not chemical-free, it's chemical-laden. The truth is that foods don't fall into black-and-white catego­ries. For example, even organic agriculture uses pesti­cides—most are natural, but some are manufactured.
        The good: Some versions of clean eating offer a genuine way to eat a nutritious diet based on fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains, with healthy fats and either plant- or animal-based protein food for bal­ance—while reducing sugar and ultra-processed foods.
        The bad: Other interpretations of clean eating can lead to a rigid diet that bans entire foods or food groups like grains—especially glu­ten-containing grains— soy, legumes, and dairy. These extremes are not supported by research, and you can develop nutrient deficiencies if your food choices are too limited. In some cases, clean eating, especially in its more rigid forms, can become less of a diet than an identity and could lead to disordered eating.
        The mixed bag: There's real benefit in eating more whole and minimally processed foods, but not in fear­ing others that are nutritious. Because many consum­ers perceive that ""clean"" foods are safer and higher quality, ""certified clean"" labels are starting to appear on some processed foods, although there's no standard definition behind them. Even the least extreme ver­sion of clean eating typically requires cooking most meals at home, which isn't feasible for everyone.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/ibs-a-low-fodmap-diet-may-help,IBS? A low-FODMAP diet may help,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that affects at least one out of 10 people in the United States each year. With symptoms like cramping, diarrhea, gas and bloating, it's no surprise that living with IBS can have a significant effect on a person's quality of life.
        Diet is one way people manage IBS symptoms. A common treatment approach is to avoid the foods that trigger symptoms.
        But if you have trouble identifying your trigger foods, you may benefit from adopting an elimination diet. One of the best ones for people with IBS is a low-FODMAP diet.
        FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. These are poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates. They are found in many foods and are associated with IBS problems, like diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and flatulence. The following foods contain FODMAPs:
        
          oligosaccharides, including fructans (in wheat, onions, garlic) and galactans (in beans, lentils, soybeans)
          disaccharides, including lactose (in milk and other dairy products)
          monosaccharides, including fructose (in apples, honey)
          polyols, including sorbitol and mannitol (in some fruits, vegetables, artificial sweeteners).
        
        The Low-FODMAP diet works in two phases. First, you eliminate most dietary FODMAP foods for two to four weeks. Then you replace them with low-FODMAP alternatives. You monitor your symptoms for changes and then reintroduce specific FODMAPs one by one over a six- to eight-week period, according to your tolerance. (Your doctor or nutritionist may advise you to keep a food diary and symptom chart to help identify problem foods as well as track amounts.) The goal is to find which foods trigger your IBS symptoms, so you can limit or eliminate them in your diet.
        Keep in mind that everyone reacts differently to FODMAPs, and some people with IBS can consume small amounts without having symptoms.
        To learn more about IBS, read Iritable Bowel Syndrome, a Special Health Report from Harvard Medical School.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/considering-collagen-drinks-and-supplements-202304122911,Considering collagen drinks and supplements?,"A tremendous buzz surrounds collagen drinks and supplements, as celebrities and influencers tout miraculous benefits for skin, hair, and nails. Since the collagen in our bodies provides crucial support for these tissues, it seems plausible that consuming collagen might lead to lush locks and a youthful glow. But what does the science say?
        What is collagen?
        Collagen is a major structural protein in our tissues. It's found in skin, hair, nails, tendons, cartilage, and bones. Collagen works with other substances, such as hyaluronic acid and elastin, to maintain skin elasticity, volume, and moisture. It also helps make up proteins such as keratin that form skin, hair, and nails.
        Our bodies naturally produce collagen using the amino acids from protein-rich or collagen-rich foods like bone broth, meat, and fish. But aging, sun damage, smoking, and alcohol consumption all decrease collagen production.
        Collagen drinks and supplements often contain collagen from many different sources, such as fish, cattle, pigs, or chicken. Typically, they contain peptides, short chains of amino acids that help make up essential proteins in the body, including collagen itself and keratin.
        What does the science say about collagen drinks and supplements?
        Research on skin includes:
        
          A review and analysis of 19 studies, published in the International Journal of Dermatology, that had a total of 1,125 participants. Those who used collagen supplements saw an improvement in the firmness, suppleness, and moisture content of the skin, with wrinkles appearing less noticeable. That sounds promising, but it's unclear if these skin improvements were actually due to collagen. Most of the trials used commercially available supplements that contained more than collagen: vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, coenzyme Q10, hyaluronic acid, and chondroitin sulfate were among the additional ingredients.
          A few randomized, controlled trials (see here and here) show that drinking collagen supplements with high amounts of the peptides prolylhydroxyproline and hydroxyprolylglycine can improve skin moisture, elasticity, wrinkles, and roughness. But large, high-quality studies are needed to learn whether commercially available products are helpful and safe to use long-term.
        
        Hardly any evidence supports the use of collagen to enhance hair and nails. One small 2017 study of 25 people with brittle nails found that taking 2.5 grams of collagen daily for 24 weeks improved brittleness and nail growth. However, this small study had no control group taking a placebo to compare with the group receiving collagen supplements.
        There haven't been any studies in humans examining the benefits of collagen supplementation for hair. Currently, no medical evidence supports marketing claims that collagen supplements or drinks can improve hair growth, shine, volume, and thickness.
        Should you try collagen supplements or drinks?
        At this time, there isn't enough proof that taking collagen pills or consuming collagen drinks will make a difference in skin, hair, or nails. Our bodies cannot absorb collagen in its whole form. To enter the bloodstream, it must be broken down into peptides so it can be absorbed through the gut.
        These peptides may be broken down further into the building blocks that make proteins like keratin that help form skin, hair, and nails. Or the peptides may form collagen that gets deposited in other parts of the body, such as cartilage, bone, muscles, or tendons. Thus far, no human studies have clearly proven that collagen you take orally will end up in your skin, hair, or nails.
        If your goal is to improve skin texture and elasticity and minimize wrinkles, you're better off focusing on sun protection and using topical retinoids. Extensive research has already demonstrated that these measures are effective.
        If you choose to try collagen supplements or drinks, review the list of ingredients and the protein profile. Avoid supplements with too many additives or fillers. Products containing high quantities of prolylhydroxyproline and hydroxyprolylglycine are better at reducing wrinkles and improving the moisture content of skin.
        Consult your doctor before starting any new supplements. People who are prone to gout or have other medical conditions that require them to limit protein should not use collagen supplements or drinks.
        The bottom line
        Large-scale trials evaluating the benefits of oral collagen supplements for skin and hair health are not available. If you're concerned about thinning or lackluster hair, brittle nails, or keeping skin smooth and healthy, talk to your doctor or a dermatologist for advice on the range of options.
        It will also help to:
        
          Follow a healthy lifestyle and eat a balanced diet that includes protein-rich foods.
          If you smoke, quit.
          Limit alcohol to two drinks or less in a day for men or one drink or less in a day for women.
          Apply sunscreen daily and remember to reapply every two hours.
          Wear wide-brimmed or UV-protective hats and clothing when you're spending a lot of time in the sun.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/grain-of-the-month-buckwheat,Grain of the month: Buckwheat,"Despite its name, buckwheat is not a type of wheat. Officially, it’s not even a grain but rather a seed that’s harvested from a flowering plant related to rhubarb. But the pyramid-shaped kernels are similar to grains from both a culinary and nutritional perspective.
        Buckwheat is gluten-free but rich in fiber and several minerals. It also contains high levels of rutin, a compound also found in apples and citrus fruits that may make blood vessels stronger and more flexible. Several studies suggest that eating buckwheat may help lower cholesterol levels and keep blood sugar levels in check.
        You may be familiar with buckwheat flour, which is sometimes added to pancakes or waffles. Buckwheat crepes made in the Brittany region of France are called galettes. In Asian countries, noodles made from buckwheat flour (such as Japanese soba) are popular. Whole, toasted buckwheat is typically soaked and simmered into a porridge known as kasha, a staple in Russia and other Eastern European countries.
        Buckwheat kernels, called groats, are sold raw or roasted. You can toast tan or ivory-colored raw groats in a skillet to make a crunchy topping for salads or soups. Roasted groats, which are brown with a slightly earthy, nutty flavor, can be cooked like rice.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/dont-let-muscle-mass-go-to-waste,Don't let muscle mass go to waste,"Age-related muscle loss, called sarcopenia, is a natural part of getting older. But after an injury, illness, or any prolonged period of inactivity, muscle loss can occur faster, leading to muscle atrophy. The consequences are greater weakness, poor balance, and even frailty.
        ""People older than age 65 are especially vulnerable to muscle atrophy,"" says Jodi Klein, a physical therapist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""It can take longer for the body to recover from dramatic muscle loss, but with the right strategy, older adults can protect themselves from muscle atrophy and rebound easier if it occurs, no matter what their age.""
        Signs of weakness
        Muscle atrophy can occur from a disease that primarily affects the muscles, such as polymyositis (an autoimmune inflammatory disease). Diseases that rob the muscles of energy, like cancer and malnutrition, are other causes.
        But muscle loss most often is due to physiologic atrophy, which happens when people don't use their muscles enough for an extended period. Besides an injury or surgery, physiologic atrophy can occur because of osteoarthritis, which makes staying active difficult, or a sedentary lifestyle.
        Muscle atrophy can lead to
        
          weakness in the upper limbs, including trouble raising your arms or reaching for high objects
          difficulty opening jars, holding a pen, typing on a keyboard, buttoning a shirt, or tying shoelaces
          muscle twitching and cramps
          trouble balancing.
        
        Muscle atrophy does not always happen after a physical setback. How a period of downtime affects you depends on your prior health, activity level, and amount of muscle mass. ""Men who are regularly active have a much easier time preventing muscle atrophy even if they are off their feet for a while,"" says Klein.
        Still, it doesn't take long for the body to lose what it has gained. A  study in the Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine found that older men who did eight weeks of strength training lost about 25% of their muscle gains after they stopped training for two weeks.
        ""A sudden stop in activity is like slamming on the brakes and can be quite jarring to the body,"" says Klein. ""Even minor muscle atrophy can cause some loss of strength and movement and make activity more difficult.""
        
          
            
              
                Get a head start on recovery
                If you know you will be inactive for a stretch — like from an upcoming surgery — then you can work to prevent muscle atrophy. ""If you are already active, continue what you are doing,"" says Jodi Klein, a physical therapist with Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital. If you are not a regular exerciser, use this time to get started. ""The better shape you are in going into surgery, the better shape you will be coming out, and the less chance you have of enduring muscle loss,"" says Klein.
              
            
          
        
        Make a move
        While you can quickly lose muscle because of physiologic atrophy, you also can get it back. It's best to get advice from your doctor. He or she can recommend an appropriate program to rebuild your lost muscle. This often includes physical therapy, strength training, cardio workouts, flexibility exercises, and a nutrition plan that may increase protein and calories.
        There is also much you can do on your own to increase and maintain muscle mass and strength. Almost any activity that works the upper and lower body can help you regain what you have lost.
        Weight training is ideal and can include workouts with dumbbells and resistance bands. Other muscle-building exercises include rowing, swimming, walking, and cycling (stationary or regular bike). ""Focus on exercises you can do safely and consistently, or better yet, enlist a trainer to create a specialized plan based on your limitations and needs,"" says Klein.
        Keep in mind that you have to take small steps at first, and it may take time to get back to where you were. ""But focus on the fact that you are moving,"" says Klein. ""Any activity is always better than no activity.""

        There are many things in life that can be categorized as coming in both good and bad versions. The same applies to bacteria.
        Bad bacteria like salmonella and E. coli can make you sick. Good bacteria like the kind in probiotics play an important role in keeping us healthy.
        These good bacteria interact with the intestinal lining to protect the body from harmful invaders. They help the immune system function properly, which means better ability both to fight infections and to dampen chronic inflammation.
        Know your bacteria
        Some research suggests that certain probiotics help relieve symptoms of gut-related conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.
        ""Many people could probably benefit by increasing their intake of probiotics,"" says Dr. Allan Walker, a professor of nutrition at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""The problem is the unsubstantiated hype that probiotic supplements have far-reaching health potential, which can keep people from choosing the best sources.""
        There are hundreds of bacteria classified as probiotics, but most come from two main species: Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Within each of these are various strains.
        There are two ways to get probiotics: fermented foods and over-the-counter products. According to Dr. Walker, fermented foods are the better choices primarily because over-the-counter supplements and formulas aren’t subject to the necessary oversight. (See ""Take care with supplements."")
        
          
            
              
                Take care with supplements
                Probiotics are also found in over-the-counter probiotic supplements and formulas. Most use Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, or a combination. The bacteria are concentrated and then dried to use as powders or in capsules, tablets, lozenges, and even gums. The issue with these products is that they are sold as dietary supplements and therefore don’t require FDA approval. ""So you can never be sure that the label claims about health benefits or the type and number of bacteria per serving are accurate,"" says Dr. Allan Walker, a professor of nutrition at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He advises you to avoid them unless recommended by your doctor.
              
            
          
        
        Eat more fermented foods
        Foods contain probiotics after going through lactofermentation, a process in which bacteria feed on the food’s sugar and starch to create lactic acid, which helps preserve it.
        Another way to think of lactofermentation is that it transforms one type of food into another kind—for instance, cabbage into sauerkraut, cucumbers into pickles, soybeans into miso, and milk into yogurt.
        The exact amounts and specific strains of bacteria in fermented foods vary depending on how they are made. Besides probiotics, fermented foods may also contain other valuable nutrients like enzymes, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids.
        How much fermented food do you need to eat for optimal gut health? Unfortunately, there is no recommended daily allowance for probiotics, so it’s uncertain which fermented foods or what amount is ideal, according to Dr. Walker.
        ""The general recommendation is simply to add more fermented foods to your diet,"" he says.

        Many choices
        There are many fermented foods to choose from. Here are some common ones you can try.
        Kefir. The tart yogurt-like drink is often made with dairy milk, but also comes in nondairy alternatives, like coconut water, coconut milk, and rice milk. Kefir also comes in fruit and vegetable flavors.
        Kimchi. Kimchi is a spicy, reddish fermented cabbage dish. You can find jars of it at most grocery stores or Asian markets.
        Kombucha. This tangy fermented tea drink is found in many grocery and specialty food stores. Some brands have added sugar, so make sure the label lists no more than 5 grams per serving.
        Miso. The paste is a staple in Japanese cuisine, especially in soup. It’s made from soybeans fermented with brown rice and has a strong, salty flavor.
        Pickles. Choose brands brined in water and sea salt instead of vinegar. Vinegar stops good bacteria from growing.
        Sauerkraut. Select raw or nonpasteurized sauerkraut, which contains more bacteria strains. You can find them in specialty grocery stores.
        Sourdough bread. This kind of bread is baked with fermented flour. Not all store-bought bread labeled ""sourdough"" uses it, so shop at an artisan bakery or specialty grocery store.
        Tempeh. Tempeh is a cake made from fermented soybeans with a firmer texture than tofu. It often comes precooked and ready to eat.
        Yogurt. Some brands include a Live & Active Cultures (LAC) seal from the International Dairy Foods Association. This certifies that the product has been fermented. But not all yogurts have this, so look for the words ""live and active cultures"" on the label. Also, opt for plain, unflavored brands when possible, as they contain less sugar per serving than most flavored and fruit-based yogurts.

        Could taking a vitamin D supplement make it less likely that you will develop a cancer that spreads or is deadly? A study published online Nov. 18, 2020, by JAMA Network Open provides some evidence that this might be the case.
        Among more than 25,000 men and women, those who were randomly assigned to take 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D each day for an average of 5.3 years were nearly 20% less likely than those who received a placebo to have an advanced cancer — defined here as one that metastasized (spread from the original tumor site) or proved fatal.
        When researchers looked at the data in more detail, the risk reduction (a 38% decrease) was limited to people who were at a normal weight than among those at higher weights, says Dr. JoAnn Manson, one of the study’s authors and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Puzzlingly, researchers didn’t see a benefit in people who were overweight or obese, says Dr. Manson.
        Hints of a benefit
        Prior to this study, the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), a large randomized trial that included nearly 26,000 participants nationwide, had already hinted that vitamin D may have some cancer-related benefits. Two years ago, when the authors published VITAL’s main findings in The New England Journal of Medicine, ""We had already seen a signal that vitamin D may reduce cancer deaths,"" says Dr. Manson.
        This new study went back and looked at the VITAL data on cancer in more detail, she says. The VITAL trial included men ages 50 or older and women ages 55 or older. All participants were cancer-free at the start of the trial. The participants were randomly chosen to receive either a vitamin D supplement or a placebo pill.
        Among the participants in the trial, approximately 1,600 went on to develop an invasive cancer during the trial period. But only some of those cancers went on to become advanced. The study authors found there was a significant difference between the number of people who developed an advanced cancer in the vitamin D group versus the placebo group. Of the 12,927 people in the vitamin D group, 226 developed a cancer that spread or was fatal, compared with 274 in the placebo group.
        The difference was more pronounced among normal-weight study subjects (defined as those with a body mass index of less than 25). Among some 7,800 normal-weight participants, there were 58 metastatic or fatal cancers in the vitamin D group, compared with 96 in the placebo group.
        No overall cancer reduction
        What researchers did not find, however, is an indication that vitamin D supplements could prevent cancer altogether. People who took the vitamin D supplements had risks of being diagnosed with an initial cancer similar to those of people took the placebo. They were just less likely to have metastatic cancer or to die from it.
        Past research has provided clues as to why this might be the case, says Dr. Manson. Animal studies have found that vitamin D seems to change the way tumors behave, affecting the biology of their cells and making them less aggressive or likely to spread. Past research has also linked higher vitamin D levels at the time of a cancer diagnosis to longer survival, according to the study authors.
        Differences in BMI
        But if vitamin D is linked to a lower risk of advanced cancers, the question is, why did overweight and obese participants not see the same results as the normal-weight participants?
        The reason may relate to differences in the biological activity of vitamin D in normal-weight versus overweight individuals, says Dr. Manson. Much like people with obesity can develop a condition called insulin resistance, where the body doesn’t respond to insulin normally, something similar could be happening with vitamin D, says Dr. Manson. ""In those with obesity, it may be that their bodies aren’t using vitamin D as effectively,"" says Dr. Manson. It’s likely that these differences could remain even when individuals who are overweight or obese take higher doses of vitamin D, she says.

        What to take from the study

        But what the study findings do suggest is that people who may be at high risk for cancer because of family history or other factors, as well as those with a previously diagnosed cancer, should be particularly vigilant about avoiding vitamin D deficiency. ""Be sure at a minimum to get the recommended 600 to 800 IU a day,"" says Dr. Manson.
        Nutrition labels now list the vitamin D content of many foods. Focus on eating vitamin D–rich foods, such as fatty fish, sun-dried mushrooms, fortified milk, or other fortified foods. (See ""Food sources of vitamin D."") If you don’t eat enough of these foods, a vitamin D supplement may be helpful.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/feed-your-gut,Feed your gut,"Nourish the healthy bacteria in your digestive tract with a mix of probiotics and prebiotics.
        
        
          
        
        If you want a healthy gut, you have to feed it well. This nourishment should include both probiotics and prebiotics — two dietary components that are increasingly being recognized as essential to your intestinal and overall health, says Teresa Fung, adjunct professor in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        There’s been a lot of buzz recently about the need to eat probiotics — ­living microorganisms found in foods such as yogurt and fermented vegetables. Probiotics add to your gut microbiota, the collection of 100 trillion or so bacteria and other critters living in your gut. Having a healthy microbiota may help foster a healthy immune system and reduce damaging inflammation in the body. Eating probiotics regularly may also help to prevent the intestinal environment from being overrun by unhealthy bacteria, which have been linked to everything from mood disorders and obesity to diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases.
        But probiotics are much like pets, says Fung. It’s not enough to just get one; you also have to take care of it, she says. This means feeding the population of microorganisms with prebiotics — foods that will help all of these desirable gut bugs grow and thrive inside your digestive tract.
        Understanding your gut
        To understand how to keep your intestinal environment healthy, it’s important to understand how your microbiota evolves. Everyone has a unique mix of microorganisms living inside them. Some of these come from your mother, conferred during pregnancy, delivery, and, potentially, breastfeeding. Others are introduced by the foods you eat, and your environment.
        Probiotics found in fermented foods and drinks — such as yogurt, cheese, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut — can add desirable organisms to your gut. But not all varieties of these foods have probiotics; it depends on how they are processed. Sometimes foods that naturally contain probiotics are then cooked or heated, killing the microorganisms and any potential health benefits along with them, says Fung.
        Slipping an occasional food with probiotics into your diet won’t do much to help you improve your microbiota, says Fung.
        ""Eating probiotics needs to be a regular thing,"" she says. (Research hasn’t yet determined the ideal frequency.)
        Try adding them into one or more daily meals for the biggest benefit. Sip a yogurt smoothie for breakfast, or put a forkful or two of sauerkraut alongside your sandwich at lunch.
        The need for prebiotics
        Even if you eat a lot of foods that contain probiotics, it won’t do you much good if your intestinal environment doesn’t allow them to prosper, says Fung.
        Research has shown that a traditional Western diet — heavy on fat, sugar, and animal meat — creates a toxic environment for healthy microbes and can even change the proportion of different types of bacteria inside your body, she says. In short, your healthy gut microbes will suffer on a diet of hot dogs and French fries.
        What beneficial bacteria love, says Fung, is fiber. When fiber enters your digestive system, enzymes from the microbiota help to break it down, producing substances called short-chain fatty acids. Experts think that having more of these fatty acids changes the pH inside your colon, making it less hospitable to some damaging types of microorganisms.
        Some good prebiotic options are beans and whole grains.
        ""Whole grains can include everything from oats to wheat,"" says Fung.
        Vegetables and fruits also contain healthy fiber. Other good prebiotic sources include garlic, bananas, onions, asparagus, and seaweed.
        Over all, the goal should be to make sure your diet contains a good balance of probiotics and prebiotics. If you feed your gut well, it may repay you in better health.

Over time, a shortfall of these nutrients may affect different aspects of your health, from teeth and bones to your heart, gut, muscles, blood pressure, weight, and more.
        
          What is a nutritional shortfall?
        
        Nutritional advice can be confusing. Eat more of this, less of that. Make sure you get enough — but not too much. It's no wonder many people have so-called nutritional shortfalls, where their diet lacks sufficient essential nutrients.
        So, which nutrients do you really need and how much? And what key nutrients do most people lack?
        The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020–2025 offers some insight. Updated every five years by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the USDA, the report found many Americans are lacking in four vital nutrients: calcium, potassium, dietary fiber, and vitamin D.
        According to the guidelines, these four are ""considered dietary components of public health concern for the general US population."" That's government talk for: these nutrients help you stay healthy, and you probably should eat more of them.
        
          Four nutrients you need — and where to find them
        
        Here is a closer look at these four nutrients, how much you need, and some of the best sources, per the recent guidelines.
        The specific daily amounts of each nutrient are based on the recommended daily calorie intake for adult men and women who don't need to lose or gain weight. For example:
        
          Women ages 19 to 50 should aim for 1,800 to 2,000 daily calories, and women ages 51 and older 1,600 calories
          Men ages 19 to 50 should aim for 2,200 to 2,400 calories, and those ages 51 and older 2,000 calories.
        
        Of course, specific calorie needs depend on the individual, but these figures offer a reasonable estimate.
        Food is always the preferred source, as it gives you other essential vitamins and minerals needed for optimal health. However, if you have trouble eating the suggested foods, check with your doctor about whether supplements are an option.
        Keep in mind that the listed portions for these foods are not recommended serving sizes. But they should help you get more of the fab four in your daily diet. (See this DGA resource page for a more detailed list of foods containing these nutrients.)

In addition to managing stress, paying attention to what you eat can have a big impact on your quality of life.
        There is no single diet that works best for managing UC. In fact, no studies have shown that any specific diet improves symptoms or that any specific foods cause UC flare-ups. The best approach is to avoid or reduce the foods that aggravate your symptoms.
        You should eat a well-balanced, healthy diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, such as a Mediterranean style diet. Avoid preservatives and emulsifiers, such as carrageenan, carboxymethylcellulose, and polysorbate-80.
        Having a nutritionist design a specialized diet plan for you may be helpful. The nutritionist will first want to identify foods that may trigger flare-ups or make your symptoms worse.
        There is no strong evidence that following any particular specialized diet diet—such as low-carb, vegetarian, or paleo—has any effect on keeping UC in remission.
        If you have inflammatory bowel disease and also irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a low-FODMAP diet may be helpful. FODMAP stands for the short-chain carbohydrates known as fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. Some people who eat high-FODMAP foods have an increased risk of problems like diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, and flatulence. FODMAPs include the following:
        
          disaccharides, such as lactose (in milk and other dairy products)
          monosaccharides, such as fructose (for example, in apples and honey)
          oligosaccharides, such as fructans (in wheat, onions, and garlic, for example) and galactans (commonly found in beans, lentils, and soybeans)
          polyols, such as sorbitol and mannitol (in some fruits, vegetables, and artificial sweeteners).
        
        A low-FODMAP diet can help reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea and improve stool consistency in people with IBS who also have well-controlled IBD. Consult with your doctor and a nutritionist about how FODMAP reduction may fit into your dietary plan.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/preventable-liver-disease-is-rising-what-you-eat-and-avoid-counts-202304032908,Preventable liver disease is rising: What you eat — and avoid — counts,"In today's fast-paced world, our waking hours are filled with decisions — often surrounding what to eat. After a long day, dinner could well be fast food or takeout. While you may worry about the toll food choices take on your waistline or blood pressure, as a liver specialist, I also want to put fatty liver disease on your radar.
        One variant, officially called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now affects one in four adults globally. Sometimes it progresses to extensive scarring known as cirrhosis, liver failure, and higher risk for liver cancer. The good news? Fatty liver disease can be prevented or reversed.
        What is fatty liver disease?
        Fatty liver disease is a condition caused by irritation to the liver. Liver tissue accumulates abnormal amounts of fat in response to that injury. Viral hepatitis, certain medicines (like tamoxifen or steroids, for example), or ingesting too much alcohol can all cause fatty liver disease.
        However, NAFLD has a different trigger for fat deposits in the liver: a group of metabolic risk factors. NAFLD is most common in people who have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, insulin resistance (prediabetes), or type 2 diabetes. It is also common among people who are overweight or obese, though it is possible to develop NAFLD even if your body mass index (BMI) is normal.
        What helps prevent or reverse NAFLD?
        Diet can play a huge role. Because NAFLD is so closely tied to metabolic health, eating more healthfully can help prevent or possibly even reverse it. A good example of a healthful eating pattern is the Mediterranean diet.
        Overweight or obesity is a common cause of NAFLD. A weight loss program that includes activity and healthy eating can help control blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar. Among the many healthful diet plans that help are the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet. Talk to your doctor or a nutritionist if you need help choosing a plan.
        To vigorously study any diet as a treatment for fatty liver disease, researchers must control many factors. Currently, no strong evidence supports one particular diet over another. However, the research below highlights choices to promote a healthy liver.
        Avoid fast food
        A recent study in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology linked regular fast-food consumption (20% or more of total daily calories) with fatty liver disease — especially in people who had type 2 diabetes or obesity. Fast foods tend to be high in saturated fats, added sugar, and other ingredients that affect metabolic health.
        Steer clear of soft drinks and added sugars
        Soft drinks with high-fructose corn syrup, or other sugar-sweetened beverages, lead directly to large increases in liver fat deposits, independent of the total calories consumed. Read labels closely for added sugars, including corn syrup, dextrose, honey, and agave.
        Instead of sugary drinks, sip plain water. Black coffee or with a splash of cream is also a good pick; research suggests coffee has the potential to decrease liver scarring.
        Avoid alcohol
        Alcohol directly damages the liver, lacks nutritional value, and may affect a healthy microbiome. If you have NAFLD, it's best to avoid any extra cause for liver injury. We simply do not know what amount of alcohol is safe for those with fatty liver disease — even social drinking may be too much.
        Eat mostly whole foods
        Vegetables, berries, eggs, poultry, grass-fed meats, nuts, and whole grains all qualify, but cutting out red meat may be wise. An 18-month trial enrolled 294 people with abdominal obesity and lipid imbalances such as high triglycerides. Regular activity was encouraged, and participants were randomly assigned to one of three diets: standard healthy dietary guidelines, a traditional Mediterranean diet, or a green-Mediterranean diet. (The green-Med diet nixed red and processed meats and added green tea and a dinner replacement shake rich in antioxidants called polyphenols.)
        All three groups lost some weight, although the Mediterranean diet groups lost more weight and kept it off for a longer period. Both Mediterranean diet groups also showed reduced liver fat at the end of 18 months, but liver fat decreased twice as much in the green-Med group as in the traditional Mediterranean diet group.
        Healthy fats are part of a healthy diet
        We all need fat. Dietary fats help your body absorb vitamins and are vital in the protection of nerves and cells. Fats also help you feel satisfied and full, so you're less likely to overeat. Low-fat foods often substitute sugars and starches, which affect blood sugar regulation in our bodies. But all fat is not created equal.
        It's clear that Mediterranean-style diets can help decrease liver fat, thus helping to prevent or possibly reverse NAFLD. These diets are high in healthful fats, such as monounsaturated fats found in olive oil and avocados and omega-3 fats found in walnuts and oily fish like salmon and sardines.
        With so many choices, it's hard to know where to start in the healthy eating journey. Let's strive to eat whole foods in their natural state. Our livers will thank us for it.","Kathleen Viveiros, MD","April 3, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/ibs-in-the-crosshairs,IBS in the crosshairs,"Up to 45 million Americans have a condition that people affected may only reluctantly mention: irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. Despite its prevalence, IBS is still somewhat mysterious when it comes to who gets it — two-thirds of patients are women — and why.
        But scientists are steadily peeling this proverbial onion, with newer treatment approaches targeting pathways that appear to be involved in the cramping, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and/or constipation that disrupt patients' everyday lives.
        Marked by chronic belly pain and altered bowel habits, IBS is categorized into three types according to which symptoms dominate: diarrhea (IBS-D), constipation (IBS-C), or a combination. It's one of the most common gastrointestinal conditions, affecting up to 15% of Americans, according to the International Foundation for Gastrointestinal Disorders.
        IBS is what doctors call a functional bowel disorder, since it affects the way the digestive system works but isn't due to any apparent structural problem. But that label is problematic, Harvard experts say.
        ""To say nothing's wrong is just wrong, because clearly something is different,"" says Dr. Anthony Lembo, a gastroenterologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""It's just that our standard clinical testing can't show it.""
        Compelling effects on daily life
        The causes of IBS remain frustratingly unclear, but symptoms are believed to stem from any of a wide range of factors. Among them:
        Changes in the gut microbiome. This array of microbes in the gut is influenced by what we eat and drink as well as by illness. ""About 10% of people who develop a gastrointestinal infection, whether viral, bacterial, or parasitic — even COVID — show a higher rate of IBS,"" Dr. Lembo says.
        Skewed intestinal muscle contractions. Normally rhythmic, these contractions push food through the digestive tract faster or slower than normal in IBS patients.
        Faulty nerve signals. Normal digestion relies on clear communication between the brain, gut, and nervous system. These signals are disrupted in IBS.
        Pelvic floor problems. This is especially true for women whose pelvic muscles don't relax normally, which can lead to chronic constipation.
        Early life stress. This can include traumatic events during childhood.
        Genetics. People with a family history of IBS are more likely to have it as well.
        At best, IBS is inconvenient, forcing people to shape their schedules around their bathroom needs. At worst, it can be incapacitating, causing extreme distress and controlling people's ability to work and travel.
        ""All the data show the suffering is pretty significant,"" Dr. Lembo says. ""It's a disorder we know can really debilitate people.""
        Tailoring treatments
        For the first time, IBS treatment guidelines, updated in June 2022 by the American Gastroenterological Association, steer doctors on how to personalize patients' treatment with a widening assortment of medications.
        Over-the-counter options — including fiber supplements, laxatives (in limited amounts), and anti-diarrheals — can help control symptoms. But recent years have brought an influx of IBS-specific drug options that don't just address symptoms, but instead target specific biochemical or cellular pathways to slow food movement through the bowel or push fluids into the intestine to soften stools and speed their passage. For IBS-D, these drugs include alosetron (Lotronex) and eluxadoline (Viberzi). For IBS-C, they include lubiprostone (Amitiza), linaclotide (Linzess), plecanatide (Trulance), and tenapanor (Ibsrela).
        The antibiotic rifaximin (Xifaxan) appears to benefit the gut microbiome, suppressing ""bad"" organisms that contribute to IBS symptoms, says Dr. Lawrence Friedman, assistant chief of medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital and chair of the Department of Medicine at Newton-Wellesley Hospital. ""It's one of the more exciting newer developments,"" he says.
        Doctors are also tapping older drugs for new purposes. Various antidepressants can alter nerve signal activity in the intestines or lessen pain in IBS, Dr. Lembo says.
        While a variety of medications can help relieve symptoms, effective IBS management depends on diet and life-style changes. For many people, avoiding trigger foods, eating more fiber, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising regularly, and getting sufficient sleep can help control mild symptoms. Symptoms may also worsen depending on the foods you eat. Wheat, dairy products, citrus fruits, beans, cabbage, and carbonated drinks are known culprits. Meanwhile, peppermint oil supplements, taken as coated tablets, can ease bloating and pain.
        ""Many people also figure out that lactose can be a trigger and if they drink a glass of milk or consume other dairy products, their symptoms worsen,"" Dr. Lembo says. ""But sometimes it's more subtle than that. Even drinking a glass of diet soda can cause gas and bloating.""
        For those in whom gas and bloating are severe, a low-FODMAP diet may help. FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols) are foods that increase gas production. They include beans, onions, celery, carrots, raisins, bananas, apricots, prunes, Brussels sprouts, wheat germ, pretzels, and bagels. Dr. Lembo suggests eliminating FODMAPs temporarily and then slowly adding each food back into your diet to pinpoint the worst offenders.
        Over all, Dr. Friedman says, ""the spectrum of treatments has expanded. We have more tools to work with and there's a higher likelihood of success, but there may still be an element of trial and error involved.""

But does it matter what kind of healthy eating plan you follow? Researchers looked at the effect of four healthy eating patterns on more than 120,000 people. The four patterns, all recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, were the Healthy Eating Index 2015, Alternate Mediterranean Diet, Healthful Plant-based Diet, and Alternate Healthy Eating Index. While they differ somewhat, all four encourage high consumption of plant-based foods like grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes.
        The participants filled out dietary questionnaires every four years for over three decades. The data showed that those who closely followed one or more of the four healthy eating patterns were less likely to die from cardiovascular disease, cancer, or respiratory disease during this period compared with those who did not follow any of the four patterns or did so less often. The results suggest that the ideal healthy eating pattern need not always be one particular diet but could be a combination that shares similar traits. The researchers added that people should focus on which diets are easiest to follow and meet their nutritional requirements and food preferences. The study was published online Jan. 9, 2023, by JAMA Internal Medicine.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-weighty-issue-of-heart-disease,The weighty issue of heart disease,"Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in men, accounting for one in every four fatalities. But there is good news. The prevalence of heart disease among men dropped in the last decade, falling from 8.3% in 2009 to 7.2% in 2018.
        ""Much of this decline can be attributed to the more aggressive lowering of cholesterol and the number of men who have quit smoking,"" says Dr. Christopher Cannon, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital and editor in chief of the Harvard Heart Letter.
        Now the not-so-good news: men's heart disease rates have idled in recent years, and a 2022 report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology predicts they will rise significantly by 2060. The reason? We are getting too fat.
        The report also pointed out that the combined rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes (for which weight gain is a leading contributor) will outpace all other risk factors for heart disease.
        ""The hope is that by identifying this trend, more men can take steps to address their weight management and hopefully slow or reverse weight gain,"" says Dr. Cannon.
        Reading the scale
        More than 70% of adults in the United States are obese or overweight, according to the CDC. Obesity is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, while a BMI of 25 to 29.9 indicates someone is overweight. (BMI is a measurement of weight in relation to height; you can calculate yours at /bmi.)
        Excess weight can increase blood pressure, raise cholesterol levels, and cause widespread inflammation, increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Being overweight also makes the body more resistant to insulin, the hormone that facilitates the transfer of glucose (sugar) from the blood into the body's cells. This can raise blood sugar levels and ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes. And people with diabetes are twice as likely to suffer a heart attack or a stroke than those without the disease.
        However, even if you are not officially obese or overweight, you should keep tabs on the scale and your waistline. ""People just below the BMI line for being overweight are still in danger of heart disease, as it's easy to add a few pounds without noticing, and that can send you in the wrong direction,"" says Dr. Cannon. He adds that even a modest loss of 2% to 5% of your body weight is associated with heart health benefits, including lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and triglyceride levels.
        
          
            
              
                When do you need medication?
                People who struggle with weight loss despite making lifestyle changes may benefit from taking one of the new anti-obesity medications. These prescription drugs are designated for treating obesity (defined as a body mass index, or BMI, of 30 or higher) and people with a BMI of 27 or higher who also have a weight-related medical condition like high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol. Although there are 10 FDA-approved anti-obesity drugs in the United States, older agents offer only moderate sustained weight loss, says cardiologist Dr. Christopher Cannon with Brigham and Women's Hospital. However, some newly approved medications, known as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, which were originally designed to treat diabetes, can be effective. Examples include semaglutide (Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro). The downside: they are expensive, and health insurance may not cover the cost.
              
            
          
        
        Making change
        While the rise in America's weight gain can't be entirely explained by consuming too many calories and exercising too little, those are two factors people can control. Still, it's no simple feat. For instance, health issues and physical limitations can make weight-loss activities a challenge. And many men don't consistently follow healthy eating plans or keep tabs on their intake of high-calorie foods.
        ""Men need to equip themselves with the right tools to be successful with weight loss and weight management,"" says Dr. Cannon.
        One tool Dr. Cannon recommends is a hospital-based weight management program. Here, men work with a team of physicians, nutritionists, exercise physiologists, life coaches, and counselors to create weight-loss goals and strategies on how to reach them.
        The programs typically include weekly group sessions and regular check-ins via phone, text, or Zoom. The duration can vary from several months to a year and longer, depending on the person's weight-loss needs.
        Ask if your doctor's practice or clinic offers weight-loss interventions or programs that support weight management. Also, contact your health insurance company and inquire about programs your plan covers.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-i-take-afternoon-naps,Should I take afternoon naps?,"Q. 
          I retired earlier this year and have begun to enjoy taking afternoon naps. But is regular napping good for my health?
        
        A. The first thing to consider is the possibility that you nap because you have daytime sleepiness. If so, what is the cause? For example:
        
          Do you take any medicine that might make you sleepy? Review your prescriptions with your pharmacist or during your next doctor's visit.
          Have you started having problems sleeping at night? If you sleep well at night and wake up refreshed, don't worry. But if you feel groggy or have early-morning headaches, you may have sleep apnea or some other cause of interrupted sleep.
          Could you be depressed? Ask yourself if you no longer enjoy activities that previously gave you pleasure and whether you feel low.
        
        If you feel your napping may be related to these issues or other health concerns then see your doctor. However, it sounds as if your nap is voluntary and enjoyable. It probably does not reflect an underlying sleep disturbance. If it refreshes your day without making it hard to sleep at night, snooze away.
        For most people, napping in the early afternoon when your body experiences a natural circadian dip, is the best way to catch a few winks without disturbing the sleep-wake cycle. There is no consensus on how long you should nap. Some experts recommend naps should last no more than 30 minutes. The limit is 60 minutes, because longer naps have been linked to a higher risk of health problems like cardiovascular disease.
        Try to schedule your naps and not wait until you get sleepy, which will prevent you from napping too late in the day. Keep your napping space dark, cool, and free from distractions. (But there is nothing wrong with the standard couch nap if that's most comfortable.) Remember to give yourself 10 minutes after napping before engaging in mentally or physically demanding tasks.
        There is still some stigma about naps at work in America because of the lingering notions of decreased productivity and even laziness. But there is solid evidence that an afternoon nap can improve a worker's cognitive performance, especially for complex tasks, and may stimulate creativity.
        When NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration studied the effects of napping on pilots, they found that naps improved mental alertness and performance. Many night shift workers reportedly perked up after taking naps as brief as 15 to 20 minutes.
        So, enjoy your nap. Even if you return to work, maintaining an afternoon nap as part of your daily routine can be beneficial.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/was-it-something-you-ate-follow-these-steps-when-food-makes-you-sick,Was it something you ate? Follow these steps when food makes you sick,"Foodborne illness outbreaks occur frequently in the United States. Invisible microbes in food sicken an estimated 48 million people in our country each year, landing 128,000 in the hospital and killing about 3,000, according to the CDC.
        Culprits are usually viruses (such as norovirus), bacteria (such as Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, or Campylobacter), parasites (such as Toxoplasma gondii), or toxins (such as those that can accumulate in shellfish).
        If you ingest them and get sick, you'll need to know how to respond.
        Recognizing symptoms
        Sometimes food-related illness shows up within a few hours of eating contaminated food. But some bugs (such as norovirus and Escherichia coli) don't trigger symptoms for days. Either way, the signs are usually intense: nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, or diarrhea, and possibly a low-grade fever (below 101° F). If you get dehydrated due to fluid loss from vomiting or diarrhea, you may feel lethargic, dizzy, or faint.
        Symptoms typically last for a couple of days. If they continue after a week, it may be less likely that food-related illness is making you sick. You should call your doctor to figure out what the problem is.
        In the throes of symptoms
        If you suspect you have food-related illness, you'll need to rest as much as possible and avoid sugary drinks or alcohol (which can make symptoms worse). Stay away from others (and try not to use the same bathroom), so you don't spread any bugs you're carrying, and keep taking any prescribed medications for chronic illnesses.
        You'll also need to stay hydrated. ""If it's hard to keep fluids down, take small sips. It's challenging, but important. Standing too suddenly when you're dehydrated can lead to fainting and injury. Severe dehydration can cause chemical imbalances in the body and even lead to kidney failure,"" says Dr. Christopher Baugh, an emergency medicine physician at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        If your symptoms don't include a high fever or bloody stool, Dr. Baugh says it's probably okay to take an antidiarrheal medication such as loperamide (Imodium). If you can stand the symptoms, however, it may be wise to avoid medications and let your body expel the invaders. ""If you take the medication, there's a risk that it might improve the symptoms but prolong or worsen the illness,"" Dr. Baugh says.
        
          
            
              
                Avoiding food-related illness
                Many cases of food-related illness result from improper food handling, preparation, and storage. For example, food can become contaminated if the cook doesn't wash his or her hands before preparing it; if fluids from raw meat, seafood, or poultry get onto fresh produce or cooked food; if food isn't cooked at temperatures high enough to kill microbes; or if food has spoiled.
                Avoiding those problems will help you ward off food-related illness. You have a lot of control over this at home. But what if you're eating at a restaurant? It's safest to order cooked foods, ask when stews and soups were initially prepared (if it wasn't that day, skip it), and tell your server that you'll need your food to be piping hot. If food doesn't arrive steaming or sizzling, request that it get a quick nuke in the microwave.
              
            
          
        
        When to seek emergency care
        Sometimes food-related illness requires a trip to the emergency room. ""The biggest warning signs are high fever or bloody stool,"" Dr. Baugh says. ""You should also seek emergency care if you have severe dehydration or abdominal pain, if you're unable to keep medications down, or if you have a weakened immune system.""
        This isn't the time to try to avoid care because you don't want to be a bother to anyone. ""Untreated bacterial food poisoning may progress into a life-threatening condition without antibiotics and intravenous fluids,"" Dr. Baugh says. ""If you're caring for someone with a food-related illness, be on alert for signs and symptoms that suggest they need medical attention.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/are-you-napping-too-much,Are you napping too much?,"A quick catnap can be refreshing and provide just the right reset to keep up your energy and concentration. But what about a lot of little catnaps — or even a great big snooze after every meal? Too much daytime sleeping can indicate a serious health problem.
        How much is too much?
        The optimal amount of sleep we need each night is seven to nine hours. Getting more or less than that is linked to cognitive decline, obesity, heart disease, and premature death. A direct cause hasn’t been established conclusively, but there’s growing evidence to suggest that possibility.
        The same is true of regular napping for long periods. For example, 90-minute daily naps are tied to increased risks for stroke, and two-hour daily naps are associated with an increased risk for dementia. Again, it is unclear whether naps actually cause these problems.
        Causes of daytime sleeping
        Many things can lead to excessive daytime sleeping. ""It could simply be that you’re bored because there isn’t much to do. Or maybe you’re bored because you have hearing loss and you’re avoiding group activities,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, associate chief of gerontology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Here are some other reasons that might lead you to sleep more during the day.
        You’re not sleeping well at night. You may be drowsy in the day if you have insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep) or another condition that keeps you from getting enough rest at night, such as chronic pain, depression, anxiety, an overactive bladder, restless legs syndrome, or sleep apnea (frequent pauses in breathing during sleep).
        You have an underlying condition. Many conditions can make you tired during the day regardless of how well you slept at night. Examples are very low blood pressure (especially after eating), low thyroid activity, vitamin D or B12 deficiency, anemia, low blood sugar, depression, narcolepsy (sudden episodes of deep sleep), and even obesity.
        You have frailty syndrome. Frailty includes a loss of muscle mass, stamina, endurance, weight, and general fitness. ""It affects about 25% of people ages 90 or older, and 50% of those 90 or older in nursing homes. One key symptom is fatigue, caused by lower energy production in cells. Eventually, doing any activity can be really exhausting, and the frail person sleeps more and more,"" says Dr. Dae Hyun Kim, a frailty researcher and geriatrician with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Your medication is making you drowsy. Common offenders include prescription medications to treat allergies, depression, high blood pressure (such as alpha blockers and beta blockers), insomnia, nausea, Parkinson’s disease, or seizures, as well as over-the-counter remedies for insomnia, allergies, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. ""And if you’re taking a lot of medications, there might be a drug interaction that’s making you tired,"" Dr. Salamon says.
        You’re not eating or drinking enough. You need food and fluids to keep up your energy.
        What you should do
        Dr. Salamon says you don’t have to do anything about excessive daytime napping if it isn’t bothering you and you’re unconcerned about potential health effects. But if you (or your family) would like to address it, talk to your doctor about hunting for causes.
        ""It could be that you just need to take your medication at a different time of day,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""For example, if you’re on a diuretic that makes you go to the bathroom a lot at night, you might be able to take it in the morning or afternoon instead of the evening.""
        If your doctor can’t find any medical causes of daytime sleepiness, you might just need a little more nourishment and activity in your life. ""Try to eat three meals and a couple of snacks each day, and drink four to six cups of fluid,"" Dr. Salamon suggests. ""And figure out a way to stay more engaged. Join a club, take an exercise class, go for a daily walk, or get together with friends,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""Even talking on the phone with someone each day can perk you up.""
        It will also help to go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day; keep your room cool and dark at night; and avoid caffeine, alcohol, and electronic screens close to bedtime. ""If you need to nap, try to limit it to up to 30 minutes,"" Dr. Salamon says. ""A little napping is normal as we get older, and quick catnaps can recharge your batteries. It’s a lot of napping that we worry about.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-our-microbes-affect-our-behavior,Do our microbes affect our behavior?,"We've known for almost 200 years that trillions of microbes live on our skin and deep inside us, particularly in our gut. Until recently, we thought they were just freeloaders using our bodies to get food and shelter, causing us no trouble. However, we now know that the genes of these microbes (our microbiome) make many chemicals that affect our body and may influence our vulnerability to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, and several degenerative neurological diseases.
        Recent studies suggest the microbes within us may also influence our behavior. A study published online Dec. 14, 2022, by the journal Nature compared mice that began exercising when given a running wheel to mice that didn't. There were no differences in their genes. However, there were differences in their gut microbiomes. In the exercisers, there were more bacteria that produced a certain chemical. Whenever these mice ran, that chemical sent signals from the gut up to the brain and ignited the brain's reward centers: they got a ""runner's high,"" and took every opportunity to run. Because of their different microbiome, the ""lazy"" mice got no such reward and remained couch potatoes. But when the microbiome of the exercisers was placed inside the lazy mice, they began exercising.
        If the gut microbiome can influence an animal's motivation to exercise, could that be true in humans? If so, could microbes in our body also affect our motivation to do other things — to use or avoid addictive substances, eat healthier foods, or socialize more readily?
        Or consider another microbe within us. When various animals are infected with a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii, they are much more likely to engage in risky behaviors. For example, infected gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park are much more likely than uninfected wolves to strike out on their own or to become dominant in the pack — or to die trying. The same fearlessness is seen in other infected animal species. Infected mice, for example, are less likely to avoid cats.
        Roughly 30% of humans are also infected with this same parasite. Could it possibly affect us the way it affects other animals, turning us into fearless risk takers? Studies have found that infected business school students are considerably more likely to aspire to be entrepreneurs (rather than, say, accountants), and that infected professionals attending events for entrepreneurs are much more likely to have already started their own business.
        So while the idea is still a long way from being proven, it is possible that the microbes within us not only influence our risk of various diseases but also influence our behavior. Scientists now even consider it conceivable that the microbes within us may influence things like intelligence, attitudes, empathy, who we are attracted to — in short, who we are.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/fighting-the-most-common-skin-cancers,Fighting the most common skin cancers,"Heading outside on a sunny day is a bit like going into battle. To protect your skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, you’ll need armor (sunscreen or sunblock, and sun-protective clothing), tactical strategy (avoiding peak sun hours), and a place to retreat (the shade) — especially during the summer months, when UV intensity is highest.

Mind you, we need a little sunshine on our skin to trigger the production of vitamin D, keep bones strong, and possibly help regulate mood and ward off illness. But unprotected UV exposure can cause skin cancers. The most common of these are non-melanoma skin cancers.

What are they?

To put it simply, non-melanoma skin cancers aren’t melanomas — the aggressive skin cancers that account for just 1% of all skin cancer cases, yet cause the majority of skin cancer deaths in the United States.

Extremely aggressive non-melanoma skin cancers are rare. Instead, the most common types, affecting millions of people per year, are slow-growing. They develop in basal cells (basal cell carcinomas, or BCCs) or squamous cells (squamous cell carcinomas, or SCCs).

These cancers don’t usually spread to other parts of the body, and they aren’t usually life-threatening. But they can be quite dangerous. ""Small skin cancers can bleed, hurt, and eat away at your skin. If left untreated, they can erode through important structures like your nose, eyes, bones, or muscles. If they become very large, they can spread, and in rare cases cause death,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, director of the Mohs and Dermatologic Surgery Center at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

Symptoms

While non-melanoma skin cancers can develop anywhere on the body, they typically show up in areas that have been exposed to the sun, such as the head, face, neck, ears, lips, arms, legs, or hands.

The cancers may look like flat areas that differ only slightly from healthy skin, or they may have distinguishing features. SCCs can be scaly patches, crusty sores, or wart-like bumps. BCCs often have raised edges, a sunken center, and visible blood vessels. They also can look like a pale scar, a sore that won’t heal, a reddish patch, or a bump that might have a number of colors (red, blue, brown, or black).

Melanomas usually have brown, black, or blue pigment of uneven color, jagged edges, and an asymmetrical shape. They can be flat or lumpy. Many people have small brown, black, or blue spots on their skin (lentigos), but their color is even, their edges are smooth, and their shape is symmetrical. Lentigos can turn into melanomas, so pigmented spots that start to change color or shape need to be evaluated.

Diagnosis

BCCs and SCCs are often found early (by you or your doctor), when they are easiest to treat.

To make a diagnosis, your doctor will take a look at a new or changing skin growth under a powerful magnifier. If the area looks suspicious, your doctor might remove a sample of the tissue (a biopsy) and send it to a lab for analysis. If the sample is positive for BCC or SCC, the cancer will need to be removed.

For large tumors, ask your doctor about additional testing. ""For SCCs that are bigger than a quarter, my recommendation is to ask your doctor about getting your lymph nodes checked to make sure the cancer hasn’t spread,"" Dr. Waldman says.

Treatment

Non-melanoma skin cancer treatment depends on a cancer’s specific type and features. ""For instance, an in situ [contained and not spreading] SCC on the cheek may be treated with a prescription cream. But an invasive SCC on the cheek would need to be removed with Mohs surgery,"" Dr. Waldman says.

Mohs micrographic surgery involves removing cancer a little bit at a time, to preserve as much healthy skin as possible. Each piece is checked immediately under a microscope. Once the edges are free of cancer, the surgery is complete.

""Mohs surgery is usually reserved for invasive skin cancers in areas that are cosmetically sensitive — on the face, scalp, neck — or on functional areas like the hands, feet, and genitals, or with very aggressive or large tumors on the trunk or extremities,"" Dr. Waldman says.

If Mohs surgery isn’t necessary, the skin cancer may be cut or scraped out with surgical tools, frozen, or destroyed with radiation. The encouraging news is that most SCCs and BCCs can be cured when they’re treated early.

Develop your battle plan

The best weapon to fight skin cancer is a strict regimen of prevention and detection. It should include the following steps.

Cover up. Apply sunscreen or sunblock with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 to 50 before you go outside. Protect your lips with a sun protection product made for them. If possible, wear a long-sleeved shirt, pants, a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, shoes, and socks.

Avoid direct sunlight. Stay out of the sun when it’s strongest (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), and seek the shade as much as possible.

Be vigilant about detection. Schedule annual skin check-ups with your doctor, and conduct your own exams at home each month. Don’t forget your scalp and all the back surfaces of your body. A mirror (or a loved one) can help you check your back and other areas you can’t see well.

Be proactive. Call your doctor if you find any new skin growth that looks suspicious. ""We need to see you before tumors grow and become a problem,"" Dr. Waldman says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/gene-editing-a-one-time-fix-for-dangerously-high-cholesterol,Gene editing: A one-time fix for dangerously high cholesterol?,"Among your more than 20,000 different genes, one provides instructions for a protein called PCSK9, which helps regulate levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in your bloodstream. About one in 250 people has a variant in this gene that causes LDL cholesterol to skyrocket, sometimes to more than three times the optimal ceiling of 100 mg/dL. This genetic condition, called familial hypercholesterolemia, is the leading cause of premature heart attacks in America.
        But other people have different PCSK9 gene variants that have the exact opposite effect. Their LDL cholesterol is extraordinarily low—and their risk of heart attack is also far below average. This discovery, made by Dallas Heart Study researchers in 2005, spurred industry scientists to develop drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors (see ""How does PCSK9 affect your cholesterol level?"").
        ""From a drug development perspective, it was very exciting, because just 10 years later, there were two FDA-approved medications that could dramatically lower LDL,"" says Dr. Pradeep Natarajan, director of preventive cardiology at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. The drugs, alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha), can slash LDL levels by 50%. Taking one of these drugs with a cholesterol-lowering statin can further de-crease a person’s risk of heart attack and related problems by approximately 15% compared with taking a statin alone.
        
          
            
              
                How does PCSK9 affect your cholesterol level?
                The PCSK9 protein acts like a tag that signals LDL receptors to be broken down in liver cells, which means there are fewer receptors to clear LDL from the bloodstream. As a result, LDL levels rise. High LDL accelerates the buildup of fatty plaque in the heart’s arteries, raising heart attack risk.
                But therapies that either block or prevent the creation of PCSK9 have the opposite effect. More LDL receptors remain active in the liver to remove LDL. Blood levels of LDL plummet, lowering the risk of a heart attack.
              
            
          
        
        From inhibition to suppression
        While taking a statin means swallowing a pill every day, the PCSK9 inhibitors are given by self-injection once or twice a month. But inclisiran (Leqvio), an equally effective drug approved last year, requires an injection just once every six months. Instead of blocking PCSK9 after it’s made, inclisiran prevents the protein from being made in the first place, using a technique called RNA interference.
        Now, a cutting-edge therapy that uses gene editing to permanently shut down PCSK9 production is being tested in people with familial hypercholesterolemia who’ve already had a heart attack. The CEO of Verve Therapeutics, the company leading the trial, is former Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Sek Kathiresan.
        To create the therapy, scientists relied on a modification of the powerful gene editing tool called CRISPR, which Dr. Kathiresan describes as ""a molecular pencil and eraser"" that changes a single letter in the instructions for making PCSK9. The one-time infusion contains tiny lipid particles that contain the editing tools, which travel through the blood to the liver. Once there, the particles release their contents, and the editor goes to work in liver cells. Studies in monkeys show that a single infusion lowered blood levels of PCSK9 by 89%, with a corresponding drop in LDL of 61%. Early data from the first human trial should be available later this year.
        Future possibilities?
        If the therapy proves to be safe and effective, it could also potentially treat people who don’t have familial hypercholesterolemia but who instead have ""garden variety"" high cholesterol, says Dr. Natarajan. ""People with inactivating PCSK9 variants in both gene copies that lead to LDL values as low as 15 mg/dL are alive and well, which suggests such levels are safe,"" he says. And so far, evidence suggests that PCSK9 gene editing is very specific and without identified ""off-target"" effects in other places on the genome.
        Despite the many available treatments to reduce LDL, many people don’t take these drugs consistently over the long term for a variety of reasons, such as insurance and access issues. That makes the ""one and done"" option of gene editing especially appealing, particularly since high LDL is very common and an important contributor to cardio-vascular disease, the leading cause of death in this country, Dr. Natarajan says. As the Verve trial moves forward, investigators at Harvard and elsewhere are developing gene editing therapies for other inherited heart conditions, including cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which currently have only limited treatment options.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/should-i-get-a-calcium-score,Should I get a calcium score?,"Q.
          I'm wondering if I should get a test to check my calcium score. I'm 52 and in good health. My LDL cholesterol level is normal (97 mg/dL), but my father had a heart attack in his late 40s.
        
        A. The artery-clogging plaque that builds up inside the heart's arteries contains cholesterol, inflammatory cells, scar tissue, and calcium. A coronary artery calcium scan (often called a calcium score) uses a special type of CT scan to look for that calcium, which is then quantified on a scale from zero to over 1,000. A score of zero indicates no calcified plaque. The higher the score, the more plaque is present. Findings from large studies link higher calcium scores to a higher risk of a heart attack or stroke.
        While a calcium score can be informative, the scans don't make sense for everyone. Not all cholesterol plaques have become calcified in younger people, so the scans aren't usually recommended for people under 40. Anyone who already has known heart disease doesn't need a calcium scan. That's because the results likely wouldn't change a doctor's treatment recommendations, which would very likely include a statin.
        However, if you're at risk for heart disease but don't have any symptoms, knowing your calcium score can help you decide whether to start taking a statin. Statins can help lower your risk of heart disease even if your LDL cholesterol is in the normal range. Current guidelines suggest that people estimate their 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease with a calculator from the American College of Cardiology, available at /ascvd. Statins are recommended for people with a score of 7.5% or higher. However, the score doesn't capture other possible situations that may elevate your risk — which include a family history of premature heart disease (defined as coronary artery disease occurring in men younger than 55 or women younger than 65).
        Calcium scans are readily available, quick, and painless. For the test, you simply lie on your back. The scanner then takes multiple pictures of your heart over the course of about five minutes. It involves some radiation exposure, although not as much as a standard CT scan. The cost (around $100) is usually covered by insurance. But keep in mind that the test isn't mandatory. Another option is to skip the test and simply start taking a statin. But for someone like you, who may have inherited a higher-than-normal heart disease risk, a calcium scan can give you a better sense of your risk and inform your doctor's advice.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-beep-program-keep-your-balance-2020031019038,The BEEP program: Keep your balance,"Balance is a skill you don't think about until you really need it — like when you lose your footing and have to perform an exotic improv dance to keep from hitting the ground. But don't wait until your sense of balance fails before you give it proper attention. As we age, balance can sharply decline, often with little warning. An exercise program called BEEP can help.
        How you keep your balance
        While keeping proper balance may seem simple, it involves a complex system with many moveable parts. Whenever you move, your eyes and brain process information about your surroundings. Your feet detect changes in the terrain. Your arms swing to keep you stable, and your lower-body muscles and joints generate rapid power so you can move forward, stop, and change directions.
        Unfortunately, this system works less effectively over time. The sensation of our bodies moving through space is not as crisp, and information travels more slowly between the body and brain. Muscles become weaker, and joints lose flexibility.
        Any breakdown in your balance system increases your risk of falls, which can cause hip fractures, broken bones, and head injuries.
        ""Doing more balance exercises and activities can keep your sense of balance in good shape, but you also want to focus on multifaceted movements that work on all the elements of your balance system,"" says Dr. Brad Manor, associate director of the Mobility and Falls Translational Research Center with Harvard-affiliated Hebrew SeniorLife.
        There are many kinds of balance exercises. Science has not tapped any specific ones as the best; however, some have stood out in many balance-related studies.
        For instance, a 2016 study in the journal Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine found that a specific Balance-Enhancing Exercise Program (called BEEP for short) improved balance skills among adults ages 60 to 80. Study participants did better on both solid and uneven surfaces, and increased their walking speed and overall confidence.
        Focus on three exercises to improve balance
        The BEEP program focused on three exercises: squats, heel and calf raises, and one-legged standing. ""These types of exercises increase both the physical and cognition skills needed for better balance,"" says Dr. Manor. ""Plus, they mimic movements of everyday life.""
        He recommends adding these to your regular workouts or doing them daily on their own.
        Squats. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and imagine you are sitting down on a stool. Lower down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as far as is comfortable. Keep your weight on your heels. Extend your arms forward or place your hands on a chair, counter, or table for stability. Pause for a second or two, then rise back to the starting position. Do this up to 10 times.
        Heel and calf raises. Stand with your arms crossed over your chest and lift your heels, so you rise up on your toes. Hold this position for up to 10 seconds, or as long as possible, and then lower your heels. Do this five to 10 times. If you need support, hold on to a door frame, a table, or another sturdy object. You also can place your hands flat on a wall.
        One-legged standing. Stand tall and place your hands on your hips or hold on to a table or chair for stability. Then raise one leg, so your foot is about six to 12 inches above the floor. Keep your gaze straight ahead. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds. Repeat on the other leg. Go back and forth three to five times.
        You also can perform these exercises with your eyes closed to work on coordination and concentration. Another option is to ""distract"" yourself by doing unrelated cognitive tasks — count backward, name words that begin with the same letter, or make a mental supermarket list.
        ""Balance is definitely a use-it-or-lose-it skill,"" says Dr. Manor. ""But if you work on your balance continuously, you are almost guaranteed to see improvements.""",Matthew Solan,"March 28, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/are-you-healthy-enough-to-age-in-place,Are you healthy enough to age in place?,"Use this checklist to identify weaknesses threatening your ability to stay in your own home.
        
        
          
        
        When daily life becomes a struggle in older age, people should question: Am I healthy enough to stay in my own home? ""Sometimes people don’t recognize the signs. They often will say everything is okay, when it turns out that bills have been piling up, the home is a mess, and there is no food in the fridge. So the conversation often needs to be corroborated with someone else,"" says Dr. Suzanne Salamon, medical editor of the Harvard Special Health Report Aging in Place (/aip).
        Consider the following health-related requirements for living independently. Use the blank boxes below to check off potential weaknesses, then talk to your family members and doctor about solutions. (We’ve listed a few to get you started.)
        Sharp thinking skills
        It’s normal to forget things from time to time. But if you’re having a little trouble thinking — difficulty managing medications, paying bills, choosing clothes for the day, selecting and buying groceries, turning off stoves and faucets, recognizing when food has spoiled or that it’s time to clean the house, doing paperwork, making decisions — and you think it’s worse than a year or two ago, you should discuss it with your doctor.
        Solutions: ""I typically do a mini screening for these complaints. If I suspect mild cognitive impairment [MCI], I’ll refer the person to a neuro­psychologist. But having MCI doesn’t mean you can’t live at home. It does mean you’ll need coping strategies,"" Dr. Salamon explains. Strategies include cutting down on the clothes in your closet and the tools in your kitchen to limit choices, using schedules and lists, and getting phones that are easier to use.
        Quick-start ideas: Label drawers and cabinets to help you remember what’s inside. If you use online banking, set your bills on autopay.
        Strength
        Living independently requires you to lift groceries; cook (put a skillet on the stove or a bowl into a microwave); get out of bed or off a chair or toilet; and perhaps climb stairs. Are you strong enough to do those things? Can you pull open various doors (to the microwave, the clothes dryer, or your car if you’re still driving)? Can you carry laundry to the washing machine or take out the garbage?
        Solutions: If weakness is affecting your activities, work with a physical therapist or trainer who’ll develop a strength-training program tailored to your needs. ""It’s best not to try strength training on your own: you can injure your muscles and bones if you don’t do the exercises properly,"" Dr. Salamon notes. Once you learn the strength-training routine, continue training at home at least twice per week. If you can’t get as strong as you’d like, find out if you can have a caregiver or an aide come into your home or have meals delivered.
        Quick-start ideas: Carry smaller loads (but make more trips). Get a tool to make it easier to exit a chair, such as a ""couch cane"" that provides a handle you can grab as you stand.
        Flexibility
        Arthritis and inactivity reduce flexibility. But you need flexibility in your hands, wrists, elbows, and shoulders to dress, brush your teeth, bathe, and reach up to a cabinet or out to a door. It takes a flexible neck to look behind you if you drive, and flexible hips, ankles, and knees to walk and get up and down from a chair. Are you finding it harder to do those activities?
        Solutions: If you’re just starting to experience muscle tightness, start a gentle stretching program at home. Stretch after your daily walk or after you’ve marched in place for a few minutes to get blood flowing to your muscles and make them more pliable. Find stretching workouts for older adults online, or get the Harvard Special Health Report Stretching (/str). For very tight muscles, work with a physical therapist or trainer to begin a stretching program.
        Quick-start ideas: If you normally reach up to grab drinking glasses or dishes, relocate them to lower cabinets. Use assistive tools when dressing (like long-handled hooks to put on socks).
        Balance
        Simply getting out of bed or standing up from a chair requires good balance; so does walking across a room, showering, stair climbing, and standing as you prepare a meal. Poor balance increases your risk for falls, which could land you in a hospital or cause permanent injury. ""One way to detect balance problems is to notice if you’re stumbling more or if you’re holding on to furniture to walk through your house,"" Dr. Salamon says.
        Solutions: Talk to your doctor if you suspect imbalance; it could be due to aging, or it might be the result of an inner ear problem, low blood pressure, or neurological disease. Treating underlying conditions can help resolve some balance issues. Work with a physical trainer to come up with an individualized program of balance exercises.
        Quick-start ideas: Install grab bars in your home, especially in the bathroom (where it’s slippery and falls often occur). Remove fall hazards, such as floor clutter and throw rugs.
        Endurance
        Are you easily winded? This could be a problem for independent living, especially if you have a large home. It takes endurance (in addition to strength and balance) to climb stairs, walk from one room to another, and do household chores.
        Solutions: A lack of endurance could signal an underlying condition that needs to be treated, such as a heart or lung problem. But it also could also be that you’re just out of shape. With your doctor’s agreement, start getting more aerobic exercise, the kind that gets your heart and lungs pumping. Your ultimate goal will be 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week, but it’s okay to start with just a few minutes per day; and it’s okay to exercise a little bit throughout the day. In the long term, consider moving to a smaller home, if possible.
        Quick-start ideas: If stair climbing is a problem, get some help and move your bedroom to the first floor. If your budget allows, hire outside help to assist with chores.
        Social connection
        Social isolation hurts health. ""People with a small community of friends and family — or none at all — are much more likely to develop serious illness and have short life expectancies,"" says Dr. Anthony Komaroff, editor in chief of the Health Letter. Do you have friends and family nearby? Do you know your neighbors? Do you have caregivers coming into your home on a regular basis or other community members you get to talk to regularly?
        Solutions: It’s been tough to enlarge your social circle during a pandemic. If you don’t know how to make a video call, it’s time to learn. Ask someone for help, or search for how-to videos online. Consider a physically distanced visit with a friend (keep your masks on). And now that the pandemic is over, a good way to meet people is to join a club or religious organization, volunteer, or go to a gym.
        Quick-start idea: Join an online social network such as My Boomer Place (www.myboomerplace.com) or Stitch (www.stitch.net), designed to help you connect with people in your age group who share your interests.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/finding-balance-3-simple-exercises-to-steady-your-steps-202110132612,Finding balance: 3 simple exercises to steady your steps,"A healthy life requires balance — and not just in a metaphorical sense. Being able to maintain physical balance is crucial to performing everyday activities from going up and down the stairs to reaching for an item on a shelf at the supermarket. But while many people squeeze in a daily walk and may even do some strength training exercises a few times a week, exercises to build balance don't always make the workout list. They should, according to experts.
        As you get older, the physical systems inside your body that help you maintain your balance aren't as responsive as they were when you were younger. Maintaining balance is actually a complex task for your body, requiring coordinated action from not only your muscles, but also your eyes, ears, tendons, bones, and brain.
        In addition, health problems that become more common with age, such as inner ear disorders, decreased sensation in feet, or postural hypotension (low blood pressure with standing) may leave you feeling unsteady.
        Practicing exercises designed to improve your balance can help keep you upright and prevent a fall that causes injuries.
        Building balance three ways
        You may wonder, what exactly is a balance exercise?
        Standing on one foot? Yes, that qualifies. It falls into a category called static balance exercises. These improve your balance when you're standing still. But a good balance workout should also include dynamic exercises, which are aimed at building balance when you are moving. Ideally, you should try to incorporate a few of these exercises two or three times a week.
        Below are three simple exercises that you can get use to get started. The first is a static balance exercise and the other two are dynamic balance exercises. For additional ideas, read this blog post on the BEEP program.
        Tandem standing
        
          
        
        Reps: 1Sets: 1 to 3Intensity: Light to moderateHold: 5 to 30 seconds
        Starting position: Stand up straight, feet hip-width apart and weight distributed evenly on both feet. Put your arms at your sides and brace your abdominal muscles.
        Movement: Place your left foot directly in front of your right foot, heel to toe, and squeeze your inner thighs together. Lift your arms out to your sides at shoulder level to help you balance. Hold. Return to the starting position, then repeat with your right foot in front. This completes one rep.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Pick a spot straight ahead of you to focus on.
          Tighten your abdominal muscles, buttocks, and inner thighs to assist with balance.
          Keep your shoulders down and back.
        
        Make it easier: Hold on to the back of a chair or counter with one hand.
        Make it harder: Hold the position for 60 seconds; close your eyes.
        Braiding
        
          
          
          
        
        Reps: 10 to each sideSets: 1 to 3Intensity: Light to moderateTempo: Slow and controlled
        Starting position: Stand up straight, feet together and weight evenly distributed on both feet. Put your arms at your sides.
        Movement: Step toward the right with your right foot. Cross in front with your left foot, step out again with the right foot, and cross behind with your left foot. Continue this braiding for 10 steps to the right, then bring your feet together. Hold until steady. Now do 10 steps of braiding to the left side of the room. This completes one set.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Maintain neutral posture throughout.
          Look ahead of you instead of down at your feet.
          Don't turn your feet out.
        
        Make it easier: Take smaller steps.
        Make it harder: Pick up your pace while staying in control of the movement.
        Rock step
        
          
        
        Reps: 10 on each sideSets: 1 to 3Intensity: Moderate to highTempo: 2–2–2–2
        Starting position: Stand up straight, feet together and weight evenly distributed on both feet. Lift your arms out to each side.
        Movement: Step forward with your left foot and lift up your right knee. Hold. Step back with your right foot and lift up your left knee. This completes one rep. Finish all reps with the left foot leading, then repeat by leading with the right foot. This completes one set.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Tighten the buttock of the standing leg for stability.
          Maintain good posture throughout.
          Breathe comfortably.
        
        Make it easier: Hold on to the back of a chair with one hand for support; lift your knee less.
        Make it harder: Hold each knee up for a count of four.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/easy-ways-to-shop-for-healthful-cost-conscious-foods-202303272906,"Easy ways to shop for healthful, cost-conscious foods","Three months into the year is a good time to recalculate if you've been slacking on your resolution to eat healthy. And if you'll be leaving home base or school soon and foraging for yourself (plus or minus roommates), it's a great time to learn about healthy, low-cost choices for your grocery list.
        The basics: A weekly shop
        A healthy diet is rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes (beans or lentils), whole grains, nuts, seeds, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. Trying to fill your cart with all of those goodies can feel overwhelming. But just think in terms of twos.
        ""Get two fruits and two vegetables of different colors, and two types of lean protein — such as fresh, frozen, or canned fish, chicken or lean ground turkey, or plant-based options,"" suggests Nancy Oliveira, a registered dietitian and manager of the Nutrition and Wellness Service at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Oliveira also recommends getting two foods in each of these categories on your weekly shopping trip:
        
          plant proteins, such as canned or dried beans, tofu, tempeh, veggie burgers, or unsalted nuts or seeds
          whole grains, such as whole-grain bread, whole-grain pasta, brown or black rice, quinoa, or farro
          dairy or nondairy milk items, such as nonfat Greek yogurt or cheese.
        
        Go ahead and add one or two healthy treats or snacks, such hummus or dried apricots.
        Do you need to choose organic foods?
        Organic produce is grown without synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which are linked to many health problems. While US scientists debate whether foods grown with organic fertilizers (such as animal waste) are safer for your health, other countries, including European Union nations, have banned or phased out synthetic pesticides still used in the United States.
        That doesn't mean that everything you buy must be organic. But try to stay away from conventionally grown produce with thin skins, such as strawberries, spinach, kale, peaches, and grapes. They tend to absorb more chemicals compared to produce with thick skins, such as avocados or pineapples.
        The Environmental Working Group creates an annual list to help shoppers avoid high-pesticide produce, and another one that highlights the least contaminated produce.
        Buying cost-conscious fresh food and staples
        Healthy food, especially organic produce, has a reputation for being expensive. But it doesn't have to be. Just do a little comparison shopping, and follow Oliveira's tips to save money on a grocery run:
        
          Shop in a smaller store with fewer choices.
          Never enter a store hungry, since you might buy more than you normally would.
          Carry a shopping list and stick to it.
          Go directly to the aisles you need. Avoid browsing elsewhere, which may lead to extra purchases.
          Be flexible, have several options within your food categories, and go with sale items.
          Always check the day-old produce cart that offers perfectly edible fresh produce at 50% to 75% off regular prices.
          Buy unseasoned canned or frozen whole foods such as vegetables, chicken, or fish (salmon, sardines, tuna), which are often cheaper than fresh versions.
          Wait for sales of healthy nonperishable staples like quinoa, brown rice, whole-grain pasta, and high-fiber cereals.
          Use coupons and coupon apps.
        
        Easy healthy snacks to reach for
        Move on from easy grab-n-go snacks, which are typically processed foods. They often contain unhealthy ingredients and promote overeating. Instead, Oliveira suggests keeping healthy snacks on hand, such as:
        
          unsalted mixed nuts
          string cheese
          grapes and berries (rinse before eating)
          clementines, bananas, or other fruits that don't need washing
          a rice cake with nut butter or hummus
          fat-free Greek yogurt
          a peeled hard-boiled egg.
        
        ""To save money, buy certain foods in larger amounts when possible, such as an 8-ounce bar of cheese that you slice into small cubes and store in a sealed container in the fridge,"" Oliveira says.
        Crowdsource shopping tips and savings
        Don't be shy about asking for shopping tips from friends and family members who've already developed shortcuts, and grocery store staffers who can offer insider advice.
        You can also turn to apps for help. Oliveira recommends two faves:
        
          Mealime is a meal-planning app with simple, healthy plant-based recipes that automatically create grocery lists for the ingredients.
          List Ease creates lists for grocery runs. You can search for items to add or scan barcodes to add to lists.
        
        ""And if you prefer not to use apps, just jot down notes after a quick pantry or fridge inventory, or text yourself every time you remember something you need,"" Oliveira advises. ""With a little practice, you'll quickly work out the best system for you.""",Heidi Godman,"March 27, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/why-eat-lower-on-the-seafood-chain-202303222904,Why eat lower on the seafood chain?,"Many health-conscious consumers have already cut back on hamburgers, steaks, and deli meats, often by swapping in poultry or seafood. Those protein sources are better than beef, and not just because they're linked to a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Chicken and fish are also better for the environment, as their production uses less land and other resources and generates fewer greenhouse gas emissions.
        And choosing seafood that's lower on the food chain — namely, small fish such as herring and sardines and bivalves such as clams and oysters — can amp up those benefits. ""It's much better for your health and the environment when you replace terrestrial food sources — especially red meat — with aquatic food sources,"" says Christopher Golden, assistant professor of nutrition and planetary health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But instead of popular seafood choices such as farmed salmon or canned tuna, consider mackerel or sardines, he suggests.
        Why eat small fish?
        Anchovies, herring, mackerel, and sardines are all excellent sources of protein, micronutrients like iron, zinc, and vitamin B12, and heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which may help ease inflammation within the body and promote a better balance of blood lipids. And because you often eat the entire fish (including the tiny bones), small fish are also rich in calcium and vitamin D, says Golden. (Mackerel is an exception: cooked mackerel bones are too sharp or tough to eat, although canned mackerel bones are fine to eat).
        Small fish are also less likely to contain contaminants such as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) compared with large species like tuna and swordfish. Those and other large fish feed on smaller fish, which concentrates the toxins.
        It's also more environmentally friendly to eat small fish directly instead of using them to make fish meal, which is often fed to farmed salmon, pork, and poultry. Feed for those animals also includes grains that require land, water, pesticides, and energy to produce, just as grain fed to cattle does, Golden points out. The good news is that increasingly, salmon farming has begun using less fish meal, and some companies have created highly nutritious feeds that don't require fish meal at all.
        Small fish in the Mediterranean diet
        The traditional Mediterranean diet, widely considered the best diet for heart health, highlights small fish such as fresh sardines and anchovies, says Golden. Canned versions of these species, which are widely available and less expensive than fresh, are a good option. However, most canned anchovies are salt-cured and therefore high in sodium, which can raise blood pressure.
        Sardines packed in water or olive oil can be
        
          served on crackers or crusty, toasted bread with a squeeze of lemon
          prepared like tuna salad for a sandwich filling
          added to a Greek salad
          tossed with pasta, either added to tomato sauce or with lemon, capers, and red pepper flakes.
        
        Golden is particularly fond of pickled herring, which you can often find in jars in supermarkets, or even make yourself; here's his favorite recipe.
        Bivalve benefits
        Bivalves are two-shelled aquatic creatures that include clams, oysters, mussels, and scallops. Also known as mollusks, they're good sources of protein but are quite low in fat, so they aren't as rich in omega-3's as small, fatty fish. However, bivalves contain several micronutrients, especially zinc and vitamin B12. Zinc contributes to a healthy immune system, and vitamin B12 helps form red blood cells that carry oxygen and keep nerves throughout the body healthy. While most Americans get enough B12, some may not.
        And from a planetary health perspective, bivalves are among the best sources of animal-based protein. ""Bivalves can be 'nature positive' because they don't require feed and they filter and clean up water,"" says Golden.
        Be aware, however, that bivalves can become contaminated from runoff, bacteria, viruses, or chemicals in the water. So be sure to follow FDA advice about buying and preparing seafood safely.
        Although we tend to think of coastal cities as the best places to find seafood, it's available throughout the United States. For less-common varieties, try larger Asian markets, which often carry a wide variety of fish and bivalves, Golden suggests.
        Aquatic plant foods
        You can even go one step further down the aquatic food chain by eating aquatic plant foods such as seaweed and kelp. If you like sushi, you've probably had nori, the flat sheets of seaweed used to make sushi rolls. You can also find seaweed snacks in Asian and many mainstream grocery stores. The truly adventurous may want to try kelp jerky or a kelp burger, both sold online.
        Nutrients in seaweed vary quite a bit, depending on species (kelp is one type of brown seaweed; there are also numerous green and red species). But seaweed is low in calories, is a good source of fiber, and also contains iodine, a mineral required to make thyroid hormones. Similar to terrestrial vegetables, seaweeds contain a range of other minerals and vitamins. For now, aquatic plant foods remain fringe products here in the United States, but they may become more mainstream in the future, according to Golden.",Julie Corliss,"March 22, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-practical-guide-to-the-mediterranean-diet-2019032116194,A practical guide to the Mediterranean diet,"The Mediterranean diet has received much attention as a healthy way to eat, and with good reason. The Mediterranean diet has been shown to reduce risk of heart disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, certain cancers, depression, and in older adults, a decreased risk of frailty, along with better mental and physical function. 
        What is the Mediterranean diet?
        The traditional Mediterranean diet is based on foods available in countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. The foundation for this healthy diet includes
        
          an abundance of plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, which are minimally processed, seasonally fresh, and grown locally
          olive oil as the principal source of fat
          cheese and yogurt, consumed daily in low to moderate amounts
          fish and poultry, consumed in low to moderate amounts a few times a week
          red meat, consumed infrequently and in small amounts
          fresh fruit for dessert, with sweets containing added sugars or honey eaten only a few times each week
          wine consumed in low to moderate amounts, usually with meals.
        
        How to bring the Mediterranean diet to your plate
        How can you incorporate these healthy foods into your everyday life? Here are some small changes you can make. Pick one change every week and incorporate it gradually. Start with the changes you think will be the easiest.
        
          Switch from whatever fats you use now to extra virgin olive oil. Start by using olive oil in cooking, and then try some new salad dressings with olive oil as the base. Finally, use olive oil in place of butter on your crusty bread.
          Eat nuts and olives. Consume a handful of raw nuts every day as a healthy replacement for processed snacks.
          Add whole-grain bread or other whole grains to the meal. Select dense, chewy, country-style loaves without added sugar or butter. Experiment with bulgur, barley, farro, couscous, and whole-grain pasta.
          Begin or end each meal with a salad. Choose crisp, dark greens and whatever vegetables are in season.
          Add more and different vegetables to the menu. Add an extra serving of vegetables to both lunch and dinner, aiming for three to four servings a day. Try a new vegetable every week.
          Eat at least three servings a week of legumes. Options include lentils, chickpeas, beans, and peas.
          Eat less meat. Choose lean poultry in moderate, 3- to 4-ounce portions. Save red meat for occasional consumption or use meat as a condiment, accompanied by lots of vegetables, as in stews, stir-fries, and soups. Eat more fish, aiming for two to three servings a week. Both canned and fresh fish are fine.
          Substitute wine in moderation for other alcoholic beverages. Replace beer or liquors with wine — no more than two 5-ounce glasses per day for men, and one glass per day for women.
          Cut out sugary beverages. Replace soda and juices with water.
          Eat less high-fat, high-sugar desserts. Poached or fresh fruit is best. Aim for three servings of fresh fruit a day. Save cakes and pastries for special occasions.
          Seek out the best quality food available. Farmer's markets are an excellent source of locally grown, seasonal foods.
        
        Finally, try to have dinner as a family as often as possible. Food as a communal, shared experience is a big part of the Mediterranean approach.
        Mediterranean all day
        There are many ways to incorporate the delicious foods of the Mediterranean diet into your daily menu. Here are a few ideas to get you started.
        
          Breakfast:

          steamed mussels with spinach-orzo salad and minestrone soup.","Katherine D. McManus, MS, RD, LDN","March 22, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/lets-go-nuts,Let's go nuts,"Nutritionally, nuts have a lot to offer, and they should figure more in our diets — and not just as snacks.
        
        Nuts are dense little packages of fat and protein, with most of the fat being the healthful, unsaturated kind. They don't contribute much in the way of vitamins but make up for it by supplying respectable amounts of potassium, magnesium, and several other required minerals.
        Dieters have tended to stay away from nuts because the fat content makes them a high-calorie food. It doesn't help that we tend to shovel them in as snacks, not as part of meals. But nuts contain very little carbohydrate, so they're showing up in low-carb diets these days, particularly the ones that emphasize plant-based foods.
        A couple of studies have found a correlation between relatively high nut consumption (two or more servings a week) and avoidance of weight gain and obesity. Researchers at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center reported results from a small (20 volunteers) study that showed walnuts at breakfast gave people a pre-lunch feeling of fullness that might make it easier to eat less. Ultimately, weight loss is about reining in calorie consumption (and increasing physical activity). But if nuts make people feel full, perhaps they can help lower calorie counts over all, even as they add to those totals.

        Apart from weight issues, nuts seem to have some protective effects against heart disease. Numerous studies have shown that if you put people on nut-filled diets, favorable effects on cholesterol levels, blood pressure readings, and inflammatory factors follow. And in large epidemiologic studies, high nut consumption has been associated with lower rates of heart disease. An analysis of data from the Harvard-based Nurses' Health Study showed that having one serving of nuts a day is associated with a 30% lower risk of heart disease compared with having one serving of red meat a day. A plate full of walnuts for dinner tonight? That's not very appealing. But cookbooks are full of recipes that incorporate nuts into pasta dishes and the like. And it would be easy for most of us to add almonds or walnuts to a bowl of cereal or low-fat yogurt at breakfast and occasionally eat a meatless lunch or dinner.
        Nuts may help with diabetes, too. The lack of carbohydrate content means nuts don't add appreciably to the surges in blood sugar we experience after many meals. In fact, they can blunt the effects of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels. Those ""postprandial"" spikes in blood sugar contribute to the development of diabetes in people vulnerable to getting the disease and must be controlled in those who have already have it. Yet the evidence for nut consumption reducing the risk for developing diabetes is mixed, as are results of studies of the effect it has on blood sugar levels.",Unknown,"March 22, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/probiotics-may-help-boost-mood-and-cognitive-function,Probiotics may help boost mood and cognitive function,"Probiotics can do more than improve your gut health. They also may indirectly enhance your brain, too.
        Research shows that the gut and brain are connected, a partnership called the gut-brain axis. The two are linked through biochemical signaling between the nervous system in the digestive tract, called the enteric nervous system, and the central nervous system, which includes the brain. The primary information connection between the brain and gut is the vagus nerve, the longest nerve in the body.
        The gut has been called a ""second brain"" because it produces many of the same neurotransmitters as the brain does, like serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid, all of which play a key role in regulating mood. In fact, it is estimated that 90% of serotonin is made in the digestive tract.
        What affects the gut often affects the brain and vice versa? When your brain senses trouble—the fight-or-flight response—it sends warning signals to the gut, which is why stressful events can cause digestive problems like a nervous or upset stomach. On the flip side, flares of gastrointestinal issues like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn's disease, or chronic constipation may trigger anxiety or depression.
        The brain-gut axis works in other ways, too. For example, your gut helps regulate appetite by telling the brain when it's time to stop eating. About 20 minutes after you eat, gut microbes produce proteins that can suppress appetite, which coincides with the time it often takes people to begin feeling full.
        How might probiotics fit in the gut-brain axis? Some research has found that probiotics may help boost mood and cognitive function and lower stress and anxiety. For example, a study published by Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience found that Alzheimer's patients who drank milk made with four probiotic bacteria species for 12 weeks scored better on a test to measure cognitive impairment compared with those who drank regular milk.
        And a small study reported in the journal Gastroenterology found that women who ate yogurt with a mix of probiotics twice a day for four weeks were calmer when exposed to images of angry and frightened faces compared to a control group. MRIs also found that the yogurt group had lower activity in the insula, the brain area that processes internal body sensations, like those emanating from the gut.
        It's too early to determine the exact role probiotics play in the gut-brain axis since this research is still ongoing. Probiotics may not only support a healthier gut, but a healthier brain as well.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-long-covid-affect-the-gut-202303202903,Can long COVID affect the gut?,"Low energy, brain fog, and lung problems are a few of the lingering aftereffects reported by some people who have had COVID-19. Could gut troubles also fall among the constellation of chronic symptoms that people with long-haul COVID experience? And if so, what do experts suggest to help ease this?
        What happens to the gut during a COVID infection?
        As we head into the fourth year since COVID-19 became a global health emergency, hundreds of millions of people around the globe have been infected with the virus that causes it. Since 2020, we've known that the virus particles that cause lung illness also infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract: the esophagus, stomach, small intestines, and colon. This can trigger abdominal pain and diarrhea, which often — but not always — clear up as people recover.
        We know chronic gut problems such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) sometimes occur even after illness caused by microorganisms like Campylobacter and Salmonella are cured. Could this happen with COVID-19?
        What is long COVID?
        While most people who get COVID-19 will survive, medical science is becoming aware of a group of people suffering from lasting declines in health. Well-reported long COVID aftereffects include tiredness, breathing difficulty, heart rhythm changes, and muscle pain. But few people, even in the medical field, are aware that long COVID symptoms may include chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain.
        Why might the gut be involved in long COVID?
        It is not clear why chronic gut symptoms might occur after a COVID-19 infection. One possible insight is a well-known syndrome called post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that may occur after a stomach flu (gastroenteritis).
        Long after the bug causing the illness is gone, a change in gut-brain signaling may occur. A complex network of nerves connects the gut and the brain, and controls communication between different parts of the gut. These nerves tell body organs to produce digestive juices, alert you to the need to go to the bathroom, or prevent you from having another serving of stuffing at the Thanksgiving table.
        The nerve network of the gut is so complicated that it is sometimes called the second brain. When the nerves are working well, you won't notice a thing: you eat without pain, you move your bowels with ease, you have no GI worries. But what if the nerves are not working well? Then, even if the process of digestion remains normal, you may frequently have symptoms like pain or a distressing change in your bowel movements, such as diarrhea or constipation.
        Once known as functional GI disorders, these health problems are now called disordered gut-brain interactions (DGBIs). When viruses and bacteria infect the gut, experts believe they may prompt a change in gut-brain signaling that can cause a DGBI like IBS to develop.
        What to do if you're noticing long-lasting gut problems after COVID-19 infection
        We still do not know conclusively if COVID-19 can cause a long-term change in gut-brain messaging that leads to IBS or other disordered gut-brain interactions. But increasing evidence suggests that GI distress lasting six months or longer might be a symptom of long COVID. While we wait for more evidence, some GI specialists, including myself, recommend trying approaches that help relieve irritable bowel syndrome and other DGBIs.
        If you are suffering from chronic abdominal pain and a change in your bowel movements after having had COVID-19, talk to your primary care doctor. Many health conditions have similar symptoms, including viral or bacterial infections, inflammation, or even cancers. A thorough exam can help to rule out certain conditions.
        If the problem persists, do not suffer alone or feel embarrassed to act! Seek help if severe pain or changes in bowel movements are harming your quality of life or affecting daily activities. Talk with your doctor about the possibility that your chronic gut symptoms might be a form of long COVID. Find out if they can recommend helpful treatments or suggest a referral to a GI specialist. As research continues, new information may be available.","Christopher D. Vélez, MD","March 20, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/safe-joyful-movement-for-people-of-all-weights-202303152902,"Safe, joyful movement for people of all weights","A simple word we all hear often — exercise — makes many people cringe. Unhappy childhood memories of school sports or gym classes, flat-out physical discomfort, guilty reluctance, or trouble finding time or pleasurable activities may help explain this. Additionally, for some people with obesity, fear of falling or injury is a high barrier to activity, recent research suggests.
        That finding has important implications for health and well-being. So, how can we make movement safe and joyful for people of all weights?
        Why be active?
        As you may know, being physically active helps combat anxiety and depression. It prevents bone from thinning and tones muscle, helps you sleep better, lowers your blood pressure and blood sugar, and improves your cholesterol levels. It would take numerous medications to do all that routine physical activity can do for you.
        Weight loss programs often incorporate exercise. Research shows that exercise helps with weight maintenance and may help with weight loss. Beyond burning calories, regular exercise also builds muscle mass. This matters because muscles are metabolically active, releasing proteins that play a role in decreasing appetite and food intake.
        What does this study tell us?
        The study found that many people with obesity fear injury and falling, which interferes with willingness to exercise. It followed 292 participants enrolled in an eight-week medical weight loss program in Sydney, Australia. All met criteria for obesity or severe obesity. The average age was 49; one-third of participants were male and two-thirds were female.
        At the beginning of the study, participants filled out a 12-question injury perception survey. The majority reported fear of injury or falling, and believed their weight made injury more likely to occur. One-third said that their fear stopped them from exercising. The researchers also recorded weight, height, and waist circumference, and administered strength tests during the first, fourth, and last sessions.
        When the study ended, the researchers found that the participants most concerned about getting injured hadn't lost as much weight as those who did not express this fear. Those who hadn't lost as much weight also tended to have the highest scores of depression, anxiety, and sleepiness.
        Fear of injury fuels a dangerous cycle
        As noted, exercise is healthy at every weight: it protects your heart, lowers your blood sugar, boosts your mood, and tamps down anxiety. It also builds balance. Weight-bearing exercise such as walking prevents bone thinning.
        If worries about injury or falls cause people to avoid exercise, they miss out on the balance-building, muscle-and-bone-strengthening, and mood-enhancing benefits of regular activity. They may be more likely to fall — and possibly more likely to experience fractures if they do.
        Find a blend of activities that will work for you
        Everyone, at every weight, needs to find ways to exercise safely, confidently, and joyfully.
        
          Start low and go slow. If you're not currently active, start by simply sitting less and standing more. Try walking for two minutes every half hour. If you're afraid of falling, try walking in place or alongside a friend or loved one who can provide security and comfort.
          Ask for guidance. Consider joining a YMCA where you can engage in supervised activities, or ask your doctor for a prescription to physical therapy to help you improve your balance and build your confidence.
          Try different activities to see what works for you. Walking is a simple, healthful activity, but it's not the only form of activity you can try. You might enjoy swimming or water aerobics. Try pedaling a seated bike or an arm bike (upper body ergometer) that allows you to stay seated while you propel pedals with your arms instead of your feet. Adaptive activities and sports designed for people with physical limitations and disabilities are an option, too. Depending on your fitness level and interests, you might also consider dancing, biking, or anything else that gets you moving more often.
        
        Lastly, keep in mind that many people suffer from anxiety, and a fear of falling is not insurmountable. If you're really struggling, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional.","Elizabeth Pegg Frates, MD, FACLM, DipABLM","March 15, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/slowing-down-racing-thoughts-202303132901,Slowing down racing thoughts,"Everyone has moments when their brain suddenly goes haywire. They repeatedly fixate on the same thought, like being stuck on a hamster wheel. Or their thoughts aimlessly bounce from one random topic to the next like a pinball.
        People often refer to these thought patterns as racing thoughts, and the most common cause is anxiety, says Fairlee Fabrett, PhD, a psychologist at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        ""People who struggle with racing thoughts are constantly worried about what needs to be done, what hasn't been done, and what is next,"" says Fabrett. ""Or they obsess about past, present, or future situations."" For example, you replay a conversation with different versions of dialogue, ruminate about an upcoming meeting with your boss or medical appointment, or worry about an unlikely doomsday scenario.
        ""When racing thoughts take over your mind you can't stay focused, and you feel trapped, which makes you even more anxious and stressed, and the cycle continues,"" says Fabrett.
        Breaking the cycle of anxiety and racing thoughts
        How can you break this cycle and keep racing thoughts from controlling you? Here are five strategies to try.
        Give yourself permission
        Racing thoughts are often made worse by the anxiety over having racing thoughts. To escape this, give yourself permission to experience them. ""Acknowledge that racing thoughts are just noise, it is what our minds sometimes do, and that's okay,"" says Fabrett. ""This gives you a sense of control so you don't feel helpless. When you put racing thoughts in their proper context, they feel less threatening and easier to manage.""
        Get mindful
        Practicing mindfulness can help change your thought patterns. For instance, try counting your breaths. Close your eyes and count to yourself as you take slow, steady breaths: count one on the inhale, two on the exhale, etc. When you reach 10, start over and repeat the process until you calm down. ""This is also a great remedy before sleep when most people's minds begin to ruminate,"" says Fabrett. Also, practice this breath work at times when your thoughts are not racing, so you will have the skill when you need it.
        Distract yourself
        You can sometimes break the cycle by distracting your mind. ""As soon as you notice yourself worrying again or thinking about things over and over, make an internal comment to yourself, like 'here I go again, with my list of thoughts that never ends,"" says Fabrett. Then make a conscious decision to do something else, like reading, listening to music, or calling a friend.
        Get moving
        It sounds like token health advice — exercise more — but movement is helpful for defusing anxiety. For instance, when an episode of racing thoughts strikes, do a set of push-ups, 10 jumping jacks, take a five-minute walk, or do household chores. ""These not only help break the cycle of racing thoughts but give your mind something else to focus on,"" says Fabrett. Also, try to build regular exercise into your life as well as these short bursts of activity. That can help relieve anxiety and stress.
        Schedule worry time
        Sometimes it's best to let racing thoughts run their course; otherwise, they may linger indefinitely. To do this, schedule worry time. When anxious racing thoughts occur, recognize them, but tell yourself that now is not worry time and you will deal with them later. Then at a fixed time of your choosing, do nothing but explore those thoughts and work through them. For example, write down the thoughts that come to mind without editing, including all the worst-case scenarios you can think of.
        ""You can also talk about them aloud and ask what makes you nervous and why,"" says Fabrett. ""This allows you to confront your anxiety head-on, but on your schedule without taking away from other activities,"" says Fabrett. Set a limit to worry time, like 10 to 20 minutes. When the time is up, you move on.
        If racing thoughts regularly affect your life or interfere with sleep, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. ""Frequent racing thoughts may be related to anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), trauma, or other mental health issues that need exploring,"" says Fabrett.",Matthew Solan,"March 13, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-electrical-brain-stimulation-boost-attention-memory-and-more-202303032898,"Can electrical brain stimulation boost attention, memory, and more?","Imagine this as a morning routine that replaces your first cup of coffee:
        You wake up feeling a bit foggy, so you slip on a wearable device that looks like an extra-thick headband. You turn on the power source and settle in while electrical current flows into your brain. Twenty minutes later, feeling more focused and energized, you start your busy day feeling grateful for this new technology.
        If this scenario sounds strange to you, I'm with you. And yet, hype around transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is growing for an expanding list of conditions such as depression, ADHD, and even Alzheimer's disease. A recent ad for one tDCS device urges you to ""elevate your performance."" But before you give this a try, read on.
        What is transcranial direct current stimulation?
        Brain stimulation therapies aim to activate or inhibit parts of the brain. tDCS has been around for years, but its popularity has spiked over the last decade.
        tDCS devices use headgear that may look like a swim cap or headband to position electrodes against the scalp. When a power source is switched on, the electrodes deliver low levels of electrical current to the brain. A typical session lasts 20 to 30 minutes and may be repeated over days or weeks.
        Three better-known brain stimulation therapies are:
        
          Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): A device worn over the forehead stimulates specific areas of the brain by changing nearby magnetic fields. TMS is cleared by the FDA to treat depression that hasn't responded to standard medicines, and for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
          Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): An electric current flowing through electrodes placed at specific locations on the scalp causes a brief seizure while a patient is under anesthesia. In use since the late 1930s, ECT can be highly effective for severe depression that hasn't responded to standard therapies. It uses higher levels of electrical current than tDCS. That's why it requires close medical supervision and is generally administered in a hospital or specialized clinic.
          Deep brain stimulation (DBS): Electrodes surgically implanted in specific areas of the brain generate electrical pulses. DBS is used to treat conditions such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, or tremors that don't improve with medicines.
        
        What claims are made for tDCS?
        The brain normally functions by sending and receiving tiny electrical signals between nerve cells. Stimulating specific regions of the brain with low levels of electricity might improve focus or memory, mood, or even dementia, according to tDCS advocates.
        Some claims say tDCS can
        
          improve mental clarity, focus, and memory
          increase energy and motivation
          relieve so-called brain fog following COVID-19, Lyme disease, or other conditions
          reduce depression or anxiety
          reduce cravings among smokers or people with drug addiction
          improve symptoms of ADHD or Alzheimer's disease.
        
        Does tDCS work?
        The jury is still out. Research suggests that tDCS holds promise for certain conditions, but techniques tested through research may differ from devices sold commercially for at-home use. For example, electrodes may be positioned more precisely over an area of the brain, and how current is delivered, session length, or number of sessions may differ.
        Currently, small, short-term studies show that tDCS may benefit people with:
        
          Depression: An analysis of 10 randomized trials found some participants were more likely to report fewer symptoms of depression, or remission of depression, after a course of tDCS treatment compared with sham treatment.
          Alzheimer's disease: A review of seven studies found that tDCS lasting 20 to 40 minutes improved memory and other cognitive measures in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
          ADHD: One randomized trial of 64 adults with ADHD found improved attention after 30 minutes of tDCS daily for a month.
        
        The FDA has not cleared tDCS for any health condition, and it is considered investigational. More research with positive results and reassuring safety data are needed before tDCS gets a thumbs-up from regulators.
        That's probably why some ads for tDCS note in fine print that it is not a medical device and is only for recreational use.
        Does tDCS have downsides?
        While the FDA assesses tDCS as safe for adults, there are downsides to consider. For example, treatment may cause itching, irritation, or small burns at the sites of the electrodes. Some users complain of fatigue or headache.
        There are no large, long-term studies of tDCS, so overall safety is uncertain. Some experts believe at-home use raises many questions, such as how much of the brain beyond targeted areas is affected, what inconsistent approaches to tDCS use might do, and how long changes in the brain — intended or not — could last.
        Very limited research has been done in children. So, the consequences for a child's developing brain aren't clear.
        Finally, tDCS devices can be expensive (several hundred dollars or more), and generally are not covered by health insurance.
        The bottom line
        It's not yet clear how tDCS should be used, or who is most likely to benefit from it. If you're interested in pursuing tDCS, understand that there's still a lot we don't know.
        If you're more skeptical and risk-averse (like me), you may want to wait for more definitive research regarding its benefits and risks — and for now, stick with your morning coffee to clear your mind.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/a-mask-thats-hard-to-shed,A mask that's hard to shed,"Since the start of the pandemic, many of us have contemplated the pros and cons of masks. Yet there's another type of mask that's been around for a long time but isn't as easy to peel off. It's called melasma, and 90% of its sufferers are women, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.
        Melasma is often dubbed the ""mask of pregnancy"" because its characteristic dark patches — which tend to cluster on the nose, cheekbones, and jaw — are even more prevalent in expectant mothers. But hormonal fluctuations related to birth control pills, menopause, and hormone therapy are also triggers, says Dr. Arianne Shadi Kourosh, director of the Pigmentary Disorder and Multiethnic Skin Clinic at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Melasma isn't harmful, but its stubborn splotches (known formally as hyperpigmentation) can certainly lead to emotional distress, Dr. Kourosh says. And some melasma is so severe it can't be covered with makeup. ""Patients have told me their melasma is ruining their life,"" she says. ""Some isolate themselves and don't want to go out in public because they feel so disfigured.""
        Insight into triggers
        Hormonal ups and downs work hand in hand with other factors, including genetics and darker skin tones, to make melasma more likely. But the chief co-conspirator is sun exposure. In recent years, scientists have also learned that ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun isn't the only offender, with blue light from screens and devices also contributing to melasma development. Even prolonged heat exposure (say, from standing near an oven) or air pollution (such as smog and car exhaust) can play a part.
        ""These harmful chemicals and pollution can corrode the skin's protective barrier and cause irritation that worsens hyperpigmentation,"" Dr. Kourosh says.
        Certain medications, including some antibiotics and pain remedies, can also make us more sensitive to light exposure and aggravate melasma. That's why Dr. Kourosh thoroughly reviews a patient's medical history when she diagnoses melasma, a process sometimes aided by devices that measure how deeply pigment is deposited within the skin.
        ""It's really a holistic picture,"" she says. ""I need to rule out other problems that can cause hyperpigmentation, including hormonal imbalances, medication reactions, or endocrine disorders.""
        
          
            
              
                Tips to prevent flare-ups
                Melasma can easily come back despite vigorous treatment, but you can stave off that scenario with these measures.
                Use sunscreen daily. Choose one with broad-spectrum protection, labeled SPF 30 or higher. Even better, mineral-based sunblocks shield your skin from all visible light along with UV rays.
                Wear a broad-brimmed hat. ""A multilayered approach to sun protection can make the difference in terms of people whose melasma gets better and those who don't,"" says Dr. Arianne Shadi Kourosh, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.
                Practice gentle skin care. Melasma can't just be scrubbed off, and ironically, skin-cleansing products may irritate and worsen it. Stay clear of products that sting or burn, and avoid harsh hair-removal efforts, such as waxing.
              
            
          
        
        Mainstays and new approaches
        Melasma can fade or disappear on its own, especially when the trigger causing it — such as a sunshine-filled vacation, pregnancy, or oral contraceptive use — ends. But you shouldn't try to self-diagnose or treat melasma without a dermatologist's input, Dr. Kourosh says. If you're tempted to use a nonprescription product that claims to lighten dark patches, you need a doctor's expertise on its safety and effectiveness.
        That said, various mainstay treatments and newer remedies are available. Options your doctor may recommend include the following:
        Hydroquinone. This skin-lightening substance comes in cream, lotion, gel, or liquid form. It works by destroying overly pigmented skin cells.
        Tretinoin and corticosteroids. Tretinoin is a retinol derived from vitamin A that boosts cell turnover in skin, enhancing skin lightening when added to hydroquinone. Steroids can lower skin inflammation. A ""triple cream"" (Tri-Luma) may contain all three substances.
        Acid-based lighteners. Incorporating azelaic acid, kojic acid, or other acids, these topical products gently slough off top skin layers to reduce dark patches.
        Tranexamic acid. Traditionally used to treat heavy bleeding, this medication has also proven effective in recent years against stubborn melasma, Dr. Kourosh says. But the pandemic dialed back its use somewhat, because one possible side effect — blood clots — is also a complication of COVID-19.
        Dr. Kourosh also red-flags chemical peels or laser procedures to treat melasma. Many ""medical spas"" advertise these techniques to lighten splotchy skin, but they're often staffed by workers without medical training who can't ensure results. ""These procedures can do more harm than good by heating and inflaming the skin,"" she says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/short-on-slumber,Short on slumber,"If you use an alarm clock to wake up, it's a good bet you're sleep deprived. But what if you feel fine when that buzzer, bell, or blast of music rouses you? You're probably still not getting all the sleep you need — the fundamental definition of sleep deprivation — or you wouldn't have required the jolt. You would have woken up by yourself already.
        ""You can keep eating when you're not hungry, but you can't keep sleeping if you're not tired,"" says Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        Most adults need seven to nine hours of sleep each night, according to the National Sleep Foundation, but more than 35% of American adults report consistently sleeping less than seven hours. Moreover, nearly half of Americans say they feel sleepy during the day between three and seven days a week — meaning they're likely not getting enough nighttime rest. Women have particular problems with getting sufficient sleep, regardless of how much time we spend in bed; our lifetime risk of insomnia (difficulty falling or staying asleep) is up to 40% higher than that of men.
        And things are only getting worse. ""When we examine the data that tell us how much people have been sleeping over the last century, it's clear we're sleeping less and less,"" says Dr. Ina Djonlagic, a neurologist at the Sleep Disorders Center at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Being short on slumber can make us dopey, sluggish, cranky, and forgetful. But consistently getting less sleep than we need can lead to serious health problems that go far beyond a day's bad mood. ""Sleep deprivation affects basically everything,"" Dr. Klerman says.
        Reasons for poor sleep
        Why aren't many of us sleeping enough? Some reasons are habit-based and therefore controllable. Often, Harvard experts say, we simply don't set aside enough time for sleep and allow work or other commitments to intrude.
        ""For some parents, bedtime is finally their 'me' time when they start to watch movies and do things they enjoy at the expense of sleep,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. ""And it's not just bedtime procrastination; some people get up really early to go to the gym to have time for themselves.""
        Some also carry a misguided sense of pride in not ""needing"" sleep, boasting about how little they get — as if it's a virtue. ""It's almost like a competition, and there's certainly this idea that if you sleep a lot you're a bit lazy and less productive,"" Dr. Djonlagic says.
        But some contributors to a lack of shuteye are indeed out of our control, making sound sleep an unattainable dream. They include
        
          pregnancy
          menopause-related night sweats
          certain medications
          sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome
          ailments such as chronic pain, cancer, depression, or dementia.
        
        Threats to health and safety
        Whatever the cause, skipping shut-eye can be disastrous. ""The immediate effect of sleep deprivation is a lack of alertness that can translate into more accidents in cars and other situations,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. About one in 25 adults falls asleep at the wheel each month, according to the CDC, while 6,000 fatal car crashes per year are due to drowsy driving.
        And a new analysis provides eye-popping insight into how our health can suffer for decades to come. Published online Oct. 18, 2022, by the journal PLOS Medicine, the study showed that healthy 50-year-olds who sleep five hours or less each weeknight have a 30% higher risk of developing two or more chronic health conditions over the next 25 years compared with peers who sleep seven hours. By age 70, that risk climbs to 40% in those with the same scanty sleep pattern.
        The study tracked nearly 8,000 British people from 1985 to 2016, none of whom had multiple chronic diseases at the start. A quarter-century later, researchers observed far higher risks of multiple conditions such as diabetes, cancer, coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney or liver disease, depression, dementia, Parkinson's disease, and arthritis in those who logged five hours of sleep or less.
        Other recent research has zeroed in on sleep deprivation's effects on specific conditions. A study published online Nov. 2, 2022, by The Science of Diabetes Self-Management and Care suggests that people who report trouble sleeping are likelier to have markers—including higher cholesterol, greater body weight, and more inflammation—that contribute to diabetes. The study involved more than 1,000 Australian adults (average age 45).
        There's also a higher risk of obesity among people averaging less than seven hours of sleep each night, according to a 2018 study in the journal BMJ Open Sport and Exercise Medicine. ""Hunger hormones are involved, but when we're tired or sleepy we gravitate more to foods that give us energy, such as carbohydrates,"" Dr. Djonlagic says.
        Our brains suffer, too. A study published in the November 2022 issue of Sleep that tracked more than 26,000 people ages 45 through 85 over three years showed those with insomnia faced greater risks of memory decline and dementia. ""We know there's a link between sleep and our ability to flush out brain toxins, such as amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. ""Sleep deprivation may also speed up the process for those destined to develop the disease.""
        Don't despair if you tend to operate on a sleep deficit. It might not be too late to turn around any deprivation-driven health trends, Dr. Klerman says. ""I want to believe if you start getting more sleep now, your body will begin repairing all the things that happened when you didn't sleep enough,"" she says.
        Tactics for sounder sleep
        Sleep feels good, so deciding to get more should theoretically be easy. But many of us don't cultivate the environment and set of habits known as sleep hygiene that promote sounder slumber. To accomplish that, Harvard experts offer these tips.
        Keep a consistent schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. But if there are nights you haven't slept enough before rising for school or work, it's okay to allow yourself to sleep longer on mornings when that's possible, Dr. Klerman says.
        Exercise earlier in the day. For some, exercising too close to bedtime can keep them up or fuel insomnia.
        Ease into sleep. ""We're good at helping little children do this by reading books and taking warm baths, but it's helpful for adults too,"" says Dr. Djonlagic. ""Light and stimulation are the biggest enemies to getting to sleep on time. Put everything aside and read a book in dim light or do something relaxing.""
        Use your bed for only two things. ""You should associate your bed with sleep or sex, not paying the bills,"" Dr. Klerman says.
        Ramp down caffeine use. This stimulant has a half-life of five hours in most adults, meaning your body will eliminate about half the caffeine you've consumed in that time, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. It's wise to avoid it after lunchtime.
        
          
            
              
                Why do we sleep?
                If sleep isn't a biological necessity, it's the biggest mistake evolution ever made. So said Allan Rechtschaffen, a pioneer of modern sleep research. His musings make sense, since by sleeping we spend about one-third of our lives inert, not reproducing or being productive in any other way.
                So why do we sleep? Scientists don't yet fully know the answer. But they do know that while we lie quiet, our brain and body are busy. Research has shown that this period of seeming inactivity serves to fine-tune physiological fundamentals such as metabolism, immune function, and more. We also process memories and wake feeling ready to focus on the day ahead.
                ""We think sleep serves multiple purposes,"" says Dr. Ina Djonlagic, a neurologist at the Sleep Disorders Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""It's almost like your body is processing things on a deeper level.""
              
            
          
        
        Skip the nightcap. Alcohol's sedative effects help us fall asleep quickly — but that effect wears off later in the night, making us more likely to toss and turn. More than one alcoholic drink each day lowers sleep quality in women by nearly 40%, according to the National Sleep Foundation.
        Put away devices. Blue light from cellphones, tablets, and computers can interfere with our circadian rhythm, the internal body clock that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Blue light–filtering glasses can help stem these effects, as can built-in filters available on some devices. Better yet, avoid using electronic devices for an hour or longer before bedtime.
        Let natural light in. Don't use blackout shades in your bedroom, Dr. Klerman advises. ""If you want to stay in sync with the world, you want the morning light to help you wake up,"" she says. Room-darkening shades can be helpful for people with chronic insomnia, however.
        Avoid using sleep aids for more than a night or two. It's tempting to take sleeping pills, but they carry major risks—especially as we age and are more prone to falls. They should only be used for a specific short-term reason (such as problems sleeping after a stressful event). Taken for longer, sleep aids tend to lose effectiveness within a few weeks and can backfire, disrupting sleep. People with chronic sleep problems can try a form of cognitive behavioral therapy that's geared toward insomnia (called CBT-i), ""which has been shown to work better than drugs,"" Dr. Klerman says.
        Another proactive step: try tracking your vacation sleep habits — the amount of shut-eye you log when you're not working for a week or two and are unencumbered by normal routines. ""That's usually how much sleep you actually need,"" Dr. Djonlagic says. ""Unfortunately, few people will make it a priority to get that amount during normal times.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/why-wont-my-hives-go-away,Why won't my hives go away?,"Q.
          I've gotten hives from time to time when I've been overly stressed. But now I have a case that won't quit after six weeks. What's going on?
        
        A. No one welcomes these red, itchy welts that crop up on our skin. Many things can lead to a temporary case of hives, including allergic reactions to food, medications, bug bites, pollen, latex, or animal dander. Like you, some people also develop them when they're stressed, or in response to ultraviolet light or excess skin pressure. Hives are more common in women than men, especially from our 30s to 50s.
        Most cases of hives go away within several days to a couple of weeks. If they last six weeks or longer, you may have autoimmune hives. This happens when your immune system mistakenly targets healthy tissue — in this case, triggering a skin reaction. Autoimmune hives are more common in people with other autoimmune conditions, such as lupus, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or celiac disease. Anyone whose hives last longer than a few weeks should see a doctor.

        Researchers recruited 60 people diagnosed with high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome, a cluster of conditions that raises the risk of heart problems and stroke. Participants were randomly divided into two groups. For three months, everyone did 30 minutes of aerobic exercise five days a week followed by either 15 minutes of yoga or 15 minutes of regular muscle stretching.
        Over the course of the study, people in both groups improved their resting blood pressure and resting heart rate (the number of heartbeats in a minute), although the yoga practitioners did better. Those in the yoga group also lowered their systolic blood pressure (the top number in a reading) by 10 points, compared with just 4 points for the stretching group. And they significantly reduced their 10-year risk for a heart attack or stroke compared with the stretching group.
        The investigators speculated that yoga's calming effect may be its advantage. They noted that other research has shown yoga helps decrease levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The results were published in December 2022 in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/try-this-take-a-seat,Try this: Take a seat,"Meditation can lower blood pressure, reduce stress, and improve concentration. But where to begin? Here is a simple meditation to get you going. Try it every other day for five to 10 minutes. and build toward a daily practice:
        
          Sit quietly in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take a full, deep breath, hold it briefly, and then exhale completely. Repeat several times until you reach a steady, calm breathing pattern.
          Relax all your muscles in sequence, beginning with your feet, lower legs, and thighs. Shrug your shoulders and roll your neck to the left and then right.
          Then on each exhalation, say to yourself or out loud the word ""peace,"" ""love,"" or any other short, positive mantra.
          Don't get discouraged when your thoughts wander (they will). Go back to the pattern of repeating the mantra each time you exhale.
        
        You can also practice brief meditation throughout your day. For example:
        Be mindful during chores. Focus your complete attention on doing routine tasks.
        Do walking meditation. Match your footsteps to your inhalations and exhalations. For example, take four steps as you inhale and four steps as you exhale.
        Take a moment. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths before starting your car or heading into a store.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-skinny-on-fatty-liver,The skinny on fatty liver,"The liver is your body's largest internal organ. About the size of a football and weighing around 3 pounds, the liver performs more than 500 functions. Some of its daily tasks include producing cholesterol, creating bile to help digest fats, and filtering deadly toxins from the blood. (Also, the liver holds about a pint of your body's blood supply at any given moment.)
        Despite its prowess, the liver is not invulnerable to illness. One of its greatest threats is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common liver disease worldwide.
        ""NAFLD affects about 24% of U.S. adults, but most of them are unaware of the condition, in part because it rarely causes symptoms early on,"" says Dr. Howard LeWine, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief medical editor of Harvard Health Publishing.
        Diabetes and obesity are the main risk factors for all forms of fatty liver disease. In fact, about 75% of people with one or both of these conditions have some form of NAFLD.
        Types of NAFLD
        NAFLD is an umbrella term that includes several forms of liver disease. Most people with NAFLD have a type known as simple fatty liver, or steatosis — excessive fat buildup in the liver not caused by overuse of alcohol, medication side effects, or genetic disease.
        However, up to 20% of people with NAFLD develop inflammation in the liver known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Left unchecked, this more dangerous form can progress into fibrosis (scarring) and potentially cirrhosis (severe scarring and liver damage).
        ""The exact reasons why some people progress to this inflammation stage is unknown,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""However, an abnormally large waist size reflecting greater amounts of visceral fat — belly fat that surrounds our abdominal organs — appears to be an important risk factor.""
        Simple fatty liver and NASH are often detected not from the appearance of symptoms, but rather from an imaging test, such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan, conducted for another reason, like gallstones.
        Other times routine blood work shows abnormal liver values, which usually means there is inflammation characteristic of NASH. But up to 50% of people with NASH have normal blood tests for liver function.
        Primary care clinicians now have readily available, noninvasive ways to identify people at higher risk for NASH and early fibrosis. These include biomarker measurements and scoring systems based on blood tests (like the NAFLD fibrosis score and the Fibrosis-4 index). ""The Fibrosis-4 index is a simple calculation based on common blood test results and a person's age,"" says Dr. LeWine. ""The index provides guidance regarding treatment and when to refer to a liver specialist.""
        Another technology, called elastography, uses sound waves to estimate fibrosis based on the stiffness of the liver.
        A weighty issue
        There are no specific FDA-approved medicines for any stage of NAFLD. Therefore, lifestyle modifications are the best approach.
        Because a majority of people with NAFLD are overweight or even obese, weight management is the No. 1 action people can take to avoid NAFLD and keep simple fatty liver from turning into NASH, says Dr. LeWine. Weight loss can also protect people from other health risks common in people with NAFLD, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease.
        ""Even men who are slightly overweight should be mindful about their weight, as any gradual increase can send them in the wrong direction and increase their risk for NAFLD,"" says Dr. LeWine.
        If you are overweight, weight loss of roughly 5% of your body weight might be enough to decrease the fat in the liver. Losing between 7% and 10% of body weight can reduce the amount of inflammation and injury to liver cells, and it may even reverse some of the fibrosis. Target a gradual weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week. For people with diabetes and those unable to attain their goal weight, your doctor may recommend drugs known to induce weight loss, such as the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide (Wegovy).
        Keep in mind that normal-weight people also can get NAFLD. ""Where your body fat lies, especially around the belly, is also a strong indicator of NAFLD risk,"" says Dr. LeWine. One way to measure potential risk is waist size. ""An ideal waist size for men is no more than half their height, so a six-foot man's waist should not exceed 36 inches,"" says Dr. LeWine.
        What you eat, how you move
        Although any diet that promotes weight loss helps NAFLD, a low-calorie Mediterranean-style diet is an excellent choice. This nutrition plan emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and olive oil. Limit red meat; eat more fatty fish and lean poultry instead. While you're considering which foods to add to your diet, follow the motherly advice to eat your vegetables. A 2020 study found a link between eating a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables (such as kale, cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts) and a reduced risk of NASH.
        Drinking coffee also may offer some protection from NAFLD. Some studies have found an association between regular coffee consumption (about three to four daily cups) and a lower risk of progression from simple fatty liver to NASH and fibrosis.
        Research shows that regular exercise, independent of weight loss, also can directly help prevent and manage NAFLD. An analysis in the October 2021 issue of Frontiers in Nutrition found that exercise can reduce fat throughout the body, and especially visceral fat, the more dangerous deep layer of fat associated with liver inflammation.
        Research suggests that both aerobic and anaerobic exercise (like high-intensity interval training and strength training) are good for people with NAFLD. One study found that 20 to 60 minutes of moderate aerobic and anaerobic exercise, done three to four days per week, helped reduce liver fat and reverse liver damage in NASH patients.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/a-closer-look-at-good-cholesterol,A closer look at good cholesterol,"Managing blood cholesterol levels is one way to avoid cardiovascular disease and protect against heart attacks and strokes. Doctors concentrate on helping men lower their blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol. Too much LDL in the bloodstream can create plaque buildup inside arteries. If this buildup blocks blood flow to the heart or brain, the result is a heart attack or stroke.
        Your goal level for LDL depends on your risk factor profile. In general, the lower the number, the better. If you already have cardiovascular disease or are at high risk for it, you should aim for an LDL of less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). For people at average risk, achieving a level of less than 100 mg/dL with lifestyle changes is excellent. You and your doctor can decide if you need a statin or other medication to lower your LDL further.
        But what about LDL's cholesterol counterpart, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the ""good"" cholesterol?
        ""HDL tends to get lost in the cholesterol conversation, but it plays a vital role in heart health, so it's important to also monitor HDL while you manage LDL,"" says Dr. Frank Sacks, professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
        When is good HDL too good?
        HDL is considered ""good"" because it does the good work. It patrols blood vessels, collects excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and artery walls, and delivers it to the liver, where it's removed from the body. This ongoing action prevents dangerous plaque buildup. Guidelines recommend an HDL level of 40 mg/dL to 60 mg/dL for adult men. ""A level below 40 mg/dL could mean that there is not enough HDL to do its job properly,"" says Dr. Sacks.
        Since HDL is deemed ""good,"" it would make sense that higher amounts equal extra protection. But research has found that this is not necessarily true, and that HDL levels beyond 80 mg/dL don't offer additional benefits.
        Higher HDL might not always be effective because it needs help to do its job. Research suggests that HDL's protective role depends partly on the levels of LDL and triglycerides (a type of blood fat that helps make up your lipid profile). One study that looked at people with both low and high HDL levels and those with normal and high levels of LDL and triglycerides discovered that for optimal protection against cardiovascular disease, there needs to be healthy levels for all three.
        
          
            
              
                Do you need advanced lipid testing?
                Doctors use lipid panels to measure cholesterol levels, screen people for cardiovascular disease risk, and monitor treatments. Yet, sometimes more detailed cholesterol information is needed. This requires advanced lipid testing to measure apolipoprotein B (apoB), the main protein in LDL. Research has suggested that higher amounts of apoB can signal greater risk.
                But not everyone needs this test. ""For the average person with high LDL or total cholesterol, the additional details won't materially alter their diagnosis or treatment,"" says Dr. Frank Sacks, professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. However, specific individuals may benefit, he adds. These include people who've had a recent stroke or heart attack without any apparent risk factors, such as high LDL, high blood pressure, diabetes, or smoking, and men diagnosed with cardiovascular disease before age 55.
              
            
          
        
        On the rise
        A standard blood test called a lipid panel measures a person's total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. Specific individuals may benefit from advanced lipid testing (see ""Do you need advanced lipid testing?""). The results help assess cardiovascular disease risk and dictate if treatment is needed.
        Addressing high LDL is always the first priority, but if you have concerningly low HDL levels — less than 40 mg/dL — your doctor likely will recommend lifestyle changes, according to Dr. Sacks. ""While a person's HDL level is predominantly determined by genetics, certain habits can cause HDL levels to drop,"" he says. Here are some strategies that people with low HDL should adopt.
        Exercise more. Moderate-intensity exercise, like brisk walking for at least 30 minutes three times a week, can help boost HDL. High-intensity interval training also can help.
        Lose weight. If overweight, aim to lose 5% to 10% of your current weight.
        Cut back on refined carbohydrates. Switch from refined carbohydrates (white bread, white pasta) to whole grains (oats, whole-wheat pasta, brown rice) and add lean protein to your diet, like poultry, tofu, beans, and lentils.
        Limit alcohol. Keep your intake, if any, to one to two drinks daily.
        Stop smoking. If needed, seek out medical assistance to quit.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-up-adaptive-sports,Taking up adaptive sports,"Regular exercise is a prescription for staying healthy and active as you age. But sometimes it's not that easy. Many older adults face an injury, illness, health condition, or disability that makes activities difficult, if not seemingly impossible. If you are in this category, adaptive sports could be a welcome opportunity.
        ""Eventually, almost everyone will experience some kind of disability that impedes regular exercise, whether it's mild arthritis, a joint problem requiring knee or hip replacement, limited vision, or a more significant physical disability,"" says Dr. Cheri Blauwet, an associate professor in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School and a former wheelchair racer, who is a seven-time Paralympic medalist and winner of both the Boston and New York City marathons.
        ""But thanks to advanced technology and supportive infrastructure, people can find almost any kind of sport or activity that takes into account their abilities and helps them stay active.""
        Wide range of choices
        Adaptive sports are competitive or recreational sports or activities for people with disabilities or physical limitations. They often run parallel to traditional endeavors but are modified to support an individual's needs.
        Name an indoor, outdoor, or seasonal activity, and there is a good chance there is an adapted version. Popular choices include cycling, skiing, archery, kayaking, rowing, tennis, bowling, swimming, basketball, and golf. (In 2022, the U.S. Golf Association launched the inaugural U.S. Adaptive Open as its 15th national championship.)
        Staying active is even more crucial for people with disabilities or limitations. ""Lack of regular exercise greatly increases their risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, diabetes, and cancer,"" says Dr. Blauwet.
        Adaptive sports also can support emotional health. A June 2019 Sports Medicine and Arthroscopy Review study found that people participating in adaptive sports and activities report significantly higher overall health, greater quality of life, and a more satisfying social life.
        Find your activity
        What kind of adaptive sport or activity you choose ultimately depends on your interests and level of function, says Dr. Blauwet. Here are some strategies to help find your best fit.
        Focus on your strengths. Don't focus on what you can't do but on what you can. Is running no longer an option? Try power walking using hiking poles for support. Can't fully use your legs? Focus on upper-body activities like swimming or kayaking.
        Explore  what you enjoy. ""There is a good chance your favorite activities can be adjusted to fit your needs,"" says Dr. Blauwet. For example, specialized golf carts can help you stand and stabilize your body while you swing the club. In sledge hockey, people with lower-body immobility use sleds to skate across the ice. Recumbent bikes (three-wheel bicycles that place the rider in a seated or supported reclining position) help cyclists who have balance problems or back issues.
        Join a team. Many adaptive sports have organized team leagues with adjusted rules and formats, like wheelchair basketball and tennis, and ""beep"" baseball and kickball for individuals with poor vision. ""These are a great way to build more awareness about your new endeavor and build a community with peers who have similar disabilities or limitations,"" says Dr. Blauwet. ""Plus, a little competition provides extra motivation to help you stay active.""
        Try something new. Use your situation as an opportunity to explore a new interest or try something outside your comfort zone, such as waterskiing, windsurfing, horseback riding, or rock wall climbing.
        ""It may be physically and emotionally tough to embrace adaptive sports and activities, as it can feel like your disability is magnified, but don't let that dissuade you,"" says Dr. Blauwet. ""Participation in adaptive sports is not a lesser way of living, but a way to live better.""
        
          
            
              
                How to find adaptive sports in your area
                You can locate state and local adaptive sports programs at the websites of the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability (www.nchpad.org, under the ""Directories"" tab) and the Challenged Athletes Foundation (www.challengedathletes.org.) ""These programs also can help you find mentors, coaches, and the support systems you need to be successful,"" says Dr. Cheri Blauwet, an associate professor in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-dark-side-of-daylight-saving-time,The dark side of daylight saving time,"On March 12, most Americans will observe the start of daylight saving time (DST) and ""spring forward"" by setting their clocks one hour ahead. (The exceptions are people living in Arizona and Hawaii.)
        DST lasts from mid-March until early November when the clocks turn back an hour and return to standard time. During DST, people can enjoy more time in the sunlight in the evenings. But that convenience comes at a price.
        ""That one-hour change may not seem like much, but it can wreak havoc on people's mental and physical well-being in the short term,"" says Dr. Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School's Division of Sleep Medicine.
        Go toward the light
        Research suggests that changing our clocks twice a year can have various health consequences. Of the two, springing ahead one hour tends to be more disruptive. That hour change can upset our circadian rhythms, the body's natural 24-hour cycles regulating key functions like appetite, mood, and sleep.
        Circadian rhythms largely depend on light exposure. The hour transition in the spring initially causes darker mornings and lighter evenings. Less morning light can decrease levels of the mood-boosting hormone serotonin. In contrast, exposure to light later in the evening can delay the production of melatonin, the hormone that helps you fall asleep.
        Many people also have trouble adjusting their sleep schedule to the new time. For the first few days or even a week, they may go to bed later or wake up earlier than usual, which can cause sleep deprivation. One study found that the average person gets 40 minutes less sleep on the Monday after DST begins compared with other nights of the year.
        ""Disrupted sleep can cause people to feel fatigued, groggy, and less focused,"" says Dr. Czeisler. This may explain, in part, the 6% rise in car accidents following the spring time change, according to a 2020 study in the journal Current Biology. Poor sleep caused by DST also can exacerbate existing problems like depression, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder.
        
          
            
              
                Is the end of daylight saving near?
                Present-day daylight saving time (DST) was officially adopted in 1966. Proponents believe the semiannual time change means people can enjoy outdoor activities longer, save energy by using less electricity for lighting, and perhaps have a positive economic impact.
                But DST has its critics. A 2022 poll found that 61% of Americans favored ending DST. Also, many sleep experts say evidence strongly suggests that staying on standard time all year is healthier. A bill to eliminate the time change has been introduced in the past three Congressional sessions but has not yet made it into law. It remains to be seen whether legislators will reintroduce it.
              
            
          
        
        Prepare for the switch
        People can take steps to make the hour change less daunting to their bodies and mind. Dr. Czeisler offers several different approaches:
        Alter your bedtime. About three days before the time change, go to bed and wake up 10 to 15 minutes earlier than usual. The next night, aim for 20 to 30 minutes, and then 30 to 45 minutes on the third night. ""By the end of this period, your body would have adjusted to that lost hour, and you won't have the stress of trying to quickly catch up on sleep,"" says Dr. Czeisler.
        Take afternoon naps. If you feel tired in the afternoons after DST starts, take scheduled midday naps for 20 to 30 minutes (napping longer than that can make you feel even more groggy).
        Get more light. During the first week after the time change, try to get about 15 minutes of exposure to morning light, which can help maintain your circadian rhythms. Another option is to use a light box that produces a bright white light. Choose a light box with 10,000 lux exposure (lux is a measure of light intensity). Sit about 12 inches away for up to 30 minutes. Keep your eyes open, but don't look directly at the light. Spend the time reading, writing, or just being present.
        Delay your day. For several days after the time change, postpone beginning your daily routine for an hour. For example, if you go for your morning walk at 8 a.m., wait until 9 a.m. ""Your internal clock is still running an hour behind, so you give it a chance to adjust,"" says Dr. Czeisler. Gradually shorten your start time by 10 or 15 minutes; within a week, your body's clock should be reset to the new time.
        Curb the alcohol and caffeine. Cut back on drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages several days before and after the time change, as they can disrupt your sleep.

A strong core supports heart health by helping you stay active, as many popular sports such as cycling, golf, tennis, and swimming depend on a stable, flexible core.
        
          
        
        Starting position: Kneel on all fours with your hands and knees directly aligned under your shoulders and hips. Keep your head and spine neutral.
        
          
        
        Movement: Extend your left leg off the floor behind you while reaching out in front of you with your right arm. Keeping your hips and shoulders squared, try to bring the extended leg and arm parallel to the floor. Hold. Return to the starting position, then repeat with your right leg and left arm. This is one rep. Aim for eight to 10 reps. Rest for 30 to 90 seconds, then do one or two additional sets.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/statins-vs-supplements-a-reckoning,Statins vs. supplements: A reckoning,"Your recent blood test shows that your LDL (bad) cholesterol is on the high side. Do you take a prescription cholesterol-lowing statin, or choose a dietary supplement that ""supports heart health"" from the myriad on display at your local drugstore?
        Many people choose the latter, which is a source of great consternation for most cardiologists. Why would people shun an inexpensive, safe medication in favor of capsules made from unregulated products in bottles labeled with vague promises? These concerns inspired a recent study (see ""Supplement standoff""). ""The results clearly show that if you need to lower your LDL, a statin works, and these supplements do not,"" says Dr. Christopher Cannon, editor in chief of the Harvard Heart Letter.
        Cardiologists usually only see people who already have heart disease, and for most of them, statins are a good idea because they lower the risk of a repeat heart attack by about 30%. But what about people without heart disease? Simply having elevated LDL cholesterol doesn't necessarily mean you should be taking a statin, says Dr. Cannon. He uses a person's risk score on the American College of Cardiology's risk calculator (available at /ascvd) to start a discussion about whether taking a statin makes sense. People with a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of greater than 5% might consider a statin, which the guidelines recommend for people with scores of 7.5% or higher, he explains.
        
          
            
              
                Supplement standoff
                Many dietary supplements claim to benefit heart health, but can any of the most popular ones help lower LDL cholesterol? To find out, researchers at the Cleveland Clinic compared a low-dose statin to six different dietary supplements. Findings from the four-week study, published Jan. 3, 2023, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, are summarized below.
                Who: 190 people, mostly in their mid-60s, with an average LDL cholesterol level of 128 milligrams (mg) per deciliter. None had cardiovascular disease, but all were at risk for it (see main story).
                What: Participants were randomly assigned to one of eight treatments: the prescription drug rosuvastatin (Crestor), cinnamon, garlic, fish oil, plant sterols, turmeric, red yeast rice, or a placebo. The rosuvastatin was given at the lowest available dose (5 mg daily). The supplements were given at doses recommended on the labels.
                When: LDL levels were measured at baseline and after 28 days of treatment.
                Key findings: None of the supplements lowered LDL levels, whereas in people taking rosuvastatin, LDL values dropped by an average of 38% compared with a placebo.
              
            
          
        
        Don't neglect lifestyle changes
        But he and other physicians agree that healthy habits — especially following a plant-focused diet and getting regular exercise—should be the foundation of lowering heart disease risk. ""For people without heart disease, lowering LDL is not an emergency. I give my patients six months to get a good plan in place and then see how their LDL responds to lifestyle changes,"" says Dr. Donald B. Levy, medical director of the Osher Clinical Center for Integrative Health at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. For some people, starting a statin reduces their incentive to exercise and eat well, he says. Rather than focusing on different ways to minimize their cardiovascular risk, including managing stress and getting sufficient sleep, they worry only about reaching a specific LDL target.
        Integrative medicine relies on a combination of well-researched conventional and alternative therapies, with a focus on healing the whole person. People who seek out this type of care are motivated to try nondrug options for a variety of reasons, says Dr. Levy. For instance, some don't trust ""Big Pharma."" Others are sensitive to medications in general and want to avoid them when possible.
        Suspicious supplements
        Dr. Levy's advice may include dietary supplements such as red yeast rice and plant sterols—but only under a doctor's supervision and using products tested and vetted by ConsumerLab.com, an independent testing company. Of note: The red yeast rice brand used in the recent study contains none of the active ingredient, a naturally occurring statin-like substance, Dr. Levy points out. What's more, with the exception of red yeast rice and plant sterols, none of the other supplements used in the study are even known to affect LDL. ""Taking cinnamon, garlic, or turmeric to lower cholesterol does not make sense,"" he says. You simply can't trust supplement labels, a problem the FDA is attempting to address (see ""Unproven claims on supplements for heart disease"").
        However, Dr. Levy also prescribes statins when appropriate and notes that compared to other statins, rosuvastatin (Crestor) is less likely to interact with other medications. Potentially harmful interactions are another reason Dr. Cannon is wary about dietary supplements, some of which can interact with heart medications. For example, high-dose garlic supplements may slightly raise bleeding risk when taken with anti-clotting medications such as warfarin (Coumadin) or clopidogrel (Plavix).
        
          
            
              
                Unproven claims on supplements for heart disease
                In November 2022, the FDA issued warning letters to seven companies for selling supplements that claim to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease. The agency released the following statement:
                ""Given that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, it's important that the FDA protect the public from products and companies that make unlawful claims to treat it. Dietary supplements that claim to cure, treat, mitigate, or prevent cardiovascular disease and related conditions could potentially harm consumers who use these products instead of seeking safe and effective FDA-approved treatments from qualified health care providers.""
              
            
          
        
        The bottom line
        After age 45 (if you're a man) or 55 (if you're a woman), get a blood cholesterol test every one to two years. Use the results to assess your risk and talk to your doctor, advises Dr. Cannon. ""Discuss whether you need treatment, and figure out together what works, but don't just try something 'natural' on your own,"" he says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-new-diabetes-drugs-your-best-shot-for-weight-loss,The new diabetes drugs: Your best shot for weight loss?,"A weekly injection that leads to dramatic weight loss without serious side effects almost sounds too good to be true. But several drugs originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes can help people shed as much as 20% of their body weight — far more than other anti-obesity drugs. Known as incretin mimetics, they also improve blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
        Not surprisingly, these medications are in high demand, especially semaglutide (for a list of these drugs and their brand names, see ""Diabetes and anti-obesity drugs""). This has led to shortages of certain formulations. That's just one of the issues faced by people hoping to take these drugs, which are costly — around $1,000 to $1,500 per month — and not covered by Medicare for obesity (although some private insurers cover them). Who's a good candidate for these medications, and what else should people know about them?
        
          
            
              
                Diabetes and anti-obesity drugs
                Poisonous lizards known as Gila monsters have a unique ability to maintain steady blood sugar levels even after long stretches of not eating. Venom from this colorful creature inspired the development of exenatide (Byetta), the first in a class of drugs known as incretin mimetics.
                Today, there are more effective drugs that mimic an incretin called GLP-1. These injectable drugs include dulaglutide (Trulicity), liraglutide (Victoza), and semaglutide (Ozempic); the latter is also available as a pill called Rybelsus. Liraglutide and semaglutide are also approved for weight loss, in formulations marketed respectively as Saxenda and Wegovy.
                The newest addition to this drug family combines GLP-1 and another incretin mimic, GIP. Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) was approved for treating type 2 diabetes in May 2022 and tagged for accelerated review for approval to treat obesity, which is anticipated sometime in 2023.
              
            
          
        
        Overlapping risks
        Up to half of all new-onset diabetes cases in this country are linked to obesity, a disease that now affects more than 40% of Americans. Both conditions are closely linked to cardiovascular disease. ""Many cardiologists now recognize that treating obesity is the best way to treat heart disease,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, who co-directs the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Other anti-obesity drugs help people lose only about 5% to 8% of their body weight. But the incretin mimics, which are similar to hormones made naturally by the gut and brain, have multiple effects. They prod the pancreas to release insulin when blood sugar rises too high, slow down the emptying of the stomach, and target brain receptors involved in reducing appetite.
        The newest ones, tirzepatide and semaglutide, can lead to remarkable weight loss and also lower HbA1c levels (a three-month average measure of blood sugar) by as much as two percentage points. ""Studies also show that semaglutide and liraglutide, an older drug, can lower the risk of serious cardiovascular problems, such as heart attack and stroke, in people with obesity and diabetes,"" says Dr. Apovian. A large trial to see whether semaglutide lowers heart-related risks in people without diabetes who are overweight or obese is currently under way, she adds.
        Who might consider these drugs?
        People with diabetes who are carrying excess weight are good candidates for semaglutide or tirzepatide, especially those at high risk for heart disease, Dr. Apovian says. For people without diabetes, the official criteria for prescribing the drugs are the same as for all other anti-obesity drugs: a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, or a BMI of 27 or higher and at least one weight-related health problem, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. (See the calculator at /bmi-calculator to estimate your BMI.)
        Taking these drugs involves injecting yourself in the abdomen or thigh using a penlike device with a tiny needle the size of a human hair. Side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, and constipation are common. But they rarely last longer than a week or so, especially if you start low and increase the dosage slowly while guided by an experienced physician, says Dr. Apovian.
        If you stop taking the drug, you'll likely regain weight. But that's similar to what would happen if you were taking blood pressure medication and stopped — your blood pressure would rise. ""Obesity is a disease, and we need to treat it like one,"" says Dr. Apovian.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/exercising-when-you-have-a-heart-condition,Exercising when you have a heart condition,"You just discovered you need surgery to replace a faulty heart valve. Or maybe you've had a heart attack, or were recently diagnosed with mild heart failure. Learning that you have heart disease is understandably upsetting. But don't let fear or worry keep you from taking steps to heal and strengthen your heart.
        ""For a lot of people, a heart attack is a wake-up call. But for others, it's more like a red light,"" says Dr. Hicham Skali, associate director of the cardiac rehabilitation program at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Instead of starting or renewing efforts to exercise, they stop or avoid physical activity. ""Some people believe that a heart condition means they should be careful and rest, but that's a major misconception,"" says Dr. Skali.
        Exercise is one of the most important things you can do to prevent all types of heart disease from getting worse — not to mention avoiding heart problems in the first place. ""As long as you're exercising safely, there's far more benefit than risk,"" says Dr. Skali. Your age, current fitness level, and diagnosis will influence what makes the most sense for you. But everyone can exercise, and even small amounts can make a difference, he adds.
        Cardiac rehab
        Many people with heart disease qualify for cardiac rehabilitation. The initial evaluation includes an exercise stress test, a closely monitored workout done on a treadmill or stationary bike that shows how your heart and body respond to exertion. The results can help your rehab team offer safe, effective suggestions for physical activity.
        Unfortunately, not everyone who qualifies for cardiac rehab has easy access to such a program, which typically requires you to attend a few times a week for several months. However, a hybrid program that includes some online sessions may be available (see ""A virtual approach to healing the heart"" in the October 2022 Heart Letter).
        Another option is to ask your cardiac surgeon, cardiologist, or primary care doctor to prescribe an exercise stress test, which can be reassuring for people who are worried about exercising, says Dr. Skali. If you're generally healthy, your doctor might decide that you don't need a stress test and can go ahead and start exercising on your own.
        After a procedure
        After any procedure, wait until your doctor gives you the green light to start exercising. After an angioplasty (a minimally invasive procedure to widen a narrowed or blocked heart artery), you can usually resume your normal activities after two days. If you had the procedure to treat a heart attack, you might need to take it easy for a bit longer. People often need a month or more to fully recover from open heart surgery, which requires sawing through the breastbone. But that doesn't mean avoiding exercise as you heal. In fact, a small study found that starting cardiac rehab just two weeks after surgery was just as effective and likely as safe as waiting for six weeks, says Dr. Skali.
        The good news is that people often have more energy and endurance after their heart is repaired. Take it easy at first, starting ""low and slow,"" especially if exercise hasn't been part of your regular routine, says Dr. Skali. Walking outside or on a treadmill for just five minutes at a time several times a day is a good way to start. Keep adding a few minutes to your walks every week or so, until you're up to at least 20 minutes a day. Pay attention to how you're feeling, and add intensity by walking briskly (or even jogging) for short bouts if that feels okay.
        Rest as needed
        Even people who've never exercised and have several serious health problems can still exercise. ""I have patients with heart failure and obesity who tell me they can't walk for more than one minute,"" Dr. Skali says.
        His advice: Put a chair at each end of your driveway or whatever short distance you can manage. Walk back and forth between the chairs, sitting down to rest when needed to catch your breath. Try to do four laps in the morning, and then another four laps in the afternoon. ""Even just 30 seconds at a time is enough to make progress,"" he says. And no matter what your fitness level, always stop or slow down if you feel dizzy, weak, or breathless.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/shift-work-can-harm-sleep-and-health-what-helps-202302282896,Shift work can harm sleep and health: What helps?,"We can feel groggy when our sleep schedule is thrown off even just a little. So what happens when shift work requires people to regularly stay awake through the night and sleep during the day — and how can they protect their health and well-being?
        What is shift work disorder?
        Mounting evidence, including several new studies, paints a worrisome picture of the potential health fallout of nontraditional shift work schedules that affect 15% to 30% of workers in the US and Europe, including factory and warehouse workers, police officers, nurses, and other first responders.
        So-called shift work disorder mainly strikes people who work the overnight or early morning shift, or who rotate their shifts, says Eric Zhou, an assistant professor in the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. It is characterized by significant problems falling and staying asleep, or sleeping when desired. That's because shift work disrupts the body's normal alignment with the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle called the circadian rhythm.
        ""People who work 9-to-5 shifts are typically awake when the sun is up, which is aligned with their body's internal circadian clock. But for shift workers, their work hours and sleep hours are misaligned with the natural cues to be awake or asleep,"" Zhou says. ""They're working against the universe's natural inclinations — not just their body's.""
        What's the connection between shift work and health?
        A 2022 research review in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine links shift work to higher risks for serious health problems, such as heart attack and diabetes. This research suggests adverse effects can include metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that raises the risks for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke), accidents, and certain types of cancer.
        ""The research is consistent and powerful,"" Zhou says. ""Working and sleeping during hours misaligned with natural light for extended periods of time is not likely to be healthy for you.""
        How do new studies on shift work boost our understanding?
        New research continues to add to and strengthen earlier findings, teasing out specific health effects that could stem from shift work.
        
          Shift workers on rotating schedules eat more erratically and frequently than day workers, snack more at night, and consume fewer healthier foods with potentially more calories, a study published online in Advances in Nutrition suggests. This analysis reviewed 31 prior studies involving more than 18,000 participants, comparing workers' average food intake over 24 hours.
          Disrupting the circadian rhythm through shift work appears to increase the odds of colorectal cancer, a malignancy with strong ties to lifestyle factors, according to a 2023 review of multiple studies published online in the Journal of Investigative Medicine. Contributors to this higher risk may include exposure to artificial light at night, along with complex genetic and hormonal interactions, study authors said.
        
        ""Cancer understandably scares people, and the World Health Organization recognizes that shift work is a probable carcinogen,"" Zhou says. ""The combination of chronically insufficient and poor-quality sleep is likely to get under the skin. That said, we don't fully understand how this happens.""
        How can you protect your sleep — and your health?
        If you work overnight or early morning shifts, how can you ensure you sleep more soundly and restfully? Zhou offers these evidence-based tips.
        Time your exposure to bright and dim light. Graveyard shift workers whose work schedule runs from midnight through 8 a.m., for example, should reduce their light exposure as much as possible after leaving work if they intend to go right to sleep once they return home. ""These measures could take the form of wearing blue light–blocking glasses or using blackout shades in your bedroom,"" he says.
        Make enough time for sleep on days off. ""This is often harder than it sounds, because you'll want to see your family and friends during nonwork hours,"" Zhou says. ""You need to truly protect your opportunity for sleep.""
        Maintain a consistent shift work schedule. ""Also, try to minimize the consecutive number of days you spend working challenging shifts,"" he says.
        Talk to your employer. Perhaps your boss can schedule you for fewer overnight shifts. ""You can also ask your doctor to make a case for you to be moved off these shifts or have more flexibility,"" Zhou says.
        Look for practical solutions that allow you to get more restful sleep. ""People engaged in shift work usually have responsibilities to their job as well as their family members, who often operate under a more typical 9-to-5 schedule,"" he notes. ""The goal is to preserve as strong a circadian rhythm as possible under the abnormal schedule shift work requires.""",Maureen Salamon,"February 28, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/parents-dont-always-realize-that-their-teen-is-suicidal-201902132897,Parents don't always realize that their teen is suicidal,"Parents like to think that they know what is going on with their children — and that they would know if their teen was suicidal. However, research shows that this is not always the case.
        Teens may consider suicide more often than parents realize
        In a study published a few years ago in the journal Pediatrics, researchers interviewed more than 5,000 adolescents ages 11 to 17. In those interviews, they asked them if they had ever thought about killing themselves — or if they had ever thought a lot about death or dying. The teens' parents were asked if they believed that their teens had ever thought about killing themselves, or had thought a lot about death or dying.
        There wasn't a whole lot of match-up. Half of the parents of the adolescents who thought of killing themselves were unaware — as were three-quarters of the parents of adolescents who thought often about death.
        This disconnect looms larger as research shows mental health problems are on the rise in youth. According to the 2021 Youth Risk Behavioral Survey, 42% of high school students reported persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness; 22% seriously considered suicide, and 10% attempted it.
        The numbers were higher for girls and youth who identify as LGBTQ+:
        
          Almost 60% of girls experienced persistent sadness and hopelessness; 30% seriously considered attempting suicide, and 13% attempted it.
          Among LGBTQ+ youth, 70% experienced persistent sadness and hopelessness; 45% seriously considered attempting suicide, and 22% attempted it.
        
        Many factors contribute to this. Stress and isolation caused by the pandemic clearly played a role. While teens are back in school, re-entry has been difficult for many. Social media clearly plays a role, inviting unrealistic comparisons, reinforcing negative thoughts and ideas, and encouraging doomscrolling. It is also a source of bullying: in the report, 16% of high school students reported being bullied electronically, including 20% of girls and 27% of those who identify as LGBTQ+.
        Why the disconnect between teens and parents?
        It's not that surprising that parents don't always know that their teens are considering suicide. Teens may not always realize how bad they are feeling, and may not want to tell their parents when they do — both for fear of worrying them, and also because of uncertainty about how their parents might react.
        Parents may miss signs of depression in their teens, or quite genuinely misinterpret them or attribute them to something innocent; after all, it's natural to want to believe that your child is fine, rather than thinking that they might be suicidal. And given how much drama can be intrinsic to the life of a teen, it's understandable that parents could misinterpret statements about death or dying as, well, just teen drama.
        What can parents do?
        
          Be aware of signs of depression in teens, and never ignore them. Acting sad is one of them, but there are many others:

	dropping gradesbeing irritable or angry oftenacting bored all the time, and/or dropping out of activitiesdifficulty with relationships, including changing peer groups or becoming more isolateddangerous or risky behaviorpersistent physical complaints such as headaches or stomachachesfatigue.
          Listen to your teen, and never assume that statements like ""nobody cares if I live or die"" are just drama. Instead of saying, ""You don't mean that,"" ask them if they do mean it. Often parents worry that asking about suicide might ""give them ideas,"" but asking may be the only way to know — and the best way to show your teen that you are taking them seriously.
          Learn how to have tough conversations about mental health and suicide. The American Academy of Pediatrics has many tips and resources for parents.
          Get help. Call your doctor, call a mental health professional, call the new nationwide number 988 that can link you to local help like a suicide hotline, or take your child to a local emergency room. This is crucial. If counseling is recommended, do your best to schedule it, letting your doctor know if you are having trouble finding a provider. Make sure your teen sticks with it.
          If you suspect your teen may be depressed or suicidal, take precautions. If you have a gun in your house, make sure it is locked up with the ammunition locked separately. Take stock of prescription medications and alcohol in your house that could be used for self-harm, and either get rid of them or be sure they are stored safely.
        
        Sometimes it is just drama — or short-term blues after a breakup or another one of life's inevitable disappointments. And in the study, half of the teens whose parents thought they were suicidal, and two-thirds of those whose parents believed their teens thought about death, said they were fine. But when it comes to suicide, it's always better to be safe than sorry. So ask the questions — and ask for help.","Claire McCarthy, MD","February 28, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/energy-boosting-coffee-alternatives-what-to-know-202302222893,Energy-boosting coffee alternatives: What to know,"When you're low on energy, is it worth trying yerba mate, yaupon tea, matcha, and other beverages invading the coffee and tea space that promise similar energy perks and health benefits? Often marketed as wellness drinks, coffee alternatives like these are trending, according to the International Food Information Council.
        So, how do a few popular alternatives stack up nutritionally? Do they rely on caffeine for an energy boost? Do they contain potentially healthy (or unhealthy) plant compounds?
        The basics on coffee and tea
        According to a National Coffee Association survey, 70% of American adults drink coffee, and 62% of those do so daily. Observational studies have linked compounds in coffee beans called polyphenols and antioxidants with health benefits, including a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Yet most of us probably don't drink it for those reasons.
        Coffee aficionados enjoy a caffeine energy boost that improves clarity and focus, and savor its fragrance and rich, deep flavor. Still, not everyone is a fan: caffeine makes some people feel jittery, and the caffeine and acidity can irritate sensitive stomachs.
        Coffee's cousin, tea, is the second most popular beverage globally behind water, and is enjoyed by a third of Americans. Most types of tea contain about half the caffeine of coffee (herbal teas have little to none) with less acidity. Tea contains health-promoting antioxidant compounds, such as flavanols.
        Caffeine comparison: 8 ounces of brewed coffee contains about 95 mg caffeine; instant coffee about 60 mg; black tea about 47 mg; and green tea about 28 mg.
        What to know about yerba mate
        Yerba mate (or mate) is an herbal tea from the Ilex paraguariensis tree in South America that has an earthy and more bitter flavor than other teas. It contains antioxidant polyphenols like chlorogenic acid, plus as much caffeine as coffee or more (80 to 175 mg per cup). Preliminary research suggests it might promote weight loss and lower blood cholesterol, but studies are inconclusive. Users report less fatigue and better focus — likely from its caffeine content — but without jitteriness.
        Downside: Certain processing methods of mate, such as drying the leaves with smoke, may introduce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons — the same carcinogenic substances that are found in grilled meats. Some research links drinking large amounts of mate over time with increased risk of certain cancers, including head and neck, stomach, bladder, and lung. However, unsmoked mate (which is processed by air drying) may be safer.
        What to know about yaupon tea
        Like mate, yaupon is an herbal tea. Native to the US, it has a mellow grassy flavor similar to green tea. It contains chlorogenic acid and antioxidants that are purported to decrease inflammation and boost energy. This tea has 60 mg caffeine per cup and also provides theobromine, a compound structurally similar to caffeine found in cocoa beans and many teas. Theobromine increases blood flow and may increase energy and alertness, but this boost is slower to start and lasts longer than caffeine, which provides a quick but short-lived boost.
        Downside: The combination of theobromine and caffeine may increase heart rate and interfere with sleep, especially if you drink a large amount of yaupon or sip it too close to bedtime.
        What to know about matcha tea
        Matcha comes from the same Camellia sinensis plant as green tea. However, unlike green tea, matcha is grown in the shade, which protects it from sunlight and oxidation and contributes to its bright green color and higher polyphenol content. Whole tea leaves and stems of matcha are ground into a fine powder, which is then whisked with hot water or milk. Matcha contains about 40 to 175 mg caffeine per cup and has the same antioxidant polyphenols as green tea, specifically theanine and catechins. However, because whole leaves are used to make matcha, it may contain higher concentrations than standard green tea.
        Downside: While green tea has low to moderate amounts of caffeine, matcha can have very high amounts, even more than coffee.
        What to know about chicory coffee
        Chicory is the root of the Chicorium Intybus plant that is dried, roasted, and ground to produce a beverage. Chicory contains prebiotic fiber called inulin that caramelizes during roasting, giving the drink a dark brown color with a nutty, sweeter, and less bitter flavor than traditional coffee. It tastes similar to regular coffee but does not offer the same energy boost, as it is caffeine-free. (Some people mix chicory coffee with brewed coffee for a lower-caffeine drink.) Animal studies show that chicory root has anti-inflammatory properties. Inulin may benefit the gut microbiome and bowel health, but the small amounts found in chicory coffee are not likely to provide such a benefit.
        Downside: The chicory plant comes from the same family as ragweed, so chicory coffee may cause allergic reactions in people sensitive to ragweed pollen.
        The bottom line
        Coffee-alternative wellness drinks may contain similar plant compounds to those found in regular coffee and green or black tea. It's fine to choose them if you like the taste. Just don't assume that they're healthier, because no strong evidence supports claims of weight loss, heart health, or cancer prevention.
        These beverages are best enjoyed plain or with only a touch of lemon, honey, unsweetened milk, or plant milk. Processing and added ingredients can negate any health-promoting effects from naturally-occurring plant compounds. For example, some research suggests that adding protein and fat to tea through milk or creamer can reduce antioxidant properties and might deactivate flavonoids. And even if natural compounds remain intact, saturating a beverage with sugar, half-and-half, syrups, or whipped cream transforms it into a dessert, neutralizing any potential health perks.","Nancy Oliveira, MS, RD, LDN, CDCES","February 23, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/age-and-muscle-loss,Age and muscle loss,"On average, adults who don't do strength training on a regular basis can lose 4 to 6 pounds of muscle per decade.
        Over time, loss of muscle strength can put everyday activities out of reach—activi­ties such as walking, cleaning, shopping, and even dressing. They hinder your ability to cope with and recover from an illness or injury.  Loss of muscle mass can also lead to dangerous falls, which may result in disability or even death. There are other specific health benefits to strength and power training, such as better blood sugar control and a slowing of bone loss.  
        Strength training can help you build muscle, make you strong, increase your endurance and make everyday activities easier. Most adults should do strength training exercises at least two days a week, according to the federal activity guidelines. Beginners should start with exercise bands or light hand weights. If you're more experienced, weight machines are a good option.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/a-pain-in-the-rear,A pain in the rear,"We're all born with eyes, ears, arms, legs… and the makings of hemorrhoids. While they're not what we think of as a body part, the blood vessels that pad the anus and rectum are nonetheless part of all of us — and one that few mention in polite company.
        These blood vessels only become problematic when they enlarge. Before that, they ""actually contribute to some of our continence — they hold things in place,"" says Dr. Anne Fabrizio, a proctologist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        But when symptoms emerge — ranging from barely noticeable to excruciating — they can disrupt our days. About half of adults have experienced some degree of hemorrhoidal symptoms by age 50. Pain, itching, swelling, and bleeding can progress to a point where hemorrhoids bulge dramatically and develop blood clots that prove agonizing, Dr. Fabrizio says.
        ""It's an incredibly common problem that can have a huge impact on quality of life,"" she says. ""But a lot of people try to ignore it for a long time, partly because it can be embarrassing, so they hesitate to bring it up.""
        Serious complications
        Hemorrhoids are classified into two types depending on where they're found. External hemorrhoids are visible at the anus, while internal ones are inside the rectum. The latter tend to produce painless, bright red bleeding with bowel movements, but not much pain, Dr. Fabrizio says.
        Because any rectal bleeding is concerning — possibly signaling colorectal cancer — you should see a doctor, even if you're unbothered and convinced internal hemorrhoids are the cause.
        Pregnancy is one of the top risk factors for hemorrhoids because it intensifies pressure in the rectum. Others include aging, chronic constipation or diarrhea, and obesity. But women are likely to delay hemorrhoid treatment in the years after childbirth — when the problem can flare — as they juggle family with other priorities.
        This is a mistake, Dr. Fabrizio says. Putting off care can lead to potentially serious complications as well as needless suffering for anyone with hemorrhoids. ""They may be uncomfortable all the time, in pain, and thinking of their hemorrhoids when they're supposed to be focused on other things,"" she says.
        When hemorrhoids get extremely large, mucus can seep out. So can blood. ""A worst-case scenario is that people can get really anemic,"" Dr. Fabrizio adds. ""They can have significant blood loss that harms their overall health.""
        Treatment strategies
        Drugstore hemorrhoid remedies are often the first thing people try when symptoms are mild. These include pain relievers, along with witch hazel pads and topical creams and ointments to reduce itching and discomfort. Shallow sitz baths and cold compresses can also bring relief.
        But while these tactics are ""great for symptom management,"" Dr. Fabrizio says, ""they don't tackle the underlying problem. They don't really make a hemorrhoid go away. That's why you should see a doctor.""
        Seeking care early also widens your treatment choices before the problem worsens to a point of needing more extreme — and potentially painful — options. One tool is prescription hydrocortisone suppositories, which can be used for short-term hemorrhoid inflammation.
        Most patients who see a doctor early and take steps toward having easy, regular bowel movements can often sidestep the worst symptoms of hemorrhoids — or even prevent symptoms from arising at all, she says.
        For internal hemorrhoids, the doctor may recommend a procedure to eliminate the hemorrhoid by cutting off its blood flow. One option is sclerotherapy, which involves a chemical injection into the hemorrhoid. Another is banding, in which the doctor places a small rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid. In both cases, the bulging vessel eventually withers away.
        For large, bulging external hemorrhoids, surgery called hemorrhoidectomy is the only permanent removal option. Dr. Fabrizio acknowledges the procedure is painful, but often worth it. ""I tell patients that hemorrhoidectomy brings short-term, guaranteed pain, but offers long-term symptom improvement.""
        Preventing hemorrhoids from enlarging in the first place is the ideal, of course. Dr. Fabrizio recommends preventing constipation by eating fiber-rich foods and drinking plenty of water. Also, avoid straining for long periods on the toilet and aggressive wiping, which can lead to more irritation.
        ""Hemorrhoids are something we've been dealing with for centuries,"" she says. ""Talking about them more would make people more comfortable seeing a doctor earlier, which would be a win-win.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/dont-buy-into-dietary-supplements-for-heart-health,Don't buy into dietary supplements for heart health,"For people without heart disease, low-dose statin therapy can lower LDL (bad) cholesterol better than six dietary supplements promoted to improve heart health, according to a study published online Nov. 6, 2022, by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.
        Researchers examined 190 adults ages 40 to 75 who did not have cardiovascular disease. Participants had LDL levels that ranged from optimal to high and a 5% to 20% risk of developing cardiovascular disease within 10 years. Everyone was randomly put into one of eight groups. One group took 5 milligrams of the statin drug rosuvastatin (Crestor), another group took a daily placebo, and the rest took one of six dietary supplements, each with a dominant ingredient: fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast rice. (These ingredients have been touted to have heart health benefits, including helping to lower cholesterol.)
        After 28 days, people in the statin group lowered their LDL by an average of almost 38%, while changes in most of the supplement groups were comparable to those who took a placebo. (The garlic supplement group actually saw their LDL levels increase.) The statin group also had an average 24% decrease in total cholesterol.
        The researchers noted that more than 28 days may be needed for these dietary supplements to affect cholesterol levels. Still, the findings support statins as the best medicine for lowering cholesterol.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-gut-healthy-heart,"Healthy gut, healthy heart","The gut is known as the ""second brain,"" as it produces many of the same neurotransmitters, chemicals released by nerves needed for communication with other nerves and tissues. The gut and brain are also connected through a joint partnership called the gut-brain axis that links biochemical signals both to and from the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system.
        But what about the gut and the heart? Do they have a similar connection?
        Research suggests there might be a link, but that it travels in one direction — from the gut to the heart — and that keeping your gut healthy can be another means to protect against heart disease.
        The gut-heart connection
        The gut is the primary home to trillions of microbes, collectively known as the human microbiota. These microbes help with digestion, manufacture certain nutrients, and release substances that have wide-ranging health effects.
        ""There's a complex interplay between the microbes in our intestines and most of the systems in our bodies, including the vascular, nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, all of which are linked with cardiovascular health,"" says Dr. Stanley Shaw, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Since diet plays a significant role in the composition of gut microbiota, what you feed your gut can therefore affect heart health — for better and for worse.
        One way the gut does this is with metabolites, substances the gut microbiota creates when breaking down food. One particular gut metabolite, trimethylamine (TMA), forms when gut microbes feed on choline, a nutrient found in red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. In the liver, TMA gets converted to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a substance strongly connected with forming artery-clogging plaque.
        Research has shown that people with high TMAO levels in their blood are more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those with lower levels. Since red meat is a main source of TMA, cutting back can stop the gut from making too much TMAO.
        In fact, a study in the September 2022 issue of Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology found that among nearly 4,000 people ages 65 and older, those who ate an average of 1.1 servings of red meat per day had a 22% higher risk of heart disease compared with those who ate less.
        The researchers pointed out that about 10% of this added risk could be attributed to increased levels of TMAO as well as two other metabolites — gamma-butyrobetaine and crotonobetaine — which also are made by gut bacteria from components in red meat.
        Fiber at work
        Fiber also helps support the gut and thus the heart. According to some estimates, fiber-rich diets can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as 30%. Fiber in the small intestine binds fat and cholesterol, decreasing absorption and lowering blood cholesterol levels.
        But the gut's microbiota also helps out. Fiber gets broken down by bacteria in the colon to form short-chain fatty acids. These compounds interact with specific receptors on cells that regulate blood pressure, better control blood sugar and body weight in people with diabetes, and dampen inflammation — all of which can improve heart health.
        Other supporting foods
        It's unclear whether eating other foods that improve gut microbiota — for example, probiotics (beneficial bacteria) found in yogurt and fermented foods (sauerkraut, miso, tempeh) — can also support heart health.
        The best advice for helping your gut help your heart is to follow a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean diet or similar eating patterns. These involve limiting red meat and eating plenty of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, all of which can have favorable effects on the gut,"" says Dr. Shaw. ""And if your gut is healthy, there is a greater chance your heart is healthy, too.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/dont-count-on-a-supplement-to-fix-high-cholesterol,Don't count on a supplement to fix high cholesterol,"Six types of supplements touted to reduce high cholesterol don't do the job, according to a randomized trial published online Oct. 19, 2022, by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Researchers (including Harvard experts) randomly assigned 190 people (ages 40 to 75) with high levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol to take either 5 milligrams of the cholesterol-lowering statin drug rosuvastatin; a supplement containing fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast rice; or a placebo (inactive pill). After four weeks, people in the statin group showed a 37% drop in LDL cholesterol, a 24% drop in total cholesterol, and a 19% drop in blood triglycerides. Meanwhile, people in the supplement and placebo groups didn't have any significant decreases in these measures. In fact, there were some adverse effects: LDL cholesterol went up for people taking the garlic supplement, and ""good"" HDL cholesterol dropped for people taking the plant sterols, compared with people taking a placebo. The study was brief, and researchers say it's possible it wasn't long enough to give some supplements a chance to work. But they also point out that the contents of dietary supplements vary and don't produce consistent results. They warn that supplements that are marketed for cholesterol or heart health are unlikely to be effective.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/poor-sleep-linked-to-a-common-cause-of-blindness,Poor sleep linked to a common cause of blindness,"Poor sleep is tied to many health problems, such as weight gain, mood disorders, and even dementia. Now, a large study published online Nov. 1, 2022, by BMJ Open suggests that poor sleep is also linked to higher risk for developing glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness. The study involved more than 400,000 people without glaucoma (ages 40 to 69) who were followed for 10 years. Researchers evaluated participants' medical records and self-reported sleep habits. People who had unhealthy sleep patterns (those who snored, experienced daytime sleepiness, had insomnia, slept less than seven hours per night, or slept more than nine hours per night) were more likely to develop glaucoma than people who had healthy sleep patterns. People who had insomnia or slept too much or too little had the highest risks for glaucoma — 13% higher than people without these problems. The study was observational and doesn't prove conclusively that unhealthy sleep behaviors caused glaucoma. So what's the possible link? Study authors say eye pressure increases when you lie down and when your sleep hormones are out of kilter (which occurs in insomnia). That might be a plausible explanation for glaucoma risks, since the condition is caused by increased pressure on the optic nerves, which connect the eyes to the brain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/bring-a-fuzzy-memory-back-into-focus,Bring a fuzzy memory back into focus,"If you're like most people ages 50 or older, your power of recall has lost a little wattage. That becomes clear if you often forget where you left your glasses or can't remember why you walked into a room. Those everyday lapses in memory are normal in middle and older age. Why is that, and can you do anything to change it?
        Age-related brain changes
        Subtle changes occur everywhere in the body as we get older, including in the brain. Some of those changes affect memory.
        For example, a brain region called the hippocampus (which plays a big role in learning and memory) shrinks a little, and structural and chemical changes in brain cells make it harder for them to communicate. That makes it challenging for us to concentrate or absorb and recall new information.
        Underlying conditions
        On top of aging, some people have health conditions that make it harder to concentrate or remember information. Examples include depression, thyroid disease, vitamin deficiency, migraine headaches, or medication side effects.
        Sleep deprivation can also affect your memory. ""To learn new information, you need to be alert so you can pay attention. But it's hard to be alert if you're tired,"" says Dr. Andrew Budson, a neurologist and chief of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology at VA Boston Healthcare System. ""And to store a memory over time, you need to consolidate it during sleep, when brain cell connections become strengthened. If your sleep is interrupted or of poor quality, the strengthening process may be disrupted,"" Dr. Budson says.
        Some memory problems can be early signs of dementia. While forgetting where you put your glasses isn't a concerning symptom, forgetting what glasses are for — or forgetting the names of family members — is something to take more seriously.
        If you suspect that you have a health condition that is contributing to a fuzzy memory, see your doctor to figure out what the problem is and get it under control.
        Sharpening memory
        Keeping the brain as healthy as possible might help slow age-related brain changes. The best way to do that is by living a healthy lifestyle: exercising regularly (at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise, like brisk walking), giving yourself the opportunity to sleep seven to nine hours per night, eating a Mediterranean-style diet, managing stress, socializing, and learning new things. These habits work together to help create new connections between brain cells, and to maintain existing ones, which keeps thinking and memory sharp.
        In addition, you can help keep your memory in good shape by practicing certain habits.
        For learning new information: ""Pay attention and put effort into the learning process,"" Dr. Budson says. ""Many people believe that they can learn information and retrieve memories while they multitask, but the evidence shows that they cannot. If someone is talking to you while you're checking your email or watching TV out of the corner of your eye, you're not likely to remember what they said. Write down the information, say it out loud, or repeat it back to the person.""
        For memory retrieval: ""It's important to relax and try to go back in your mind to the time and place when you formed the memory. Think about the senses that were engaged at the time. What did you see, hear, smell, taste, or touch? What were you feeling at the time? The brain ties those perceptions to memories as a way to help you retrieve them later,"" Dr. Budson explains.
        For overall sharpness: Make your brain work harder. Challenge it with exercises such as crossword puzzles. A small randomized trial of people with mild cognitive impairment, published online Oct. 27, 2022, by NEJM Evidence, found that people who did online crossword puzzles for 18 months had less brain shrinkage and performed better on memory tests than people who took part in online cognitive games that included memory, matching, spatial recognition, or processing speed tasks for 18 months.
        Dr. Budson isn't surprised. ""Many studies have shown that doing moderately difficult cognitive tasks is better for your brain than doing easy tasks,"" he says. ""A good crossword puzzle in particular causes you to use large areas of your brain to come up with the correct word, and that will, in turn, keep those areas of your brain strong. Finally, crossword puzzles — at least in my household — are usually a social activity, in that the person with the puzzle will frequently call on others nearby for help. And the more we connect with others, the more we'll keep our brain cells connected, firing, and ready to work.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-keeping-you-from-getting-a-good-nights-sleep,What's keeping you from getting a good night's sleep?,"Remember when you could crawl into bed at night and sleep straight through until the morning? Now you wake up several times each night, wondering if you'll ever slumber for long stretches again. This change in sleep habits, called sleep fragmentation, is a natural part of aging, and generally nothing to worry about if you can still get seven to nine hours of nightly shut-eye — the sweet spot for optimum health.
        ""The concern comes when sleep fragmentation regularly reduces how many hours you sleep each night or keeps you from waking up and feeling refreshed. In that case, something else is probably contributing to the problem, and we need to identify it and treat it,"" says Dr. Suzanne Bertisch, clinical director of Behavioral Sleep Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        The importance of sleep
        Sleep is the body's time for restoration and recuperation. It's when toxins are flushed out of the brain, tissue is repaired, muscles grow, memories are consolidated, and hormones are released.
        Over time, getting too little sleep or fragmented sleep impairs concentration and mood and increases the risks for obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cognitive decline, premature death, and possibly glaucoma.
        Sleep interrupters
        There's a long list of culprits that can interrupt sleep, and you may have a number of them, which compounds the problem. Here are some examples.
        Electronics. Electronic gadgets are conveniences of modern-day life. But they create inconvenient side effects when the light from smartphone screens stimulates your brain and keeps you from falling asleep, or when the noise from a TV show, music playlist, or podcast that's playing overnight rouses you from slumber.
        Bed partners. Do you have a bed partner who snores or kicks while sleeping? Are pets or children climbing into bed with you? You might not be able to sleep through the disruptions, especially if bed partners crowd you into uncomfortable sleep positions.
        Food or alcohol. Eating or drinking anything with caffeine later in the day (such as chocolate, tea, or coffee) can make it hard to stay asleep. So can a late-night snack: it tastes good going down, but it can come back up during the night as stomach acid that causes heartburn. Drinking alcohol in the evening also promotes interrupted sleep. ""Alcohol can help you fall asleep at first, but then it causes fragmentation as it wears off,"" Dr. Bertisch says.
        Underlying conditions. Many health conditions can keep you from sleeping through the night. Examples are sleep apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep), chronic pain, neuropathy (pain, numbness, or tingling in the hands, feet, or legs), hot flashes, stress, anxiety or depression, bladder issues that cause frequent nighttime bathroom trips, or tinnitus (ringing in the ears).
        Medications. Pills are supposed to help us cope with health problems, not cause them. Yet some medications interfere with sleep. Examples include some antidepressants, steroids, beta blockers to treat high blood pressure, and drugs that treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
        The sleeping environment. Is your bed uncomfortable? Is your room too hot? Is there light coming in through a window? These can all interrupt sleep.
        
          
            
              
                Tips for better sleep
                
                  Cut down on caffeine intake, especially after lunch.
                  Avoid eating spicy dinners or late-night meals.
                  Avoid drinking alcohol at night.
                  Two hours before bedtime, turn off electronic screens and turn down all the lights in your home.
                  Keep your bedroom environment dark and cool.
                  If you can't fall asleep, get out of bed, go to another room, read for 20 minutes, then go back to bed.
                
              
            
          
        
        What you can do
        If you frequently wake up feeling that you didn't get enough sleep, and if that's interfering with your day, it's time to get help. Your primary care doctor can look for causes of sleep interruptions and prescribe treatment if necessary.
        For example, treatment might be medication if you have heartburn, or a course of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) —a combination of specific behavior changes, such as limiting your time in bed, setting regular wake times, and using relaxation techniques.
        ""And often, despite how long people have had trouble sleeping, with behavioral changes, treating underlying issues, and at times using targeted sleep medications, we can improve people's sleep and improve their quality of life,"" Dr. Bertisch says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/easy-ways-to-keep-inflammation-in-check,Easy ways to keep inflammation in check,"A mattress, a toothbrush, and a salmon dinner: on the surface, those items don't seem to have much in common. But they all represent healthy lifestyle habits that help fight chronic inflammation, a persistent state of the immune system that's linked to many health problems. And the more healthy habits you practice, even simple ones, the better chance you'll have at thwarting chronic inflammation and disease.
        What is inflammation?
        Normally, inflammation is part of how the body responds to threats such as injury or invading microbes. The body sends special cells to attack and isolate invaders, clean up debris, and heal tissue and organs. It's an important system that kicks into high gear when we need it, and returns to normal when health is restored.
        But sometimes the immune response continues indefinitely, fueled by unhealthy lifestyle habits. A constantly active immune system does more harm than good. It damages tissues and organs, and increases the risks for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, heart disease, dementia, weight gain, heart attacks, and strokes.
        Fighting back
        Fortunately, for reasons we don't fully understand, certain healthy habits can counter chronic inflammation. A healthy diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, maintaining good oral health, and reducing stress all reduce inflammation.
        If those strategies seem too big to take on all at once, just start with small steps in their direction, such as the following.
        Eat fatty fish twice a week. Here's that salmon dinner we mentioned earlier. Salmon and other fatty fish (such as anchovies, halibut, sardines, and tuna) contain omega-3 fatty acids that reduce inflammation. ""Omega-3s disrupt the production of chemicals that cause inflammation by certain immune system cells. They may even help lower the risks for stroke and for the type of brain inflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease,"" says Dr. Robert Shmerling, a rheumatologist and medical editor of the Harvard Special Health Report Fighting Inflammation (/ui). ""But our body doesn't make omega-3s. We need to get them from food."" Other ways to fight inflammation with diet include minimizing processed foods and added sugars, and eating lots of fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, poultry, fish, and healthy oils (such as olive and canola).
        Get a new mattress. Does your mattress make you toss and turn? ""Even one night of disturbed sleep can spark inflammation,"" Dr. Shmerling says. ""It increases inflammatory substances in the blood. Regularly missing sleep contributes to obesity, which is also linked to inflammation."" If you suspect that the fix for your poor sleep is a new mattress (or maybe just a mattress topper), it's worth the investment. Getting seven to nine hours of sleep per night is associated with reduced risks for many chronic diseases, including dementia.
        Brush your teeth regularly. We're all supposed to brush our teeth twice per day, and floss them at least once per day. It's necessary to brush away the bacteria that can inflame the gums, lead to infection, and cause inflammation or infection elsewhere in the body. ""Evidence suggests bacteria can travel to the heart, lungs, and even the brain. Inflammation in the gums also is strongly associated with diabetes,"" says Dr. Tien Jiang, a prosthodontist in the Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
        Go for a walk. Aerobic exercise — the kind that gets your heart and lungs working, like brisk walking — is an important way to fight chronic inflammation. ""It helps reduce body fat, which contains inflammation-promoting substances. Exercise may also increase the production of hormones that help keep inflammation in check,"" Dr. Shmerling says. We all need at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week to stay healthy. If you've been inactive for a while, start with a five-minute daily walk and work your way up to 20 or 30 minutes a day. If you have heart disease or are at increased risk for it, check with your doctor about your best exercise program.
        Do some deep-breathing exercises. Feeling stressed? Chronic stress promotes inflammation and is linked to several chronic inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, depression, and inflammatory bowel disease.
        To reduce stress, practice relaxation-promoting exercises, such as yoga or deep breathing. ""Studies have found that people who take part in those types of exercise have less stress and fewer inflammatory markers in the blood,"" Dr. Shmerling says. An easy deep-breathing exercise: Sit quietly, take a deep breath, and hold it for a count of three. Breathe out, then pause for a count of three. Continue for one minute. Make sure you feel your belly rising and falling with each breath, so you know you're breathing deeply.
        Will it really work?
        Practicing just one of these simple strategies probably won't be enough to ward off all chronic inflammation. ""For example, we don't have convincing evidence that an individual food choice, such as salmon, will make a meaningful difference against chronic inflammation if processed foods and sugary drinks — which promote inflammation — are still part of your diet,"" Dr. Shmerling says. ""But you have to start somewhere. If that's swapping out an unhealthy meal for a healthier one, you're on the right track. Then add another healthy habit, and another. The combined effects of those habits will eventually add up and keep you healthier.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/whats-the-minimum-amount-of-exercise-i-need-each-week,What's the minimum amount of exercise I need each week?,"Q.
          You're always writing that regular physical activity improves our health. I believe you. But I don't particularly like to exercise. So what's the minimum I need to do to get a benefit?
        
        A. You're not alone in disliking exercise: only 20% of middle-aged and older adults spend even 15 minutes per week in vigorous physical activity. By ""vigorous physical activity,"" I mean activity in which it is hard to talk or sing when you do it, like jogging or exercising on a treadmill.
        What's the minimum you really should do? I have some good news. A recent study conducted by scientists around the world, including colleagues here at Harvard, concludes that you don't need that much physical activity each week to gain substantial health benefits.
        The study enrolled nearly 72,000 people (most between 50 and 80 years old). All of them were free of diagnosed heart disease or cancer at the start of the study. A strength of the study was that the amount of vigorous physical activity people did was tracked by a device that measured their actual level of activity. (Many past studies just relied on participants to report their physical activity, which can be inaccurate.) The study participants' health was followed over the next five years.
        Even the people who did only 15 minutes per week of vigorous physical activity had a 17% lower risk of death from any cause and death from cancer compared with people who were inactive. With about 50 minutes per week, death from any cause was reduced by 36%. The reduction in risk of death from all causes, and death from cancer, was greatest in the first 40 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week. In contrast, death from heart disease continued to decline substantially with each additional minute beyond 40 minutes.
        For me, there are several important messages from this study. If vigorous physical activity doesn't immediately appeal to you, moderate physical activity like brisk walking—for at least 150 minutes per week, and ideally 300 minutes per week—also has proven health benefits. But if you're up for at least trying some vigorous physical activity, aim for 40 minutes per week—unless you're at increased risk for heart disease, in which case you should strive for more. Your activity does not have to be done all at once. It can be done in short bursts that add up over the week to your goal. Some of these short bursts can be things you are doing anyway, like climbing stairs.
        And if you're someone like me who enjoys physical activity because you feel good during and after that activity, be as active as you can be: you get additional health benefits with each additional minute. It's the best return on investment you'll ever get.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sugary-drinks-may-raise-levels-of-unhealthy-blood-fats,Sugary drinks may raise levels of unhealthy blood fats,"A new study links sugary drinks — the biggest source of added sugar in the American diet — to higher levels of LDL cholesterol and other unhealthy fats in the bloodstream.
        Published in the November 2022 issue of The Journal of Nutrition, the study relied on nutrition and health data from more than 29,000 people involved in two long-running studies. Researchers focused on the participants' intake of regular sodas, lemonade, fruit drinks, and other sugar-sweetened beverages. Higher intakes (more than one 12-ounce serving per day) were linked to increased levels of unhealthy blood fats (lipids), including LDL (bad) cholesterol, triglycerides, and other lipids associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
        Although the results don't prove that sugary drinks cause blood lipids to rise, they are consistent with earlier research on this topic.

But if you don't have any, you can use cans of soup, full plastic water bottles, or any other easy-to-hold item that feels like an appropriate weight. Start with fairly light weights — maybe 2 to 5 pounds each. As you get stronger, switch to heavier weights.
        Starting position: Stand tall with your feet about shoulder-width apart, your chest lifted, and your shoulders back and down. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your arms down at your sides and your palms facing forward.
        Movement: Slowly bend your elbows, lifting the dumbbells toward your shoulders. Hold. Slowly lower the dumbbells, straightening your arms back to the starting position. Repeat this movement to complete eight to 12 curls. Rest for 30 to 90 seconds, then do one or two additional sets.
        
          Tips and techniques:
        
        
          Tighten your abdominal muscles.
          Keep your spine neutral and your shoulders down and back.
          Hold your upper arms still, with your elbows close to your sides.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-latest-on-lipoprotein-a-an-inherited-cause-of-early-heart-disease,"The latest on lipoprotein(a), an inherited cause of early heart disease","About one in five people has high blood levels of fatty particles called lipoprotein(a), which doctors refer to as ""L-P-little a"" or Lp(a). Think of it as the evil twin of the familiar low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as ""bad"" cholesterol.
        ""Lp(a) particles are similar to LDL particles but with an apolipoprotein(a) molecule wrapped around each one,"" says cardiologist Dr. Christopher Cannon, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Lp(a) accelerates the buildup of fatty plaque inside arteries and inflammation even more than LDL does. A high Lp(a) level may double or even triple a person's risk of a heart attack. It also raises the risk of stroke and is linked to a narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis).
        So why have most people never even heard of Lp(a)?
        For starters, Lp(a) isn't picked up by a standard cholesterol test. You can get a separate Lp(a) blood test, but doctors haven't routinely recommended it because currently there aren't any FDA-approved drugs to lower elevated Lp(a). And because Lp(a) levels are largely genetically determined, eating and exercise habits are believed to have virtually no effect on the level in your bloodstream.
        
          
            
              
                Novel RNA-based drugs lower Lp(a)
                The burgeoning field of RNA therapeutics uses a small piece of genetic material to interfere with and silence unwanted genes. Currently, three RNA-based drugs that shut off the gene that makes Lp(a) in liver cells are in clinical trials. The drugs, called pelacarsen, olpasiran, and SLN30, are given by injection just once every one to six months. So far, studies suggest they can lower Lp(a) levels dramatically — between 70% and 100%. The side effects appear to be limited to mild, short-lived pain at the injection site. For now, it's too soon to know whether lowering Lp(a) will prevent heart attacks and related problems, but that evidence should be available within several years.
              
            
          
        
        Testing and treatment trends
        But recent clinical trials of several investigational drugs have shown promising results (see ""Novel RNA-based drugs lower Lp(a)""), which have raised awareness of Lp(a). In Europe and Canada, guidelines already recommend that everyone get tested for Lp(a) at least once in their lives. In the United States, the recommendations are more conservative, with testing suggested for the following groups:
        
          people with premature cardiovascular disease, defined as people who've had a heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or aortic stenosis before age 55 (for men) or 65 (for women)
          people who have a father, mother, sister, or brother with premature cardiovascular disease
          people with very high LDL cholesterol (190 mg/dL or higher)
          close relatives (siblings, children, and parents) of anyone with an elevated Lp(a) level.
        
        However, growing numbers of cardiologists support more widespread Lp(a) testing. ""I'm now measuring it in most of my patients who have or are at high risk for cardiovascular disease,"" says Dr. Cannon. People with high Lp(a) levels often have close family members who suffered a heart attack or stroke in their 50s or even earlier. Some of these people appear to be unlikely candidates for developing heart disease because they don't have any traditional risk factors, such as high LDL cholesterol, diabetes, or high blood pressure.
        A risk enhancer
        But many others have one or more of those risk factors, and the high Lp(a) adds to their overall vulnerability to heart problems, says Dr. Cannon. ""We think of high Lp(a) as a risk-enhancing factor that may warrant more intensive LDL lowering, in addition to paying close attention to a healthy lifestyle,"" he says. That means eating a mostly plant-based diet, getting regular exercise and sufficient sleep, and managing stress. Some people might benefit from aspirin and LDL-reducing drugs to lower their risk (see ""The changing landscape of LDL-lowering drugs"" in the April 2022 Heart Letter). People with high Lp(a) should consult a cardiologist for specific advice, says Dr. Cannon. They should also suggest Lp(a) testing for their close family members.
        ""I have patients who are in their 30s and 40s who find out they have high Lp(a) and are worried,"" says Dr. Cannon. He reassures them that he's optimistic there will be an effective therapy soon.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/pouring-from-an-empty-cup-three-ways-to-refill-emotionally-202301262882,Pouring from an empty cup? Three ways to refill emotionally,"It's hard to care about anything when you feel exhausted, burned out, or ragged around the edges. Your once-fiery enthusiasm may seem more like charred rubble due to overwhelming family responsibilities, a job that drains you, or financial struggles. Or maybe an illness, the uncertainty and disruptions of the age we live in, or a combination of factors has left you feeling as if you have precious little to give.
        ""What you're experiencing is burnout. It's real and it can lead to depression, anxiety, relationship damage, and an inability to function at home or at work,"" says Dr. Marni Chanoff, an integrative psychiatrist with Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        Take heart: With time and effort, you can refill your cup, slowly adding back a bit of the energy and joie de vivre you've been missing. Here are three ways to start.
        1. Carve out time for yourself
        Taking time for yourself isn't a luxury; it's essential to self-care. ""You need to slow down and give yourself the opportunity to rest and rejuvenate,"" Dr. Chanoff says, ""Schedule it if you have to, starting with 10 or 15 minutes, a couple of times a day.""
        How can you reclaim precious minutes in an overly full schedule? ""Look at your day, week, or month, and be discerning about how many things you say 'yes' to in one period of time. Give yourself permission to say 'no thank you' to things that deplete you or don't serve you,"" Dr. Chanoff says.
        Make small moments count: choose what makes you feel at peace. For example, have a cup of tea, or simply lay a blanket or mat on the floor at home or work and lie on your back. Don't look at your phone or email. ""You want to tell your body to take a break. It helps you reset and back away when stress draws you in,"" Dr. Chanoff explains.
        2. Commit to better health
        A strong body helps balance the stressful situations that have caused your burnout. The basic recipe for good health includes:
        
          Exercise. Moderate intensity exercise, the kind that works the heart and lungs, releases important chemicals that help regulate mood, sleep, and many body systems. Aim for at least 150 minutes of exercise per week, which amounts to about 22 minutes a day. Start with just a few minutes a day if it's all you can do. It doesn't have to be fancy. ""It can be any movement that brings you joy, like dancing, yoga, or brisk walking,"" Dr. Chanoff suggests.
          A good diet. Eating lots of junk food (typically full of sugar, salt, and unhealthy saturated fat) fuels chronic stress, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. Choose more unprocessed foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, lean proteins (fish or poultry), and unsaturated fats (such as avocados or olive oil). If time is an issue, Chanoff suggests batch-cooking simple, healthy foods you can have several days of the week. (Lentil or bean soup is a good one-pot meal. Throw in as many vegetables as you can.)
          Sleep. Insufficient sleep affects overall health, concentration, and mood. Try to sleep seven to nine hours per night. ""It helps to wind down an hour or two before you fall asleep. And practice good sleep hygiene: turn off your phone, keep your room cool and dark, and go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day,"" Dr. Chanoff advises.
        
        3. Surround yourself with comfort
        Hygge (pronounced HOO-ga) is the Danish concept of cozy comfort that brings happiness and contentment. Folks in Denmark know a thing or two about finding sunshine in cold dark months.
        To practice hygge, surround yourself with people, activities, and things that make you feel cozy, loved, happy, or content. Go simple: spend time with your favorite people, add a small vase of flowers to your space, don fuzzy slippers once home, eat a treasured comfort food, or listen to a favorite song.
        More ideas to try:
        
          Light a candle.
          Get under a heated blanket.
          Frame a photo of a happy time.
          Have breakfast in bed.
          Use pretty table linens.
          Indulge in art (check out various works at museums online).
          Stand still outside to listen to the sounds of nature.
          Curl up in a cozy chair.
          Window-shop in your favorite store.
          Wear a soft sweater that feels good on your skin.
          Use a silk or satin pillowcase on your bed pillow.
          Take a warm bath.
          Get an oil diffuser with a scent that reminds you of a place you love, like the beach or a pine forest.
        
        Turn up the effect by savoring cozy comfort. How does it feel, taste, smell, or sound? ""Engaging the senses with soothing stimulation can be nourishing. It counteracts ongoing stress that the nervous system endures, and may help to elicit the relaxation response — the opposite of the fight or flight [stress] response,"" Dr. Chanoff explains. Breathing deeply will help, too.
        Eventually, these bits of hygge, health, and personal time will give you something you probably haven't allowed yourself in a while, and that's compassion. Be gentle with yourself. Pamper your soul and replenish your cup, so you can continue being there for the important people and tasks in your life.",Heidi Godman,"January 26, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/do-we-feel-pain-more-at-night-202301182877,Do we feel pain more at night?,"As many as one in five adults in the US — 50.2 million — experience chronic pain, according to a recent survey. These people usually encounter fluctuations in pain during the day: sometimes it's better in the morning and worse in the afternoon, or the opposite.
        But what happens when the sun sets? Some research — supported by many chronic pain sufferers — suggests chronic pain worsens at night.
        ""The end of the day doesn't mean people necessarily get a break from flare-ups,"" says Ellen Slawsby, director of pain services at Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. ""In some cases, nighttime is when pain is the worst and can drastically interfere with sleep.""
        What is chronic pain?
        Chronic pain is defined as pain that lasts at least two to three months, often long after a person has recovered from the original injury or illness. The pain may even become a permanent issue. It can strike individual joints or muscles, or affect only certain areas of the body like the back and neck. Persistent pain may be more diffuse from conditions such as arthritis or fibromyalgia.
        Symptoms and severity of chronic pain vary and can include a dull ache; shooting, burning, stabbing, or electric shock–like pain; and sensations of tingling and numbness.
        Why might chronic pain increase at night?
        There are several reasons why pain might worsen at night. Hormones could be a major factor, says Slawsby. ""Nighttime is when the production of the anti-inflammatory hormone cortisol is at its lowest.""
        New research also has suggested that pain may follow a circadian rhythm like the body's internal 24-clock that regulates our sleep-wake cycle. ""This helps explain why some people regularly have higher pain levels at certain times, such as during the night,"" says Slawsby.
        While there is no good time for chronic pain, nighttime is especially problematic, as it disrupts sleep. Insufficient sleep affects our ability to manage pain. And sleep problems are common among people with chronic pain. At least 50% of people with insomnia (the most commonly diagnosed sleep disorder) suffer from chronic pain.
        ""Insomnia can lead to sleep deprivation, which increases the release of proteins called cytokines that are involved in the body's inflammatory response and makes people even more sensitive to pain,"" says Slawsby.
        Ways to get the rest you need if pain at night is a problem
        If pain at night has been keeping you awake, trying these strategies may help you sleep better.
        
          Do a pre-bedtime relaxation routine. A soothing transition from a hectic day can help prepare your body and mind for sleep. ""Spend at least 20 minutes before bedtime focused on relaxation, which helps slow the heart and breathing rate, decrease cortisol levels, and lower the chance of flare-ups occurring,"" says Slawsby. For example:

	take a warm or cool showerperform a series of gentle stretches or yoga posesdo several minutes of deep breathing exercises.
          Create a healthy sleep environment. Make your bedroom as dark as possible and keep it cool (the ideal temperature is 65º Fahrenheit). Consider a sound machine that plays relaxing white noise or nature sounds. ""Also, use comfortable pillows and supports for areas that have pain, like under your knees if you have back pain,"" says Slawsby. Consistent routines and tools like cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia can also help improve your sleep.
          Reframe your thoughts. People with chronic pain often worry about when their pain will occur, which can further increase stress and anxiety. ""If you fear not falling asleep because of your pain, remind yourself that you've slept well in the past and can do so again,"" says Slawsby. ""If chronic pain does strike at night, remind yourself that it will go away soon, just as before. It's difficult to change this mindset, but engaging in more positive thinking is important in mitigating pain.""
        
        If pain wakes you up, allow your body time to recover so you can fall back to sleep. Listen to soft music or read, though preferably not on blue light–emitting electronic devices (computers, tablets, and smartphones) that affect sleep cycles. Another option is to count your breaths. Close your eyes and do a simple breathing exercise where you inhale while mentally counting to one, exhale while counting to two, and continue this pattern until you reach 10. Repeat as necessary. This can move your focus away from the pain and help relax the body. ""Most of the time, you will fall back to sleep after a short while,"" says Slawsby.",Matthew Solan,"January 18, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/time-for-a-diabetes-tune-up-202301132875,Time for a diabetes tune-up,"At nearly 300 pages long, the recently released 2023 American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care are quite comprehensive. And given the strong link between obesity and diabetes, one major theme is weight loss. For the estimated 37 million Americans currently living with diabetes, what other changes are worth noting?
        Collaborating on lifestyle change is key
        There aren't any dramatic shifts in this update, says Harvard Medical School professor Dr. David M. Nathan, who co-authored and chaired earlier versions of some of the guidelines, which have been published annually for more than three decades. ""Most of the standard lifestyle advice for managing diabetes are the same common-sense things your grandmother told you: eat your vegetables, go outside and exercise, and get enough sleep.""
        One subtle shift in the association's advice over the past five to 10 years, however, is an overarching effort to make care for people with diabetes more person-centered, says Dr. Nathan, who directs the Diabetes Center and the Clinical Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""That means collaborating with your physician to figure out a lifestyle and medication plan that works for you,"" he says. ""Doctors don't stand by your dinner table or bedside telling you what to do. They can help you make plans and informed decisions to better manage your diabetes, but you have to play an active role.""
        Five takeaways for a diabetes tune-up
        According to Dr. Nathan, here are five key takeaways from the guidelines that people with the most common form of the disease, type 2 diabetes, should know. (Several of these tips also apply to people with type 1 diabetes, but those people should check with their own doctors for targeted advice).
        Strive for sound, uninterrupted sleep. Experts have long recognized a link between poor sleep and obesity. Mounting evidence suggests that sleep problems are also associated with diabetes risk. ""Altered sleep patterns can affect blood sugar control,"" Dr. Nathan says. Obstructive sleep apnea, a serious disorder that causes repeated, brief pauses in breathing throughout the night, is a frequent cause of disrupted sleep. Because it's more common in people with diabetes (especially those who have obesity), anyone with the hallmark symptoms — loud snoring, snorts and gasps during sleep, and daytime sleepiness despite a full night's sleep — should be evaluated. Ask your doctor about a home-based test for sleep apnea.
        Don't ""diet."" Many popular fad diets — keto, paleo, intermittent fasting, and others — can help people lose weight. But most people regain any lost weight once they stop following the diet. Instead, it's much more effective to gradually move toward a healthy dietary pattern that you can stick with over the long haul, says Dr. Nathan. Good choices include the Mediterranean eating pattern and the closely related DASH diet. For people with diabetes, it's especially important to avoid sodas and other sugary drinks. You should also reduce how often you have desserts, sweets, and fatty foods, and eat more high-fiber carbohydrates, such as whole-wheat bread and brown rice.
        Exercise safely. Walking is ideal exercise for most people, provided you start slow and ramp up your distance and speed gradually if you haven't been physically active. People with diabetes need to pay special attention to choosing a well-fitting pair of shoes and check their feet regularly for redness, blisters, or sores. That's because diabetes can cause neuropathy (numbness due to nerve damage), which can leave you unable to sense minor trauma and injuries to the toes and feet. These can result in more severe foot problems and lead to amputations.
        Work toward a healthier weight. The three tips above can help people lose weight, but many people with obesity need medications to lose significant amounts of weight. Metformin, the most commonly prescribed drug to lower blood sugar, may help people lose about five pounds on average. And while that modest weight loss improves diabetes and its complications, larger losses are even more beneficial.
        Two relatively new diabetes drugs, semaglutide (Ozempic) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) can help people shed up to 15 to 20 pounds, respectively. They also lower hemoglobin A1c levels by as much as two percentage points. (A1c is a three-month average measure of blood sugar.)
        ""These drugs, which are given by a once-weekly injection, are quite exciting, and should be in the running as a first choice to add to metformin for people with diabetes and obesity,"" says Dr. Nathan. But because they're very expensive (around $1,000 per month before insurance) and must be taken indefinitely, they aren't realistic for everyone, he adds. In contrast, metformin costs only $4 per month.
        Know your treatment targets. As in the past, most people with diabetes should aim for an A1c of 7% or less. Even if you don't lose weight, reaching that goal reduces your risk for serious diabetes complications like vision and kidney problems and neuropathy, says Dr. Nathan.
        Diabetes also raises your risk of heart disease. Target blood pressure is less than 130/80 mm Hg. Target LDL cholesterol is at least a 50% reduction (or reaching 70 mg/dL or lower). If you already have heart disease, the guidelines suggest an even lower LDL target of 55 mg/dL. ""Many of the people I treat take cholesterol-lowering statins, and I often increase their doses to help them reach a lower goal,"" says Dr. Nathan. In some instances, a combination of cholesterol-lowering medicines can help lower stubbornly high LDL.",Julie Corliss,"January 16, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/winter-hiking-magical-or-miserable-202301102873,Winter hiking: Magical or miserable?,"By midwinter, our urge to hibernate can start to feel constricting instead of cozy. What better antidote to being cooped up indoors than a bracing hike in the crisp air outdoors?
        Winter backdrops are stark, serene, and often stunning. With fewer people on the trail, you may spot more creatures out and about. And it's a prime opportunity to engage with the seasons and our living planet around us, says Dr. Stuart Harris, chief of the Division of Wilderness Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. But a multi-mile trek through rough, frosty terrain is far different than warm-weather hiking, requiring consideration of health and safety, he notes. Here's what to know before you go.
        Winter hiking: Safety first
        ""The challenge of hiking when environmental conditions are a little more demanding requires a very different approach on a winter's day as opposed to a summer's day,"" Dr. Harris says. ""But it gives us a chance to be immersed in the living world around us. It's our ancient heritage.""
        A safety-first attitude is especially important if you're hiking with others of different ages and abilities — say, with older relatives or small children. It's crucial to have both the right gear and the right mindset to make it enjoyable and safe for all involved.
        Planning and preparation for winter hikes
        Prepare well beforehand, especially if you're mixing participants with vastly different fitness levels. Plan your route carefully, rather than just winging it.
        People at the extremes of age — the very old or very young — are most vulnerable to frigid temperatures, and cold-weather hiking can be more taxing on the body. ""Winter conditions can be more demanding on the heart than a perfectly-temperatured day,"" Harris says. ""Be mindful of the physical capabilities of everyone in your group, letting this define where you go. It's supposed to be fun, not a punishing activity.""
        Before setting out:
        
          Know how far, high, and remote you're going to go, Dr. Harris advises, and check the forecast for the area where you'll be hiking, taking wind chill and speed into account. Particularly at higher altitudes, weather can change from hour to hour, so keep abreast of expectations for temperature levels and any precipitation.
          Know if you'll have access to emergency cell coverage if anything goes wrong.
          Always share plans with someone not on your hike, including expected route and time you'll return. Fill out trailhead registers so park rangers will also know you're on the trail in case of emergency.
        
        What to wear for winter hikes
        Prepare for extremes of cold, wind, snow, and even rain to avoid frostbite or hypothermia, when body temperature drops dangerously low.
        
          Dress in layers. Several thin layers of clothing are better than one thick one. Peel off a layer when you're feeling warm in high sun and add it back when in shadow. Ideally, wear a base layer made from wicking fabric that can draw sweat away from the skin, followed by layers that insulate and protect from wind and moisture. ""As they say, there's no bad weather, just inappropriate clothing,"" Dr. Harris says. ""Take a day pack or rucksack and throw a couple of extra thermal layers in. I never head out for any hike without some ability to change as the weather changes.""
          Protect head, hands, and feet. Wear a wool hat, a thick pair of gloves or mittens, and two pairs of socks. Bring dry spares. Your boots should be waterproof and have a rugged, grippy sole.
          Wear sunscreen. You can still get a sunburn in winter, especially in places where the sun's glare reflects off the snow.
        
        Carry essentials to help ensure safety
        
          Extra food and water. Hiking in the cold takes serious energy, burning many more calories than the same activity done in summer temperatures. Pack nutrient-dense snacks such as trail mix and granola bars, which often combine nuts, dried fruit, and oats to provide needed protein, fat, and calories. It's also key to stay hydrated to keep your core temperature normal. Bonus points for bringing a warm drink in a thermos to warm your core if you're chilled.
          First aid kit. Bandages for slips or scrapes on the trail and heat-reflecting blankets to cover someone showing signs of hypothermia are wise. Even in above-freezing temperatures, hypothermia is possible. Watch for signs such as shivering, confusion, exhaustion, or slurring words, and seek immediate help.
          Light source. Time your hike so you're not on the trail in darkness. But bring a light source in case you get stuck. ""A flashlight or headlamp is pretty darn useful if you're hiking anywhere near the edges of daylight,"" Harris says.
          Phone, map, compass, or GPS device plus extra batteries. Don't rely on your phone for GPS tracking, but fully charge it in case you need to reach someone quickly. ""Make sure that you have the technology and skill set to be able to navigate on- or off-trail,"" Harris says, ""and that you have a means of outside communication, especially if you're in a large, mixed group.""",Maureen Salamon,"January 10, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/low-carb-diet-helps-cut-blood-sugar-levels-in-people-with-prediabetes-202301032869,Low-carb diet helps cut blood sugar levels in people with prediabetes,"For most people, there's no single healthy way to eat, though there are healthy foods and eating patterns. Yet for people with prediabetes, a low-carb diet could quickly bring elevated A1C levels back to a healthier range, a trial published in JAMA Network Opensuggests.
        But while this research revealed several benefits of low-carb eating to blood sugar control, Dr. Giulio Romeo, associate medical director of the Adult Diabetes Section at Harvard-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center, wonders whether its rigorous approach is realistic in everyday life. ""Clearly this study shows that a low-carb — and really, a borderline very-low-carb — diet is effective in reducing A1C levels, which are a measure of blood sugar during the previous three months,"" he says. ""But it may or may not be sustainable in the long run.""
        Prediabetes affects an estimated 96 million American adults. This condition is characterized by higher-than-normal-range blood sugar levels, and puts people at higher risk for developing full-blown diabetes.
        Which foods were study participants asked to eat — or avoid?
        This randomized clinical trial — considered the gold standard in scientific research — enrolled 150 older adults with untreated prediabetes or less severe diabetes. All were overweight (average BMI 35); nearly three-quarters were women and 59% were Black. Over the course of six months, half were randomly assigned to a low-carb diet and frequent dietary counseling, while the other half continued eating their usual diet.
        During the first three months, low-carb participants needed to keep carbohydrate levels below 40 grams a day — that's roughly the amount of carbs in an English muffin and an apple. During months four through six, their carb limit was below 60 grams a day.
        The researchers recommended that participants veer toward proteins and healthy fats by eating non-starchy vegetables, fish, poultry, lean meat, eggs, olive oil, avocados, nuts and seeds, Greek yogurt, low-carb milk, and small amounts of cheese. They were advised to limit or avoid other dairy, fruits, legumes, beans, and grains. The low-carb participants were provided various foods throughout the study, including olive oil, green beans, tomatoes, tuna, non-sugar sweetener, nuts, and low-carb bars and shakes.
        What did the study find?
        All participants underwent blood testing three and six months into the trial. Compared to those eating their usual diet, participants taking the low-carb approach had greater improvements in A1C and fasting blood glucose levels at the six-month mark. They also lost an average of 13 pounds. Though modest, the A1C improvements represented nearly a 60% lower risk for developing diabetes within the next three years.
        ""The reduction in A1C was greater in participants who were white compared to Black, which is important to know,"" Dr. Romeo says. ""By including a large number of Black participants, the study helps us to understand whether the response to a low-carb diet is comparable across race. In this trial, it did not seem to be.""
        Was the low-carb diet the only factor in better blood sugar control?
        No. It's impossible to tell how much low-carb participants' weight loss counted toward better blood sugar control, Dr. Romeo says. Losing fat helps reduce insulin resistance. ""That means your body will respond more effectively to the action of the insulin you make,"" he says. ""That's obviously very helpful.""
        But two direct effects of the low-carb approach may also be responsible for the downward swing in blood glucose, he says. Forcing your body to rely on energy sources other than carbohydrates cuts your appetite. Also, when you eat higher levels of carbs, your pancreas has to produce higher amounts of insulin. Eating fewer carbs reduces the burden on the pancreas and lowers insulin resistance independent of weight loss.
        Other study limitations may have also skewed findings, including the intensive dietary counseling low-carb participants received and the self-reporting of daily diets. Dr. Romeo also pointed out that the study wasn't large or long-term, two attributes that would have strengthened its findings. ""It doesn't necessarily address how sustainable this low-carb diet is, so a 12-month or 18-month study would be welcome,"" he says. ""But I think it's a very good step in that direction.""
        Can a reasonable approach to carbs make a difference?
        Not everyone with prediabetes will be willing or able to cut their carbohydrate intake to the extreme levels undertaken by study participants. But cutting even some carbs might lead to blood sugar and weight control benefits, Dr. Romeo says.
        ""The fairly large carbohydrate intake we've all become accustomed to — breads, sweets, starchy vegetables — can be dialed down a bit,"" he says. ""Not only can that reduce the risk of diabetes, but it also may help weight loss.""",Maureen Salamon,"January 3, 2023",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/7-things-your-dentist-wants-you-to-know,7 things your dentist wants you to know,"Instead of putting your money where your mouth is, try putting your health where your mouth is. (Hint: it's already there.)
        There's growing recognition we can't ignore our mouths and expect a healthy body. About 300 diseases and conditions are linked in some way to oral health — triggering some problems and worsening others, says Dr. Brittany Seymour, an associate professor of oral health policy and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.
        A nationally representative 2017 poll of more than 2,100 people ages 50 to 64 found that more than one-third had dental problems that caused them to miss work or suffer with pain, difficulty eating, or other health problems within the prior two years. About two-thirds had undergone a dental check-up in the past year, but nearly one-quarter hadn't sought preventive dental care in at least three years.
        ""There's still a myth that we can neglect our oral health and it only affects our mouths. We know that's not the case,"" says Dr. Seymour, also a national spokesperson for the American Dental Association. ""There's still a lack of awareness around the importance of oral health far beyond the way we look.""
        Gum disease dangers
        Downstream effects of poor oral health can indeed prove more serious than the occasional cavity. Harmful bacteria and inflammation can creep from the mouth to the bloodstream and reach far-flung areas of the body.
        The heart is particularly vulnerable. Building on research indicating that people with poor oral health (such as gum disease or tooth loss) have higher rates of heart attacks, a new study goes one step further. The analysis, published Aug. 1, 2022, in The Journal of the American Dental Association, found that heart attack patients who'd had no dental care over the prior year remained in the hospital longer than similar patients who'd had dental treatment.
        Meanwhile, a 2020 study in the journal Diabetes Care estimated that among people with diabetes who also had periodontitis (severe inflammation of the gums and the bones that support the teeth), improved gum care could reduce complications such as kidney, nerve, and eye damage by about 20%. Periodontitis is three times more common among people with diabetes, Dr. Seymour says. In addition, a person with uncontrolled gum disease typically has more difficulty controlling blood sugar levels.
        ""Early warning signs of diabetes can even show up in the mouth,"" she says. ""These include dry mouth, gum disease, changes in taste, slower healing of cuts or sores in the mouth, and mouth infections such as thrush.""
        
          
            
              
                Oral care products: What do you really need?
                Choosing toothpaste, mouthwash, and other oral care products was once a fairly simple task. But the variety of products vying for our mouths — and wallets — has exploded into a $49 billion oral care market that's expected to nearly double by 2030.
                Today's products don't just promise to keep our mouths minty clean and fresh, however. From gum repair toothpaste to plaque removal mouthwash, these items — filling entire aisles of supermarkets and drugstores — make claims that can confuse and frustrate us, says Dr. Brittany Seymour, an associate professor of oral health policy and epidemiology at Harvard's School of Dental Medicine. ""Options are a great thing until choosing becomes overwhelming and people aren't confident in the choices they're making,"" she says.
                It's smart to be skeptical. Removing plaque, for example, requires some kind of mechanical process, such as brushing or flossing. So ""a mouthwash marketed for plaque removal may kill bacteria, but still wouldn't necessarily remove debris,"" she says.
                Similarly, gum repair toothpaste — marketed to reduce the inflammation and gum bleeding that comes with gingivitis — contains the same active ingredient as most toothpastes: stannous fluoride, which has antibacterial properties. ""Gum repair toothpaste may not work any better or differently than other toothpastes containing this type of fluoride,"" she says.
                If in doubt, look for the American Dental Association (ADA) Seal of Acceptance on packaging. The seal means a team of dentists independently evaluated the product to verify that it says what it does and does what it says.
                ""I cannot tell the difference between patients' mouths based on the products they use,"" she says. ""Really, it's just important to find a routine you can stick with. This is where product choice can be helpful; you can try different options and ultimately find something that enables you to maintain those good habits.""
              
            
          
        
        Additional revelations
        What else might surprise you about dental health? Dr. Seymour offers six additional nuggets.
        Brushing harder or longer isn't necessarily better. The choice of toothbrush bristle — or an electric variety — is personal preference, but a more abrasive brush doesn't make your pearly whites any whiter or your gums any healthier. As a rule of thumb, brush twice a day for at least two minutes. ""It's more about technique than rigor,"" she says. ""If your technique is effective, two minutes is just as effective as five."" Ask your dentist for pointers on optimal brushing technique.
        Flossing is optional, but cleaning between teeth isn't. Some people don't like dental floss, but that's not the only way to clean between teeth, where debris and plaque hide. Skipping this vital step can lead to inflamed gums and cavities. Floss-haters can try floss picks, which have tiny spans of floss stretched between plastic prongs. Other options include an oral irrigator (such as Waterpik) or an interdental cleaner, a tiny cylindrical brush. ""The bottom line is, cleaning between teeth matters,"" Dr. Seymour says. ""Ask any dentist if she can tell which patients do it and which don't — and we can.""
        Your dentist isn't only checking your teeth and gums—she's also screening for cancer. Dentists are trained to look for head and neck cancers during routine check-ups. This typically involves pressing around your jaw, chin, and neck to look for lumps or swollen lymph nodes. She'll also stretch your cheeks out and look at your tongue, palate, and throat for abnormal spots. Head and neck cancers affect 66,000 Americans each year, killing 15,000.
        Going to the dentist when you're pregnant is recommended. A long-debunked but still-prevalent myth tells women to avoid dental care — and especially dental x-rays — while pregnant. But preventive care can nip a problem before it blossoms into an infection or a cavity requiring a root canal. Pregnancy also triggers many changes in the mouth, such as bleeding gums, that should be evaluated. ""You need to be sure they're normal changes that will resolve after delivery or determine if they're signs that need more immediate attention,"" Dr. Seymour says.
        Menopause can affect your mouth. The menopause-related drop in estrogen and progesterone can reduce saliva production, causing mouth dryness that encourages tooth decay and infection. Gum pain and inflammation (gingivitis) is also more prevalent when estrogen levels fall.
        Chewing sugar-free gum can't substitute for brushing. Gum-chewing encourages saliva production, which helps wash away acids from foods and drinks before they can erode tooth enamel. Gum made with the artificial sweetener xylitol can enhance this effect, lowering the level of decay-causing bacteria in saliva. But these benefits don't override the value of twice-daily brushing. ""Gum might dislodge large food particles, but it's not as effective at removing plaque as brushing,"" Dr. Seymour says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/prolonged-stress-may-increase-the-risk-of-death-from-cancer,Prolonged stress may increase the risk of death from cancer,"Long-term exposure to stress has long been known to increase risk for cardiovascular disease. A study in the September 2022 issue of SSM—Population Health suggests it also may raise the risk of dying from cancer.
        Investigators looked at health information — including body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, blood glucose, and C-reactive protein (a measure of inflammation) — on 41,000 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Based on these and other data, the researchers determined everyone's allostatic load — that is, the cumulative effect of stress over time. Scores ranged from 0 to 9, with scores higher than 3 indicating a high allostatic load. Researchers then determined how many of these people later died of cancer. They found that those with high allostatic loads were 2.4 times more likely to die from cancer than those with low allostatic loads.
        The connection between stress and cancer could be related to the body's exposure to cortisol, the stress hormone. The body releases cortisol during stressful events, but levels usually decrease once the threat has passed. However, exposure to ongoing stressors can keep cortisol levels consistently high, which can wear down the body on a cellular level, according to the research team. They added that other studies have suggested this reaction may raise the risk of cancer or cause existing cancer to spread more rapidly.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/you-dont-say-facts-about-flatulence,You don't say? Facts about flatulence,"Everyone does it, but no one talks about it. Passing gas, that is. Here's everything you ever wanted to know about flatulence (but perhaps were afraid to ask).
        Why do we do pass gas? It's normal to have some air in the digestive tract. Air accumulates when you swallow, and the process of digestion generates gases as well. When too much builds up, the body releases it. Passing gas keeps the pressure within the intestinal tract low and prevents painful stretching of the stomach and intestines. Burping accomplishes the same purpose.
        How often? On average, the body produces approximately two liters of flatus (the technical name for intestinal gas) daily, and people pass gas about 14 times a day.
        Why do some foods cause gas? Common gas-producing foods include beans; certain vegetables, such as cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, and peas; oat bran and other high-fiber foods; carbonated beverages; foods containing sorbitol (a sugar alcohol used in many low-calorie foods); and fructose, a natural sugar present in many fruits, including prunes, pears, grapes, dates, and figs. These foods break down slowly, which allows more time for gas to be produced and build up.
        What makes gas smell? Slow-digesting foods don't completely break down until they reach the large intestine, where they are digested by bacteria. The bacteria also ferment the undigested foods, which produces foul-smelling gases like methane and hydrogen sulfide.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/prune-juice-for-constipation-a-new-study-says-yes,Prune juice for constipation? A new study says yes,"Prune juice has a long-held reputation as an elixir to ease constipation, and a recent study suggests drinking the beverage actually works.
         

        Researchers recruited 84 people diagnosed with chronic constipation, defined as having fewer than three bowel movements per week or hard stools for the past three months. The participants drank 200 grams (about 1 cup) of 100% prune juice or a similar-tasting placebo drink every day for eight weeks.
        After only three weeks, the people drinking prune juice reported fewer hard and lumpy stools than did those who were drinking the placebo. After seven weeks, most had regular bowel movements. A previously cited downside of prune juice is a higher risk for diarrhea and gas, but the people in this study reported no such problems.
        How might prune juice help? The researchers pointed to the juice's high amounts of sorbitol (sugar alcohol), dietary fiber (especially pectin), and polyphenols, all of which have been associated with treating constipation. Another possibility is that these particular ingredients (and perhaps others) work together to change the gut microbiome in a way that aids with constipation. The results were published in the October 2022 issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/reviewing-your-wellness-portfolio,Reviewing your wellness portfolio,"Financial planners recommend regular reviews of your investments to ensure they still meet your short- and long-term goals. You should take the same approach with your wellness. ""A regular assessment of your overall well-being can help you stay on track and identify where you might need to make changes,"" says Dr. Shalender Bhasin, an endocrinologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        Review process
        As with a financial portfolio, a review of your wellness portfolio addresses three questions: where are you now, where do you want to go, and how will you get there?
        Where are you now? Begin with a thorough assessment of your health. The goal is to record your usual habits and note recent changes. For example, have you experienced any pain in specific spots or discomfort doing certain activities or movements? Do you have less endurance or less energy? Have your sleeping habits or diet changed? What about your sex life? How many hours do you work out per week on average, and what kinds of exercises do you pursue? The more details you can provide, the better. ""This examination can help reveal areas that might be underperforming,"" says Dr. Bhasin.
        Where do you want to go? Next, list your goals. For example, do you want to travel, take up a new sport, or compete in a 5K race? Do you want to improve certain aspects of your health, like increasing your walking performance? Or do you want to maintain your current activity level or continue to live independently?
        How will you get there? Once you have compiled this information, share it with your doctor. ""By identifying where your health needs attention and what changes may be needed, you can work with your physician to draw up a strategy to address them,"" says Dr. Bhasin. Depending on your specific needs and goals, additional support could come from a certified trainer, physical therapist, or nutritionist.
        Ongoing investments
        Your wellness portfolio should also contain some standard ongoing investments, no matter your age or goals. ""These areas promote long-term health, prevent injuries, and support daily active living,"" says Dr. Bhasin. Three worthy health investments men often don't make but should:
        Strength training. Strength training helps counter the natural loss of muscle mass, called sarcopenia. After age 60, men can lose a quarter to a third of their muscle strength in their upper and lower body over a 10-year period. Consult a certified trainer who specializes in older clients to assess your muscle strength and help devise an adequate training plan.
        Balance. Balance becomes increasingly important over time to help prevent falls. Every year, according to the CDC, one out of four adults ages 65 and older suffers a fall, and from 2007 to 2016, deaths related to falls increased by 30%. ""Make sure you either practice regular balancing exercises or do yoga or tai chi to help improve and maintain your sense of balance, coordination, gait mechanics, and flexibility,"" says Dr. Bhasin. See your doctor if you have ongoing balance issues.
        Attention to mental health. Depression or anxiety can become a problem at any age, but perhaps the biggest threat to older men's mental health is that many fail to recognize the symptoms of a problem. Speak with your doctor if you experience any of the following:
        
          loss of enjoyment in activities
          persistent sad or ""empty"" mood
          increased boredom and apathy
          fatigue or loss of energy
          restlessness or irritability
          insomnia or spending too much time in bed
          feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
          trouble concentrating or making decisions.
        
        Your doctor may recommend a trial of medication or suggest talking to a mental health professional (in person or online). Devoting more time to a meditation practice and nature outings also can support your mental well-being.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/protect-yourself-from-cardiovascular-disease,Protect yourself from cardiovascular disease,"An August 2022 report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology predicts higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) — a category that includes heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, and stroke—over the next three decades.
        While this expected increase partly stems from people living longer, suboptimal heart health habits also are to blame, according to Dr. Marc Sabatine, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Many older adults may have a general understanding of good heart-health behavior and think they follow it for the most part, but in reality could do better.""
        The good news is that about 80% of heart attacks and strokes can be prevented if the right preventive measures are taken early enough, according to Dr. Sabatine. The key is to control high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and excess weight, not smoke, and to follow the ""big three"" healthy-heart habits: diet, exercise, and sleep.
        This probably comes as no surprise. This advice has long been the foundation for greater health and longevity. But the best way to meet these standards is to change how you approach heart health over all. ""Protection from CVD is not about short-term fixes, but adopting long-term lifestyle changes,"" says Dr. Sabatine. ""And it's never too late to act.""
        Know your numbers
        The first step is to know your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels. (See your doctor if you don't know or if it's been a while since they were last checked.) High cholesterol and high blood pressure are associated with a higher risk of CVD. High glucose can be a sign of diabetes or an increased risk for the disease, which is another risk factor for CVD.
        Guidelines suggest men aim for an LDL (bad) cholesterol level of less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), blood pressure below 120/80 millimeters of mercury, and fasting glucose levels less than 100 mg/dL. But these are just recommendations. Your ideal numbers may differ based on your health and individual goals, as determined in consultation with your doctor.
        For example, if you already have cardiovascular disease or diabetes, your LDL cholesterol should be less than 70 mg/dL. You will likely need medication in addition to lifestyle changes to achieve this goal.
        Also, keep tabs on your weight. About 30% of American adults are classified as overweight. While it's natural for men's weight to increase somewhat with age, even five to 10 pounds over your ideal number is associated with an increased risk for CVD, according to Dr. Sabatine. A recent study found that a five-inch increase in waist size was associated with a more than 150% higher risk for CVD.
        The big three
        Good diet, exercise, and sleep habits can help manage blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight and provide other health benefits like controlling blood glucose levels and reducing inflammation. Here's how to better pursue each one.
        Diet. If you don't already follow a plant-based eating pattern, now is the time to start, as solid evidence shows it greatly minimizes CVD risk.
        The diets most studied for heart health are the Mediterranean diet, the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, and MIND (Mediterranean–DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay).
        They emphasize foods linked with heart-healthy benefits, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and healthy oils like olive oil, while minimizing red meat and processed foods. (Visit /meddiet to learn about how to adopt a plant-based diet.)
        Also, reduce alcohol intake. Studies show drinking too much alcohol — more than 100 grams, or about seven standard drinks, per week — is linked with increased heart disease and early death. A standard drink (12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits) contains about 14 grams of alcohol.
        
          
            
              
                Check your family history for risk factors
                Genetics plays an important role in a person's cardiovascular disease risk. Take a detailed assessment of your family's health history and tell your doctor whether a parent, sibling, or aunt or uncle suffered from cardiovascular disease, died young, or struggled with high blood pressure or cholesterol. ""A strong family history of heart disease means you need to work harder on the risk factors you can control,"" says cardiologist Dr. Marc Sabatine, with Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""By knowing your weak spots, you and your doctor can devise a more effective prevention strategy.""
              
            
          
        
        Exercise. Guidelines recommend that adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week, which breaks down to 30 minutes on each of five days a week.
        If you need motivation, consider joining a walking or running club or hiring a personal trainer. Another way to ensure you get the minimum amount is to spread your total activity time across two areas: purposeful exercise and daily movement.
        Purposeful exercises are traditional workouts like brisk morning walks, treadmill running, swimming, and cycling. For daily movement, focus on doing small bouts of activity throughout the day, such as walking for five minutes every hour, or doing two sets several push-ups on the floor or against the kitchen counter.
        Also, look for opportunities to add extra movements. For example, wash your car yourself; park farther away from the grocery store entrance; take the stairs instead of the elevator; and do yard work like mowing, planting, and raking. ""Every bit of movement can count toward your overall exercise requirement,"" says Dr. Sabatine.
        Sleep. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society recommend that adults get at least seven hours of sleep per night. Studies have found that less than this amount is associated with heart disease risk factors like higher stress, increased inflammation, high blood pressure, and weight gain.
        People with sleep apnea, a disorder in which a person repeatedly stops breathing during sleep, also have a higher risk of heart failure and diabetes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sleep-apnea-treatment-lowers-rehospitalization-for-heart-problems-in-older-adults,Sleep apnea treatment lowers rehospitalization for heart problems in older adults,"Up to 60% of people with cardiovascular disease also have sleep apnea — meaning they briefly and repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping. But treating the latter can help with the former, a new study suggests. Researchers found that heart disease patients with apnea who were hospitalized for heart problems were 60% less likely to end up back in the hospital within a month if they were diligent about managing their apnea.
        The analysis looked at Medicare data from 1,301 heart disease patients (average age 73) who were diagnosed with sleep apnea and put on CPAP therapy — which uses air pressure through a mask to keep the airway open while sleeping — and who were hospitalized for heart issues within two years of the apnea diagnosis. About 10% of participants were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of that hospitalization. But the readmission rate was far lower for the participants who consistently used CPAP therapy compared with those who didn't. The study, published online Aug. 8, 2022, by Clinical Sleep Medicine, underscored how effectively treating sleep apnea can help improve outcomes and lower health care costs for heart patients, the researchers said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/adding-strength-training-to-aerobic-exercise-may-fuel-longevity,Adding strength training to aerobic exercise may fuel longevity,"Heart-pumping exercise goes a long way toward achieving robust health, but adding strength training to your regimen may be key to living even longer. That's the finding of a large study published online Oct. 17, 2022, by JAMA Network Open. Researchers evaluated physical activity reported by more than 115,000 people ages 65 and older as part of the ongoing National Health Interview Survey. They compared exercise data with deaths over an average of nearly eight years. Regardless of how much aerobic exercise they did, participants who did strength training two to six times weekly were less likely to die from any cause during the study period compared with those who did less strength training. People who did at least two sessions of strength training as well as 2.5 hours of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity each week were 30% less likely to die during that time. The study was observational and did not prove conclusively that doing strength training or aerobic exercise caused people to live longer. Strength training includes activities such as lifting weights, using resistance bands, doing push-ups or sit-ups, or digging in the garden.

When you eat — the time of day — is also important, according to a small randomized controlled trial published Oct. 4, 2022, online by Cell Metabolism. Harvard researchers asked 16 overweight or obese people to test two different meal schedules with identical diets. On the first schedule, for six days in a row, participants ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but finished the last meal six-and-a-half hours before bedtime. On the second schedule, for another six days, the same meals were bumped four hours later in the day, ending two-and-a-half hours before bedtime. During the study, scientists measured participants' appetite-regulating hormones, body temperatures, calorie expenditure, and fat cells. Eating later in the day increased participants' hunger, decreased the number of calories they burned, and promoted fat storage. Over time, those effects could lead to weight gain. So while it won't hurt to have an occasional late supper, try not to make it a habit.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/its-not-too-late-to-save-thinning-hair,It's not too late to save thinning hair,"Hair loss doesn't typically cause pain, but it can be emotionally distressing when you realize that your hair is thinning, especially if you can see space in between hairs and your scalp peeking out in places. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to treat thinning hair and keep the problem from advancing.
        Why is your hair thinning?
        Two common conditions account for most age-related hair loss.
        The most common is androgenetic alopecia, also called male- or female-pattern hair loss. Thinning hair is the first sign. ""Hair follicles become smaller, which makes the hair strands finer. Some hair follicles stop producing hair altogether,"" says Dr. Kathie Huang, co-director of the Hair Loss Clinic at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital and assistant professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School.
        This type of hair loss can result from genetics or age-related hormone changes. It occurs gradually, in patterns specific to men and women. ""In men, the front hairline tends to recede, or they might have thinning at the temples or the crown on top of the head. In women, it can involve most of the scalp, or affect certain areas such as the middle part, the temples, and the frontal scalp area,"" Dr. Huang says. ""But in androgenetic alopecia, women do not develop balding the way men can.""
        Another common type of hair loss is called telogen effluvium. This type of thinning occurs suddenly, often as a reaction to emotional or physical stress. ""It might happen after you've had a high fever, a urinary tract infection, or surgery. Shedding can also occur as a reaction to an underlying medical condition or from taking a new medication,"" Dr. Huang says.
        
          
            
              
                Where to turn for hair loss help
                Your primary care physician can assess whether you have hair loss caused by an underlying condition, medication, hormone changes, or aging. The doctor may order blood work or prescribe treatments. If you want to see a specialist, visit a board-certified dermatologist who specializes in hair loss treatment and is well versed in the many options available to help regrow hair.
              
            
          
        
        Protecting your hair
        The type of treatment your doctor prescribes will depend on the cause of hair loss. Telogen effluvium corrects on its own or once the underlying cause is treated. ""Telogen effluvium usually gets better in three to six months,"" Dr. Huang says.
        For people with androgenetic alopecia, treatment aims to enhance the hair follicles, so the hair strands become thicker and your hair appears to be denser over all. The following treatments may help.
        Topical drugs. The FDA has approved minoxidil (Rogaine), available over the counter, as a hair loss treatment for both men and women. It helps thicken hair follicles and promotes hair lengthening. It comes in a liquid or foam that's applied to the scalp. ""If you have a lot of hair, it may be easier to apply the liquid form. But more people experience irritation with the liquid, compared with the foam,"" Dr. Huang says. ""And you have to use it on a daily basis for at least nine months to see improvement.""
        Oral medications. Recent studies suggest that taking minoxidil as a pill, which has been used for decades to treat high blood pressure, is safe and effective for treating hair loss. ""We've seen an increase in the use of oral minoxidil for hair loss in the past year,"" Dr. Huang says. ""It's helpful for people who aren't getting enough benefit from topical minoxidil, or those who have scalp irritation from the topical form.""
        Other oral medications to treat hair loss include finasteride (Propecia, Proscar) and spironolactone (Aldactone). ""Oral medications can have side effects. For example, oral minoxidil can cause low blood pressure or heart palpitations. Therefore, we carefully tailor the treatment regimen for individual patients,"" Dr. Huang says.
        Platelet-rich plasma injections. In this procedure, high concentrations of components of your own blood are injected into your scalp to stimulate hair growth. Dr. Huang says each treatment can cost from $500 to $1,500. You typically repeat the process monthly, for three months, and require follow-up treatments every year. The effectiveness of platelet-rich plasma for hair regrowth is not yet proven.
        Laser light treatments. Devices that emit low-level LED laser light might promote hair growth. They're available (without a prescription) in combs and helmets that you use regularly in your own home. Prices range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.
        Supplements. Supplements are sometimes expensive, and there isn't solid evidence that they make hair grow. ""But if they won't interfere with your medications, it's probably okay to try them,"" Dr. Huang says.
        And for any of these treatments, the key is starting them as soon as you detect hair loss. Once the follicles stop working, the only option to restore your locks is hair transplant surgery.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/reclaim-your-pre-pandemic-function,Reclaim your pre-pandemic function,"We've moved past some of the immediate effects of the pandemic, with many people returning to their previous physical activities. But some people are finding they're a bit worse off functionally than they were before COVID-19 changed the world. ""Some people say they can't walk as far as they used to, or they're now afraid to step on uneven surfaces. They feel they've suddenly aged,"" says Janice McGrail, a physical therapist at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        Are these changes just a consequence of getting older, or did something happen during the pandemic to reduce our physical capabilities?
        Use it or lose it
        COVID surges have caused many people to take breaks from exercising regularly over the past few years. Perhaps they got sick. Or they couldn't work out in a gym and didn't know how to work out at home. Or they felt sad or unmotivated.
        Unfortunately, once we stop being active, our physical function and energy levels go downhill rapidly. Muscles get weaker and use more energy to do their jobs, the body's balance system (which involves coordinated actions among our nerves, joints, senses, and brain) gets rusty, and the cardiovascular system (the heart, lungs, and blood vessels) gets out of practice at providing enough blood and oxygen when the body demands it during activity.
        ""You might not even notice that you're becoming deconditioned,"" McGrail says. ""And if you don't do anything right away to regain the strength or function you've lost, you'll lose even more. It becomes a downward spiral.""
        Telltale signs
        How can you recognize symptoms of deconditioning if you haven't noticed any so far? McGrail suggests looking at some of your habits. It could be that
        
          your former 30-minute walk is now just a 15-minute walk
          you don't have the energy to shop, so you order groceries online for pickup, or you have them delivered to your door
          you don't meet a friend for a walk anymore; you just meet for coffee
          you worry about falling, and you're more cautious about where you step.
        
        ""You start to change your habits, patterns, and activities because you don't think you can do it or you don't feel like doing it,"" McGrail says.
        Reclaiming function
        If you recognize that you're not where you were physically a few months or a year ago, you're not alone: many people have experienced similar changes. But accept that it's time to turn things around. Consider the following steps.
        Set a big goal. ""Ask yourself what you've lost because of decreased function and what you want to regain. Is it the ability to remain independent, go to the grocery store, play with your grandkids, or go on a hike to see a beautiful view? Get an image of what you want,"" McGrail suggests.
        Track your activity. If you have a smartphone, it might be able to track your steps each day. If not, clip a pedometer ($10) onto your waistband or wear a fitness tracker ($20 and up). The devices can record the number of steps you take each day and (if you wear a fitness tracker) minutes that you're active.
        Take action. ""Push yourself out of your comfort zone, even if it's just off the couch,"" McGrail says. ""Sign up for an online or in-person exercise class. Start walking each day, or go for a longer walk if you're already active. Make your activity something that you like and something that fits into your life, so you'll be more likely to stick with it.""
        Get help from the pros. If you have an underlying condition such as heart disease or knee pain, talk to your doctor before you start to exercise. Then, see a physical therapist, who can assess your physical strengths and weaknesses and tailor an exercise program to your specific health condition.
        Set small goals. ""Just like an athlete during preseason, you'll need to build your activity level gradually, so you don't get injured,"" McGrail says. ""If you take just a thousand steps per day, increase it by another 500 or 1,000. If you're active for 10 minutes per day, increase it to 15 minutes. Keep making small increases each week."" Your eventual step goal should be 7,500 steps per day, and at least 22 minutes of moderate-intensity activity (such as brisk walking) per day.
        Add strength training. It takes strong muscles to be able to do even basic activities each day, such as getting up and down from a chair, climbing stairs, carrying groceries, standing at a stove to make dinner, or getting in and out of a car. And it takes even stronger muscles to live an active lifestyle. ""A week or so after you increase your activity levels, start improving your muscle strength,"" McGrail says. ""Do a five- or 10-minute session every day, or a 20-minute session two or three days per week. You can use dumbbells, resistance bands, or weight machines. Or do body-weight exercises such as squats, biceps curls, or planks.""
        Enlist a friend. Exercising with a friend can help motivate you and keep you on track. Plus, it's fun.
        Don't give up. ""Once you increase your activity, you'll notice a difference in your energy levels right away. But it could take four to six weeks before you see real gains in your muscle strength,"" McGrail says. ""Just remind yourself why you're working so hard. What was that big goal you set? Keep it in mind every day.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-can-meal-schedules-affect-your-weight,How can meal schedules affect your weight?,"Q.
          A friend told me she started losing weight when she ate dinner in the late afternoon, rather than at around 8 p.m. (her usual suppertime). How can the time you eat affect your weight?
        
        A. Ten years ago, I would have said that it probably is nonsense. But science keeps learning new things about the human body. How many calories you take in, and how much activity you engage in, still matters… a lot. But several studies over the past decade have shown that eating late meals might make it harder to lose weight. A new study from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School sought to see if it was true and, more important, to see what changes occur in the body to make it true.
        Sixteen overweight or obese young adults agreed to participate in an experiment that lasted several months. Their meals and physical activity were controlled by the study. During the ""early-meal"" study period, they ate the first meal at 9 a.m. and the last meal at 5 p.m. During the ""late-meal"" study period, they ate the first meal at noon and the last meal at 8:30 p.m. Each study period included a third meal mid-way in between the first and last. Importantly, the total amount of calories during the two study periods, and the physical activity, was identical: only the meal times were different.
        Late eating greatly increased hunger, decreased levels of an appetite-reducing hormone (leptin), increased the amount of fat that was stored, and decreased the amount of fat that was burned, over the 24-hour day. Late eating did that by changing the activity of the genes that control the burning and storage of fat. Thus, this new study confirmed earlier studies that said eating late encouraged weight gain, and the study also showed why.
        While this was a small study, and needs to be confirmed by other scientists, it makes sense to me. Several years ago, my wife and I decided to switch to eating a large breakfast and a second large meal in midafternoon, with healthy nibbles (nuts, fruit) in between, and maybe a dessert at around 6 p.m. Our smart watches monitored our daily activity level and our sleep.
        Three things quickly became clear. First, to our surprise and delight, we didn't feel hungry. Second, as we expected and hoped, we started to lose weight. Third, and unexpected, we got more deep sleep at night. Dinner with friends at a ""normal"" hour is invariably followed by a bad night's sleep. Several recent studies have found the same effect of late eating on sleep quality.
        So I recommend that you try our two-large-meal program, or at least have the last of your three meals end before 5 p.m. You might be surprised by the results.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heart-disease-and-heartburn-whats-the-overlap,Heart disease and heartburn: What's the overlap?,"Heartburn and heart disease have one big thing in common: their classic symptoms cause discomfort in the center of the chest. Heartburn happens when acid from the stomach splashes up into the esophagus (the tube connecting the stomach to the throat) and creates a burning sensation. Insufficient blood flow to the heart's arteries can cause angina or a heart attack, which often produces a feeling of tightness or pressure in the chest. But it's not always easy to tell the difference.
        ""Even emergency room physicians grapple with distinguishing between heart attacks and heartburn based on how people describe their symptoms,"" says Dr. Michelle O'Donoghue, cardiovascular specialist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. In cases where heartburn seems more likely, doctors often give people a fast- acting antacid such as Mylanta to see if that relieves their symptoms, she says.
        Of the over eight million emergency room visits for chest pain each year, severe heartburn (known as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) accounts for over half the cases in which actual heart problems are ruled out. But to be on the safe side, always see a doctor if you have symptoms you are unsure about, and head to the emergency room if you have other heart attack symptoms (see ""Heartburn or heart attack?"").
        
          
            
              
                Heartburn or heart attack?
                While heartburn is more likely to appear after a large or spicy meal, heart attacks are more common after physical exertion or stress. But if you're unsure, seek medical help right away.

        Heart-stomach overlaps
        In addition to its role in GERD, acid in the digestive tract can also eat away at the lining of the stomach or small intestine, creating irritated, raw spots that can turn into painful, bleeding sores called peptic ulcers. The main symptom of peptic ulcer disease is a dull or burning pain in the stomach, anywhere between the breastbone and navel.
        ""Some factors that make people more likely to develop heart disease, such as smoking and being older or overweight, also increase the risk for GERD or a peptic ulcer,"" says Dr. O'Donoghue. Common medications — namely, aspirin and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) — used to treat these conditions may also be part of the picture.
        Nearly everyone who's had a heart attack takes low-dose aspirin, which helps avert future heart attacks by preventing blood components called platelets from sticking together and forming blood clots. People who've received an artery-opening stent are often prescribed clopidogrel (Plavix), a more potent anti-platelet drug. Here's the problem: Aspirin also blocks a chemical that protects the lining of the stomach from stomach acid. Taking clopidogrel or a similar medication with aspirin can further increase the risk of stomach bleeding.
        People with heartburn often take PPIs, which include over-the-counter drugs such as omeprazole (Prilosec) and prescription drugs such as pantoprazole (Protonix). These drugs prevent certain cells in the stomach from pumping out acid. Even people who don't have heartburn may benefit from this stomach-protecting effect. That's why doctors sometimes prescribe PPIs for people who take aspirin, clopidogrel, or related drugs that may increase stomach irritation, says Dr. O'Donoghue. She typically recommends PPIs for people who are taking long-term aspirin or clopidogrel if they have ever had a peptic ulcer or are at high risk of developing one.
        Take-home advice
        GERD is far more common than peptic ulcer disease, however. If you take PPIs to treat GERD, be sure to seek medical attention if you have chest discomfort brought on by exercise that's not relieved with an antacid, as that scenario is more characteristic of a heart-related problem.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/sugar-substitutes-new-cardiovascular-concerns,Sugar substitutes: New cardiovascular concerns?,"Diet sodas and other products that contain calorie-free artificial sweeteners are popular, especially among people trying to lose weight. But the health effects of sugar substitutes aren't fully settled.
        The evidence that drinking artificially sweetened beverages helps people slim down is mixed. And numerous small studies have hinted at potential health problems, including a higher risk of cancer, kidney disease, and heart disease. Now, a large study has found a potential link between artificial sweeteners and an increased risk of strokes, heart attacks, and related cardiovascular problems (see ""Fake sugars and heart health"").
        As is true for all observational studies, the findings can't prove cause and effect, as other factors might explain the association. For instance, compared with people who didn't use artificial sweeteners, people who consumed the highest amounts tended to have a higher body mass index, be less physically active, and to be following a weight-loss diet.
        But the researchers accounted for those and other potentially confounding issues, says Teresa Fung, adjunct professor in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""People who develop high blood pressure and high cholesterol may be told by their doctors to start watching their weight, so they may switch to diet sodas,"" she says. So diet soda gets blamed for heart disease among people who were already at risk. To help control for this problem (known as reverse causation), researchers didn't count any of the heart-related problems during the first two years of the follow-up.
        Other strengths of this study include the large number of participants — more than 100,000 — and the detailed dietary analysis. Just over half of the sweeteners the participants reported consuming were from soft drinks. Another 30% came from tabletop sweeteners (such as those in the colored, single-serving packets), with the remainder from dairy-based foods and other products.
        
          
            
              
                Fake sugars and heart health
                To help clarify how artificial sweeteners might affect the heart, French scientists took advantage of the NutriNet Sant' study, a large, Internet-based nutrition study. Their findings, summarized below, were published online Sept. 7, 2022, by the BMJ.
                Who: 103,388 people, about 80% women, with an average age of 42.
                What: Study volunteers provided detailed food records over several 24-hour periods along with other information that included lifestyle and health habits and medical history. More than one-third (37%) used artificial sweeteners, and they consumed about 42 milligrams per day, on average — an amount roughly equal to the contents of one tabletop packet or just under a quarter-cup of diet soda.
                When: During the follow-up, which lasted a median of nine years, participants received twice-yearly health questionnaires and were asked to report any new health exams, problems, or treatments.
                Key findings: Artificial sweeteners were linked to a 9% higher risk of any type of cardiovascular problem (including heart attacks) and an 18% greater risk of stroke.
              
            
          
        
        Unequal risks?
        The study also identified three artificial sweeteners that appear to be the most problematic. Aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal) was linked to a higher risk of stroke, while acesulfame potassium (Sunnett, Sweet One) and sucralose (Splenda) were associated with higher coronary artery disease risk.
        It's not clear why these fake sugars might contribute to cardiovascular problems, says Fung. Some experts postulate that artificial sweeteners may trigger inflammation and alter normal metabolism, the gut microbiome, and blood vessels in ways that promote type 2 diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels, and high blood pressure. But these speculations are based on studies in animals or small numbers of people.
        Diet soda swap
        ""These new findings provide yet another piece of evidence that artificial sweeteners may not be benign in terms of heart health,"" says Fung. Diet sodas and other artificially sweetened beverages (including teas and energy or sports drinks) are the biggest source of artificial sweeteners in the diet. If you drink those products on a daily basis, try switching to flavored, zero-calorie sparkling water, which now comes in many flavors, including watermelon, blackberry, and mango. Or add a splash of 100% fruit juice to plain sparkling water. ""You can enjoy fizz and flavor without questionable additives,"" says Fung.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-many-ways-exercise-helps-your-heart,The many ways exercise helps your heart,"If you take a brisk walk, you'll notice certain changes in your body right away. Your heart beats a little faster, your breathing rate increases, and you may feel your leg muscles working. But you might not appreciate the myriad other physiological changes happening inside your body when you exercise — some of which offer benefits similar to those from common medications.
        Together, exercise-induced changes can prevent or improve all the major risk factors that contribute to heart disease, including high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and unhealthy cholesterol levels. ""Exercise can also improve mental health problems like depression and stress, which are common but often ignored contributors to cardiovascular problems,"" says cardiologist Dr. Aaron Baggish, a professor at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland and founder of the Cardiovascular Performance Program at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Being physically active also helps people live longer, mainly because regular exercise helps prevent early death from heart disease, as noted in an article published Sept. 13, 2022, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology that details the cardioprotective effects of exercise.

While the exercise guidelines don't include a suggested time or amount to do at any one time, experts says even a 10- to 15-minute session can be effective.

        A stronger heart
        Over time, exercise increases the size of the heart's chambers and also conditions the heart. As a result, the heart relaxes more easily and pumps more efficiently because it requires less effort to send blood throughout the body.
        Better blood vessels
        High blood pressure results from stiff, inflexible arteries. Exercise boosts the amount of blood circulating through your body by up to 25%, which, over time, encourages blood vessels to expand slightly and become more flexible. Exercise also spurs the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes and widens blood vessels.
        Both aerobic and muscle-building exercises can lower blood pressure slightly in people with normal blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure (defined as 130/80 mm Hg or higher), the average reductions are greater — between 5 and 7 points in systolic pressure (the first number in the reading). ""That's similar to the reduction people experience from taking a blood pressure drug,"" says Dr. Baggish.
        Muscles: The sweet spot?
        During a workout, muscles churn out a protein called GLUT-4, which improves the body's ability to process glucose (sugar) for energy, in part by making cells more sensitive to insulin, the hormone that enables cells to absorb glucose. That's why exercise helps prevent and treat type 2 diabetes. ""If everyone exercised enough, there would be almost no type 2 diabetes, which is largely a function of a sedentary lifestyle typical in Western countries,"" says Dr. Baggish. Type 2 diabetes — which is closely linked to excess weight — doesn't exist in primitive societies, where physical activity is a way of life, he adds.
        Either type of exercise can lower your HbA1c by 0.7 percentage points, which is similar to the reduction from some diabetes drugs. (HbA1c is an average measure of your blood sugar over the past three months; a normal level is less than 5.7%, and levels of 6.5% or higher signal diabetes.)
        Metabolism makeover
        Although exercise is widely touted for helping people burn calories and shed pounds, the amount of weight loss from exercise usually isn't dramatic unless routine exercise is coupled with a healthy, balanced, calorie-restricted diet. However, exercise does help reduce visceral fat — the type that accumulates around the liver and other organs and is strongly linked to a higher risk of heart disease. Exercise has also been shown to modestly lower triglycerides (the most common type of fat in the bloodstream) and harmful LDL cholesterol.

        Regular exercise is believed to help dampen the body's ""fight or flight"" response, which plays a role in chronic stress and anxiety. Exercise may also release naturally occurring cannabis- like chemicals that may boost your sense of well-being. In addition, Dr. Baggish and colleagues recently showed that a single, 30-minute bout of moderate exercise releases a number of proteins into the bloodstream, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF has direct effects on brain function, especially with respect to mood and thinking ability. All of these effects may explain why regular aerobic exercise is as effective as any antidepressant medication, he says.
        And while the heart may reap the bulk of exercise's many benefits, it may be the effect on your brain that inspires you to start moving more. ""You can't feel your nitric oxide level rise or your blood pressure drop. But you can feel the emotional benefits of exercise right away,"" says Dr. Baggish.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/3-easy-ways-to-eat-a-healthier-diet-2021010421673,3 easy ways to eat a healthier diet,"Simple shifts toward healthy eating.
        
        
          
        
        While many people might be taking a pass on formal New Year’s resolutions this year, others may mark a fresh start by resolving to make up for poor eating habits of the past. But this motivation is often focused on a diet that’s too ambitious or restrictive. Without a solid plan, you may fail quickly. So consider a compromise: start with these three easy ways to eat a healthier diet.
        
          Aim for real food only
        
        Look at your plate and note what’s processed and what isn’t. Maybe it’s the whole thing (like a frozen dinner), or maybe it’s just part of your meal (like the bottled dressing on your salad). Think of where you can swap processed foods for healthier versions. Ideas include
        
          eating whole-grain pasta instead of enriched white-flour spaghetti
          having quinoa instead of white rice
          making your own snacks like baked chickpeas, instead of opening a bag of potato chips.
        
        Processed foods are linked with chronic inflammation and other health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. One of the healthiest diets you can eat is a Mediterranean-style eating plan rich in vegetables, legumes, fruits, whole grains, nuts and seeds, fish, poultry, and low-fat dairy products (milk, yogurt, small amounts of cheese).
        
          Schedule your meals and snacks
        
        Set timers on your phone for three different meals and two snacks (if you need them), and don’t eat in between these scheduled times. This might curb your cravings, reduce stress about when you’ll eat next, and cut down on the extra calories of unnecessary snacking — a real challenge if you’re close to a refrigerator all day while at home or work.
        Avoid scheduling late-night meals or snacks, when your body’s internal clock (circadian rhythm) senses that you’re supposed to be sleeping. ""During the circadian sleep period our metabolism slows, our digestive system turns down, and brain temperature drops, part of the process of clearing toxins during sleep. Eating at different times than our typical circadian awake phase leads to weight gain,"" says Dr. Lawrence Epstein, associate physician with the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
        
          Reduce your portion sizes
        
        If you’re like most Americans, you’re eating too much food. An easy way to implement portion control: load your plate as you normally would, then put back a third or half of the food. Other ideas:
        
          Use a salad plate instead of a dinner plate, to fool yourself into taking less food.
          Keep serving bowls off the table, so you won’t be tempted to eat extra helpings.
          Don’t linger at the table and keep eating when you’re already full.
        
        It will also help to know how many calories you should consume in a day. For example, if you’re supposed to eat 2,000 calories per day but you’re scarfing down 3,000, it’s probably time to cut all of your usual portions by a third. How can you figure out your calorie needs? This body weight planner can help you strike a healthy balance between food and activity.
        
          A final thought: Take just one step a week
        
        You don’t need to incorporate all of these steps at one time; try one step per week. Write down what you’re eating and any thoughts or questions you have about the process. After a week, assess what worked and what didn’t. Before long, you’ll have the confidence to attempt new steps.",Heidi Godman,"December 15, 2022",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/dont-want-to-go-to-bed-dealing-with-bedtime-procrastination-202212122865,Don't want to go to bed? Dealing with bedtime procrastination,"A few years ago, the official Twitter account for Netflix sent out the following message: ""Sleep is my greatest enemy."" This perfectly sums up the battle you might experience when you know that you should be in bed but avoid going. But the urge to stay awake may be affecting your health. Here's why it's time to rethink bedtime procrastination and take steps toward a healthier path.
        What is bedtime procrastination?
        Our highly-wired world jockeys to keep us engaged; there's always one more episode to watch, another text to respond to, a few more social media apps to check out. Daily pressures and challenges can make it hard to carve out time for ourselves. Is it any surprise that many of us procrastinate about going to bed?
        Nearly two decades ago, a group of researchers in Europe coined the term ""bedtime procrastination"" to describe someone who goes to bed later than planned, despite knowing that there will be negative consequences if they do. Their research showed that adults who procrastinated significantly about going to bed were more fatigued and slept less compared to those who did not procrastinate.
        One key factor? Smartphone use: procrastinators use their devices for an average of almost 80 minutes before bed compared with 18 minutes for non-procrastinators.
        Why does it matter?
        Routinely getting less sleep than you need, or not getting sufficient good-quality sleep, is associated with many poor health outcomes, including cardiovascular issues like high blood pressure and heart problems, cognitive issues, and depression. Sleep is one of the three pillars of health, along with good nutrition and exercise. Yet encouraging restful sleep is often overlooked as a way to improve our physical and mental well-being.
        What can you do if you struggle with bedtime procrastination?
        Recently, researchers from the Republic of Korea piloted a small trial of a program to target bedtime procrastination. Their program focuses on improving motivation and changing behavior. During this preliminary study, 20 participants engaged in 50-minute sessions once weekly for three weeks, followed by a booster phone call. They reduced time spent procrastinating before bed by more than 60%, and reported fewer struggles with daytime sleepiness and insomnia.
        Five promising takeaways may help you dial down bedtime procrastination:
        
          Figure out your motivation for a positive change. Bedtime procrastination wouldn't occur if it didn't have positive aspects — watching more TV, say, or enjoying the only quiet time you have in the day. However, you're probably not tallying the costs of staying up later than you should. You're experiencing the immediate gratification of being awake now, whereas the potential reward of feeling good in the morning if you go to bed now is a distant possibility, hours and hours away. Be honest with yourself about the pros and cons of bedtime procrastination and how you'll feel the next day.
          Track your sleep patterns. Most likely, you don't remember when you wanted to go to bed versus when you actually went to bed during the past few weeks. Writing this down for a week or two will help you understand if bedtime procrastination is a problem for you.
          Set a realistic goal. Let's say you know that you need to be in bed by 11 pm to feel clear-headed and well the next morning. If you typically go to bed at 1 am, aiming for 11 pm every night is probably not realistic. Start by trying to move your bedtime back by 15 or 30 minutes. If that's successful, keep the momentum going.
          Make a contract for change. One of the most powerful tools you can bring to the table is a promise to another person. It holds you accountable, and greatly increases the likelihood that you will follow through on making a change in your life. Have you ever wondered why you are more likely to go to the gym if you have a personal trainer? In this case, consider sharing your aims and actual results with a partner, parent, child, relative, friend, or coworker.
          Keep an eye out for barriers. As you act on changes, be mindful of the barriers you encounter. For example, you might find yourself feeling lonely at night, which drives you to use your smartphone more than you should to feel connected with others.
        
        The bottom line
        If you procrastinate about going to bed, you are not alone. Whether you feel like you never have enough time for yourself, or stay up too late on Sunday night because you dread your to-do list on Monday morning, your reluctance to sink into sleep is completely understandable. Occasional bedtime procrastination is a normal part of life unlikely to affect your health. However, if you find that consistent procrastination leads to getting less sleep than you need, consider trying strategies designed to curb the habit.","Eric Zhou, PhD","December 12, 2022",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/jump-start-a-healthier-new-year-with-four-holiday-eating-tips-202212072862,Jump-start a healthier New Year with four holiday eating tips,"Many people wait until January 1st to begin eating healthier. After all, the holidays are full of stress and extra helpings of rich festive foods, so why bother?
        But banish that negative thought, because this is an ideal time to adopt new habits. ""The dietary changes you make now can help you manage the stress and avoid overindulging on holiday fare,"" says Teresa Fung, a registered dietitian with Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""Plus, by practicing healthier eating, you can begin the new year with momentum and motivation.""
        4 keys to healthy holiday eating patterns
        Fung suggests four great strategies for healthier fare that can give you a jump-start on a healthful 2023.
        Focus on portion control and mindful eating
        People often overeat during the holidays because of tempting food choices and larger portions — think family dinners and party spreads. ""This is a wonderful chance to practice portion control,"" says Fung. For example, if three different cakes are offered at the party and you like all three, take a tiny slice of each. ""This way, you can enjoy a variety of goodies without overdoing it,"" says Fung.
        Eating at big gatherings is also a chance to practice mindful eating, which can reduce overeating. ""Focus on eating slowly and savoring the flavors, and pause to talk and socialize,"" says Fung. ""The slower pace gives your body time to sense what you've eaten and signal the brain that you are full, so you are less likely to reach for seconds or third servings.""
        Push the plants
        When considering your holiday dishes, make plant-based foods a high priority. For instance, the Mediterranean and MIND diets emphasize eating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and using healthy oils. These diets are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals that help lower blood pressure and maintain a healthy weight (both welcomed gifts during the holidays).
        ""The holidays are an ideal opportunity to begin the transition into a plant-based diet, since you are cooking more than usual and often need new ideas for meals,"" says Fung. Here are some ways you can begin adopting plant-based habits.
        
          Eat more salads. These are great for holiday parties and family meals, as you can make large amounts. ""Another approach is to add a side salad to at least one daily meal,"" says Fung.
          Adopt a vegetarian day. Once a week, go vegetarian for the entire day and eat nothing but fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. ""This can help you recognize the types and amounts of foods you need to eat without the overwhelming pressure to do it all the time,"" says Fung. As you get more comfortable, try two days a week. A fun option is to consider specific meals or foods for certain days of the week, like Whole-Grain Wednesdays and Stir-Fry Fridays.
          Try new recipes. Creating just one new vegetarian meal per week can help make preparing meals less daunting. ""There are many easy, healthy recipes on the Internet,"" says Fung. ""Find something that uses ingredients you like and that requires only a few steps or minimal cooking skills.""
        
        Get spicy
        With all the extra baking and cooking, the holidays are the ideal time to add more spices to your diet. Many spices contain antioxidants, flavonoids, and other beneficial compounds that are involved in mood and inflammation regulation.
        ""There are a lot of spice mixes available that combine a variety of spices and can be used on all kinds of meals, from poultry to soups to side dishes,"" says Fung. Better yet, experiment with creating your own spice mix. ""You don't have to know what you are doing, just give it a try and enjoy your creation,"" says Fung.
        Go light on the alcohol
        One survey found that the average adult consumes three alcoholic drinks daily during the holidays. And a new study suggests that just one daily drink may raise a person's risk of cardiovascular disease. Then there are the extra calories to consider. Depending on the type of beverage (beer, wine, spirits) and the amount, calories per serving can range from about 120 to more than 200.
        If you do enjoy raising a glass of celebratory cheer, Fung suggests switching to sparkling water or a cocktail made of one-third fruit juice and two-thirds sparkling water after one or two drinks. ""This can help keep you from drinking too much, and help you realize you can enjoy social settings without alcohol even after the holidays are over,"" she says.",Matthew Solan,"December 7, 2022",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/americans-use-of-prescription-sleep-medications-drops-dramatically,Americans' use of prescription sleep medications drops dramatically,"After rising steeply for several decades, Americans' use of prescription sleep aids is dropping sharply, a new study suggests.
        The study, published online July 12, 2022, by the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, analyzed data from 29,400 adults gathered from 2013 to 2018 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. At three separate visits over this period, participants presented prescription bottles for all medications they'd used in the prior month. Researchers noted all medications used for sleep disturbance (whether or not they were FDA-approved for that use) and examined changes in their use over time.
        Over the course of the study, the likelihood of participants using sleep medications dropped 31%. Notably, among participants 80 and older — who are most vulnerable to falls when using sleep medications — researchers saw an 86% reduction in FDA-approved sleep medication use.
        While the researchers said the COVID-19 pandemic may have since influenced the trend of sleep aid use, they were encouraged by the study's findings. Medical and public health groups have strongly discouraged the use of sleep medications because of side effects such as dizziness and lightheadedness, which can lead to falls.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/do-fermented-foods-live-up-to-the-hype,Do fermented foods live up to the hype?,"Wander down a supermarket's refrigerated aisle nowadays and you'll notice shelves packed with fermented foods and drinks. Newer additions such as milk-based kefir, kimchi (Korean cabbage), kombucha (tea), and tempeh (soybeans) have joined perennial favorites such as yogurt, sauerkraut, and beer, highlighting a market projected to grow globally by $533 million over the next four years.
        But the fresh popularity of fermented foods belies a heritage dating thousands of years. Ancient civilizations used fermentation, which incorporates bacteria and yeast to break down sugars and carbohydrates, to transform flavors, and prevent spoilage. Scientists have long since learned that fermented foods also contain live microorganisms called probiotics, which bolster a healthier mix of the trillions of ""good"" bacteria that live in our gut.
        Does this mean you should load up your shopping cart with fermented foods and drinks? Only if you're realistic about what you're buying, a Harvard expert says. Heat and bright lighting used in commercial food manufacturing can kill off the very probiotics advertised on product labels.
        ""Nothing on the label tells us that,"" says Nancy Oliveira, a registered dietitian and manager of the Nutrition and Wellness Service at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""In reality, there may not be as many probiotics or microbes left in fermented foods as they started with. You buy them believing they're so good for you, but they may not be able to provide all of the intended health benefits.""
        Array of health benefits
        That said, eating and drinking even small amounts of probiotics over time can support our health, Oliveira says. A 2021 study in the journal Cell adds to research underscoring the advantages. The analysis suggests diets rich in fermented foods increase gut bacteria variety and lower inflammation markers better than a high-fiber diet.
        But high-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains certainly figure into the power of probiotics, Oliveira says. Dubbed ""prebiotics,"" these foods fuel the growth of different types of intestinal bacteria and work hand in hand with fermented foods to promote these effects:
        Smooth digestion. The fermentation process has already broken down some natural sugars and starches, so your digestive tract doesn't have to work as hard. The ""good"" bacteria in fermented products can also help digest other foods you eat.
        Dampen inflammation. Probiotics stimulate proper immune system function and may lower the risks of inflammation-driven conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, Oliveira says.
        Boost nutrient absorption. Fermented products may deactivate substances in other foods dubbed ""antinutrients,"" which can inhibit the absorption of essential nutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamins B12 and K.
        Battle bad bacteria. Beneficial bacteria lower your intestine's pH levels and produce germ-fighting proteins. Both can quell the overgrowth of harmful bacteria.
        
          
            
              
                Sourdough's belly benefits
                Billions of people around the world eat some type of bread every day. But sourdough rose above its competitors as the pandemic bore down in 2020. Social media teemed with comforting images of homebound bakers turning out tantalizing loaves during a stomach-churning era.
                Indeed, stress-induced tummy troubles drove many people to try sourdough during the global health crisis, says Nancy Oliveira, manager of the Nutrition and Wellness Service at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Fermented using a ""starter"" that typically contains lactic acid bacteria and yeast, sourdough has long been a favorite of those interested in so-called low-bloat foods that are more easily digested and ""easier on the gut,"" Oliveira says.
                Aside from its distinctive ""sour-ish"" taste and chewy texture, how does sourdough stand apart from whole-grain breads? Its fermentation process can reduce components known as ""anti-nutrients"" that are found in some whole grains, improving nutrient absorption and fueling digestion. Oliveira adds that sourdough also boasts antioxidants — which can lower the odds of some diseases — and a lower glycemic index than white bread, which means it can minimize spikes in blood sugar levels.
              
            
          
        
        Buying tips
        If you're able to ferment your own foods, such as pickles, sauerkraut, or sourdough bread, doing so can preserve the full complement of beneficial bacteria that commercial manufacturing might destroy, Oliveira says. Otherwise, here are some strategies for getting the biggest probiotic punch from store-bought versions.
        Look for live cultures. The words ""live and active cultures"" might appear on the label (as in yogurt), or you may see bubbles in liquids (such as kombucha, though sometimes added carbon dioxide produces the fizz). These signs mean the product likely contains probiotics.
        Make sure they're refrigerated. Shelf-stable products labeled as ""fermented"" are typically pickled using vinegar, not live organisms, and don't contain probiotics.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/eating-disorders-in-midlife,Eating disorders in midlife,"What does an eating disorder look like? Likely to spring to mind is a young, waiflike woman strutting down a catwalk, bones protruding under her clothing. Yet her older sisters aren't immune to anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating. Weight-control efforts veer into dangerous territory in more women at midlife and beyond than popular images suggest.
        It's no secret that most of us have dieted at some point — some of us on a regular basis — but women can face unique stressors as we age that increase our risks of eating disorders, Harvard experts say. The rigors of calorie restriction or binge-purge cycles on an older body, in particular, can also lead to worsened health effects.
        By age 40, one in five women has dealt with an eating disorder, twice the proportion identified in women at age 21, according to a 2019 study in JAMA Network Open. Many cases are likely a resurgence of a long-simmering pattern from earlier years that may have flown under the radar, says Dr. Holly Peek, associate medical director of the Klarman Eating Disorders Center at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital.
        ""Many women with eating disorders in midlife have had the problem for most of their lives,"" Dr. Peek says. ""And a lot are going through major life transitions starting around age 40 that are all different from those of a teenage or young woman.""
        Disordered eating that barely skirts the line between normal and problematic is also highly common, more so than diagnosed eating disorders. ""Up to midlife, it could look like chronic dieting, yo-yo dieting, or excessive exercise. Sometimes women get wrapped up in this identity of being a gym rat who eats very clean, and menopause-fueled body changes make them ramp it up even more,"" Dr. Peek says. ""It may not even feel like a problem to them. It gets really complicated.""
        Midlife risk factors
        Many variations of eating disorders are possible, but three types dominate: anorexia nervosa, characterized by extreme food restriction; bulimia nervosa, gorging followed by purging through vomiting or laxative use; and binge eating disorder, eating huge amounts past the point of feeling full.
        Anorexia becomes less common after age 26, but bulimia rates don't top out until age 47, according to a November 2017 study in the International Journal of Eating Disorders. Meanwhile, binge eating disorder — the most common eating disorder in all adults — can continue to be a problem for women in their 70s.
        What fuels such pathologic preoccupation with food and weight through the decades? Midlife and older women may be trying to stay competitive in the workplace, where thinness may be associated with youth, or re-emerge on the dating scene after divorce or widowhood. The jolt of an empty nest may also propel body-redefining efforts.
        ""The importance of body image seems to be a key feature that makes women either return to or start an eating disorder,"" says Dr. Bettina Bentley, a primary care physician at Harvard University Health Services. ""With aging, many women are also disturbed by the lack of control over the ways their body is changing.""
        Indeed, estrogen shifts related to the menopause transition can heighten eating disorder risks. ""We know that estrogen plays a role in developing an eating disorder on both ends of the age spectrum, but in terms of why, the jury is still out,"" Dr. Peek says. ""Women during menopause are more likely to gain weight, and you may feel your body is working against you.""
        
          
            
              
                How can you spot an eating disorder?
                Extreme weight loss is a clear sign someone may have an eating disorder. But how else might you spot this condition in yourself or others? Look for
                
                  dramatic weight fluctuations, whether up or down
                  preoccupation with weight, calories, and body size and shape
                  refusal to eat certain foods or categories of foods (such as sugar or carbohydrates)
                  excessive exercising
                  skipping meals or eating only tiny portions at regular meals
                  food rituals, such as excessive chewing or not allowing different foods on a plate to touch
                  signs of purging behaviors, such as frequent bathroom trips, vomiting sounds or odors, or laxative wrappers
                  lots of empty food wrappers or containers within short periods.
                
                ""Anytime these thoughts and behaviors are taking over your life, it's a sign to seek help,"" says Dr. Holly Peek, associate medical director of the Klarman Eating Disorders Center at McLean Hospital.
              
            
          
        
        Array of health effects
        Even when invisible to others, eating disorders can take a toll on the body. At a minimum, women with eating disorders are often deficient in some nutrients, particularly iron, vitamin B12, calcium, and vitamin D, says Margaret Schrier, a registered dietitian and head of nutrition at Harvard University Health Services. ""Supplements can help with deficiencies and are usually well tolerated by patients,"" Schrier says. She advises taking them with food, since they may not be absorbed as well on an empty stomach.
        Extreme weight loss, purging, and malnutrition can also lead to these problems:
        Bone loss. The risk of bone fracture is seven times higher in someone who's had anorexia than in the general population, Dr. Bentley says. While bone density testing isn't routinely recommended for women in their 50s, she orders it for those she thinks might have an eating disorder as well as those who've broken bones.
        Heart problems. Lower electrolyte levels from disordered eating can lead to an irregular heartbeat. Women in midlife are also more likely to take medications for chronic conditions, which can increase this risk. ""It's more of a recipe for a medical emergency, because your body just isn't as resilient as when you were 16,"" Dr. Peek says.
        Lung conditions. Chest muscles become weaker over time, especially in people who repeatedly force themselves to vomit. This raises pneumonia risk.
        Gastrointestinal issues. Reflux, bloating, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea may be dismissed as consequences of aging but instead may be related to an eating disorder.
        Diabetes. People with binge eating disorder have far higher rates of diabetes, likely fueled by frequent blood sugar spikes after gorging, Dr. Bentley says.
        Skin breakdown. Poor wound healing and profound facial wrinkling is common in people with longstanding anorexia, Dr. Bentley says. This probably reflects overall poor nutritional status.
        While eating disorders claim more lives than any other type of psychiatric illness, only 27% of those affected seek professional help. A team of health professionals that include a dietitian and therapist can help shepherd patients to better physical and mental wellness. If you suspect you have an eating disorder, don't be afraid to have a frank conversation with your doctor. She is trained to assess and treat eating disorders as she would any other medical condition, without judgment.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/muscle-pain-in-statin-users-is-probably-not-caused-by-the-drug,Muscle pain in statin users is probably not caused by the drug,"While muscle pain is a possible side effect of taking a statin medication, an analysis published Sept. 10, 2022, in The Lancet found that it's uncommon, and most pain stems from something other than the cholesterol-lowering drug.
        Researchers reviewed 19 trials with more than 120,000 people who took either a daily statin or a placebo for an average of four years. (Most dosages were moderate-intensity regimens that typically reduced LDL cholesterol levels by approximately one-third.) About 25% of people reported muscle pain whether they took statins or not.
        Among statin users, the drug was found to have a marginal impact on pain risk. In general, symptoms were rated as mild and gone within a year despite continuing the drug. A separate analysis of four trials, comparing high statin doses with moderate or low doses, showed a greater likelihood of muscle pain symptoms from higher doses. But almost always, the benefits of high-intensity doses outweigh any muscle aches the user may experience, the researchers noted.
        They also suggested that many people who develop muscle pain after beginning a statin experience a ""nocebo effect,"" where negative expectations can lead to perceived side effects. In other words, some people think a statin will cause discomfort, so they blame the drug even though muscle aches and pain generally are more common with age.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-can-i-tell-if-i-have-a-concussion,How can I tell if I have a concussion?,"Q.
          I tripped over the vacuum cord the other day and whacked my head on the banister. I seem okay now, but how would I know if I got a concussion?
        
        A. Ouch! Few of us haven't hit our heads in a similar way at some point. But a blow like that only sometimes results in a concussion, which is when the brain bumps around or twists in the skull and damages brain cells.
        After a bump on the head, it's wise to look for concussion signs such as headache, sensitivity to light, eye pain or fatigue, neck pain or stiffness, imbalance, impaired depth perception, difficulty remembering things, or changes in sleep patterns.
        Get checked out if you're experiencing these symptoms or if you simply have the sense that you're not okay. Your doctor will complete a concussion assessment that may include a balance test, memory and speech evaluation, and a visual test. Seeing your doctor early will give her the ability to tailor a treatment plan to your symptoms if you are diagnosed with a concussion.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/poor-physical-function-may-predict-cardiovascular-disease,Poor physical function may predict cardiovascular disease,"Staying functionally fit helps you safely perform everyday movements, reduce the risk of falls, and live independently. But evidence suggests it may also lower your risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. Researchers examined 5,570 adults (average age 75) who were part of the ongoing Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.
        Participants' physical function was graded low, intermediate, or high, based on several tests, such as walking speed, speed of rising from a chair without using the hands, and standing balance. Over a follow-up period averaging seven years, the researchers kept track of who suffered a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure, adjusting for risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Compared with adults with high physical function scores, those with low scores were 47% more likely to experience at least one of these cardiovascular events. Those with intermediate scores were 25% more likely.
        While the study only revealed an association, it adds further evidence to the importance of maintaining high physical function as you age. The results appeared Sept. 6, 2022, in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/gout-linked-with-risk-for-heart-attack-and-stroke,Gout linked with risk for heart attack and stroke,"Gout flare-ups are trouble enough, but according to a study published Aug. 2, 2022, in JAMA, an episode may signal an increased risk for a heart attack or stroke over the following two months. Gout strikes when too much uric acid builds up in the body and gets deposited in one or more joints, causing severe joint pain, swelling, and redness.
        Researchers looked at more than 62,000 people diagnosed with gout, 70% of whom were men (average age 77). They found that about 10,000 patients had experienced strokes or heart attacks within four months after a flare-up. The risk was greatest during the first 60 days and then gradually declined.
        The results only showed an association, but other research has linked high uric acid levels with increased incidence of hypertension and diabetes, two leading contributors to heart attacks and strokes. While reducing high uric acid levels does not directly lower risk for a heart attack or stroke, an attack of gout does offer the opportunity to take steps to prevent these events as well as future gout flare-ups. This means making any necessary dietary and medicine changes to control gout and to ensure your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels are at healthy levels.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/you-dont-say-myths-about-teeth,You don't say? Myths about teeth,"There are many myths and misconceptions about what makes for a healthy smile. Here are some truths behind the more common ones.
        All dental stains can be whitened. Coffee, tea, and tobacco discolor or stain teeth. These stains usually can be removed with either a professional cleaning or a tooth-whitening procedure. However, discoloration related to damage or death of the pulp (the tooth's soft core, which contains blood vessels and nerves) is harder to fix. But it's not impossible. The procedure involves putting bleach into the part of the tooth with the pulp. Some stains don't respond well to whitening or cleaning. Those require a procedure called bonding, in which a dentist paints a plastic-like material onto the tooth.
        ""Soft"" teeth cause cavities. Teeth are naturally hard. The enamel that covers the part of the teeth above the gum line is the hardest substance in the human body. It's not ""softness"" that causes cavities. They occur when acid produced by bacteria dissolves the hard enamel. This missing enamel (the ""soft spot"" in the tooth) is the cavity. But the tooth itself is not soft.
        Chewing gum is bad for your teeth. Chewing gum increases saliva production, which helps to clean teeth. However, the sugar in most gum feeds cavity-causing bacteria. A better option is sugar-free gum containing xylitol, an artificial sweetener that can fight oral bacteria.
        Fluoride is unsafe. Numerous studies refute claims that the usual level of fluoride in drinking water causes problems, such as heart disease, allergies, and genetic abnormalities, to name a few. That said, fluoride can be dangerous when ingested excessively — 2.5 to 5 grams for an average adult. But this would require drinking 5,000 to 10,000 glasses of fluoridated water in a single day.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/dont-be-the-fall-guy,Don't be the fall guy,"Every second, someone age 65 or older suffers a fall, making it the No. 1 cause of injury-related death in this age group. According to the CDC, about 20% of falls in adults lead to life-altering changes, primarily from broken bones or head injury.
        ""The best way to protect yourself is to address the three main physical conditions that contribute to falls: weak stabilizer muscles, poor core strength, and balance issues,"" says Carina O'Neill, a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        Stabilizer muscles. The stabilizer muscles keep you upright and allow you to easily change directions. Two essential stabilizers for fall prevention are the gluteus medius (located on the side of the hip) and the gluteus maximus (the largest buttock muscle). ""These work both together and independently to allow us to stand upright and stabilize the back and pelvis as we move during activities,"" says O'Neill.
        Core strength. Core strength is vital for fall prevention, as your body's core is the epicenter from which every movement revolves. ""As we walk, our bodies constantly have to adapt to ever-changing ground levels,"" says O'Neill. ""Adequate core stability and strength help you better react to these sudden changes and prevent potential falls."" The core consists of several muscle groups: the rectus abdominis (the ""six-pack"" or ""abs""); the obliques, located on the sides and front of your abdomen; and the transverse abdominis muscles, which lie under the obliques and attach to your spine.
        Stabilizer and core muscles weaken over time as men naturally lose muscle mass, a condition called sarcopenia. ""These muscles further weaken from a sedentary lifestyle or when people follow a regular exercise program that neglects these areas,"" says O'Neill.
        Balance. Sense of balance naturally wanes over time, as do reflexes and coordination. This makes it easier to topple and harder to catch yourself if you do have a misstep. Another cause of poor balance is deterioration of the inner ear's vestibular system. It feeds information to the brain about motion, head position, and spatial orientation, and it, too, becomes less effective as we age.
        Defense is the best offense when it comes to fall prevention. ""Take steps now to address areas that place you at a higher risk for falls,"" O'Neill advises. Here are some strategies for shoring up your stabilizer muscles, core strength, and balance.
        
          
            
              
                Headed for a fall?
                You can check your fall risk with some simple tests. Place one foot in front of the other so the toes and heel touch (like how you would measure distance on the floor) and try to stand without losing your balance for up to a minute. Another version is to walk heel-to-toe, like on a tightrope, for 20 steps. ""If you have trouble maintaining balance and stability with either of these, you should discuss it with your doctor,"" says Carina O'Neill, a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
              
            
          
        
        Side to side
        Side-to-side leg movements, like those you make when playing tennis or pickleball, can strengthen the gluteus medius and gluteus maximus muscles. If you're not into racquet sports, there are many exercises that work. One is the clam, a simple floor exercise that targets both muscles. Here's how to do it:
        
          Lie on your right side, your left leg on top of your right, and your knees comfortably bent.
          Keeping your feet together, raise your left knee, rotating the left leg until it makes a 90° angle to the right leg (or as high as is comfortable).
          Hold for a second and slowly return to the starting position.
          Do eight to 10 repetitions to complete one set. Do two to three sets.
          Change sides, and complete the same number of repetitions and sets with the opposite leg.
        
        For more of a challenge, wrap a resistance band around both legs above the knee.
        Bridge and plank
        Bridge and plank poses are two exercises that O'Neill recommends to strengthen your core.
        Bridge. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Place your arms at your sides. Relax your shoulders against the floor. Tighten your buttocks and abdominal muscles, press your heels into the floor, and lift your hips as high as is comfortable, or until they are in line with your shoulders and knees. Hold for a second. Return to the starting position. Do this eight to 12 times. Rest 30 to 90 seconds, and repeat the entire set.
        Plank. Lie facedown with your forearms resting on the floor. Tighten your abs and raise your body to form a straight line from your head to your feet. Hold for 15 to 30 seconds. Rest 30 to 60 seconds, and repeat one or two more times. You can also hold the plank from a full push-up position, or on your forearms with your knees on the ground.
        
          
            
              
                Other contributors
                Health conditions can further contribute to falls. Examples include arthritis (which can cause stiffness in the ankles, knees, and hip), peripheral neuropathy (nerve disease) involving the feet or lower legs, and heart arrhythmia (a change in heartbeat speed or rhythm that can cause weakness, dizziness, or fainting). Vision problems like cataracts, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration also can contribute to balance problems.
              
            
          
        
        Tai chi
        According to O'Neill, one of the best ways to improve balance is practicing tai chi. The ancient Chinese martial art consists of slow controlled movements focusing on weight distribution and rotation. Numerous studies have supported its use to improve balance and coordination and reduce fall risk among older adults and others at high risk for falls, like stroke survivors.
        Another exercise for improving balance is one-legged standing. Stand on one leg for 30 to 60 seconds, using a counter or the back of a chair for support as needed. Switch legs and repeat. Go back and forth between the two poses several times.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/kidney-health-quick-start-guide,Kidney health quick-start guide,"We all want to protect our heart and our brain. But how often do you think about protecting your kidneys? The health of those two bean-shaped organs is easy to take for granted, especially since there aren't noticeable signs of trouble until chronic kidney disease — an irreversible loss of kidney function — has already developed. And with 37 million people in the United States struggling with the condition, and millions more at risk for developing it, it's important to pay attention to your kidneys now, when you can protect them.
        The role of the kidneys
        The kidneys — located on either side of the spine, just below your rib cage — perform many important functions. They route blood through a complex filtering system that removes toxins; hold on to fluid, salt, or other minerals the body needs; and send the waste (urine) to the bladder to be flushed out of the body.
        These remarkable organs also help regulate your blood pressure, convert vitamin D to its active form, and release hormones needed for blood pressure control and red blood cell production.
        Chronic kidney disease
        Unhealthy lifestyle habits, chronic diseases, and genetic conditions can damage the kidneys and reduce their ability to do their many jobs.
        ""When your kidneys don't effectively flush out toxins, the toxins build up in the blood. That can hurt the heart and brain and cause problems with blood pressure, blood, bones, and nerves,"" says Dr. Joseph Bonventre, chief of the Division of Renal Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Samuel A. Levine Distinguished Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        Treatment
        If kidney disease is caught early, certain medications may slow its development. ""For many years, we had only one set of drugs to protect against kidney disease progression. Those drugs target blood pressure and cardiovascular function. More recently, new drugs originally designed to treat diabetes, called SGLT2 inhibitors, have been found to help prevent kidney damage, even in people without diabetes,"" Dr. Bonventre says.
        People with very advanced kidney disease need to have a machine filter their blood for them (a treatment called dialysis) or get a kidney transplant, breakthroughs pioneered at Harvard Medical School.
        Protect your kidneys now
        There's a lot you can do now to keep your kidneys healthy.
        Control diabetes. Diabetes is the top cause of chronic kidney disease, likely because exposure to high blood sugar damages tiny blood vessels in the kidney. ""The best things you can do if you have diabetes are to control blood sugar levels and lose weight,"" Dr. Bonventre says.
        Reduce high blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major contributor to kidney disease progression. ""High blood pressure can damage the kidney's filters and small blood vessels,"" Dr. Bonventre says.
        Limit salt. Salt can cause your body to retain excessive fluids and raise blood pressure (in some people). The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting salt intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day. ""Avoid salty restaurant and processed foods. Look for low-salt foods at the grocery store. And don't add salt to your food. Use other spices instead. And as long as your kidney function is good, you can use a salt substitute,"" Dr. Bonventre says.
        Limit oxalate-rich foods. Spinach, almonds, cashews, and rhubarb are all loaded with oxalate, a chemical that can form kidney stones and deposits that sometimes lead to kidney disease. ""You don't have to avoid these foods, but eat them in moderation. Don't eat a big plate of spinach every night,"" Dr. Bonventre says.
        Watch your protein intake. Having too much protein in the diet forces the kidneys to work overtime. Can it harm them? ""Some observational studies suggest that long-term high-protein diets can cause kidney disease. But it's hotly debated,"" Dr. Bonventre says. ""Why take a chance? Limit protein to the recommended daily amount in grams, which is determined by multiplying your weight in pounds by 0.36.""
        Limit alcohol intake. Don't have more than one drink per day. Regular excessive alcohol drinking increases the risk for high blood pressure, contributes to weight gain, and makes the kidneys work harder. Over all, it may double the risk for kidney disease.
        Lose weight if you need to. ""Obesity makes the kidneys work harder than they need to do. This can ultimately cause the kidney filters to break down,"" Dr. Bonventre says.
        Stop smoking. Smoking damages blood vessels, including those providing oxygen and nutrients to the kidneys. Smoking can also make drugs that treat high blood pressure less effective.
        Exercise regularly. Aerobic exercise — the kind that makes your heart and lungs work hard, like brisk walking — helps blood vessels stay healthy, flexible, and able to expand and contract well. Aim for 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week.
        Stay hydrated. Getting enough fluids each day — from water or watery foods like fruit and soup — helps the kidneys flush out toxins from the body. You need about four to six cups of fluids per day to stay hydrated.
        Limit these painkillers. High doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve), can cause kidney damage and worsen existing kidney disease. Follow dosing directions carefully.
        Get an annual kidney function test. ""You should get a blood test and a urine analysis once a year to check kidney function,"" Dr. Bonventre says. ""The urine analysis lets us check for protein in the urine, which would reflect the early stages of kidney disease. And the sooner we catch it, the more likely it is that we can slow the progression of kidney disease and give you a better and longer quality of life.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-your-medications-keeping-you-up-at-night,Are your medications keeping you up at night?,"It's 4 a.m., and you can't sleep. As you lie awake wondering why, consider whether any of your medications could be causing the trouble.
        ""Medications can interfere with sleep in a number of ways. Some delay sleep onset, which is how long it takes you to fall asleep. Some cause frequent nighttime awakenings or trigger early morning waking. And some medications impair sleep quality or how rested you feel in the morning,"" says Jennifer Corapi, a psychiatric clinical pharmacist at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Common offenders
        Medications that affect sleep can be prescription drugs or over-the-counter remedies. Here are some common culprits.
        Antidepressants. Antidepressants are typically prescribed to treat depression or anxiety, and they have varying side effects, even within the same drug class. For example, among selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), fluoxetine (Prozac) can be stimulating and make it hard to fall or stay asleep. ""But another SSRI, paroxetine [Paxil], can be more sedating and make you sleepy,"" Corapi says.
        Beta blockers. Beta blockers such as metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL) and atenolol (Tenormin) are used primarily to treat high blood pressure or an irregular heartbeat. ""One side effect is that the medications can decrease the body's natural levels of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle. If beta blockers suppress melatonin, you might have trouble falling or staying asleep at night,"" Corapi says.
        Decongestants. Decongestants such as phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine help shrink swollen membranes in the nasal passages, allowing more air to pass through them. ""Both drugs can be stimulating. They can raise your blood pressure and heart rate, and may cause insomnia in some people,"" Corapi says. ""We don't recommend them for people with heart problems, a history of stroke, or high blood pressure.
        Diuretics. Diuretics such as furosemide (Lasix), torsemide (Demadex), and hydrochlorothiazide reduce the amount of sodium and water in the body. They're prescribed to treat high blood pressure, kidney disorders, liver disease, and fluid retention caused by heart failure. ""Diuretics don't affect sleep directly, but they can interrupt sleep if they make you go to the bathroom during the night,"" Corapi says.
        Smoking-cessation drugs. Over-the-counter nicotine replacement medications such as nicotine patches, gum, or lozenges help people stop smoking. ""Nicotine can cause someone to have unusual dreams or nightmares and wake them up,"" Corapi says. Prescription medications that curb smoking can also interfere with sleep. One drug, varenicline (Chantix), affects the same brain areas as nicotine replacement products and can cause nightmares. Another drug, bupropion (Wellbutrin), is an antidepressant that may be stimulating and make it hard to fall asleep.
        Steroids. Oral steroids such as prednisone are used to reduce inflammation inside the body. ""Prednisone stimulates the production of the stress hormone cortisol and mimics what stress does to the body,"" Corapi says. ""And one thing stress does is disrupt the sleep cycle."" Steroids are usually taken short-term, but certain chronic diseases might require longer-term therapy.
        What you can do
        There are a number of things you can do if you think your sleep problems could be related to your medications. For starters, write down the date, dose, and time of every drug you take, as well as any symptoms you experience, to find patterns linking symptoms to medications. You can also try the following strategies, if your doctor or pharmacist says it's okay.
        Take the medication during the day. This applies to drugs that make it hard to fall or stay asleep, cause nightmares, or make you to get up and go to the bathroom. For example: ""We advise patients not to take diuretics within six hours of bedtime,"" Corapi says.
        Take a melatonin supplement before bed. Melatonin is a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. ""It may help for the short term, until your body gets used to the medication that's causing sleep difficulty,"" Corapi says.
        Take a lower dose. Ask your doctor if lowering your medication dose will help you get better sleep.
        Practice good sleep hygiene. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day; avoid caffeine after lunch; don't drink alcohol or eat close to bedtime; turn off electronic screens an hour before bed; and sleep in a cool, dark, comfortable spot.
        Switch to a new medication. ""If you've tried everything and sleep problems are becoming distressing, ask your doctor if you can switch to a medication that won't affect your sleep,"" Corapi says. ""There's often a good alternative.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-the-future-of-remote-patient-monitoring,What's the future of remote patient monitoring?,"Q.
          I use a home blood pressure machine, and my doctor says it helps her take better care of me. Are there other home machines, measuring other aspects of my health, that also could help her, and me?
        
        A. There's a growing number of devices that monitor your body throughout the day, and many more are coming in the future. Nearly 50 million people in the United States currently use such ""remote patient monitoring"" devices. Home blood pressure machines were among the first. Most of them require that you put a cuff around your arm; then, you tap a button, the cuff starts to tighten, and after 30 seconds or so, the cuff relaxes and the machine shows your blood pressure on a little screen. That's neat, but the machine only measures your blood pressure when you remember to do so. And it typically doesn't send the results automatically to your doctor. Also, it's not with you all the time, like when someone says or does something that would raise anyone's blood pressure.
        The miniaturization of electronics is leading to the development of next-generation devices. For example, a 2022 report in the journal Nature Nanotechnology described an experimental device — a thin strip of material that you paste onto your skin, just above your wrist. Like a sticky note, it stays securely on your skin, but you can easily remove it. Inside the strip are tiny sensors that painlessly and automatically measure the blood pressure in the artery that delivers blood to your hand. You go about your day normally, not even thinking about it. You can even exercise, including doing push-ups: the tiny sensors above your wrist just keep checking your pressure. Then, using your smartphone or smart watch, and with your permission, the strip can automatically send the readings over the Internet to your doctor's office. The office can spot worrisome trends immediately — trends you may be unaware of.
        As for the present, people today are using various devices (typically smart watches) to measure their heart rate, the regularity of their heart rhythm, the quality of their sleep, their body temperature, and the levels of oxygen and sugar in their blood. People with diabetes no longer need to stick their fingers to determine if their blood sugar is under control; they can just stick their smartphone next to a little device pasted to their skin.
        As for the future, scientists are working on devices that measure other blood chemicals besides oxygen and sugar, and that constantly monitor the function of organs inside us. Remote patient monitoring is still in its infancy, but I think it will be an increasingly important part of our future.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/attention-deficit-disorder-linked-to-higher-heart-disease-risk,Attention deficit disorder linked to higher heart disease risk,"People with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — a condition marked by trouble focusing and impulsive behavior — may be more likely to have cardiovascular disease than people without the disorder, a new study finds.
        Between 2001 and 2013, researchers reviewed the records of nearly 5.4 million people without cardiovascular disease who were born in Sweden between 1941 and 1983. During a follow-up period averaging nearly 12 years, 38% of those with ADHD were diagnosed with at least one form of cardiovascular disease, compared with 24% of people without ADHD.
        People with ADHD were more likely to have other factors known to raise the risk of heart problems, including obesity, sleep problems, and heavy smoking. Even after adjusting for these and other potentially confounding factors, however, the elevated risk persisted. Of note, the higher risk of cardiovascular disease was the same whether or not people took medication for ADHD. People with ADHD should be carefully monitored for heart disease, say the authors, who published their findings in the October 2022 issue of World Psychiatry.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/some-heart-patients-need-antibiotics-before-dental-work,Some heart patients need antibiotics before dental work,"Guidelines suggest that people with certain heart conditions take antibiotics before invasive dental procedures. A new study confirms the benefit of this practice for reducing the risk of endocarditis, a serious heart infection often caused by bacteria from the mouth.
        Published Sept. 13, 2022, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, the study relied on health and dental records from nearly eight million people, including more than 36,000 at high risk for endocarditis. This includes people with a replaced or repaired heart valve, certain congenital heart defects, or a history of endocarditis.
        Only about one-third of people at high risk for endocarditis received antibiotics before invasive dental procedures. Among those who didn't receive antibiotics, the risk of endocarditis was 10 times higher following a tooth extraction and 12.5 times higher after oral surgery compared with those who received antibiotics before the procedures.

In addition, according to a survey released by the American Heart Association earlier this year, 95% of pet parents report that they rely on their pets for stress relief. Companion animals also provide other mental and physical benefits that may be good for your heart (see ""The proof about cats and dogs"").
        ""Pets provide us with a sense of belonging, connection, and contentment for which we all long,"" explains Dr. Beth Frates, director of lifestyle medicine and wellness in the Department of Surgery at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. The excitement dogs often display when you arrive home makes you feel special and loved. Hearing a cat's gentle purring can be very soothing. Sitting quietly and stroking your pet's soft coat can trigger the release of oxytocin, the so-called love hormone, she adds.

                Nearly a decade ago, an American Heart Association scientific statement concluded that pet ownership — especially dog ownership — may be linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. A more recent review, published in the August 2022 issue of Current Hypertension Reports, reiterated that message. Having a pet appears to lower the risk of developing high blood pressure and may improve blood pressure control in people who already have the condition, the authors say. The main mechanism behind these benefits? Pets seem to dampen the body's stress response.
                There's only limited evidence suggesting that cat owners have lower blood pressure. However, dog owners also tend to have lower resting heart rates and lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels than non-owners, according to the review.
                But does owning a dog actually make you healthier — or are healthier people more likely to own dogs? Most research tries to account for possible confounding factors, but that's not always possible.
              
            
          
        
        More than just a walk?
        Dog owners also benefit from the extra physical activity of daily walks. Research suggests that, on average, people who own dogs walk about 20 minutes more per day than those who don't have a dog. But these walks can offer more than just a fitness boost. ""Dogs are great mindfulness teachers because they live in the moment, using their senses of smell, hearing, sight, and touch as they move through the world,"" says Dr. Frates. Follow your dog's lead when taking a walk, paying close attention to your dog and your immediate surroundings, she suggests, noting that this mindfulness practice is good way to de-stress. Walking in a green, wooded area may offer added stress relief, as suggested by research on the Japanese practice of shinrin-yoku, or ""forest bathing,"" which promotes a slow, relaxed enjoyment of nature.
        Connecting with other people
        A daily dog walk can also help you forge connections and even friendships with your neighbors and other dog owners. ""With my goldendoodle Reese, I often talked to new people on my walks, especially when she was a puppy. People wanted to pet her and share their experiences with dogs or express their interest in adopting a dog,"" says Dr. Frates. Setting up ""play dates"" for your dog provides fun and extra exercise for the dogs as well as time for the owners to chat. Many friendships are started at the dog park, Dr. Frates says. Increasingly, loneliness and social isolation are being recognized as contributing to a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from either of these causes. If you live alone, a pet may be particularly helpful not just for companionship but also for expanding your social circle.
        Important considerations
        Of course, owning a pet is a serious responsibility, requiring time, money, and energy. For older adults, the size, strength, and temperament of a dog are important things to consider, says Dr. Frates. Larger dogs may require more exercise, but be aware that smaller dogs and cats can be tripping hazards. Also, letting a pet sleep in your bed can disrupt your slumber, another factor that's important for heart health. Train your dog to sleep in its own bed and have your cat sleep in a separate room, Dr. Frates advises.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/21-spices-for-healthy-holiday-foods-2020120421550,21 spices for healthy holiday foods,"The holiday season is one of the hardest times of the year to resist salty, fatty, sugary foods. Who doesn't want to enjoy the special dishes and treats that evoke memories and meaning — especially during the pandemic? Physical distancing and canceled gatherings may make you feel that indulging is a way to pull some joy out of the season.
        But stay strong. While it's okay to have an occasional bite or two of marbled roast beef, buttery mashed potatoes, or chocolate pie, gorging on them frequently can lead to weight gain, and increased blood pressure, blood sugar, and ""bad"" LDL cholesterol.
        Instead, skip the butter, cream, sugar, and salt, and flavor your foods with herbs and spices.
        The bounty of nature's flavor-makers go beyond enticing tastes, scents, and colors. Many herbs and spices contain antioxidants, flavonoids, and other beneficial compounds that may help control blood sugar, mood, and inflammation.
        Amp up holiday foods with herbs and spices
        Try flavoring your foods with some of the herbs and spices in the list below. Play food chemist and experiment with combinations you haven't tried before. The more herbs and spices you use, the greater the flavor and health rewards. And that's a gift you can enjoy all year through.
        Allspice: Use in breads, desserts, and cereals; pairs well with savory dishes, such as soups, sauces, grains, and vegetables.
        Basil: Slice into salads, appetizers, and side dishes; enjoy in pesto over pasta and in sandwiches.
        Cardamom: Good in breads and baked goods, and in Indian dishes, such as curry.
        Cilantro: Use to season Mexican, Southwestern, Thai, and Indian foods.
        Cinnamon: Stir into fruit compotes, baked desserts, and breads, as well as Middle Eastern savory dishes.
        Clove: Good in baked goods and breads, but also pairs with vegetable and bean dishes.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/when-replenishing-fluids-does-milk-beat-water-202211142849,"When replenishing fluids, does milk beat water?","Driving along the freeway recently, a billboard caught my eye. In bold letters it proclaimed:
        
          Milk hydrates better than water.
        
        Wait, could this be true? And if so, should I be rehydrating with milk after a workout? And should we all have milk, rather than water, in our water bottles?
        What's behind the claim?
        Unsurprisingly, the ad is sponsored by the milk industry. And while I'd never heard this claim before, the studies behind the idea aren't particularly new or compelling. The website supporting this ad cites three small studies dating back more than a decade:
        
          A 2007 study enrolled 11 volunteers (five men, six women) who exercised until they were markedly dehydrated on several occasions. Each time they rehydrated with a different drink, and their urine output was measured over the following five hours. After drinking milk, the study volunteers produced less urine (and therefore retained more fluid) than with water or a sports drink (Powerade). Therefore, milk was considered to provide better hydration.
          A study published in 2016 described seven men with marked dehydration following exercise who drank fat-free milk, water, or Powerade. The results were similar.
          A 2016 study enrolled 72 healthy, well-hydrated men who drank various fluids and then had their urine production measured over the next four hours. The drinks used in this study were water, whole milk, skim milk, beer, Dioralyte (an oral rehydration solution used after fluid loss from diarrhea), tea, coffee, diet cola, regular cola, orange juice, and Powerade. The researchers found that fluid retention was best after drinking either type of milk or the oral rehydration solution; results for the other drinks were similar to water.
        
        Sounds like milk is a winner, right? Maybe. But there are other things to consider.
        The study details matter
        The findings of these studies aren't definitive. As with all research, there are important limitations. For example:
        
          The small number of participants in these studies means that just a few people could have an outsized impact on the results.
          Two of the three studies involved significant dehydration by intensely exercising in a warm environment, leading to several pounds of fluid loss. Therefore, the results may not apply to people engaged in more typical daily activities or workouts. In addition, the studies equated better hydration with less urine production in the hours after drinking various fluids. This is only one way to define hydration, and not clearly the best one.
          The advantage of milk reported in these studies may be too small or too temporary to matter much. For example, in the study of 72 people, milk drinkers produced about 37 ounces of urine over four hours while water drinkers produced 47 ounces. Does the 10-ounce difference have a meaningful health impact? If the study participants had been monitored for a longer period, would this difference disappear?
          The amount of milk consumed in the study of seven men would contain more than 1,000 calories. That may be acceptable for an elite athlete after hours of intensive exercise in the heat, but counterproductive and costly for someone working out for 30 minutes to help maintain or lose weight. Tap water is free and has no calories!
        
        Hyping hydration: Many claims, little evidence
        The billboard promoting milk reflects our relatively recent focus on hydration for health. This is promoted — or perhaps created — by advertisers selling sports drinks, energy drinks and, yes, water bottles. But does drinking ""plenty of water"" translate to weight loss, athletic performance, and glowing appearance? Does monitoring urine color (darker could indicate dehydration) and downing the oft-recommended eight glasses of water daily make a difference in our health? On the strength of evidence offered so far, I'm not convinced.
        But wait, there's more! Emotional support water bottles, a trend popularized recently in Australia, offer one part public expression of your commitment to health and one part security blanket. (Yes, it's a thing: #emotionalsupportwaterbottle has more than 80 million views on TikTok.) And then there's intravenous hydration on demand for healthy (and often wealthy) people convinced that intravenous fluids will improve their looks, relieve their hangovers, help with jet lag, or remedy and prevent an assortment of other ailments.
        Is this focus on hydration actually helpful?
        Before water bottles were everywhere and monitoring fluid intake became commonplace, medically important dehydration wasn't a problem for most healthy people who were not rapidly losing fluids due to heat, intense exercise, diarrhea, or the like.
        The fact is, drinking when thirsty is a sound strategy for most of us. And while there are important exceptions noted below, you probably don't need fluids at hand at all times or to closely monitor daily fluid intake to be healthy. There are far more important health concerns than whether you drink eight glasses of water each day.
        When is dehydration a serious problem?
        Weather, exercise, or illness can make dehydration a major problem. Particularly susceptible are people who work or exercise outside in hot and humid environments, those at the extremes of age, people experiencing significant fluid loss (as with a diarrheal illness), and those without reliable access to fluids. If significant dehydration occurs, replacing lost fluids is critically important, and may even require a medical setting where intravenous fluids can be provided quickly.
        The bottom line
        Despite the claims of milk ads and the iffy studies justifying them, the idea of replacing water with milk for rehydration may not convince everyone: the taste, consistency, and extra calories of milk may be hard to get past.
        As for me, until there's more convincing evidence of an actual health advantage of milk over water for routine hydration, I'll stick with water. But I'll forego the water bottle.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/rethinking-cardio-exercise,Rethinking cardio exercise,"Standard exercise guidelines call for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. But many people have trouble reaching this mark.
        ""They either don't enjoy aerobic workouts or have physical or medical issues that make traditional cardio exercise a challenge,"" says Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Then there is the additional barrier of thinking these requirements take too much time and effort. All this can intimidate people and keep them from getting their necessary exercise.""
        Breaking it down
        The first step to overcoming these obstacles is to break down the time commitment into manageable segments. For example, 150 minutes is 2.5 hours, which comes to 30 minutes five days a week, or about 20 minutes daily. ""And you don't have to do those 20 to 30 minutes all at once,"" says Dr. Apovian. ""You can further divide into two or three 10-minute daily segments. Everyone has 10 minutes to devote to exercise.""
        Next, change your perception of ""moderate intensity."" ""People automatically feel overwhelmed because it sounds difficult, but this level of exertion is not as physically demanding as people may think and is quite doable,"" says Dr. Apovian. (See ""How to measure moderate-intensity exercise."")
        
          
            
              
                How to measure moderate-intensity exercise
                A simple measure of moderate-intensity exercise is the ""talk test"": you're at the right level if you're exercising hard enough to break a sweat but can still comfortably hold a conversation. Another approach is to use the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale, which classifies exercise intensity by how you feel. Signs like higher heart rate, heavier and faster breathing, increased sweating, and tired muscles indicate higher levels of intensity. A modified Borg scale rates exertion from 1 to 10, with 1 being extremely easy and 10 being very vigorous (involving labored breathing or gasping for air). Moderately intense activities are 5 to 6 on this scale, meaning ""somewhat hard"" exertion with heavy breathing.
              
            
          
        
        Different kinds of aerobics
        Any kind of movement that gets the heart rate up, speeds up your breathing, and makes you sweat a little counts as aerobic exercise. The best exercise is the one you enjoy. But don't assume you are limited to traditional activities like running, cycling, swimming, or tennis. There are other options that may better fit your interests, comfort level, and ability. Here are some examples.
        Brisk walking. Walking at a brisk pace is a simple moderate-intensity workout. But what is ""brisk""? That pace is different for everyone, but here is advice from President Harry Truman, known for his quick-paced morning walks around Independence, Mo., after he left office. He followed a pace of 120 steps a minute for 1.5 miles, a routine he learned in the Army. ""You swing your arms and take deep breaths as you walk … your whole body gets a vigorous workout,"" he wrote.
        Stair climbing. Set a timer for five to 10 minutes and go up and down stairs at a casual pace.
        Treadmill. The trusty treadmill can be an excellent cardio tool, as you can adjust the incline and speed to reach the required intensity.
        Marching in place. You don't need a lot of space for cardio. For instance, try marching in place. Stand with your feet together and arms at your sides. Bend your elbows and swing your arms as you lift your knees, one at a time, bringing them as high as possible with each movement. March in place for 50 steps at a steady rhythm. Rest and repeat several times.
        Home work. Many household chores count as moderate-intensity exercises. Examples include mowing the lawn, raking leaves, digging and planting, washing the car, and vacuuming. ""Even though these are often stop-and-go activities and may feel light, the movements can add up,"" says Dr. Apovian.
        Weight training. Guidelines also recommend doing weight training on at least two days of the week to help build and maintain muscle mass. But this also can be a way to add in some moderate-intensity aerobics. ""Doing weight training exercises in a circuit fashion, where you move from one exercise to the next with little to no rest, can elevate the heart rate enough to provide cardio benefits,"" says Dr. Apovian.
        Different movements. ""Almost any kind of movement can qualify if done with enough effort,"" says Dr. Apovian. ""Take a dance class, go for a hike, play pickleball, or walk 18 holes of golf instead of riding a cart.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/can-taking-enzyme-supplements-help-soothe-my-bloating,Can taking enzyme supplements help soothe my bloating?,"Q. 
          I often feel uncomfortable and bloated after eating. I have not been able to identify any particular foods that cause it. Would digestive enzyme supplements be helpful?
        
        A. Digestive enzyme supplements purportedly fix all sorts of abdominal symptoms, including bloating, gas, and bowel irregularity, as well as overall gut health. However, for most people, there's little evidence that they do any good.
        Naturally occurring digestive enzymes help break down food so the body can soak up nutrients. Your mouth, stomach, and small intestine make some digestive enzymes. Still, most come from your pancreas, which floods the small intestine with enzymes when the food arrives there.
        The main pancreatic enzymes are lipase, which breaks down fats; amylase, which breaks down carbohydrates; and proteases and peptidases, which break down proteins.
        Once nutrients are broken into small molecules, they are absorbed through the wall of the small intestine into the blood and then delivered throughout the body. Sometimes the body doesn't make enough digestive enzymes, which can slow digestion and lead to uncomfortable symptoms.
        For example, if your small intestine doesn't make enough of the enzyme lactase, you can have difficulty digesting lactose, the sugar in milk and milk-based products. This can lead to bloating, flatulence, and loose stools.
        Doctors prescribe special enzyme pills to substitute for the lack of natural enzyme production for people who can't make enough digestive enzymes because of a health condition, like chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis. People with known deficiencies get benefit from these drugs.
        On the other hand, over-the-counter digestive enzyme supplements — available in health food stores and drugstores or through the Internet — are not medications. The FDA does not regulate them. Therefore, you can't be sure how the pills are made or the amount of enzymes they may contain.
        A lactase supplement (such as Lactaid or Lactrase) can help people manage lactose intolerance. An alpha-galactosidase supplement (like Beano or Bean Relief) may reduce gas and bloating if you have difficulty digesting the sugars in beans.
        Even though you have not identified specific foods as problematic, it's still likely that dietary changes will help reduce your discomfort. Consider a consultation with a registered dietitian.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-it-slow,Taking it slow,"An active life is a healthier one. But there are times when you should embrace a slower pace, an approach commonly known as ""slow living.""
        ""Slow living isn't about doing less, but doing more with greater focus and purpose and at the right speed,"" says Laura Malloy, director of the Successful Aging Program at Harvard-affiliated Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. ""It's about enjoying the moments and putting more energy and enjoyment into fewer things.""
        Quality over quantity
        Older adults could be putting the hectic years of work and family obligations behind them. Yet many seniors claim they are busier now, as they juggle new interests and commitments.
        ""It's hard to jump off the treadmill of busyness when you've been on it for so long,"" says Malloy. ""But one aspect of slow living is that it helps you evaluate what is important and what offers the greatest pleasure, and what you should consider giving up. It teaches you to value quality over quantity.""
        Practicing slow living may indirectly offer health benefits, such as lowering your stress level and blood pressure as you become more mindful during the day. It also can improve your social interactions by teaching you to be more engaged in conversations where you listen more and talk less. In addition, slow living encourages greater awareness of your surroundings and how your body moves, so you are less likely to make missteps that could cause injury. Being more attentive, in turn, helps improve concentration and short-term memory. ""It can help you become less forgetful about recent actions like whether you locked the front door, turned off the stove, or took your medicine,"" says Malloy.
        Slow and steady
        You don't need to make sweeping changes to embrace slow living. ""Try to incorporate slow living into your daily routines, or choose certain moments to practice it, so over time, it becomes a more natural part of your behavior,"" says Malloy. Here are five strategies you can try to make your life slower and even healthier.
        Engage in routines. We mindlessly do many daily tasks, like bathing, brushing our teeth, making coffee, and washing dishes. Instead of doing them on autopilot or rushing to get them completed, try to be fully present in the process. For instance, when showering, note the smell of the soap and how the hot water soothes your muscles. If you feel rushed or your mind wanders, bring your attention back to the various sensations. ""Paying attention to the smallest details like this can slow your entire rhythm,"" says Malloy.
        Take a mindful walk. Use a regular walking workout to practice mindfulness. ""Don't focus on rushing from point A to point B,"" says Malloy. ""Instead, pay attention to your surroundings and use all your senses. Notice the scenery, the sounds of birds, the smell of the air, how the sun feel against your skin.""
        Do a mini-unplug. Spend 15 to 20 minutes each day disconnected from the world. No computer, phone, TV, or interactions. Just be present and do nothing. ""This forces your body and mind to slow down, and you may notice how refreshed you feel after unplugging yourself for a while,"" says Malloy. Research also has shown that time spent letting your mind wander can enhance creativity and problem-solving skills.
        Take up a new hobby. ""We tend to be more attentive and savor the experience when doing something we enjoy,"" says Malloy. Consider a new activity or interest, or revisit one from your past.
        Do only one chore. When faced with multiple household chores, we tend to focus on completing the list instead of individual tasks. Instead, only complete one chore and leave the rest for later. ""This helps you stay engaged until the task is finished and offers a wonderful sense of satisfaction and appreciation, which further reinforces the benefits of slowing down,"" says Malloy.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/can-these-approaches-really-improve-memory,Can these approaches really improve memory?,"Q.
          I'm 70, and my memory isn't what it used to be. I've been seeing news about procedures to improve memory, like injecting young blood or stimulating the brain with electrical currents. Is any of this true?
        
        A. Believe it or not, it could be. But don't hold your breath waiting for this research to produce a treatment that helps you and me. What you see in the news is part of a growing body of research on slowing aging. We've talked about this before (see ""Can we slow the aging process?"" in the May 2021 Health Letter). We used to assume that aging, like death, was inevitable. But increasing evidence indicates that it may become possible someday to slow, if not eliminate, the aging process.
        That's even true of the aging brain. Between the ages of 50 and 60, various aspects of thinking (including memory) begin to wane. A little less than 10 years ago, experiments showed that when blood of young mice was introduced into old mice, memory improved in the old mice. And a study published online May 11, 2022, by the prestigious scientific journal Nature showed that when spinal fluid (the liquid that bathes the brain) from young mice was infused into the brains of old mice, this also improved memory. More important, these studies have identified specific molecules in the blood and spinal fluid that appear responsible for the improved memory, knowledge that might someday lead to medicines that can prevent or even reverse memory loss.
        For several decades, scientists also have been trying to improve memory by exposing the brain to electrical currents, with very mixed results. The studies have focused on both working memory and long-term memory. Working memories are temporarily stored in one part of our brain when we experience an event, and then transferred to another part of the brain for long-term storage.
        In contrast to past mixed results, a study in humans (not mice) published online Aug. 22, 2022, by the journal Nature Neuroscience reported on specific types of electrical stimulation directed at specific areas of the brain. The stimulation lasted for 20 minutes each day for four days, and it improved both working memory and long-term memory for at least a month. The electrical stimulation involved no surgery and no pain. These encouraging results need to be reproduced by other scientists, studying other people, before they can be considered true. If they are confirmed, it will remain to be determined how long the benefits last and whether there are any adverse effects.
        So, like I said, don't hold your breath. But I think that science is finally beginning to understand the aging process well enough to offer the hope that we will someday be able to slow it — even the effects of aging on the brain.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/winterize-your-heart-health,Winterize your heart health,"Are you preparing for winter? Perhaps you're retrieving heavy coats from their summer slumber, getting a check-up for your home's furnace, and stocking up on road salt for snowy days. You might also add your health to the list of items to be ""winterized,"" especially your heart, which faces increased risks during the winter. In addition to the basics — eating a healthy diet, doing moderate-intensity exercise (such as brisk walking) for at least 150 minutes per week, and getting enough sleep (seven to nine hours per night) — take the following steps to protect your heart.
        Stay up-to-date on vaccinations
        Make sure you get this year's influenza (flu) shot and any recommended COVID-19 vaccinations or boosters. Flu and COVID surge in the winter, and both can harm your heart. ""You can develop cardiovascular problems after COVID, even if you don't have any heart disease risk factors,"" says Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a cardiologist and editor in chief of the Harvard Heart Letter. ""And while the flu increases your risk for a heart attack, our research has shown that getting a flu shot is associated with significantly reduced heart attack risks — as much as 45%.""
        Check your medicine cabinet
        Lots of people have cold and flu remedies on hand for the winter, but these often contain ingredients that pose heart risks. Common culprits include decongestants (such as phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine) and cough suppressants (such as dextromethorphan), which can raise your heart rate and blood pressure. ""Stay away from cold remedies containing decongestants if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, or a history of stroke,"" Dr. Bhatt advises.
        Cold remedies may also contain ibuprofen (the ingredient in the pain relievers Advil and Motrin) to reduce fever or relieve aches and pains. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which may increase the risk for a heart attack or stroke.
        Make an exercise plan
        Aerobic exercise — the kind that works your heart and lungs — is crucial for heart health, a healthy immune system, and much more. But it's easy to stop exercising when the weather turns cold.
        Figure out now where you'll exercise indoors this winter and which types of exercise you'll do. Perhaps you'd like to work out at home, following an online exercise video. YouTube is a rich source of free exercise videos. Look for one geared toward people in your age group. Other options for exercising indoors include working out at a gym, walking indoors at a local mall, or taking classes at a YMCA.
        Prepare for snow removal
        Shoveling snow or pushing a heavy snow blower makes your heart work overtime, especially in cold weather (which narrows blood vessels). It also increases risk of a heart attack, particularly if you are deconditioned from infrequent physical activity.
        Avoid the risk by asking friends, family, or neighbors if they might be available to help you shovel snow this winter, or by hiring a snow removal company if finances allow (call now, since they book up quickly).
        If you want to shovel snow on your own, remember that the activity requires the same precautions as a strenuous workout, such as preparing the heart and muscles with a warm-up, staying hydrated, going slowly, and stopping if you feel dizzy or you're out of breath.
        Start managing stress
        Get into a regular practice of managing stress now, before the winter holidays arrive with their many pressures. Stress triggers the body's fight-or-flight response, which sends stress hormones throughout the body and makes the heart beat faster, breath quicken, and muscles tense. It's not harmful if it's temporary, but chronic stress contributes to clogged arteries and high blood pressure and can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Manage stress by practicing yoga, tai chi, meditation, or deep breathing exercises, and by getting enough sleep and exercising.
        Come up with winter eating and drinking strategies
        The winter brings many opportunities to go off a healthy diet or drink too much alcohol, and both affect the heart. Eating lots of food that's fatty, salty, sugary, or high-calorie may add pounds or increase your blood sugar or cholesterol levels, which can raise cardiovascular disease risk. Drinking too much alcohol can cause a temporary or even permanent irregular heartbeat condition called atrial fibrillation.
        Plan now to avoid overindulging. Enjoy holiday or comfort foods only occasionally, in small portions. Limit alcohol to no more than one drink per day, if your doctor says it's okay. Where can you find the resolve to stick to the rules? Think of the harms you risk if you don't. ""It often takes a heart attack before people get serious about heart health,"" Dr. Bhatt says. ""It's much better to be proactive than reactive.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/the-best-exercises-for-your-warm-up,The best exercises for your warm-up,"A warm-up is essential before a workout. Sometimes, just marching in place and moving your arms around for a few minutes is enough to prepare your body for what it's about to endure. At other times, it takes more work to get your body ready for activity. ""Many people think that a warm-up before playing golf, pickleball, or tennis means taking a couple of practice swings with the club or racquet. In reality, it should include five to 10 minutes of warm-up activities,"" says Christina Ruggeri, a physical therapist specializing in sports medicine at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
        What does the warm-up do?
        Warm-up activities accomplish several tasks:
        
          They get blood pumping, which sends oxygen and energy to your tissues and muscles, so they're ready for activity.
          They put muscles and joints through their range of motion, gently stretching them so they can accommodate broad movements.
          They prepare the joints for forward and backward movement, side-to-side movement, and rotation.
        
        For moderate-intensity activity
        The type of warm-up you need depends on your activity. For a strengthening routine or moderate-intensity activity (such as brisk walking or riding a bike on level ground), marching in place for a few minutes makes an effective warm-up. Swing your arms as you march.
        ""Alternating leg activity can quickly raise the heart rate, which is important in a warm-up,"" Ruggeri says. ""Marching also works your leg and buttock muscles. The leg you lift works the hip flexor. Your stationary leg works the gluteal muscles [in the buttocks] and the quadriceps [in the thighs].""
        
          
            
              
                Move of the month: Alternating hamstring curls
                Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Bend your left knee to bring your left heel toward your buttocks as you balance on your right leg. Immediately return to the starting position. Repeat with your right leg. Continue this left-right sequence for a total of 10 times on each leg. Let your arms swing forward and back as you move.

        For more intense activity
        For vigorous physical activity, such as swimming or playing tennis, or for activity involving strenuous physical movements, such as golf, you'll need a more extensive warm-up. For example: ""Golf requires that you swing your arms and turn your trunk. Tennis and pickleball require those movements, plus lateral shuffles. So you'll want to prepare the muscles for that,"" Ruggeri says.
        One way to warm up is by practicing moves you'll perform later. ""Do the movement repeatedly, in a slow and controlled manner, to allow the body to adjust to the activity,"" Ruggeri says. ""For example, for tennis, stand in place and slowly perform a backhand swing to warm up the shoulder and core muscles.""
        Other warm-up activities to perform before vigorous exercise include marching in place, arm sweeps (sweeping your arms overhead), torso rotations (turning your torso left and then right), and the following moves.
        Step-ups. Facing the lowest step in a staircase, take one full step up and then step back down. Repeat the exercise 10 times, take a break, then do another 10 step-ups. ""This targets your quadriceps muscles when you step up, and your gluteal muscles when you step down. When you step up with one leg at a time, you also activate your core and back muscles to help keep your body upright,"" says Ruggeri.
        Arm circles. Put your arms out to the sides and move them in circles of varying size (small, medium, and then large). Move them in forward circles for 30 seconds, then backward circles for 30 seconds. ""This helps the shoulder muscles and the rotator cuff, a group of muscles and tendons at the shoulder,"" Ruggeri says. ""The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body, and these circles allow for the full range of shoulder movement.""
        Air punches. Punch the air in front of you, alternating right and left arms, for 30 seconds. Then do 30 seconds of cross-body punches: punch your right hand to the left, and then your left hand to the right. Try some uppercuts, too (punching upward). ""Punches increase your heart rate and get more blood flowing through the arm,"" Ruggeri says.
        Stretching after activity
        After the warm-up, do your workout. Finish the activity with stretches — gently holding each stretch for about 30 to 60 seconds. Ruggeri recommends stretching the shoulders, buttocks and hip muscles, upper leg muscles (the hamstrings and quadriceps), and calves. This will keep muscles long and supple, and ready to respond the next time you call on them for a workout or everyday activity.",Heidi Godman,"November 1, 2022",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/steak-and-burger-substitutes-to-satisfy-a-carnivore,Steak and burger substitutes to satisfy a carnivore,"Diets high in red meat are associated with many health problems, such as chronic inflammation, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, dementia, and premature death. While those risks may be enough to keep you from digging into a juicy burger or steak, they may not stop your craving for meaty textures on the plate.
        Plant-based burgers or steaks (now being featured in grocery stores, vegan food shops and restaurants) might fill the bill, if you keep some caveats in mind.
        Traditional plant-based ""meat""
        Plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs) have been around for decades. They're made of flours, concentrates, or isolates (protein drawn from plants) that come from such foods as soybeans, black beans, mushrooms, or whole grains.
        PBMAs (such as black bean burgers or tofu steaks) don't always look or taste like red meat, but they may provide enough flavor and texture to satisfy the sensory experience you want in a meal.
        They may also have a few health perks: they typically contain less total and saturated fat and cholesterol than red meat, and they may be rich in protein and fiber.
        Plants that mimic meat
        The newest generation of PBMAs (such as those from Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods) is engineered to replicate the taste and texture of red meat.
        The products — made from purified soy or pea protein — are thick and savory. They smell, taste, and look like meat, with pink centers that ooze juice when cooked. But they're usually lower in total and saturated fat and cholesterol than the real thing.
        Also, they contain about the same amount of protein as red meat and are fortified with vitamins — including B12, which is often missing in plants.
        The caveats
        All PBMAs can help you reduce red meat in your diet. But note the following caveats.
        PBMAs are processed foods. They may be minimally processed, such as tofu steaks, or ultra-processed, such as newer PBMAs. Ultra-processed foods contain ingredients that were changed dramatically from their original plant forms. Also, they can include lots of salt, oil, sugar, flavoring, and preservatives, which (in high amounts) increase risks for chronic diseases (such as heart disease, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and cancer), chronic inflammation, and premature death.
        PBMA fat content varies. Some newer PBMAs are higher in saturated fat than traditional PBMAs, and not that different from red meat.
        Some PBMAs have extra iron. Some PBMAs from Impossible Foods contain heme iron. Heme is an iron-containing molecule found naturally in animal foods, especially red meat. The heme in Impossible Foods is genetically engineered from soy roots. ""Iron is important for body function. But our research has shown that too much heme iron in the diet is associated with increased risks for diabetes, especially in older adults,"" says Dr. Frank Hu, the Frederick J. Stare Professor and Chair of the Department of Nutrition and Epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

        PBMAs in your diet
        Despite the potential risks of PBMAs, they may have a place in your diet. ""I think it's okay to include PBMAs as a replacement for red meat. How often you eat them is still a question. A couple of times per week might be fine,"" Dr. Hu says.
        Why don't we have definitive answers as to whether diets emphasizing PBMAs are healthier than diets rich in red meat? ""While many studies that have shown that there are health benefits to replacing red meat with minimally processed plant foods, very few studies so far have compared eating red meat with eating PBMAs. Some recent evidence has been encouraging. But at this point, we don't know how PBMAs will influence health long-term,"" Dr. Hu explains.
        Until we have more answers about the long-term effects of PBMAs, eat them only in moderation, and go for the ones with the fewest ingredients and lowest levels of salt and saturated fat. Don't pair them with unhealthy foods, like French fries, soda, or refined grains (white bread or buns).
        And if PBMAs with heme are on the menu (look for an ingredient called soy leghemoglobin), reduce other sources of heme (especially meat) in your diet.
        Other substitutes
        As for other substitutes for red meat, actual plants — vegetables and legumes — are great options. Both are low in calories, they have little or no fat, and they're rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants that fight free radicals (molecules that damage cells). Legumes (beans, lentils) are also excellent sources of protein. These options cost a lot less than red meat or PBMAs, too.
        For example, for burger alternatives, try a large portabella mushroom cap; thick (three-inch) slices of eggplant, cut crosswise (from side to side); or homemade bean burgers (made of sturdy beans such as chickpeas or black beans).
        For steak alternatives, you can use thick slices of eggplant cut lengthwise (from root to stem) or slices of a large head of cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, or romanesco (an unusual-looking broccoli with a mild flavor).
        It's okay to roast or grill plant steaks and burgers, and even get grill marks on them. ""Just don't burn them. You want to maintain their nutrient content,"" Dr. Hu says.
        To flavor them, brush them with a marinade made of your favorite spices and a healthy oil (such as olive oil) before grilling or roasting them. Avoid topping them with salty, sugary, or creamy sauces, but do go for healthy versions of the toppings you like on burgers (such as tomato, onion, and mustard) or steaks (such as saut'ed mushrooms on a cauliflower steak).
        Is it ever okay to eat red meat?
        For generally healthy people, red meat doesn't have to be off the menu entirely, ""And it's especially important to minimize processed red meat like bacon, hot dogs, and sausages, particularly if you have or you're at high risk for diabetes, heart disease, cancer, or cognitive decline,"" Dr. Hu says. ""With the many steak and burger alternatives available, hopefully, you'll find other meals to enjoy.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/what-is-non-hdl-cholesterol,What is non-HDL cholesterol?,"Q.
          My recent cholesterol test results included a value I haven't seen before: non-HDL cholesterol. What's the relevance of that number, and what's a healthy value?
        
        A. A standard cholesterol test (also called a lipid profile) typically features four numbers: total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. Recently, non-HDL cholesterol (your total cholesterol minus your HDL cholesterol) has started appearing on some of these reports. In coming years, its relevance may rise for two reasons: (1) you don't need to fast to check your non-HDL cholesterol, and (2) for many people, it may be as good as (or even more reliable than) LDL for assessing heart disease risk.
        Traditionally, doctors have focused mainly on LDL cholesterol, mostly because large studies have revealed that statins and other drugs that lower LDL cholesterol levels also decrease the risk of heart attacks and related problems. Also, a number of guidelines have instituted target LDL levels for various levels of risk.
        However, most labs don't directly measure LDL in your blood sample. Instead they use a formula to calculate your LDL based on your triglycerides and other lipid values. When and what you eat affects your triglyceride levels, so you ideally should fast before the blood test, which helps standardize the results. But many doctors no longer tell patients to fast, as it may be difficult depending on when they get their blood drawn.
        Because the non-HDL cholesterol calculation is not based on a triglyceride value, you aren't required to fast before the test; the results are similar whether you fast or not. A non-HDL cholesterol value includes all the atherogenic (artery-clogging) lipoprotein particles — not just LDL, but also very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL). These particles, which transport triglycerides to tissues, are eventually transformed into LDL.
        Increasingly, lipid experts acknowledge that the non-HDL cholesterol value may be superior to the LDL cholesterol value for predicting heart disease. Most people eat every few hours during the day, which means we spend the better part of our waking hours in a ""fed"" rather than fasting state. So results from non-fasting blood tests better reflect our typical physiology. Also, the widely used online Heart Risk Calculator (www.cvriskcalculator.com) uses the non-HDL cholesterol number.
        The target for non-HDL cholesterol is no greater than 30 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) above your recommended LDL level. For example, if your LDL target is under 100 mg/dL, you should strive for a non-HDL cholesterol level of 130 mg/dL or less. If your non-HDL cholesterol is elevated, your doctor might further intensify your LDL-lowering therapy or focus on lowering elevated triglycerides.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-essential-8-enhanced-advice-for-a-healthy-heart,The Essential 8: Enhanced advice for a healthy heart,"An estimated 80% of all heart attacks and strokes are preventable. Are you doing everything you can to avoid these life-threatening events? An online tool from the American Heart Association (AHA), called My Life Check, can help you find out.
        The newly updated tool is based on Life's Essential 8 — the AHA's revamp of its Life's Simple 7 list of heart-healthy practices, created in 2010. The initial seven factors included maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, being physically active, eating a healthy diet, and keeping blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol at acceptable levels.
        ""Life's Simple 7 was an important pivot for the AHA because it moved the organization's focus beyond the treatment of cardiovascular disease to include ways to prevent it in the first place,"" says cardiologist Dr. Elliott Antman, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and past president of the AHA. Now, the association has added healthy sleep duration (seven to nine hours per night for adults) to the checklist, based on mounting evidence linking insufficient sleep to a range of cardiovascular-related risks (see ""Too little sleep may be hard on your heart"" in the August 2022 Heart Letter).
        New scores and assessments
        The domains of the Essential 8 are scored on a scale of 0 to 100, which are then used to generate a composite cardiovascular health score. To calculate your own score, go to My Life Check at the AHA website (www.mlc.heart.org). The 34-question survey takes just a few minutes to fill out, but you'll need to know your blood pressure, blood sugar, and total and HDL cholesterol values (also see ""Score more points for your heart"").
        You have the option of entering either your fasting blood sugar value or your hemoglobin A1c value. The latter (which doesn't require you to fast) is actually a better measure of blood sugar control because it reflects your average blood sugar over the past three months, Dr. Antman explains. But unless you have diabetes, some primary care physicians don't regularly order this test, so you may need to request it.
        Likewise, you may not need to fast before your cholesterol test. That's because the updated metric uses a non-HDL cholesterol measurement. And instead of simply asking if you smoke cigarettes, the new survey also asks about e-cigarettes or vaping devices and about exposure to secondhand smoke.
        Finally, the diet assessment was broadened. The questions help determine how close your diet comes to a healthy Mediterranean-style eating pattern, which emphasizes whole, mostly plant-based foods and has been shown to prevent heart attacks and related problems.
        
          
            
              
                Score more points for your heart
                If you got a perfect score (100 points) on My Life Check (see main story), you're in a very exclusive club. Only about 0.5% of people got scores that high in a study of 23,400 people published Sept. 13, 2022, in Circulation. In fact, just 20% had scores of 80 and higher, putting them in the ""high"" cardiovascular health category. (A score of 50 to 79 is considered ""moderate,"" while anything below 50 is ""low."")
                The data came from people who took part in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2013 to 2018. Their average score was just under 65, which suggests the heart health of the typical American is not great. If you need help nudging your score into the high category, the AHA provides fact sheets with targeted tips for addressing each of the eight metrics (see https://health.harvard.edu/le8).
              
            
          
        
        Psychological health underlies everything
        The details of Life's Essential 8 are described in an AHA Presidential Advisory published Aug. 2, 2022, in Circulation. The advisory also highlights the role of psychological health in cardiovascular disease. In line with this, the Life Check survey features a well-being assessment with questions about mental health, wellness, and social determinants of health.
        For example, one question asks how many days per month you feel stressed or depressed. Another delves into potential contributing factors, asking whether you've experienced discrimination or bullying based on your race or ethnicity. Still others focus on social factors, such as whether you have access to high-quality medical care and live in a neighborhood with spaces to exercise safely and buy fresh produce.
        As the authors explain, these traits are multidimensional and challenging to measure, which is why they're not included as a formal metric among the Essential 8. ""Instead, we can think of these psychological factors as the foundation that underlies all the others,"" says Dr. Antman.
        As an individual person, you can use My Life Check to help identify and improve your own heart health score. But to make real progress population-wide, we need policy changes at local, state, and national levels, Dr. Antman says. Examples include things such as increasing subsidies for healthier, less-processed food and creating accessible, safe places to exercise in parks and community centers.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/trying-to-lower-stubbornly-high-ldl-cholesterol-202211012842,Trying to lower stubbornly high LDL cholesterol?,"Recently I met with Nancy, a 72-year-old woman with coronary artery disease, to review her latest cholesterol results. Despite taking a statin, following a healthy diet, and exercising regularly, her low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remained above our target. ""What else can I do?"" she asked. ""When I increase my statin dose I get terrible leg pains. But I don't want to have another heart attack!""
        When elevated, LDL contributes to cardiovascular disease, which can cause a heart attack or stroke. Taking statin drugs can drop LDL levels in most people by about 30%, substantially lowering this risk. Usually, these commonly prescribed drugs work effectively with tolerable side effects. But what if a person's LDL level remains too high on their maximally tolerated dose? An expert consensus report issued by the American College of Cardiology lays out a clear path for next steps.
        What is a healthy target for LDL cholesterol?
        Target LDL depends on many factors, including your age, family history, and personal history of cardiovascular disease. For people at intermediate risk, LDL should be lowered by 30% to 50%. For those who have already had a heart attack, target LDL is no more than 70 mg/dl (note: automatic download).
        Which non-statin therapies are recommended first?
        Five non-statin therapies described in this post aim to help people achieve target LDL goals while minimizing side effects. They may be combined with a statin or given instead of statins.
        Each helps lower LDL cholesterol when diet and statins are not sufficient, such as when there is a family history of high cholesterol (familial hypercholesterolemia). But so far, only two options are proven to reduce cardiovascular risk — the risk for heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and other issues affecting the heart and blood vessels.
        
          Ezetimibe (Zetia)
        
        What it does: Lowers LDL and cardiovascular risk by reducing cholesterol absorption.
        How it's given: A daily pill
        Relatively inexpensive and often given with statins.
        
          PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha)
        
        What it does: A protein called PCSK9 controls the number of LDL receptors on cells. These medicines are monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 that increase LDL receptors on the liver, helping to clear circulating LDL from the bloodstream.
        How it's given: A shot every two to four weeks
        Highly effective for lowering LDL, but expensive and may not be covered by insurance.
        Three newer non-statin therapies
        Three newer, FDA-approved non-statin therapies are highly effective for lowering LDL cholesterol. Whether these lessen cardiovascular risk is not yet known.
        
          Bempedoic acid (Nexletol)
        
        What it does: Like statins, bempedoic acid tells the liver to make less cholesterol.
        How it's given: A daily pill
        Bempedoic acid is activated only in the liver, whereas statins are activated in liver and muscle tissue. Experts hope that this difference will translate to a similar LDL lowering effect, but without the muscle aches that some people who take statins report. Indeed, early trials show this medication lowers LDL cholesterol by about 20% to 25% compared to placebo.
        Potential downsides include high cost and a possible increase in the risk of tendon rupture, gout, and a heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. Results of larger trials are expected in late 2022.
        
          Evinacumab (Evkeeza)
        
        What it does: Rare individuals born without a cholesterol-processing protein called ANGPTL3 have extremely low LDL and triglyceride levels, which lowers their risk for coronary heart disease by about 40%. Taking a cue from nature, scientists developed evinacumab, a monoclonal antibody that turns off ANGPTL3, mimicking this rare condition and resulting in dramatic LDL lowering of almost 50% in one trial.
        How it's given: Monthly intravenous infusion
        Currently, the FDA has only approved evinacumab for people with familial hypercholesterolemia. Evinacumab appears safe in early trials, but is very expensive and can only be given in a doctor's office.
        
          Inclirisan (Leqvio)
        
        What it does: Inclirisan blocks PCSK9. However, unlike alirocumab and evolocumab, which inactivate PCSK9 after it is produced, inclirisan inhibits production of PCSK9 in the liver. Inhibition of PCSK9 leads to an increase in the number of LDL receptors on the surface of the liver, speeding clearance of LDL from the bloodstream and dropping LDL by about 50% (see here and here).
        How it's given: A shot every six months
        Potential downsides include increased rate of urinary tract infection, joint and muscle pain, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. This medicine is expensive and insurance may not cover it.
        What does the report recommend?
        It reinforces the importance of personalizing a plan to lower LDL by accounting for individual risk, cost of medication, and genetic factors. A combination of lifestyle changes and medicine can help people achieve better control of LDL. So, if you have elevated LDL cholesterol, try to follow healthy eating patterns, exercise regularly, avoid smoking and vaping, and maintain a healthy weight.
        
          Statin drugs are the first choice to treat anyone who has elevated cholesterol and cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.
          If statins aren't sufficient to help you reach your LDL target, or if side effects aren't tolerable, ezetimibe should be added next. PSCK9 inhibitors are then considered for those who remain at increased risk after adding ezetimibe.
          If LDL targets still cannot be achieved in people with cardiovascular disease, bempedoic acid and inclirisan are considered.
          For those with familial hypercholesterolemia, evinacumab may be appropriate.
        
        Cardiologists eagerly await the results of studies looking at whether the three new LDL-lowering medications also lower risk for heart attack, stroke, and other poor cardiovascular outcomes. Until then, their use is likely to be limited to people at high risk for whom proven, less costly drugs cannot achieve LDL goals.","Dara K. Lee Lewis, MD","November 1, 2022",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/weighing-the-new-approaches-to-treating-crohns-and-ulcerative-colitis-202210312841,Weighing the new approaches to treating Crohn's and ulcerative colitis,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a condition that involves inflammation of the digestive tract. In recent years, treatment options for IBD have rapidly expanded. The goal of these newer treatments is to improve control of inflammation in the gut, which can greatly improve patients' quality of life.
        Medication options for IBD
        5-aminosalicylates: This class of drugs contain 5-aminosalicylic acid, which works to reduce inflammation in the intestine. Sulfasalazine and mesalamine (available in oral and rectal forms) are often prescribed for patients with mild UC or CD of the colon, but are especially helpful in patients with inflammation limited to the rectum and sigmoid colon. Aminosalicylates are generally well tolerated, but it is important for blood tests (including those for kidney function) to be monitored closely every few months while taking the medication.
        Biologics: These medications target specific proteins and pathways to reduce inflammation in IBD. Biologics, which historically were reserved for severe cases, are now often a first-line approach for patients with CD and UC. This class of medications is a rapidly developing area of research, with several ongoing clinical trials and newly-approved agents.
        
          Anti-TNF alpha therapies: These medications block a protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to reduce inflammation, and are used in both CD and UC patients. Infliximab and adalimumab are some examples of anti-TNF drugs. With anti-TNF alpha therapies, you will require frequent blood tests to follow your response to treatment. Additionally, an approach called therapeutic drug monitoring, where drug concentrations in the blood are measured, can be used to tailor the dosage of medication to an individual patient's needs.
          Anti-IL-12/23: These therapies reduce intestinal inflammation by inhibiting specific pro-inflammatory proteins called interleukin-12 and interleukin-23. Ustekinumab is FDA-approved to treat both UC and CD. Risankizumab was FDA-approved in June 2022 to treat moderate to severe CD; clinical trials to assess its utility in UC are ongoing.
          Anti-Integrin: These medications block white blood cells that cause inflammation from entering the GI tract. Vedolizumab has been shown to be an effective treatment that is tolerated well in IBD patients. Natalizumab has been approved to treat moderate to severe CD, but is less commonly used due to its side effect profile.
        
        Small molecules: This newer class of medications uses molecules that are small enough to easily enter cells in order to modify different inflammatory pathways in the body. One advantage to these treatments is that they are orally administered, and therefore may be more convenient for patients.
        
          JAK inhibitors: These therapies interfere with the activity of Janus kinases (JAK), which normally work to stimulate the body's inflammatory response. Tofacitinib has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe UC, and is being investigated in CD. Upadacitinib was shown to have high clinical remission rate in UC, and was FDA-approved in March of 2022.
          S1P receptor modulators: This class of medication blocks the receptor of a signaling fat molecule called S1P, in order to reduce inflammation and the immune response. Ozanimod was approved in May of 2021 for the treatment of moderate to severe UC.
        
        Corticosteroids: The use of oral corticosteroids such as prednisone was once a mainstay of IBD treatment, but now is typically reserved for short-term usage for patients with active flare symptoms. These medications are associated with increased risk of infection, blood clots, bone thinning, and hyperglycemia, among other unfavorable side effects. One specific type of oral corticosteroid called budesonide is primarily released in the gastrointestinal tract, and is associated with fewer adverse effects.
        Immunomodulators: These medications reduce inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract by suppressing the immune system, and can be effective in treating both CD and UC. Azathioprine, methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, tacrolimus, and cyclosporin are some examples. However, their usage as a primary treatment is declining due to adverse side effects such as bone marrow suppression, increased risk for certain blood cancers, liver injury, and gastrointestinal intolerance.
        Sometimes, these medications are used in lower doses in combination with biologic medications in order to optimize the effectiveness of treatment and prevent the development of antidrug antibodies to biologics. Patients on these medications require regular blood tests for monitoring.
        Which treatment is right for me?
        IBD treatment plans are complex, and are personalized for each patient. Your past medical history, disease severity and location, type of IBD, and response to past treatments are some of the many factors in deciding which medication is right for you.
        To assess your treatment, your doctor will continue to use a combination of your symptoms, blood work, stool tests, imaging, and endoscopy (upper endoscopy and/or colonoscopy) to determine if your treatment is working or needs adjustments. Sometimes this means changing the dosage or frequency of your current medication, adding a second medication, or starting you on a different type of treatment. The goal is to find the right medications for you for the long term, and to achieve clinical remission.
        What happens if I cannot afford my recommended treatment?
        There are several options to reduce the cost of IBD treatments. Your doctor can work with you to see if the drug manufacturer offers patient financial assistance programs that provide medication at a discounted cost. Additionally, your doctor may work with your insurance company to prescribe more affordable biosimilars (medicines with similar structure, function, and clinical efficacy as standard biologic drugs).
        In some cases, missing doses of medication may lead to the development of antidrug antibodies, which can make a patient vulnerable to serious allergic reactions when the medication is restarted. Additionally, medication gaps can make patients with IBD more susceptible to flares and complications, including surgery and hospitalization. For these reasons, it is important to work with your doctor, insurance company, and the manufacturer of any medication you are on to minimize gaps in medication dosing.
        Crohn's and ulcerative colitis are lifelong, chronic conditions. However, when remission is achieved, most people have an excellent quality of life. Additionally, every patient's symptom course is unique. If you are concerned about medication costs or safety, or are considering stopping your medications, reach out to your doctor to discuss a personalized solution for you.","Nisa Desai, MD","October 31, 2022",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/inflammatory-bowel-disease-issues-outside-the-gut-202210112831,Inflammatory bowel disease: Issues outside the gut,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a type of chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Ulcerative colitis, marked by continuous inflammation of the large intestine, and Crohn's disease, which causes patches of inflammation and can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, are both types of IBD. Patients with IBD can experience a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in their stool, bloating, and weight loss.
        What conditions can occur outside the GI tract in people with IBD?
        IBD symptoms can occur both inside and outside the gastrointestinal tract. The latter are known as extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) of IBD. These conditions occur in nearly half of all people with IBD, and can be present before and/or after someone's IBD is diagnosed. EIMs are more frequent in people who receive their diagnosis at an earlier age, and generally also occur earlier in the course of IBD. In fact, approximately 24% of EIM symptoms are present prior to receiving a diagnosis of IBD. The causes of EIMs are poorly understood but, similar to IBD, may be due to a combination of genetic risk factors, immune reactions, and lifestyle factors such as cigarette smoking.
        What are some examples of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD?
        Patients may have multiple EIMs at the same time, with varying severity. EIMs may not be easy to detect, and almost any organ system can be affected. Sometimes the severity of EIM symptoms mirrors that of the gut symptoms, but in certain conditions the EIMs behave independently. Below are some common examples of extraintestinal manifestations.
        Musculoskeletal: Musculoskeletal manifestations of IBD are the most common, occurring in up to 46% of IBD patients. They may present as inflammatory back pain (ankylosing spondylitis), inflammation of tendons or ligaments, arthritis, joint pain without arthritis, or swelling of fingers or toes (dactylitis). Arthritis can occur both within the axial skeleton (hips, lower back, spine) or peripherally (fingers, wrists, elbows, knees, ankles).
        Mucocutaneous: IBD can cause changes in the skin and mucosa (the moist lining covering certain organs and cavities in the body). Oral aphthous ulcers (seen with Crohn's disease), erythema nodosum (raised purple nodules typically on the front of the legs, which can occur in 10% to 15% of patients), and pyoderma gangrenosum (painful skin ulcers) are some examples of how IBD can impact the skin. Sweet syndrome, which involves tender lumps under the skin and is also associated with increased white blood cell count, fevers, arthritis, and eye symptoms, is a rare EIM.
        Ocular: Inflammation in parts of the eye (episcleritis, scleritis, or anterior uveitis) affects 2% to 7% of IBD patients. If patients experience eye pain, redness, sensitivity, or visual changes, urgent evaluation by an ophthalmologist may be necessary, due to the risk of blindness from uncontrolled inflammation.
        Vascular: Patients with IBD are at up to three times greater risk of developing blood clots compared to patients without IBD. Sometimes these clots can travel to the lungs and are called pulmonary embolisms. Symptoms of blood clots may be leg swelling or shortness of breath. Poorly controlled inflammation in the GI tract is thought to be the cause of increased clotting risk.
        Gastrointestinal: While not common, patients can develop liver diseases related to IBD, including primary sclerosis cholangitis (inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts) and autoimmune hepatitis (when the immune system attacks the liver cells, causing liver inflammation). Autoimmune pancreatitis has also been reported. These conditions can be diagnosed by symptoms, blood tests, or imaging findings (sometimes using MRI).
        How are EIMs treated?
        It is important to effectively treat bowel inflammation, as this may reduce activity of extraintestinal manifestations. Sometimes, EIMs may require additional specific treatments. For example, corticosteroids, sulfasalazine (anti-inflammatory medication), or specific biologic therapies may be considered for arthritis treatment. Skin and eye manifestations of IBD may be treated with topical or systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or specific biologic therapies. Vascular manifestations such as blood clots may be treated with anticoagulation medications. Treatment of EIMs is complex, and frequently requires a collaborative approach to care with several healthcare providers.
        What should I do if I am experiencing symptoms?
        EIMs are important to recognize, as they can significantly affect your quality of life and may also impact your doctors' approach to IBD treatment and monitoring over time.
        Whether or not you have been diagnosed with IBD, it is important to see your primary care doctor or gastroenterologist (if you have one) to discuss any symptoms you may be experiencing. Your doctor(s) will discuss your medical and family history to determine your risk for IBD or other medical conditions.
        For patients with a diagnosis of IBD or at risk for IBD, EIMs may be the first clue toward diagnosis or the need for treatment review and adjustment. It is important to communicate both your gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms with your gastroenterologist in order to promptly be started on the appropriate treatment and connected to specialists for the affected organ system. Lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation may also reduce the risk of EIMs.
        With targeted treatment and the appropriate health care team in place, management of both IBD and EIMs can be achieved to improve patients' quality of life.","Nisa Desai, MD","October 11, 2022",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/new-advice-on-melatonin-use-in-children-202210062832,New advice on melatonin use in children,".
        
        When it's bedtime, what parents really, really want is for their kids to go to sleep. Not only do parents want their children to get the rest they need, but parents want to get some rest themselves! So it's understandable that when children have trouble falling asleep, many parents reach for melatonin. Recent warnings about melatonin call this into question.
        What is melatonin?
        Melatonin is a hormone that the body makes to regulate sleep. Commercially, it is sold without a prescription as a sleep aid. If you give your body more of a hormone that helps you sleep, you are more likely to fall asleep, right? This isn't always true, of course; for many people, taking extra melatonin does little or nothing. But for some people it does help — including some children.
        Over the past couple of decades, use of melatonin supplements has increased significantly. It's the second most popular ""natural"" product parents give to their children after multivitamins.
        A health advisory on melatonin supplements for children
        Whenever a lot of people do something, things can go wrong. And indeed, there have been many reports of melatonin overdoses in children. While overdoses can lead to excessive sleepiness, headaches, nausea, or agitation, luckily they aren't dangerous most of the time. That doesn't mean that over-the-counter melatonin is completely safe, however. In fact, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recently issued a health advisory with warnings about its use.
        Over-the-counter melatonin is classified as a dietary supplement. This means it's not regulated by the FDA the way over-the-counter medicines like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or diphenhydramine are regulated. There is no oversight on what companies put in the melatonin that parents buy.
        And what they put in it is exactly the issue. The AASM warns that the amount of actual melatonin in tablets or liquid can vary, from less than what the label says to much more. The greatest variation is found in the chewable tablets, which are unfortunately the ones children are most likely to take. It's also hard — impossible, even — to know what else might be in the supplement. The AASM reports that some melatonin products also contain serotonin, a hormone and neurotransmitter that requires a prescription.
        Helping children sleep well
        The thing is, while some children really do benefit from melatonin, such as children with neurologic or neurodevelopmental problems, most don't need it to get a good night's sleep. Before buying a sleep aid — especially one that may not contain what you think it does — there are some strategies parents should try first.
        
          Keep your child or teen on a regular sleep schedule. For teens, that sleep schedule should preferably include sleep at night, not during the day. It's okay if your child stays up a little later on a weekend or during vacation, but try not to vary too much. Our bodies are more likely to drift off to sleep when we're used to falling asleep at a particular time.
          Make sure your child gets exercise during the day; it helps them be more tired at bedtime.
          Once your child has given up naps, don't do naps. If they come home from school exhausted because they stayed up too late, don't let them nap — it will just make it harder to go to sleep that night.
          Have a calming bedtime routine. This can be hard for high school students who have sports practices and homework, but to the extent that you can limit the stimulating stuff right before bedtime, please do. Think bathing, reading, and generally being quieter as bedtime approaches.
          Shut off the screens. The blue light emitted by screens can wake up the brain, and it's easy to get sucked into whatever you are doing on that screen. Ideally, screens should be off two hours before bedtime. For teens, it's best to charge phones somewhere else besides the bedroom. If teens say they need the phone as their morning alarm, buy them an alarm clock.
          Create a sleep environment conducive to sleep. Not having a TV or other device helps. For some kids, room-darkening curtains are great; for others, a night light is important. A white noise machine can help if there is ambient noise. Make the space inviting and comfortable — for sleep. It's best if kids don't hang out in their bed during the day or do homework there; bed should be for sleep.
        
        If you have tried all this and your child is still having trouble falling asleep, talk to your doctor before giving them melatonin. There may be other issues at play. By brainstorming together you may come up with ideas.
        If you decide to use melatonin:
        
          Select a product with the USP Verified mark, as it's more likely to be of higher quality.
          Start at a low dose.
          Don't give it every night. If you do, your child's body gets used to it and you end up having to increase the dose.
        
        Bottom line: if your child is having trouble falling asleep, there's lots to try before trying melatonin. Talk to your doctor before you buy — or try — it.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/poor-sleep-heightens-risk-of-copd-flare-ups,Poor sleep heightens risk of COPD flare ups,"People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who sleep poorly are far likelier than those who sleep well to experience flare-ups of worsened breathing, a new study suggests. COPD, a progressive, incurable lung condition, affects more than 16 million adults in the United States. Many factors, ranging from air pollutants to viruses, can trigger flare-ups.
        The study, published online June 6, 2022, by the journal Sleep, tracked 1,647 current and former smokers over three years. (The vast majority of COPD patients have smoked.) Participants described their sleep using seven measures, including duration, timing, and frequency of disturbances. Researchers combined each person's responses into a score of sleep quality, which they compared to the person's recorded number of COPD flare-ups. Compared with participants who had the best possible sleep scores, those with generally poor sleep showed a 25% higher chance of experiencing a COPD flare-up within the following year. For participants with the worst sleep scores, odds of a flare-up over the next year nearly doubled.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/womens-heart-attacks-more-strongly-connected-to-different-risk-factors-than-mens,Women's heart attacks more strongly connected to different risk factors than men's,"Women 55 and younger have different chief risk factors for heart attack — including high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, and low household income — than men in the same age group, a new study suggests.
        The study, published online May 3, 2022, by JAMA Network Open, analyzed data on 2,264 heart attack patients 55 and younger, comparing them with an equal number of adults matched for age, sex, and race who hadn't experienced a heart attack.
        Researchers found that seven risk factors collectively accounted for most of the heart attack risk in both the women and men studied. These factors were diabetes, depression, high blood pressure, current smoking, family history of heart attack, low household income, and high cholesterol. But in men, the leading heart attack risk factors were current smoking and family history; for women, those two risk factors both ranked lower than diabetes. Depression, high blood pressure, and low household income also appeared more strongly associated with heart attacks in these women than family history of heart attack.
        The investigators said their findings suggest the need for sex-specific strategies to prevent heart attacks in younger women and men.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/could-i-have-lactose-intolerance,Could I have lactose intolerance?,"Q.
           I used to have an iron stomach, but lately I feel gassy and bloated after eating foods like yogurt, cheese, and ice cream. Is this lactose intolerance?
        
        A. It does sound like you're dealing with lactose intolerance, which can develop at any age — yes, even after a lifetime of happily eating and drinking dairy products. When it does crop up later in life, it could just be a natural consequence of aging.
        Normally, the small intestine produces an enzyme called lactase, which enables you to digest lactose, the sugar in milk. Lactase production declines over the years, so eventually there may not be enough to break down all the lactose you consume. When lactose passes intact into the large intestine, it ferments and prompts those notorious symptoms of gas and bloating, along with cramping, nausea, and diarrhea in some cases.
        In some people, lactase production drops suddenly after illness, injury, or surgery. This so-called secondary lactose intolerance is more common in people with digestive conditions such as celiac or Crohn's disease, among others.
        That's why you should mention your recent digestive symptoms to your doctor. She can perform tests to confirm lactose intolerance and also check if something else might be triggering it.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/more-fallout-from-covid-19,More fallout from COVID-19,"It's jolting to notice handfuls of hair clustered in the shower drain or matted on your hairbrush. But if you've had COVID-19 within the past several months, this distressing hair loss is probably not a coincidence.
        The phenomenon — additional fallout from the global pandemic — is still catching sufferers off-guard. But Harvard experts echo national statistics that report excessive strand-shedding among a significant proportion of people infected with the virus.
        Thinning tresses can be a remnant of a COVID bout or a lesser-known mark of long COVID, along with symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog, and shortness of breath. Even weathering the pandemic's lingering mental and emotional stress is prompting some people to conspicuously lose locks, says Dr. Deborah Scott, co-director of the Hair Loss Clinic at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        ""It's literally adding insult to injury. First you are sick because of COVID, then you lose your hair,"" Dr. Scott says. ""Several patients have come to me in tears after losing up to 30% of their hair. I think most of them were surprised to learn it was linked to COVID.""
        
          
            
              
                Scalp symptoms that deserve a doctor's look
                While it's normal for hair shedding to wax and wane, other scalp symptoms should prompt you to see a doctor. According to Harvard experts, these include
                
                  itching or burning, which can indicate an inflammatory scalp condition
                  continued hair loss, especially six or more months after COVID-19 infection or another physical or mental stressor
                  lackluster regrowth.
                
              
            
          
        
        More noticeable in women
        Research published in the past two years has increasingly spotlighted COVID-related hair loss. A 2021 study published in The Lancet indicated that about 22% of patients hospitalized with the virus dealt with excess hair loss within six months after discharge. Meanwhile, a 2020 survey of nearly 1,600 members of a COVID survivors' group showed more than one-quarter suffered unusual hair loss after recovering.
        Women likely notice it more than men, if only because our tresses tend to be longer and fuller. ""If you're losing a lot of long hair, it's more obvious than if you're losing lots of short hair,"" Dr. Scott says.
        But COVID-19 is not unique in causing thinning tresses. It's just the newest known trigger of a long-recognized medical phenomenon called telogen effluvium, or TE. This happens when our normal hair growth cycle is disrupted by intense physical or emotional strain.
        Typically emerging two to four months after a jolt to the system such as surgery, high fever, medication use, or illness, TE can undermine our manes for months longer.
        ""For reasons we cannot explain, the physiological or emotional stress on the body triggers this hair shedding process,"" says Dr. Rachel Reynolds, interim chair of the Department of Dermatology at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Normally, about 10% of hairs are in the shedding (telogen) phase at any given time, she says, but after one of these stressors, shedding can triple or quadruple.
        Prescription for patience
        Regrowth happens slowly, typically taking six to 12 months for your locks to look more normal again. ""Given time, your hair will grow back,"" Dr. Scott says. ""That's all that most people ultimately want to know.""
        In the meantime, Harvard experts offer these tactics to speed and support regrowth:
        Try over-the-counter products. Topical minoxidil (Rogaine) can boost blood flow to hair follicles.
        Avoid harsh hair habits. Don't pull your hair into a tight ponytail or brush it strenuously. Similarly, skip using hair dye, peroxide, and chemical straighteners. ""New strands are fragile,"" says Dr. Scott. ""You really want to treat them gently.""
        Get a haircut. It may seem counterintuitive, but trimming hair into layers that blend lush and patchy areas can enhance your satisfaction as your strands fill in.
        Check nutrient levels. Ask your doctor to measure your thyroid, vitamin D, and iron levels, since any deficiencies can worsen hair shedding. Unless you're found to have a deficiency, though, taking supplements probably won't stem hair loss.
        Pump up protein intake. A balanced diet incorporating several servings of protein-rich foods each day can boost hair health.
        Stay away from ""hair growth"" supplements. Collagen and biotin supplement labels often claim these products can reduce hair loss or support new growth. But research doesn't support those claims, Dr. Scott says. Too-high biotin levels can also interfere with certain lab test readings.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/when-is-the-right-time-for-weight-loss-surgery,"When is the ""right"" time for weight loss surgery?","Dr. Thomas Tsai had performed weight-loss surgery on the beaming woman in front of him only six months before, but she was already a changed person. Dozens of pounds had melted from her physique, lowering not just the number on the scale but her odds of developing potentially life-threatening health problems. A coveted career promotion capped off her fresh sense of confidence.
        ""She was the same hardworking person she'd been before surgery, but she didn't face the stigma associated with her weight anymore,"" says Dr. Tsai, a bariatric surgeon at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""Not only did her health improve, but the surgery may have contributed to social and professional benefits.""
        Also known as bariatric or metabolic surgery — in reference to its effects on both weight and the body's break-down of food into energy — such procedures were once considered a last resort for people carrying 100 or more extra pounds. But clinicians and patients now view weight-loss surgery as a proactive tool to prevent health dangers linked with extreme obesity — including diabetes, heart disease, and sleep apnea — from developing in the first place.
        ""I see a range of people who are obese but otherwise healthy, and they want to regain control of their health and life. Others are trying to manage the consequences of obesity on their health,"" Dr. Tsai says. ""A paradigm shift has led us to realize that obesity is a medical disease that should be treated effectively with a range of options.""
        One tool among many
        While more than 70% of Americans struggle with overweight or obesity, according to the National Institutes of Health, bariatric surgery is an option for those who are considered morbidly (or severely) obese. This generally translates to a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or greater, or a BMI of 35 or higher in people who also have weight-related health problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or sleep apnea.
        For these people, bariatric surgery can serve as a tool to take off significant weight when diets, exercise, medications, or other treatments haven't worked. Still, it's not an easy way out—only a leg up, Dr. Tsai says. Surgery won't work if patients don't also change their overall approach to food and fitness.
        ""Weight-loss surgery doesn't turn a marathon into a 100-meter dash, but it takes an uphill road and makes it downhill, and then flat, by changing the body's metabolism,"" he says. ""It doesn't run the race for you.""
        Most weight-loss surgeries are performed using minimally invasive techniques, meaning surgeons insert small tools through a few dime-sized cuts in the belly. To varying degrees, the procedures reduce the size of the stomach and alter how nutrients are absorbed. Among the most popular versions are sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass, with the latter more extensively modifying internal organs to alter digestion and ""hunger hormone"" levels, Dr. Tsai says. Some people may be candidates for gastric banding, a procedure to place an inflatable tube around the stomach to limit its capacity.
        Heap of health benefits
        More than 250,000 Americans — mostly women — undergo weight-loss surgery each year, a number Dr. Tsai notes is steadily increasing. The procedures can lower an obese person's risk of premature death by up to 50%, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. ""Very few medications or lifestyle changes have such a durable effect on health,"" he says.
        Myriad recent studies have teased out specific health risks that the surgery can improve. A study published online June 3, 2022, by JAMA suggests that adults with obesity who undergo weight-loss procedures have a 32% lower risk of developing cancer and a 48% lower risk of dying from it compared with similar adults who don't have surgery. Obesity raises the risks of developing 13 different types of cancer that together account for 40% of all cancers diagnosed each year, Dr. Tsai says. Notable among them is endometrial cancer.
        ""There are very powerful reasons for women, especially, to explore whether metabolic surgery is the right option for them,"" Dr. Tsai says.
        Multiple studies have shown that bariatric surgery also reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart attack, and complications from them, Dr. Tsai adds. ""Some patients can stop taking many or all of their medications, and sleep apnea and blood sugar levels are shown to improve as well. And for patients who had back or joint pain, their mobility clearly improves.""
        What results might you expect? Perhaps a loss of 20% to 30% of your body weight, Dr. Tsai says — most of which occurs in the first year after surgery. ""It's not a silver bullet, but it can really magnify a healthy lifestyle,"" he says.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/heart-health-guidelines-get-updated,Heart health guidelines get updated,"The American Heart Association (AHA) recently revised its checklist for achieving optimal heart health, introducing its new Life's Essential 8. The list replaces the AHA's decade-old Life's Simple 7.
        Sleep health is the new addition to the cardiovascular health scoring tool, which now advises that adults get seven to nine hours per night. The organization updated four of the categories:
        Diet: More emphasis was given to following heart-healthy diets like the DASH and Mediterranean.
        Nicotine exposure: Secondhand smoke and vaping were added as risk factors.
        Blood lipids: People now can get a non-fasting blood sample that measures total, HDL, and non-HDL cholesterol. Non-HDL cholesterol can provide similar risk information as LDL cholesterol.
        Blood sugar: Measurements now include hemoglobin A1c, a key component to assessing type 2 diabetes risk.
        Three categories were unchanged:
        Physical activity: The optimal weekly level is at least 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity.
        Body mass index (BMI): A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is ideal for heart health.
        Blood pressure: Levels less than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) remain optimal. Stage 1 hypertension is 130 to 139 mm Hg for systolic pressure (the first number) or 80 to 89 mm Hg for diastolic pressure (the second number).
        You can calculate your heart health score at mlc.heart.org. The guidelines were published online June 29, 2022, by Circulation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/meeting-your-exercise-goals-online,Meeting your exercise goals online,"If there's one thing the COVID-19 pandemic shut down, it's movement — both within our communities and around the world. But that impact swiftly extended to how we move our bodies, too, generating aftershocks that may forever change our relationship with exercise.
        Most gyms and fitness studios shuttered their physical doors, at least temporarily, in response to the new global reality. But many rapidly launched or expanded virtual portals to exercise, ranging from Spin and Pilates to yoga, dance, and martial arts classes. A report by fitness research firm ClubIntel showed that three-quarters of newly closed brick-and-mortar gyms offered on-demand and livestream group workouts by early April 2020 — a number tripling since just two years earlier.
        Meanwhile, vast numbers of people pivoted by tuning in to on-screen workouts, which spared them from COVID infection risks and offered a welcome dose of flexibility. A May 2020 survey of 700 people who used the MindBody health and wellness app showed that 80% had livestreamed workouts since the pandemic's start, compared with only 7% in 2019.
        Now that lockdowns are (hopefully) in the rearview mirror, Harvard experts say the pandemic has transformed the ways we approach exercise — mostly for the better. And we can apply these hard-earned lessons going forward, regardless of how the pandemic continues to evolve.
        ""It emboldened us to try new forms of movement,"" says Dr. Lauren Elson, a physiatrist (a doctor who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation) at Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Network. ""I myself had never gone the extra mile to try other types because I already had a set routine. I think a lot of people had to become more flexible, because normal options were not there.""
        Physical and mental effects
        It didn't take long after the advent of the global health crisis for public health organizations to recommend online exercise classes as a way to make up for lost activity. But it was vital to reinforce how strongly physical activity factored in to staying both physically and mentally healthy as the pandemic bore down. ""It would have been really easy to completely turn off exercise, so finding resources and shifting gears really helped people weather the storm,"" Dr. Elson says.
        Exercise-induced bursts of endorphins and other natural brain chemicals that boost mood were especially helpful during the fraught first months of the pandemic, says Dr. Beth Frates, director of lifestyle medicine and wellness in the Department of Surgery at Harvard's Massachusetts General Hospital.
        ""People could better manage the anxiety and stress of the daily news if they were exercising,"" Dr. Frates says. ""Exercise was a great way to get away from the drama of the moment, and it still is."" She notes that vigorous movement also beats back food cravings and promotes sleep.
        Moreover, newfound forms of connected exercise — which included no-cost, socially distanced walks around the neighborhood — yielded untold mental health benefits.
        ""We crave human contact,"" Dr. Frates says. ""Even if we didn't talk to people in our virtual classes, just seeing them doing the same moves helped us feel connected. We were joined in the journey of the class and meeting the challenges of the moment, whether they were planks or Warrior poses.""
        Our ability to exercise in fundamentally fulfilling ways also heightened our sense of control during an otherwise out-of-control era, says Dr. Pamela Peck, clinical director of psychiatry at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        ""It's been a little bit of making lemonade out of lemons. You could show up for your 6 a.m. class, even when you didn't have control over the numbers of COVID cases or how long this was all going to last,"" Dr. Peck says.
        Wide-ranging benefits
        Online workouts do present a few disadvantages, notably a lack of personalized attention from instructors who can wave to the masses but not much else. ""Actions that encourage us, like pats on the back and high-fives, are all bigger and stronger in person than on-screen,"" Dr. Frates says.
        Still, virtual sessions — which are certain to blend with in-person options beyond the pandemic — have much to offer. Harvard experts point to these additional benefits:
        Variety. It's tough to claim boredom with your exercise routine when so many workout choices are available at the touch of a button. Customized ""playlists"" of classes allow you to toggle between, say, high-energy aerobics and core-strengthening Pilates, accomplishing specific fitness goals.
        Collective competition. Some of us have banded together with friends to join the same online workout classes. ""A lot of people benefit from the competitiveness that results,"" Dr. Elson says.
        Privacy. Some people don't like exercising around others in person or feel vulnerable in that setting. ""For them, virtual classes afford connection at a distance,"" Dr. Peck says.
        Shared experience. Personal crises — death, divorce, unemployment — can make us feel alone, but the pandemic is something we've endured together, facing the same challenges and hurdles. ""Being part of something larger than yourself can help you feel grounded and less alone,"" Dr. Peck says.
        Perhaps the biggest upside to our new, hybrid approach to exercise: many of us are now doing more of it. ""Some have slipped back into their old habits, but a lot of us have developed healthy new patterns with a new mix of options,"" Dr. Elson says.
        ""There's no commute time, no paying for parking, and no traffic"" with virtual sessions, Dr. Frates says. ""Some people have likely grown accustomed to their 7 a.m. online Zumba class and don't want to stop — and there's no reason to. If the ease of the class helps people stay on track, then it's worth continuing.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/the-rundown-on-diarrhea,The rundown on diarrhea,"Everyone deals with diarrhea at some time. Episodes are often minor, albeit unpleasant, experiences. Other times, they turn into recurring mad dashes to the bathroom with no relief in sight.
        So, when is diarrhea ""normal,"" and when should you get checked out?
        ""Diarrhea is your body saying something is wrong, and while it usually is not a cause for concern, you should still monitor when it occurs, how often, and its severity, as it could be a sign of a more serious digestive issue,"" says Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Acute problems
        Most episodes of typical diarrhea are acute — that is, short-term — and they resolve on their own. People usually have loose, watery stools with cramping and urgency. They also may have a temporary low-grade fever and fatigue.
        One common cause is a group of viruses known as noroviruses. Another is exposure to toxins produced by bacteria like Escherichia coli (E. coli) through contaminated food or water. (Although people often refer to acute diarrhea as stomach flu, these viruses and toxins are not related to the influenza virus.)
        According to Dr. Staller, most people with acute diarrhea recover by allowing the illness to run its course. ""Let your system do its work and naturally eliminate the invaders,"" he says.
        The frequency of bathroom trips should begin to decrease after a few days, and the diarrhea should be gone within five days. Be sure to drink a lot of fluids — water and low-sugar sports drinks are ideal — to replace the liquid you are losing and avoid dehydration.
        Over-the-counter products that contain the active ingredients loperamide (Imodium) or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate) can help reduce the frequency of loose, watery stools and ease cramping. ""Take them as directed, but avoid them if you have a fever or bloody diarrhea,"" says Dr. Staller.
        Once the diarrhea has receded, ease back into regular eating. For the first few days, Dr. Staller recommends following a BRAT diet — Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast. The bananas bind the stool, slowing the movement, while white rice, applesauce, and dry, white toast are low in fiber and easily digested.
        When to seek help
        In some situations, you should seek immediate medical care for your diarrhea. For instance, even if your symptoms just started, call your doctor if you experience bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, or a high fever. These symptoms are uncommon with a viral infection.
        Another such circumstance is when diarrhea persists for longer than a week or two. ""Persistent diarrhea always should be examined to see if there's an obvious trigger or underlying problem,"" says Dr. Staller. Although persistent episodes often resolve without an answer, your doctor will begin considering causes different from the ones that trigger acute diarrhea.
        For example, your doctor will want to know if you have recently taken antibiotics or been hospitalized. If yes, he or she can order a stool test to check for infection with the bacterium Clostridioides difficile (C. diff), which can be contracted during hospital stays or emerge after a course of antibiotics.
        Your doctor also will ask about your recent travels to see if you might have picked up a bacterium or parasite from contaminated food or water.
        Diet and medication
        Your doctor will inquire about your dietary habits, as persistent diarrhea could be related to undiagnosed lactose intolerance (difficulty digesting milk sugar) or celiac disease (trouble digesting gluten in wheat products).
        If one of these is suspected, your doctor may recommend tests to confirm the diagnosis and help design an elimination diet that removes possible trigger foods to see if it resolves the issue.
        Also, make sure your doctor knows what medications you are taking. Diarrhea can be a side effect of several prescription drugs, including some used to treat blood pressure or heart problems, and certain over-the-counter remedies, like antacids containing magnesium.
        The characteristics of your stool could provide insight as well. Is it just watery, or is there blood and mucus? Blood and mucus usually indicate inflammation of the colon, which could be from a bacterial or parasitic infection or an inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease).
        Based on your answers, your doctor will decide on next steps, such as a blood test for anemia and inflammation markers, a stool culture, and an abdominal CT scan. Your doctor may also recommend a colonoscopy.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/natural-ways-to-boost-energy,Natural ways to boost energy,"As men age, many factors affect their energy levels. Muscle mass naturally declines, which makes it harder to stay active. Diet may become less healthy, and sleep more erratic.
        The body also becomes less efficient at producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy-carrying molecules found in all living cells. And don't forget the stress of enduring a two-plus-year pandemic.
        ""Add it all up, and it's no surprise that you may feel less energetic at times,"" says Dr. Anthony Komaroff, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
        The good news is that the causes of your energy debts are also the solutions for refueling. Here's a look at how better managing diet, exercise, sleep, and stress can help refuel your depleted energy tank.
        Diet
        Increasing your intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and protein can help boost ATP and muscle mass, according to Dr. Komaroff.
        Choose lean meats like chicken and turkey, fatty fish like salmon and tuna, and nuts. Also, eating a small meal or snack every few hours is better than having three large meals a day. ""Your brain has very few energy reserves of its own and needs a steady supply of nutrients,"" says Dr. Komaroff.
        Fatigue also is a sign of dehydration. Although individual needs vary, men should aim for approximately 15 cups (about 3.7 liters) of fluids per day from drinks and foods. Water and beverages like coffee and tea are ideal. Some fruits and vegetables are almost 90% water or higher and provide a good source of fluids. Examples include cucumbers, zucchini, bell peppers, tomatoes, celery, strawberries, peaches, oranges, and melons like watermelon and cantaloupe.
        What you don't eat is equally important. For instance, cut back on foods with a high glycemic index. These foods, most of which are high in simple carbohydrates, quickly raise blood sugar levels and provide a jolt of energy. But this sudden spike often leads to a sharp drop in blood sugar levels, the so-called sugar crash, which can trigger fatigue. (Find a detailed list of high-glycemic-index foods at /glycemic.)
        
          
            
              
                When does low energy become a problem?
                See your doctor if you experience prolonged bouts of low energy or if lack of energy begins to affect your daily life. This could be a red flag for a serious medical condition, such as heart disease, cancer, anemia (a deficiency of red blood cells), or an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis.
              
            
          
        
        Exercise
        Exercise increases energy levels in several ways. ""It not only helps add muscle mass but also spurs your body to produce more ATP in your cells,"" says Dr. Komaroff. Exercise also boosts energy-promoting neurotransmitters in the brain, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, which provide that mental lift you feel after a workout.
        Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week. Of course, it can be a challenge to exercise when energy levels are already low, so start small. Some research suggests that just 20 minutes of low-to-moderate aerobic activity, three days a week, can help energize you.
        It doesn't really matter what kind of exercise you do. Studies have found that non-aerobic exercises like strength training can have the same energy-boosting effect as aerobic activities.
        Sleep
        Nothing rejuvenates the body and mind more than a good night's rest. However, this is often difficult for older adults, who may have trouble falling or staying asleep.
        It can help to practice good sleep hygiene. For example, go to bed and get up at the same time every day, including weekends, to keep your sleep/wake cycle synchronized with your circadian rhythms. Establish a bedtime ritual in which you give yourself an hour before sleep to bathe, brush your teeth, and relax. Use the bed only for sleeping or sex (no TV or electronic devices). Keep your bedroom dark and cool.
        Afternoon naps can help with sleep quality, but keep them to 20 to 30 minutes, and don't nap within several hours of your normal bedtime, as this can disrupt your sleep cycle. ""If you still have problems sleeping through the night, see your doctor,"" says Dr. Komaroff.
        Stress relief
        Regular exercise can help manage stress, but you can also explore mind-body practices that emphasize calming breath control and mindfulness, such as yoga, tai chi, and qi gong. Also, alleviate stress with diversions, like taking up a new hobby. Stress that affects your sleep or appetite could be related to anxiety or depression and may require professional therapy.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/get-a-lift-from-body-weight-workouts,Get a lift from body-weight workouts,"Regular exercise doesn't always conform to your schedule or mood. Sometimes you're crunched for time. Sometimes your typical workout feels uninspired. Sometimes you just need a quick jolt to jump-start your day.
        When these moments arise, your body can lend a hand.
        ""Body-weight exercises are not only versatile — as you can do them anytime, anywhere, without any equipment — but they help improve everyday movements,"" says Shawn Pedicini, a physical therapist specializing in sports and orthopedic injuries with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Network.
        Muscle activation
        One of the main advantages of body-weight movements is that they activate the smaller stabilizing muscles that sometimes get missed when you use gym machines or dumbbells. As their name implies, stabilizer muscles help to stabilize larger muscles so they can more effectively do their job.
        ""This comes in handy for daily activities that require balance and stability, like climbing stairs, squatting, twisting, and reaching,"" says Pedicini.
        It only takes a few body-weight exercises for an all-around workout. The following is a simple three-move routine that hits the major muscles. It consists of push-ups (arms, shoulders, chest), lunges (buttocks, legs), and a plank pose (core).
        To complete one circuit, do eight push-ups, eight lunges on each side, and a plank pose for 15 to 30 seconds. Rest for a minute and then repeat the circuit two more times, with a rest period in between. The entire routine takes about 15 minutes to complete.
        Push-ups
        Begin in a full plank position with your arms extended, palms flat and just below shoulder level, feet together or about 12 inches apart. Keep your back straight and your weight evenly distributed.
        Movement: Look down and lower your body until your elbows are at 90° (or go to the floor to rest, if needed), and then push back up to complete one rep.
        
          Tips:
        
        
          Keep your head in line with your spine.
          Hold your core tight.
          Don't bend at the hips.
        
        Make it easier: Do a modified version from a hands-and-knees position. Another option is inclined push-ups, in which you place your hands on a counter or wall at a 45° angle, which puts less strain on the wrists and shoulders.
        Make it harder: Slow your tempo and take two to three seconds to go down and one second to go up.
        Lunges
        Stand up straight with your right foot one to two feet in front of your left foot. Shift your weight forward and lift your left heel off the floor.
        Movement: Bend your knees and lower your torso until your right thigh is parallel to the floor. Keep your hands on your hips or place them on your knee for stability. Hold, then return to the starting position. Finish all eight reps, then repeat with your left foot forward. This completes one set.
        
          Tips:
        
        
          Don't extend your front knee past your ankle.
          In the lunge position, keep your shoulder, hip, and rear knee aligned.
          Don't lean forward or back.
        
        Make it easier: Lower your torso only halfway. Hold on to the back of a chair with one hand to help yourself balance.
        Make it harder: Hold for four counts in the lunge position before returning to the starting position. Or hold dumbbells in each hand as you lunge.
        Plank
        Kneel on all fours with your hands and knees directly aligned under your shoulders and hips.
        Movement: Tighten your abdominal muscles and walk your hands forward. Lower your upper body onto your forearms. Clasp your hands and align your shoulders directly over your elbows. Raise your knees off the floor so your body forms a straight line from your head to your feet. Hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds.
        
          Tips:
        
        
          Keep your neck and spine aligned.
          Tighten your abdominal muscles so your belly doesn't sag.
          Look at the floor and not up, which can strain your neck.
        
        Make it easier: If resting on your forearms is painful, do the plank from a starting push-up position with your arms extended. If you have back pain or other back issues, do the plank on your knees, or lean against a counter with your body at a 45° angle.
        Make it harder: As you hold the plank, try alternating leg lifts, raising one leg for a second or two and then repeating with the other leg.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/do-activity-trackers-make-us-exercise-more,Do activity trackers make us exercise more?,"Activity trackers can do more than ever before. They can measure your heart rate, heart rhythm, blood oxygen levels, calories burned, and the number of minutes you spend exercising or sleeping. They can ""talk"" to your smartphone or smart gym machines and connect you to workout videos, recipes, or guided meditation. Do trackers get you to move more? Studies of this question have been mixed. But an analysis published in the August 2022 issue of Lancet Digital Health found that wearing a tracker does seem to be a motivator. Scientists evaluated data from almost 400 studies from around the world, involving 164,000 people of all ages and varying health. Taken together, the findings suggested that trackers encouraged people to walk 40 more minutes per day, resulting in about two pounds of weight loss per person in about 5 months. There was also some evidence that wearing a tracker was linked to lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels. The findings don't prove conclusively that trackers triggered the increased activity. But it won't hurt you to use one, and it may even motivate you to work out more.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/sleep-added-to-list-of-essential-healthy-heart-habits,Sleep added to list of essential healthy heart habits,"The American Heart Association (AHA) has updated its list of essential components for heart and brain health. The organization added sleep duration to its ""Life's Simple 7"" and renamed the list ""Life's Essential 8."" The rest of the list covers diet, physical activity, exposure to nicotine (including secondhand smoke), weight, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure. Addressing each of those factors can reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and help ward off a heart attack or stroke. Why did the AHA add sleep to the list? Because sleep affects overall health, and getting enough sleep helps keep the other risk factors in check. Plus, wearable trackers make it easier than ever to measure your sleep. The AHA recommends that all adults get seven to nine hours of sleep per night.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/your-guide-to-taking-statins,Your guide to taking statins,"For more than 30 years, statins, the world's most prescribed class of drugs, have helped protect people against cardiovascular disease by lowering high cholesterol levels.
        ""Statins remain the first-line treatment for many people at risk of heart attacks and strokes,"" says Dr. Christopher Cannon, a cardiologist with Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""And the good news is that there are many types available, so more people can find the best one for them.""
        How statins work
        Statins lower the blood level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol. They achieve this by blocking a key enzyme in the liver that makes cholesterol and by turning on mechanisms in liver cells to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood.
        High levels of LDL can lead to fatty deposits (plaque) in artery walls throughout the body. By limiting plaque buildup in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries) and those that supply blood to the brain, statins help prevent heart disease and stroke.
        But statins do even more. They help dampen the inflammation that adds to plaque buildup and reduce the risk of existing plaque rupturing, which can trigger a heart attack.
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
                High cholesterol levels can cause plaque to build up in the arteries and block blood flow.

        Who needs them?
        All seven statins are available as generic versions: atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol XL), lovastatin (Mevacor), pitavastatin (Livalo), pravastatin (generic only), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and simvastatin (Zocor).
        Once you begin taking a statin, you will likely stay on it indefinitely, as the effect wanes once you stop.
        Statins can benefit otherwise healthy people with elevated LDL levels, defined as 130 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or higher, and those with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 7.5% or higher. (You can assess your estimated 10-year risk at /ascvd.)
        ""Also, anyone with coronary artery disease or other arterial disease caused by plaque buildup should be on a statin, even if the person has a normal cholesterol profile,"" says Dr. Cannon. In addition, statins can benefit people with diabetes at any LDL level.
        Another way to identify possible statin candidates is with a coronary artery calcium scan. This test uses a computed tomography (CT) scanner, such as an electron beam CT or a multidetector CT machine, to measure the amount of calcium in the heart's arteries, high levels of which are linked with heart disease.
        The amount of calcification is scored from zero to 1,000 and higher. The lower the score, the less calcium, and the lower the risk of heart attack or stroke. For example, a score of zero indicates no plaque is present and the person's chance of cardiovascular disease over the next 10 years is less than 2%, whereas a score higher than 400 suggests a 20% or higher risk. ""Most people with a score higher than 100 can benefit from a statin, but I recommend statins for anyone above zero,"" says Dr. Cannon.
        
          
            
              
                The age of statins
                Are you too old to benefit from a statin? Research suggests not. A study published online July 7, 2020, by JAMA found that people who started taking statins in their mid-70s or later had fewer heart-related problems and lived longer than people in the same age range who did not take statins.
              
            
          
        
        A look at side effects
        Fear of side effects is a common reason people hesitate to begin a statin, but most individuals don't encounter serious problems, says Dr. Cannon. The most common side effects are achy muscles and fatigue. Less common are headaches, digestive issues (constipation and diarrhea), and sleep disruptions.
        Some people report changes in memory and ""brain fog"" after beginning a statin. However, research suggests these problems may be related to other health issues, not the drug. Statins also don't appear to raise the risk of dementia, according to a study published June 29, 2021, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. If side effects do arise, they are often mild and go away after a week or so. If they linger, there are ways to manage them.
        ""The initial step is to coordinate with your doctor. You would stop taking the statin for a month and see if your symptoms improve,"" says Dr. Cannon. ""If they do, then we restart the medication to see if symptoms return, and if so, then the statin is likely the cause.""
        In this situation, your doctor would then try a lower dosage (as little as half a pill three times a week) or switch to a different statin. If neither of these strategies works, other new cholesterol-lowering drugs are available. For example, ezetimibe (Zetia), colesevelam (Welchol), or bempedoic acid (Nexletol) can be used along with lifestyle changes like diet, weight loss, and exercise.
        Other options are a PCSK9 inhibitor like alirocumab (Praluent) or evolocumab (Repatha), which are given via injections every two weeks, or inclisiran (Leqvio), given twice a year. ""However, these drugs are usually for people with heart disease who can't get their LDL level below 70 mg/dL with statins and other medications,"" says Dr. Cannon.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/atrial-fibrillation-after-surgery-common-and-undertreated,Atrial fibrillation after surgery: Common and undertreated?,"After surgery unrelated to the heart, a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (afib) — a heart rhythm ­disorder that raises the risk of stroke — may be more common than previously thought. And these cases appear to be undertreated, according to a study published July 25, 2022, in Annals of Internal Medicine.
        Among the 4,231 people in the study, 13% had their first-ever bout of afib after surgery unrelated to the heart, most often within a week of the operation. Stress and inflammation related to surgery may trigger afib, the researchers postulated.
        Compared with people who developed afib unrelated to a surgical procedure, those diagnosed with afib following surgery were less likely to be taking anti-clotting drugs to lower their stroke risk.
        The common perception that afib that emerges after surgery is less serious than other types of afib may be to blame for this discrepancy. However, during the average follow-up of just over six years, both groups had similar risks for stroke, transient ischemic attack (known as TIA or ministroke), and death, the researchers found.

        The study included 552 adults ages 63 to 84 who were part of the Chicago Healthy Aging Study. In addition to being assessed for factors that raise heart disease risk (such as high blood pressure and diabetes), they all wore devices that measured the amount of light in their bedrooms over a week. Fewer than half of the participants consistently had a five-hour stretch of complete darkness per day. The rest were exposed to some light even during their darkest periods (usually in the middle of the night).
        These observational findings cannot prove that nighttime light exposure makes obesity and other heart-related risks more likely. However, light during sleep may disrupt the body's internal clock and trigger other changes that affect normal metabolism, the authors noted. The findings were published online June 22, 2022, by the journal Sleep.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/harvard-health-ad-watch-a-new-injection-treatment-for-eczema-202209272824,Harvard Health Ad Watch: A new injection treatment for eczema,"Dry, itchy, reddened skin is the hallmark of eczema. If you have eczema and have seen this ad, you may be wondering about Dupixent (dupilumab). Does this new medicine work as well as it seems to in the ad? Where does the ad hit the mark, and where could it do better?
        The medicine only treats one type of eczema
        While the ad uses ""eczema"" and ""atopic dermatitis"" interchangeably, these conditions aren't exactly the same. Eczema is an umbrella term that includes:
        
          atopic dermatitis, which develops in people prone to asthma and environmental allergies, such as hay fever
          contact dermatitis, which is an allergic reaction to a substance touching the skin, such as soaps, scented products, or poison ivy
          skin inflammation that accompanies leg swelling.
        
        Atopic dermatitis is the only skin condition for which Dupixent is approved.
        The pitch
        Every ad is a sales pitch, whether it uses real people or paid actors. Here we see real people banging on drums in a band, playing piano or trombone, and baking in the kitchen. A voiceover says ""With less eczema, you can show more skin. So, roll up those sleeves and help heal your skin from within with Dupixent."" The pitch? People with eczema may be embarrassed by it and try to hide it — and effective treatment means you need not keep your skin covered.
        We next hear this is ""the first treatment of its kind that continuously treats moderate to severe eczema, or atopic dermatitis, even between flare-ups."" The viewer sees an outstretched arm with a red rash that clears up over a second or two. Of course, that's not what happens in real life; it can take weeks to see improvement.
        More perplexingly, the voiceover tells us that the drug ""…is a biologic, and not a cream or steroid."" Perhaps you're wondering what a ""biologic"" medicine is. Hold that question for further explanation below. ""Many people taking Dupixent saw clear or almost clear skin and had significantly less itch. That's a difference you can feel.""
        Side effects, warnings, and a tagline
        The warnings may raise eyebrows. ""Don't use if you're allergic to Dupixent. Serious allergic reactions can occur, including anaphylaxis, which is severe. Tell your doctor about new or worsening eye problems such as eye pain or vision changes, or parasitic infection. If you take asthma medicines, don't change or stop them without talking to your doctor.""
        Quickly, though, the ad moves on to a glowing tagline: ""So help heal your skin from within"" and recommends talking to ""your eczema specialist"" about Dupixent. That may be difficult: most people with eczema see their primary care physician for it, not a dermatologist.
        What the ad gets right
        It's true that people with eczema may try to hide it and that effective therapy may be liberating, allowing them to worry less about others seeing their skin. Dupixent is, indeed, neither a cream nor a steroid, which are older, common treatments for eczema. And, yes, Dupixent is the first treatment of its kind for eczema. It blocks a chemical called interleukin 4 (IL-4), which is thought to play an important role in this skin disease.
        What else should you consider if you have atopic dermatitis?
        
          How is it usually treated? Mild cases of atopic dermatitis may respond to skin moisturizers or medicated creams, gels, or ointments, some of which contain steroids. But this may not be effective for more severe eczema.
          What's a biologic? These medicines are made in a living system such as a microorganism, human or animal cells, or plant cells. They are often antibodies that block a substance in the body thought to cause or contribute to a disease. Because biologics are usually large molecules that would be destroyed during digestion if taken in pill form, they are generally available only by injection. Dupixent is injected every two weeks.
          Why are eye problems, parasites, and asthma mentioned in the warnings? Eye inflammation was a side effect of the medicine in studies leading to approval. IL-4 is considered a key part of our immune defense against parasitic infections, and a few study participants developed parasitic infections. As for asthma, Dupixent is an approved asthma treatment when combined with other medicines. So, if you had asthma and it improved while you treated your atopic dermatitis, you might be tempted to cut back on your other medicines — but that's not safe without medical supervision.
          What about cost? Biologics are expensive. This yearly price tag for this medicine is about $40,000 a year. Even when covered by health insurance, copays and deductibles can make it a costly treatment.
          Does it work? Text appearing on the screen says 37% of adults and 24% of teenagers saw major improvement after four months of treatment, compared with less than 10% of people not taking Dupixent. That may seem great if you're in the minority of people who dramatically improved. Or it might seem like modest success for a systemic treatment with significant risk of side effects and a large price tag.
        
        The bottom line
        Drug ads exist to sell a product. They should never be your primary source of health and treatment information. For that, look to your own health care providers and other reliable sources of information like the FDA or NIH. Their primary interest is providing accurate information and promoting public health and medication safety, not convincing you to use a particular drug.","Robert H.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/3-simple-swaps-for-better-heart-health-202209262812,3 simple swaps for better heart health,"Busy days make it hard to put heart health on the front burner. It just feels like you don't have time for habits that keep the ticker in top shape — like exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and eating a healthy diet. So maybe you take the stairs when you can, or you park farther away from a store to rack up a few extra steps each day. But what else can you do? Here are three things that might fit in your schedule.

Swap electronic communication for an in-person meeting

It's fine if texting, emailing, social media, or Zoom calls are your primary means of communicating with others. But it's not okay if those methods leave you feeling lonely or isolated — two problems linked to higher risks for heart disease, heart attack, or stroke, according to a scientific statement from the American Heart Association in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

To combat loneliness and isolation, try to replace some of your electronic back-and-forth with people with in-person meetings. Maybe you can find room in your schedule for a quick walk, cup of coffee, or brief lunch with a friend or colleague.

""Time spent face-to-face helps connect you to others and may make you feel less isolated,"" explains Matthew Lee, a sociologist and research associate at Harvard University's Human Flourishing Program. ""Being physically co-present can help you feel more engaged with others, more valued, and more likely to feel a sense of shared identity — all things that may help ease loneliness. This is why some doctors are starting to engage in 'social prescribing,' including suggesting that people get involved in volunteering and other activities that build in-person social relationships.""

A recent study published in the International Journal of Public Health by Lee and a team of Harvard-led researchers suggests that better social connectedness may reduce the risk of being diagnosed with depression or anxiety. Both are associated with heart disease or making existing heart conditions worse.

Swap an unhealthy breakfast for a healthier one

Is your typical breakfast something quick and full of refined (not whole) grains, processed meat, saturated fat, or added sugar? Eating that kind of food regularly may drive up calories, weight, blood sugar, or cholesterol levels — and that's not good for your heart.

Instead, choose breakfast foods rich in fiber, a type of carbohydrate that either passes through the body undigested (insoluble fiber) or dissolves into a gel (soluble fiber) that coats the gut.

Not only does fiber help digestion, it also


	traps, mops up, and lowers bad [LDL] cholesterol that can lead to clogged arteries
	controls blood sugar and lowers the risk for diabetes, which is strongly associated with heart attacks and strokes
	may help fight chronic inflammation, which plays a role in clogging arteries and causing heart attacks.


Fruits, nuts, seeds, whole grains (oats, barley, quinoa) and many other foods are rich in fiber. Try these fiber-rich breakfast ideas:


	microwaved oatmeal (heat a 1/2 cup of oatmeal with almost a cup of low-fat milk for about two minutes)
	a serving of cooked quinoa (cold, if you have it in your fridge) with a dollop of nonfat Greek yogurt, berries, and granola
	whole-grain cereal with milk (go for cereals with the highest amounts of whole grains and lowest amounts of added sugars)
	a slice of whole-grain toast with two tablespoons of nut butter (like almond or peanut butter)
	one or two handfuls of homemade trail mix (use your favorite unsalted nuts, sunflower seeds, and dried fruit such as raisins or apricots).


Swap a few minutes of scroll time for meditation time

If you ever take a break from your busy day to scroll through news on your phone or computer, chances are you can also find a little time to meditate, which is important for heart health. Research indicates that people who meditate have lower rates of high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, and coronary artery disease compared with people who don't meditate.

What's the connection? Meditating triggers the body's relaxation response, a well-studied physiological change that appears to help lower your blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, oxygen consumption, adrenaline levels, and levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

The great news: it doesn't take much time to reap the heart-healthy benefits of meditating — just about 10 to 20 minutes per day.

Ideas for quick ways to meditate in a busy day include sitting quietly, closing your eyes, and


	focusing on your breathing, without judging sounds you hear or thoughts that pop into your head
	listening to a guided meditation, which uses mental images to help you relax
	listening to a recording of calming sounds such as waves, a bubbling brook, or gentle rain.


Just try to calm your brain for a few minutes a day. Soon, you may find you've become better at meditating and better at practicing other heart-healthy habits, no matter how busy you are.",Heidi Godman,"September 26, 2022",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/nutritional-psychiatry-your-brain-on-food-201511168626,Nutritional psychiatry: Your brain on food,"Think about it. Your brain is always ""on."" It takes care of your thoughts and movements, your breathing and heartbeat, your senses — it works hard 24/7, even while you're asleep. This means your brain requires a constant supply of fuel. That ""fuel"" comes from the foods you eat — and what's in that fuel makes all the difference. Put simply, what you eat directly affects the structure and function of your brain and, ultimately, your mood.
        Like an expensive car, your brain functions best when it gets only premium fuel. Eating high-quality foods that contain lots of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants nourishes the brain and protects it from oxidative stress — the ""waste"" (free radicals) produced when the body uses oxygen, which can damage cells.
        Unfortunately, just like an expensive car, your brain can be damaged if you ingest anything other than premium fuel. If substances from ""low-premium"" fuel (such as what you get from processed or refined foods) get to the brain, it has little ability to get rid of them. Diets high in refined sugars, for example, are harmful to the brain. In addition to worsening your body's regulation of insulin, they also promote inflammation and oxidative stress. Multiple studies have found a correlation between a diet high in refined sugars and impaired brain function — and even a worsening of symptoms of mood disorders, such as depression.
        It makes sense. If your brain is deprived of good-quality nutrition, or if free radicals or damaging inflammatory cells are circulating within the brain's enclosed space, further contributing to brain tissue injury, consequences are to be expected. What's interesting is that for many years, the medical field did not fully acknowledge the connection between mood and food.
        Today, fortunately, the burgeoning field of nutritional psychiatry is finding there are many consequences and correlations between not only what you eat, how you feel, and how you ultimately behave, but also the kinds of bacteria that live in your gut.
        
          How the foods you eat affect your mental health
        
        Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate sleep and appetite, mediate moods, and inhibit pain. Since about 95% of your serotonin is produced in your gastrointestinal tract, and your gastrointestinal tract is lined with a hundred million nerve cells, or neurons, it makes sense that the inner workings of your digestive system don't just help you digest food, but also guide your emotions. What's more, the function of these neurons — and the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin — is highly influenced by the billions of ""good"" bacteria that make up your intestinal microbiome. These bacteria play an essential role in your health. They protect the lining of your intestines and ensure they provide a strong barrier against toxins and ""bad"" bacteria; they limit inflammation; they improve how well you absorb nutrients from your food; and they activate neural pathways that travel directly between the gut and the brain.
        Studies have compared ""traditional"" diets, like the Mediterranean diet and the traditional Japanese diet, to a typical ""Western"" diet and have shown that the risk of depression is 25% to 35% lower in those who eat a traditional diet. Scientists account for this difference because these traditional diets tend to be high in vegetables, fruits, unprocessed grains, and fish and seafood, and to contain only modest amounts of lean meats and dairy. They are also void of processed and refined foods and sugars, which are staples of the ""Western"" dietary pattern. In addition, many of these unprocessed foods are fermented, and therefore act as natural probiotics.
        This may sound implausible to you, but the notion that good bacteria not only influence what your gut digests and absorbs, but that they also affect the degree of inflammation throughout your body, as well as your mood and energy level, is gaining traction among researchers.
        
          Nutritional psychiatry: What does it mean for you?
        
        Start paying attention to how eating different foods makes you feel — not just in the moment, but the next day. Try eating a ""clean"" diet for two to three weeks — that means cutting out all processed foods and sugar. See how you feel. Then slowly introduce foods back into your diet, one by one, and see how you feel.
        When some people ""go clean,"" they cannot believe how much better they feel both physically and emotionally, and how much worse they then feel when they reintroduce the foods that are known to enhance inflammation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/taking-up-adaptive-sports-202209122813,Taking up adaptive sports,"Health guidelines recommend adults get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous exercise. Which activities you choose don't matter as long as they get you moving.
        But what if an injury, illness, health condition, disability, or even normal aging makes being active hard for you? In those cases, adaptive sports could lend a much-needed hand.
        What are adaptive sports?
        Adaptive sports are competitive or recreational sports or activities for people with disabilities or physical limitations. They often run parallel to traditional endeavors, but are modified to support people's specific physical abilities.
        ""Eventually, almost everyone will experience some kind of disability that impedes regular exercise, whether it's mild arthritis, requiring a knee or hip replacement, limited vision, or a more significant physical disability,"" says Dr. Cheri Blauwet, an associate professor in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School, and a former wheelchair racer who is a seven-time Paralympic medalist and two-time winner of both the Boston and New York City Marathons. ""But today, because of advanced technology and supportive infrastructure, people can find almost any kind of sport or activity that takes into account their abilities and helps them stay active.""
        Why is it important to stay active?
        Not getting sufficient regular exercise increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. It also affects mood. And people with disabilities are especially vulnerable because of the challenges of staying active, says Dr. Blauwet. ""Adaptive sports are a way for us to continue to exercise regularly and support our health and well-being going forward.""
        Research backs this up. According to one study, people participating in adaptive sports and activities report better overall health, quality of life, and social life.
        How can you learn about options for adaptive activities near you?
        You can find state and local adaptive sports programs and accessible activities through the websites of the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability and the Challenged Athletes Foundation. ""These programs also can help you find mentors, coaches, and the support system that you need to be successful,"" says Dr. Blauwet.
        What kind of sport or activity you choose ultimately depends on your interests and level of function, but many options are available.
        Build on strengths and consider new activities
        Dr. Blauwet shares other strategies that can help you transition to adaptive activities.
        Look at your current form of exercise. ""Almost any kind of sport or activity can be adjusted to accommodate people with disabilities, so there is a good chance you can continue with a favorite endeavor,"" says Dr. Blauwet.
        For instance, as part of her ongoing therapy, former Arizona representative Gabby Giffords, an avid cyclist who lives with a brain injury after an assassination attempt, now rides a recumbent bike because of paralysis on her right side and balance issues. (A recumbent bike is a three-wheel bicycle that places the rider in a seated or laid-back reclining position.)
        Other sports and activities can be altered similarly. For example, specialized golf carts can help you stand and stabilize your body while swinging the club. Sledge hockey uses sleds to skate across the ice.
        Focus on your strengths. Don't dwell on what you can't do, but focus on what you can. Running no longer an option? How about power walking using walking poles for support? Can't use your legs? Focus on upper body activities like swimming or kayaking. Low vision? Guides are available to help you walk, run, and cycle.
        Join a team. Many adaptive sports have organized team leagues with adjusted rules and formats, like wheelchair basketball and tennis, and ""beep"" baseball and kickball for individuals with low vision. ""These are a great way to build more awareness about your new endeavor and build a community with other peers with similar disabilities,"" says Dr. Blauwet. ""Plus, a little competition provides extra motivation.""
        Try something new. Use your new functional status as an opportunity to attempt a different sport or activity. ""Test the waters and try something that has always interested you,"" says Dr. Blauwet. ""Now might be the ideal time to explore waterskiing, windsurfing, horseback riding, or rock wall climbing.""
        It may be mentally and emotionally tough to embrace adaptive sports and activities, as it can feel like your disability has become magnified.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/proton-pump-inhibitors-should-i-still-be-taking-this-medication-202209062809,Proton-pump inhibitors: Should I still be taking this medication?,"Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a common type of anti-acid medication, and are available both by prescription and over the counter. Omeprazole and pantoprazole are examples of PPIs. They are the treatment of choice for several gastrointestinal disorders, such as peptic ulcer disease, esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and H. pylori infection.
        New guidelines by the American Gastroenterological Association have highlighted the need to address appropriate PPI usage, and they recommend that PPIs should be taken at the lowest dose and shortest duration for the condition being treated. However, PPIs are frequently overused, and may be taken for longer than necessary. This can happen unintentionally; for example, if the medication was started while the patient was hospitalized, or it was started as a trial to see if a patient's symptoms would improve and then is continued beyond the needed timeframe.
        Who should use PPIs in the short term?
        There are a variety of reasons for short-term PPI usage. For instance, PPIs are prescribed typically for one to two weeks to treat H. pylori infection, in addition to antibiotics. A PPI course of four to 12 weeks may be prescribed for people with ulcers in their stomach or small intestine, or for inflammation in the esophagus.
        People may also be prescribed a short course of PPIs for acid reflux or abdominal pain symptoms (dyspepsia), and for symptom relief while physicians perform tests to determine the cause of abdominal pain. People may be able to move to a lower dose of PPIs, or discontinue their medication altogether, if their symptoms get better or they have completed their treatment course.
        Who should be on PPIs long-term?
        Some patients with specific conditions may need to be on PPIs for the long term, and they should discuss their condition and unique treatment plan with their doctor. Some conditions that may require longer-term use of PPIs include:
        
          severe esophagitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal strictures, or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
          acid reflux
          dyspepsia or upper airway symptoms that improve with PPI usage but worsen when stopping PPIs
          people with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding from gastric and duodenal peptic ulcers may need to be on PPIs long-term to prevent recurrence.
        
        What are some side effects of PPIs?
        Any medication can cause side effects. Fortunately, adverse effects from PPIs are generally rare. However, these medications have been associated with increased risk of certain infections (such as pneumonia and C. difficile). Previously, there had been concerns that PPI usage was linked to dementia, but newer studies have contradicted this association.
        Additionally, while rare, PPIs may also cause drug interactions with other medications. For example, PPIs may affect the levels and potency of certain medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and some seizure and HIV medications, sometimes necessitating dosage adjustments of these drugs. Therefore, it is important to let the team of healthcare providers who manage your medications know when a new medication has been added to your list or if a medication has been discontinued.
        How do I work with my doctor to step down from taking PPIs?
        Some patients are prescribed PPIs twice a day in an acute situation, such as to prevent rebleeding from stomach ulcers or if a patient has severe acid reflux symptoms. If there no longer remains a reason to take PPIs twice a day, you may be stepped down to once a day. To discontinue a PPI, your doctor may decide to taper the medication — for example, by decreasing the dose by 50% each week until discontinued.
        What might I experience if my doctor suggests I stop taking a PPI?
        Studies have shown that for patients with long-term PPI use, there can be rebound secretion of stomach acid and an increase in upper gastrointestinal symptoms when discontinuing PPIs. However, a different type of anti-acid medication (such as an H2 antagonist like famotidine or a contact antacid medication containing calcium carbonate like TUMS) can be used for relief temporarily. If a patient experiences more than two months of severe persistent symptoms after discontinuing a PPI, this may be a reason to resume PPI therapy.
        What steps should I take next?
        It is important to routinely discuss your medication list and concerns with your primary care doctor. The decision to step down or discontinue a PPI is complex, and for your safety you should verify with your doctor before adjusting your PPI dosing. Ultimately, the goal is to make sure you are only taking medications that are necessary in order to maximize the benefit and minimize side effects.","Nisa Desai, MD","September 6, 2022",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/severe-covid-infection-may-lead-to-noticeable-cognitive-loss,Severe COVID infection may lead to noticeable cognitive loss,"People who suffered from severe cases of COVID-19 may develop cognitive problems — such as brain fog and trouble recalling words — equivalent to losing 10 IQ points, a small new study suggests.
        The study, published April 28, 2022, in the journal eClinicalMedicine, analyzed data from 46 adults who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom from March to July 2020, including 16 who needed ventilators. All underwent comprehensive, computerized testing of memory, attention, and reasoning abilities an average of six months after their illness. The researchers compared the test results to data from more than 66,000 people who weren't infected with the virus.
        The COVID survivors, especially those who'd needed ventilators, logged far slower mental processing speeds and showed less-accurate verbal reasoning than the uninfected group. The researchers estimated their magnitude of cognitive loss to be about 10 IQ points.
        The results suggest that the cognitive effects of severe COVID infection are still noticeable more than six months afterward and that recovery can be gradual, the investigators said.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/beyond-hot-flashes,Beyond hot flashes,"We're told what to expect when we're expecting — but not so much at midlife, when we might not expect to inhabit a body that no longer feels quite like our own.
        Yet that's exactly what happens to a startling number of women as menopause approaches. Relatively predictable symptoms such as hot flashes, mood shifts, vaginal dryness, and hide-and-seek periods can be trumped by a tsunami of new concerns from head to toe.
        What's changed? You're inching along a spectrum of declining hormones in a lengthy, often volatile process. And while all sex hormones ping-pong during the menopausal transition — defined as the years just before periods cease — the drop in estrogen, in particular, sets off a wave of low-grade inflammation that can lead to body-wide complaints.
        ""The most common thing women say to me is 'I just don't feel like myself anymore.' These seemingly disparate symptoms hit hard,"" says Dr. Heather Hirsch, head of the Menopause and Midlife Clinic at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""While nothing stays the same during perimenopause, what's so fascinating is how the loss of sex hormones can cause a constellation of issues.""
        
          
            
              
                Brain effects can seem ominous
                ""Do I have Alzheimer's disease?"" Dr. Heather Hirsch hears that question almost every day from women who come to the Menopause and Midlife Clinic at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
                Why? Many fear their cognitive problems — forgetfulness, lack of focus, trouble understanding information — must signal dementia. But that's rarely the case in midlife, when drops in estrogen can fuel brain fog. Fewer than 10% of the six million Americans who have Alzheimer's are under 65, according to the National Institute on Aging.
                How can you tell the difference between menopausal brain fog and Alzheimer's symptoms? Dr. Hirsch suggests watching for these more ominous signs:
                
                  getting lost in once-familiar places
                  forgetting how to do everyday tasks, such as zipping your jacket or turning on the stove
                  losing items repeatedly or misplacing them in odd spots.
                
                If you're concerned about cognitive symptoms — or if friends and family have expressed worries about you — talk to your doctor. She might refer you for specialized neurocognitive testing to look for dementia or another underlying condition.
              
            
          
        
        A lengthy list of problems
        The average American woman is 52 when she has her final menstrual period. But symptoms linked with menopause — marked by a full 12 months without periods — can begin years before and extend long after. During what's called the late menopausal transition, when menstrual cycles may stretch 60 days or longer, symptoms can even ramp up.
        Because virtually every organ contains estrogen receptors, hormone fluctuations affect all parts of our bodies. But the decline in estrogen — which has powerful anti-inflammatory effects — also triggers a cascade of low-grade inflammation that can reach every cell. A 2020 study in the Journal of Neuroinflammation describes the menopausal transition as an ""inflammatory event"" for this reason.
        Either alone or together, hormone drops and inflammation can lead to unanticipated symptoms in the following areas, among others.
        Digestive tract. Inflammation is linked to a condition known as leaky gut, which can enable bacteria to seep through the gut lining and trigger digestive woes, such as gas, or worsen the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Research also shows nearly half of women deal with frequent heartburn and other symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease around menopause.
        Skin. Noticeable skin changes, such as dryness and thinning, are common around menopause. But both can also worsen the rashes and blemishes that characterize eczema and rosacea. Psoriasis flares increase as well; about half of women with the condition notice exacerbations at menopause, according to one study.
        Joints. Stiff, achy swollen joints are common, but few women talk about it, Dr. Hirsch says. Wear-and-tear osteoarthritis might be the culprit, but menopause-driven inflammation likely plays a role, she says. One study found that more than half of women cope with joint pain around the time of menopause.
        Eyes. More than six in 10 women develop dry eye syndrome — marked by dry, itchy, gritty, burning eyes — around menopause. Changes in the balance of sex hormones are believed to influence the ""tear film"" that keeps eyes moist, according to a 2017 study.
        Ears. Even the inner ear, which is vital to our sense of balance, isn't spared from hormone changes. These can lead to dizziness or vertigo, Dr. Hirsch says.
        Heart. Palpitations or ""flutters"" during menopause affect up to 47% of women, according to a 2012 study in Menopause. But you should carefully track this phenomenon, as it may indicate an underlying heart problem, Dr. Hirsch says. Note the day and the time of month you feel palpitations, along with other menopause-related symptoms you're having.
        Allergies. Hay fever can start or get worse in your 40s, or you may find you're allergic to foods that never before caused trouble. That's because fluctuating hormones can lead to spikes in the body's production of histamine, which sets off symptoms such as itching and swelling when triggered by allergens.
        Sorting through clues
        It often takes a year or longer before a woman dealing with seemingly odd symptoms figures out their link to menopause, Dr. Hirsch says.
        ""A lot of women tell me they turned 48 or 50 and then everything seemed to fall apart,"" she says. ""They were the picture of perfect health a few years ago, and now they're on four or five medications and going to the doctor all the time and have no idea what happened.""
        Considering menopause's body-wide effects, Dr. Hirsch hopes future research will pair the phenomenon with specific symptoms to further tease out these relationships.
        ""We need people in different fields acknowledging that menopause is not just this siloed phenomenon where periods end. It's not a disease, but it can look a lot like disease does, where people aren't feeling well and their lives are turned upside down,"" she says. ""There's so much to be uncovered.""
        
          
            
              
                Even our jaws can feel perimenopause's bite
                There's seemingly no end to the ways estrogen loss can produce disturbing changes all over our bodies. Now a new study suggests it may also fuel symptoms of temporomandibular disorder (TMD), which affects twice as many women as men and is marked by pain in the jaw or the muscles controlling jaw movement.
                For the analysis, published in June 2022 in the journal Menopause, researchers divided 74 women with TMD symptoms into three groups, based on stage of menopause. The researchers then looked at how pain intensity might correlate with the women's menopausal stages. They found that both TMD pain and menopause symptoms were worst in the late menopausal transition — when menstrual cycles stretch 60 days or longer — compared with any point in the years after menstrual periods ceased entirely.
                While the study found an association between severity of jaw pain and the stage of menopause, it can't prove a cause-and-effect relationship. But since the jaw joint contains receptors for both estrogen and another female hormone, progesterone, the findings weren't surprising, says Dr. Heather Hirsch, head of the Menopause and Midlife Clinic at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
                She advises perimenopausal women dealing with jaw pain to seek treatment. That might include a customized mouth guard to prevent you from grinding your teeth and clenching your jaw — actions that fuel TMD pain.
              
            
          
        
        Ways to curb inflammation
        As you wait for hormone levels to settle, you can turn to lifestyle measures that ""help your body turn a corner"" by curbing inflammation, Dr. Hirsch says. Try these tactics:
        Eat the rainbow. Munch on brightly colored fruits and vegetables, which are rich in anti-inflammatory antioxidants. Smart options include broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, leafy greens, berries, apples, beets, and peppers. ""You don't necessarily need to eat vegan,"" Dr. Hirsch says, ""but try to eat more plant-based foods.""
        Skip packaged goods. Processed sugar and carbohydrates, which fuel inflammation, often hide in boxed foods such as cookies, candy, pasta, cereals, and microwaveable meals.
        Go for healthy fats. Good sources of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids include oily fish such as tuna, salmon, and sardines; flaxseeds and walnuts; and free-range chicken.
        Spice it up. One spice stands out: turmeric, the Indian spice dominating many curries. Much research has demonstrated the anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin, a key component of turmeric.
        Beat back stress. Calming pursuits such as yoga, reading, meditation, listening to music, or walking outdoors can lower inflammation markers in the bloodstream.
        Get your heart pumping. Regular aerobic exercise packs a one-two punch by reducing inflammation levels along with stress. ""Movement is so important, and even simple movement helps,"" Dr. Hirsch says.
        Avoid smoking and excessive drinking. ""Both are important, because some women self-medicate when they're not sleeping well during menopause,"" Dr. Hirsch says. ""It's also very common for alcohol use to start to increase in our late 40s. But it disrupts sleep and can cause mood issues as well.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/punch-up-your-fitness,Punch up your fitness,"Many people think boxing only involves opponents duking it out, so ""non-contact boxing"" might sound like a contradiction in terms. But this form of exercise, which involves throwing punches but not receiving them, has found a role well beyond the ring. Physical therapists are now using boxing fitness to help people with Parkinson's disease manage their symptoms.
        A progressive nervous system disease, Parkinson's causes involuntary and uncontrollable tremors or shaking. People with Parkinson's also battle other physical issues like muscle stiffness and weakness, poor balance and coordination, fatigue, a stooping posture, and a slow, shuffling gait.
        ""Non-contact boxing fitness has been shown to help many people with Parkinson's improve their balance, hand-eye coordination, mental focus, muscle strength, and body rhythm,"" says Laurie Keating, a physical therapist assistant with Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Network who works with Parkinson's patients as a Rock Steady Boxing coach. ""But boxing fitness also can help older adults in the same way, since they face many of the same physical and mental challenges.""
        In this corner
        Rock Steady Boxing is a national program with almost 900 affiliates. While it caters to individuals with Parkinson's, these people are just one part of a steady growth in boxing fitness over the past decade. In 2021 more than five million Americans put on boxing gloves for exercise.
        Workouts are done using punching bags and hitting oversized boxing mitts worn by coaches. Class formats can vary, but most routines, including those offered through Rock Steady, involve a coach leading you through a series of moves based on standard boxing punches: crosses, hooks, uppercuts, and jabs.
        For instance, you may perform a combination of punches for a set time, such as jabs, crosses, jabs again, and two hooks. Other routines may involve more complex sequences, or something simpler like repeating one or two punches at a quick pace.
        
          
            
              
                Slip on the gloves
                You can find boxing fitness classes at many gyms, YMCAs, and specialized boxing clubs. Gloves are often provided, or you can purchase your own. You are also taught how to wrap your hands and knuckles for extra protection. (Since boxing incorporates both strength training and cardio, make sure to check with your doctor beforehand to make sure this is a safe form of exercise for you.) If you are unsure whether boxing is right for you, observe a class. You will often feel more comfortable after watching how the class is structured and even feel motivated by seeing people like yourself participate.
              
            
          
        
        Top-to-bottom benefits
        While boxing fitness can provide a complete strength and cardio workout, here are some benefits that stand out.
        Balance and posture. The wide-legged stance used in boxing and the shifting of your center of gravity when you throw a punch are excellent training for improving balance and posture. ""If you look at boxers, they are always moving their feet to establish balance and foundation to throw their next punch,"" says Keating. Also, the footwork required to move around a bag teaches you how to change direction quickly and safely, which helps with agility and lowers your odds of falling.
        Core and lower-body strength. Boxing can strengthen your arms and shoulders, but the core and lower body are where the most significant gains occur. ""Effectively throwing punches begins at the feet,"" says Keating. ""Power is driven through the legs, up through the core, and then extends out of the arms to deliver the punch. So, with every punch, you help strengthen your legs and core muscles.""
        A stronger core improves posture, protects against low back pain, and helps with everyday movements like bending, twisting, and reaching.
        Memory and concentration. Boxing has a thinking component, in which your brain must stay one step ahead of your body. During routines, you have to memorize and execute various sequences and combinations of punches. ""This not only makes you learn complex maneuvers but keeps you focused in the moment, because you need to remember the current punches and then what immediately comes next,"" says Keating.
        Stress relief. Aerobic exercise is a wonderful stress reliever, but boxing adds the benefit of releasing built-up tension. ""Sometimes it just feels good to let out aggression and a punching bag doesn't hit back,"" says Keating.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/the-mental-powers-of-super-agers,The mental powers of super-agers,"The general thinking is that memory and other brain functions automatically slow with age. But older adults known as ""super-agers"" have changed that perception. ""This group of individuals can maintain optimal brain power much longer in life,"" says Yuta Katsumi, an instructor in neurology with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""They suggest that age-related brain changes are not always inevitable.""
        Old brain, young brain
        Memory decline is often linked to brain shrinkage. But how much brain size changes with age is highly variable.
        On average, a person's brain declines in volume and weight by about 5% per decade, beginning after age 40. Age-related brain shrinkage tends to affect the brain regions involved with learning and memory, like the frontal lobe and hippocampus. A reduced brain size is also less likely to maintain robust communication among its different parts.
        ""These brain changes can make it more difficult to learn and process new information, recall names and words, and focus on completing tasks,"" says Katsumi.
        But super-agers' brains shrink slower — almost half as fast, according to some research. Why this occurs is not fully understood.
        ""There could be a genetic component that makes these people's brains be more resilient to natural shrinkage or shrink at a slower rate, but the difference also may be associated with lifestyle habits,"" says Katsumi. ""It's also possible some people are born with exceptional memory, so they can still maintain higher-than-normal brain function even when exposed to natural decline.""
        Living the life
        So the question becomes, can you make yourself a super-ager? While you can't do anything about your genes, it may be possible to slow cognitive decline — or maybe even improve cognitive function — by following the lifestyle of super-agers.
        Many super-agers embrace habits that research has linked with healthier brains, including better memory and a lower risk for dementia. For example:
        Be more social. Super-agers tend to have large social groups. Studies have shown that regular social engagement is a great brain booster. The opposite is also true. Social isolation is linked to lower volumes of gray matter in brain regions related to cognition, according to research published online June 8, 2022, by Neurology.
        One way to increase social activity is to join a group. Men often find it most natural to bond with others over a shared activity or interest, so consider a walking group, golf or bowling league, card or chess club, or men's club at a senior community center.
        If you already have a small circle of friends but have trouble getting together regularly, take the initiative and schedule a meeting time. Men respond well to routine, so try setting up a regular gathering for coffee or lunch at the same place, ideally a setting designed for conversation and discussion.
        Challenge yourself. Studies have linked learning with better memory. ""Anything that can stimulate the mind and engage you to learn new information helps,"" says Katsumi.
        Focus on topics that interest you. For instance, study a language for an upcoming overseas trip. A study published May 15, 2019, in Frontiers in Neuroscience found that adults ages 59 to 79 who studied a second language for just four months (16 two-hour sessions) improved the neural connectivity in the brain regions responsible for attention, working memory, and language processing. Other examples include signing up for an online class, learning to play an instrument, volunteering for a favorite cause, or mentoring a youth. Even playing video games may improve memory in older adults, according to a 2020 study in Behavioural Brain Research.
        Eat more ""superfoods."" So-called superfoods are high in antioxidants, which a growing body of research has shown help reduce inflammation and protect cells from disease-causing damage. But scientists also have suggested that other nutrients or compounds — like polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, and specific vitamins and minerals — also play a role.
        It's no coincidence that many superfoods are staples in confirmed brain-healthy diets like the MIND, DASH, and Mediterranean diets. It's not certain which of these foods or what amounts are ideal, so the consensus is to focus on eating ""superplates"" — meals containing a variety of superfoods. Common choices include the following:
        
          berries
          whole grains (oatmeal, quinoa, barley)
          fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, trout)
          nuts (walnuts, almonds, pecans)
          olive oil
          cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower)
          avocados
          green tea.
        
        Be more active. Super-agers are quite active. Research has suggested that exercise can help maintain and possibly improve cognitive function, even if you begin later in life. Aerobic exercise, strength training, and even yoga are all connected to better memory among older adults.
        Guidelines suggest 150 minutes of weekly moderate-intensity exercise. But consistency is key. ""The more active you are on a regular basis, the greater the brain benefits,"" says Katsumi. Doing a variety of activities can help you stay motivated. Choose several you enjoy and make them part of your lifestyle.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/getting-stuck-in-long-term-grief,Getting stuck in long-term grief,"When a loved one passes away, we each grieve differently and on our own timeline. When an intense level of grief lasts beyond a year, however, experts now have an official diagnosis for it. In March 2022, the American Psychiatric Association added ""prolonged grief disorder"" to its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) — the guide clinicians use to diagnose mental health conditions.
        ""Prolonged grief isn't just missing your loved one at 12 months. It's debilitating and interferes with functioning. It exceeds social, cultural, and religious norms,"" says Sue Morris, a senior psychologist who specializes in bereavement at Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
        Prevalence and symptoms
        Prolonged grief disorder applies only to people mourning the death of a loved one. The condition is estimated to affect 7% to 10% of bereaved adults.
        Symptoms are very specific. After 12 months, a person with prolonged grief still has a daily, intense longing or yearning for the loved one or remains preoccupied with thoughts and memories of the loved one to the point that it interferes with daily life.
        To be diagnosed with prolonged grief, a person must also have at least three of the following symptoms:
        
          a feeling that part of oneself has died
          disbelief about the death
          avoidance of reminders that the person is gone
          intense anger, bitterness, or sorrow related to the death
          difficulty re-engaging with life
          emotional numbness, especially regarding connection with others
          a feeling that life is now meaningless
          intense loneliness due to the death.
        
        In addition, the symptoms must not be better explained by other conditions, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or substance abuse.
        Living in grief
        There are a number of reasons why the cloud of grief can envelop us and keep us wandering aimlessly in another world. The risk factors fall into two categories:
        
          circumstances related to the death, including trauma, suddenness, or violence; lack of preparation for the death; death of a child or a younger person; or death in a hospital intensive care unit
          circumstances related to the bereaved individual, including a history of psychological disorders, such as depression or substance use; other losses in life; or lack of social support.
        
        Having a close or dependent relationship with the person who died is another risk factor for prolonged grief disorder, especially for people who've been married for many years. ""They grew up with their spouse and often relied on each other for companionship and doing certain jobs. When one dies, the other has to navigate a lot of change, and that can be very hard, especially if they are isolated or struggling with other issues,"" Morris says.
        Those risk factors can derail the normal grieving process. ""That's why prevention is important. We want to get ahead of that curve. When I meet family members soon after someone dies, I try to identify known risk factors and what we can do now to help,"" she says.
        Health consequences
        Left untreated, prolonged grief disorder can lead to health problems. Any kind of grief can contribute to
        
          chronic stress
          inactivity
          missed doctor appointments
          increased blood pressure (which raises the risk of stroke)
          high cholesterol levels (which raise the risk of heart disease)
          high blood sugar levels (which raise the risk of diabetes)
          alcohol or drug abuse
          insomnia
          a weakened immune system.
        
        Prolonged grief disorder in particular increases the risks for a shortened life span or suicide.
        Treatment
        Dealing with grief starts with self-care — giving yourself permission to grieve and following healthy lifestyle habits, even if it's just eating one healthy meal a day or going for a brief walk every day. Connecting with friends and family is also important.
        Other key steps include a visit to a primary care doctor and an assessment with a therapist. If the therapist determines that you do have prolonged grief disorder, healing is possible.
        ""Having this diagnosis can validate someone's experience and help the person receive the appropriate treatment. We have evidence-based therapy programs that help people understand grief, manage painful emotions, deal with avoidance, think about the future, tell the story of the death, and learn to live with reminders,"" Morris says. ""In time, they reintegrate with life.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/better-balance-may-mean-a-longer-life,Better balance may mean a longer life,"A study published online June 21, 2022, by the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that people who are unable to stand on one leg for 10 seconds in middle and later life have almost double the usual risk of premature death. Researchers evaluated the health information and balance test results of 1,700 people (ages 51 to 75, and all free of walking problems), and then followed them for seven years. During the study, 123 participants died of various causes. After taking participants' age, underlying conditions, weight, and other factors into account, scientists determined that failing the balance test was associated with an 84% higher risk of dying within the study period, compared with passing the balance test. The study was observational and found only an association (not a cause-and-effect relationship) between balance ability and early death. But if you want to give the test a try, it happens also to be a good way to boost balance — which reduces your risk of falls, regardless of any possible effect on longevity. Here's what to do: Stand near a counter (for support if necessary). To balance on your left leg, keep your arms at your sides and slowly place the top of your right foot on your left calf. Stand that way for 10 seconds. Then repeat, reversing leg positions. Practice every day, and see how much your balance improves.

But it's important to keep up your handgrip strength, and not just to get through daily tasks. A large study published online June 23, 2022, by JAMA Network Open found that poor handgrip strength in midlife was associated with cognitive decline a decade later. More than 190,000 dementia-free men and women (average age 56) were involved in the study and followed for at least 10 years. Participants took tests that measured handgrip strength, problem-solving skills, memory, and reasoning abilities, and also underwent brain imaging. Compared with people who'd had higher handgrip strength scores at the start of the study, people with lower grip scores were more likely to later have problems with thinking and memory, brain imaging markers of vascular dementia, and diagnoses of dementia. The study was observational and doesn't prove that poor handgrip strength caused cognitive decline. But other studies have suggested a similar association.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/do-you-fall-down-when-you-stand-up,Do you fall down when you stand up?,"Blood pressure that drops when you stand — what doctors call orthostatic hypotension — affects nearly one in three older adults. It's also a common cause of falls, according to a scientific statement from the American Heart Association, published online May 19, 2022, by Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.
        ""There are serious consequences to orthostatic hypotension. People can fall and fracture their hips and other bones. Some people can't even get out of bed without feeling dizzy or lightheaded and fainting. It can be incapacitating,"" says Dr. Roy Freeman, a neurologist who specializes in treating orthostatic hypotension at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Orthostatic hypotension can be hard to manage. But because of the risks, it's important to do as much as possible to control it.
        Orthostatic hypotension causes
        When you stand, gravity pulls blood downward, away from your brain and heart. Blood pressure falls, and the body's alarm bells go off. Normally, this triggers automatic reflexes: the brain sends nerve signals that cause the heart to beat faster and blood pressure to rise, restoring normal blood flow to the brain and heart.
        Several things can throw off that system. One is aging, which causes sensors monitoring blood pressure to become less responsive: they don't immediately notice the drop in blood pressure.
        The bigger contributors can be divided into two categories:
        Nerve problems. Several conditions, such as diabetes or Parkinson's disease, can damage the autonomic nerves involved in blood pressure control. If orthostatic hypotension results, it's said to be neurogenic. This type of orthostatic hypotension can be severe and disabling.
        Circulation problems. Anything that decreases the amount of fluid in your blood vessels — such as dehydration, a medication, or a heart problem — can cause blood pressure to drop too low when you stand. Usually, this type of orthostatic hypotension is less serious than the kind caused by nerve problems.
        What you can do
        If the problem reflects fluid loss from a medication, such as an antidepressant or a diuretic, your doctor often can switch you to a different drug. When the underlying problem is neurogenic, such as from long-standing diabetes, your doctor will likely recommend a combination of therapies.
        Here are some strategies to help all types of orthostatic hypotension:
        Keep up your blood volume. ""Drink at least 3 liters of fluid per day, and make sure you're eating 4 to 6 grams of salt per day,"" Dr. Freeman advises. ""This will increase your blood volume."" You need to monitor your blood pressure to be sure that this approach doesn't cause high blood pressure at times other than when you're standing up.
        Take medication to alleviate light-headedness. A number of drugs may help, such as midodrine (Orvaten, ProAmatine) or droxidopa (Northera), which tighten blood vessels and thereby increase blood pressure. Another option is fludrocortisone (Florinef), which increases sodium in the body so you retain water; that increases blood volume and raises blood pressure.
        Avoid hot environments. Warmth can cause the blood vessels to dilate (widen), which can lower blood pressure further when you stand up.
        Get up slowly from a sitting or lying position. This will give your body time to restore normal blood flow.
        Wear compression stockings. These may be helpful in certain situations — such as when you're standing for long periods — to help promote better circulation. But Dr. Freeman does not recommend using them routinely to avoid orthostatic hypotension.
        Sit for 30 minutes after eating. ""Eating causes blood vessels to dilate, so be particularly careful about standing up following a meal. For people who have orthostatic hypotension, it helps to eat small, frequent meals,"" Dr. Freeman says.
        Sleep with the bed on a slant. ""Many people develop higher blood pressure when they lie down. That causes the kidneys to move fluid from the blood to the urine, leaving blood volume more depleted in the morning,"" Dr. Freeman explains. Use a specially made wedge under the mattress or blocks under the upper legs of the bed to elevate the head of the bed by around six inches. That way, says Dr. Freeman, you use gravity to keep blood pressure from rising during the night.
        Emergency maneuvers
        If you feel lightheaded when you rise, sit down as soon as possible. ""If you can't, try an emergency maneuver,"" advises Dr. Freeman. ""Make fists and tense the muscles in your arms, legs, buttocks, and abdomen. That will narrow your blood vessels.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/could-anger-and-depression-raise-the-risk-of-afib,Could anger and depression raise the risk of afib?,"Psychological issues such as anger, anxiety, depression, and work stress may be associated with a greater likelihood of developing the heart rhythm disorder known as atrial fibrillation (afib), according to a review article published Sept. 1, 2022, in the International Journal of Cardiology.
        Researchers examined 13 studies that involved a total of more than 5.3 million participants. They found that the two most common emotional disorders, depression and anxiety, were associated with a 25% and 10% higher risk of afib, respectively. Significant work stress was linked to a 18% greater risk of afib, and anger to a 15% increase in risk.
        People with depression and anxiety tend to have higher blood levels of stress hormones and substances known as inflammatory biomarkers. Both may contribute to alterations in the heart's electrical activity and structure, which could contribute to afib, according to the study authors.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/hybrid-exercise-training,Hybrid exercise training,"Looking to shake up your workout routine? You might want to consider hybrid exercise training, which combines heart-pumping aerobic action with muscle-strengthening moves in the same exercise session. The strategy has the advantage of meeting two key goals of the federal Physical Activity Guidelines in one fell swoop. And it also appears to be one of the best — and most time-efficient — ways for people who are overweight to lower their risk of cardiovascular-related risk factors, according to a new study (see ""A comparison of 5 workout strategies"").
        ""Like many fitness trends, hybrid training likely started in the athletic community and then moved into the mainstream,"" says Dr. I-Min Lee, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who studies the role of physical activity in disease prevention. It's not exactly a novel concept, since people have been informally combining types of exercise (such as carrying small weights to do biceps curls while walking) for a while, she points out. And fitness classes often feature combination moves, such as a squat plus an overhead press, known as a thruster (see illustration). A hybrid workout would consist entirely of these kinds of moves, which work several major muscle groups while simultaneously boosting your heart rate.
        
          
            
              
                A comparison of 5 workout strategies
                The federal Physical Activity Guidelines recommend the following goals for adults:
                
                  at least 150 minutes weekly of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, or 75 minutes weekly of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, or an equivalent combination of both
                  muscle-strengthening activities on at least two days a week.
                
                Are some exercise strategies more effective than others for improving factors that influence the risk of heart disease? To find out, researchers identified five categories of workouts:
                1. continuous endurance training: aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming) done for at least 20 minutes at a steady intensity, without any rest periods
                2. interval training (also known as high-intensity interval training): alternating periods of high- and low-intensity aerobic exercise
                3. resistance training: muscle-strengthening exercises, including the use of free weights, weight machines, and resistance bands
                4. combined training: aerobic and resistance exercises performed consecutively in a single session
                5. hybrid training: exercises that are both aerobic and strength-based, done at various levels of intensity during a single session.
                For the analysis, researchers pooled findings from 81 studies involving people who were overweight or obese. The 4,330 participants had an average age of 39, and 59% were women. Measurements of interest included blood pressure, blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), blood sugar, body composition, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Combined training produced the greatest improvements on all of those cardiometabolic factors, followed by hybrid training. The results were published in the June 2022 issue of Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.
              
            
          
        
        Hybrid training: A time saver
        The recent study found that combination training — defined as doing aerobic exercise and muscle strengthening separately but in a single session — is the most effective of several workout patterns for improving cardiometabolic risk factors (such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels). However, it's also the most time-consuming. In the study, that kind of training took an average of 187 minutes per week. The hybrid training, in contrast, took an average of 128 minutes per week.
        The one caveat is that performing hybrid exercises may be more challenging than doing aerobic and strength exercises consecutively. As Dr. Lee points out, the study included younger people without any known health problems aside from being overweight or obese. ""So, it's not clear if these findings translate to older people or those with health conditions,"" she cautions.
        Why strong muscles matter
        The main take-home message is to make sure you're adding strength-based exercises to your routine in whatever way makes the most sense for you. Strong muscles boost your basal metabolic rate — the amount of energy your body needs to keep working when you're not moving. That improves weight-loss efforts by ramping up the number of calories you burn. Building muscle mass also appears to help prevent and improve diabetes because it helps regulate blood sugar levels and related cardiometabolic factors. Harvard Health Publishing's Workout Workbook has sample exercise routines that can be tailored to your fitness level (to order, go to /ww).

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/are-you-headed-for-a-fall,Are you headed for a fall?,"People often don't realize they're at high risk for falling until after they've taken a tumble. But how can you tell if you're what health professionals call a fall risk? Studies have shown that three abilities are essential for fall prevention: optimal postural strength, good balance, and flexibility in the calves and hips.",Matthew Solan,"April 1, 2025",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-lowdown-on-good-cholesterol,"The lowdown on ""good"" cholesterol","Our bodies rely on cholesterol to create cell membranes, make hormones, and synthetize vitamin D, among other things. This waxy fat travels through the blood in tiny particles called lipoproteins, which come in a range of shapes and sizes. But too much of the wrong type in the wrong place can create problems.
        The tale of ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is pretty straightforward. Excess LDL ends up in artery walls, triggering plaque buildup and inflammation, and raising heart attack risk. Lowering LDL reduces that risk. But the story of ""good"" high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is a bit more complex.
        ""We used think of HDL as protective because it grabs cholesterol from the bloodstream and other tissues and transports it to the liver, where it's recycled or disposed,"" says Dr. Jorge Plutzky, director of preventive cardiology at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. But it turns out that not all HDL particles perform this function, which is known as reverse cholesterol transport. Some types of HDL are indifferent to cholesterol, and others actually block the process of reverse cholesterol transport.
        Failed promises
        Over the past decade, five different experimental drugs known as CETP inhibitors have been tested in large clinical trials in people with low HDL. All the drugs raise HDL levels dramatically — sometimes by as much as 60%. But most haven't clearly achieved their real goal: preventing heart attacks, stroke, and other complications from clogged arteries.
        Maybe that's because they increased the wrong type of HDL, according to researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who scrutinized 16 of the 200-plus different subtypes of HDL. In a study published in 2021 in Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology, they found that two of the experimental drugs, evacetrapib and torcetrapib, tended to raise the subtypes of HDL that are not associated with cardiovascular benefit.
        Still, another new CETP inhibitor called obicetrapib looks promising. When taken with a high-intensity statin, the drug raises HDL but also — perhaps more importantly — lowers LDL by about 50%. Larger studies of this experimental drug are currently under way.
        Danger from very high HDL?
        Past observational studies in large groups of people have suggested that those with higher HDL levels (above 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/dL for women) tend to have fewer heart attacks. However, a recent analysis found that people with very high HDL levels (80 mg/dL or higher) were about as likely to die from heart disease as people with low HDL (30 mg/dL or lower). The findings, gleaned from nearly 20,000 people with heart disease, were published May 18, 2022, in JAMA Cardiology.
        Rare genetic variations known to cause high HDL but also increase heart disease risk didn't explain these paradoxical findings. Other health habits could be at play, such as frequent alcohol intake, which is known to raise HDL and may increase heart attack risk (see ""A daily drink: Not as harmless as you think"" in the July 2022 Heart Letter).
        In addition, a national large health survey found that people who consumed at least 10% of total calories from added sugar were up to three times more likely to have low HDL as those who took in half that much sugar. People who consumed the most sugar had HDL levels that were, on average, about 11 points lower than the low-sugar-intake group. Other research has linked high-sugar diets with an increased risk of death from heart disease.
        Take-home message
        What should you make of these new results? A very low or very high HDL value should be a red flag warning to double down on your efforts to dodge heart disease, an editorial accompanying the JAMA Cardiology study suggests.
        Traditionally, the things that doctors recommend to keep your heart healthy, such as exercising and eating a mostly plant-based diet, are also thought to boost HDL. ""That's especially true for people who have high triglycerides, which tend to go hand-in-hand with low HDL levels,"" says Dr. Plutzky.
        Also, lifestyle changes have clear benefits even if they don't change your HDL levels. For example, among people who smoke, quitting can raise HDL levels and is also known to markedly reduce cardiovascular risk.
        ""For lowering your risk of heart attack and stroke, reducing elevated LDL cholesterol is still the main priority,"" says Dr. Plutzky. If you've already had a heart attack or been diagnosed with heart disease, aim for an LDL of at least 70 mg/dL, if not lower. For everyone else, an LDL of 100 mg/dL or lower is a good goal.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/putting-potassium-in-perspective,Putting potassium in perspective,"If you eat lots of vegetables, legumes, and fruits, you're probably getting plenty of potassium in your diet. Many plant-based foods are not only rich in potassium (see ""Good sources of potassium""), they're also naturally low in sodium, both of which can help keep blood pressure in a normal range.
        Alas, most Americans don't pack enough produce into their daily fare and fall shy of the 3,500 to 4,700 milligrams (mg) of potassium recommended as a daily target. (Dairy products and fish are also good sources.) They also tend to eat far too much sodium, a well-known contributor to elevated blood pressure. High blood pressure is a potent risk factor for strokes and heart attacks.

        A sodium substitute?
        A clinical trial published in 2021 in The New England Journal of Medicine hinted at a possible solution. The study included nearly 21,000 people living in rural China, most of whom had high blood pressure and a history of stroke. Half used regular salt (sodium chloride), while the others used a salt substitute that contained 25% potassium chloride and 75% sodium chloride. After a follow-up period averaging 4.7 years, the risk of stroke was 14% lower among those using the salt substitute.
        Here's the rub: these findings don't necessarily apply to most Americans. ""In China, about 75% of the sodium they eat is added during meal preparation, which is very different than here in the United States,"" says Dr. Stephen Juraschek, a blood pressure specialist at the Hypertension Center of Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. In the United States, about 75% of the sodium in our diets comes from food that's prepared elsewhere — namely, processed foods and meals from supermarkets and restaurants. ""The patients I counsel often tell me they don't salt their food, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're eating a low-sodium diet,"" says Dr. Juraschek. Many entrees at popular restaurant chains contain more than 2,300 mg of sodium — the recommended limit for an entire day's worth of food.
        Potassium: Natural vs. added
        Salt substitutes that contain 50% or 100% potassium chloride are easy to find online, but Dr. Juraschek doesn't recommend them. Eating more fresh, unprocessed food is a smarter strategy. Also, try lemon-based spice blends, which target the same taste receptors as sodium, he suggests. (For more ideas, see ""Spice up your cooking to cut down on salt"" in the August 2021 Heart Letter.)
        Food manufacturers already use potassium chloride in some products (such as bread, cereal, cheese, and processed meats) to replace a percentage of the regular sodium chloride they would normally use. But potassium salt has a somewhat bitter, metallic flavor that limits how much people will tolerate, and it's also more expensive than sodium chloride.
        There's another reason to be cautious about supplementing the food supply with potassium: the risk of hyperkalemia, a higher-than-normal level of potassium in the blood. Very high potassium levels can trigger dangerous heart rhythm problems, and in extreme cases, cardiac arrest.
        Kidney-related concerns
        Fortunately, hyperkalemia isn't something most people need to worry about. The vast majority of people have healthy kidneys, which do a great job filtering excess potassium out of the body, says Dr. Juraschek. But increasing age, diabetes, and heart failure may impair kidney function. Also, certain medications cause the kidneys to hold on to potassium, including drugs used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. These include so-called potassium-sparing diuretics: eplerenone (Inspra), spironolactone (Aldactone), and triamterene (Dyrenium, Maxzide). ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril (Prinivil) and ramipril (Altace) and angiotensin-receptor blockers such as losartan (Cozaar) and valsartan (Diovan) also cause potassium levels to rise in some people.
        A blood test called a basic metabolic panel (normally done two to four weeks after people start these medications) can detect abnormal potassium levels. Once you're on a stable drug regimen and your doctor has confirmed your kidney function looks good, you can have your potassium checked on a yearly basis. But to be on the safe side, if you're taking one of these drugs, you should avoid salt substitutes made with potassium chloride, as some products contain as much as 800 mg of potassium in one-quarter teaspoon. It's also a good idea to check with your doctor if you start eating more potassium-rich foods, although the risk of hyperkalemia from foods is likely very low, even among people with moderately advanced kidney disease, says Dr. Juraschek.
        Finally, the opposite problem — a potassium level that's too low, known as hypokalemia — can also occur. Different types of diuretics (known as thiazide and loop diuretics) sometimes trigger this problem, but it's not common.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/medications-to-lower-triglycerides,Medications to lower triglycerides,"Q.
          I've had high triglyceride levels (250 to 280 mg/dL) for years. Because I take a statin to lower my cholesterol, I thought I didn't need to worry. Is that true? I'm trying to follow a healthy diet, but is there anything else I should do to lower my triglycerides?
        
        A. Triglycerides, the most common type of fat in the body, come from fat in foods. But extra calories your body doesn't use — such as those from sugar and alcohol — are also transformed into triglycerides. That's why a healthy diet that limits sugar and refined carbohydrates (such as white bread and white rice) can help lower triglyceride levels. Minimizing alcohol also helps, as does exercising and maintaining a healthy weight.
        While it's clear that high LDL (bad) cholesterol increases the risk of a heart attack, there's increasing evidence that triglycerides are important too, even if your LDL is under control. Your triglyceride levels fall into the high range, which is defined as 200 to 499 mg/dL. (A normal level is 149 or lower; 150 to 199 is borderline high; and a value of 500 and higher is considered very high and should be treated with medications to prevent inflammation of the pancreas, called pancreatitis.)
        Anyone with a triglyceride level of 150 to 499 should be checked and treated for any underlying health problems that might be to blame, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, a low thyroid level (hypothyroidism), and liver or kidney disease. But if your triglycerides remain high after addressing these issues and making lifestyle changes, medication may be a good idea.
        Niacin can lower triglycerides, but the high doses required often cause unpleasant side effects, including flushing and stomach upset. Drugs known as fibrates can drop levels by as much as 50%. But neither drug lowers the risk of heart attacks or strokes when added to a statin.
        But a drug made from a highly purified form of EPA (an omega-3 fatty acid found in fish) called icosapent ethyl can. It lowers triglycerides and, when taken with a statin, lowers the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from cardiac causes by 26% in people with either diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Marketed under the name Vascepa, icosapent ethyl is available as a generic in the United States.
        Note that this prescription-only drug is very different from over-the-counter fish oil supplements found in stores and online. Those nonprescription products also contain EPA, but often in combination with DHA (another omega-3 fatty acid), and the amounts are far lower than in the prescription formulation. Also, fish oil supplements aren't regulated for purity or quality control.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-good-is-your-cardiometabolic-health-and-what-is-that-anyway-202208182803,"How good is your cardiometabolic health — and what is that, anyway?","Heart attack and stroke, two forms of cardiovascular disease, are leading causes of death in the US. Risk factors include a family history of cardiovascular disease, smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Excess weight increases the chances that several of these risk factors will develop.
        Do you have optimal cardiovascular health? And have you minimized your risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease in the future? Unfortunately, research suggests not many people in the US can answer yes to these questions.
        What is cardiometabolic health?
        Your cardiovascular system includes your heart, blood, and blood vessels. Cardiometabolic health is a term that refers to a combination of many of these risk factors. To estimate how many people in the US have optimal cardiometabolic health, researchers publishing in the Journal of the American College of Cardiologyanalyzed survey results from more than 55,000 adults in the US. Optimal measures were defined as all five of the following:
        
          body mass index and waist circumference in ideal ranges
          normal blood sugar (without taking medicine to lower blood sugar)
          ideal cholesterol levels (without taking medicine to lower cholesterol)
          normal blood pressure (without taking medicine to lower blood pressure)
          no evidence of cardiovascular disease, such as a prior heart attack or stroke.
        
        The results are in — and they are eye-opening
        The study found that, as of 2018, just 6.8% of the US population had optimal cardiometabolic health. That's less than one out of every 14 people!
        The researchers also found that:
        
          Optimal cardiometabolic health rates are falling. While 6.8% of the population had optimal cardiometabolic health in 2018, the rate was 7.7% in 2000 and 8.4% in 2004.
          Excess weight and elevated blood sugar are the biggest culprits. Between 2000 and 2018, the proportion of those with ideal body weight fell from 34% to 24%, while those with normal blood sugar levels fell from 59% to 37%.
          Health disparities are significant. For example, poorer cardiometabolic health was more common among people who were nonwhite, male, poor, less educated, or older. This may reflect social determinants of health, such as where people live and work.
        
        And good cardiometabolic health may be even rarer now than this study suggests: these data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is evidence that physical activity decreased and unhealthy habits increased during pandemic lockdowns.
        Good news about cardiometabolic health tucked in among the bad news
        Though disappointing, the findings of this latest research offered some good news.
        
          Within the youngest age group (ages 20 to 34), the proportion of those with optimal cardiometabolic health rose slightly, from about 14% in 2000 to about 15% in 2018.
          Overall, ideal cholesterol levels improved, going from about 30% of the population in 2000 to 37% in 2018.
          Many study participants had intermediate (not poor) cardiometabolic health. They might need only minor improvements to move into the optimal group.
        
        What can you do to improve your cardiometabolic health scorecard?
        When studies find Americans are failing on health measures and that health disparities exist between different populations, it's easy to become discouraged. But this can also be a personal call to action. Avoiding a heart attack or stroke would seem well worth it.
        Think about your own cardiometabolic health. Could it be better? Small, manageable steps and a discussion with your doctor can help you move toward your goals.
        
          Get your blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar checked. Find out what steps can help you improve them if they aren't in an ideal range. Getting sufficient exercise, for example, can help all three.
          Lose excess weight through a healthful diet and adding more physical activity to your day.
          Quit smoking. Though not included in this latest study, smoking is among the most important risk factors for poor cardiometabolic health, as well as many types of cancer and other health problems. Your health care team can help you create a plan to quit, which may include medications, or you can try the free resources on smokefree.gov.
        
        Improving cardiometabolic health can be difficult to do on your own. Talk to your doctor about what steps to take and how best to monitor your progress.
        The bottom line
        Based on the findings in this research, few of us are doing enough to prevent the suffering and death caused by heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiometabolic disorders, especially among certain groups. The good news is that much of the risk of cardiometabolic disease is under our control. So, let's roll up our sleeves and get to it.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/poison-ivy-scratchin-like-a-hound-202208172804,Poison ivy: Scratchin' like a hound?,"Earlier this summer, I contracted a case of poison ivy that was so bad, I woke up in the middle of the night clawing my forearms with my fingernails — scratchin' like a hound, as The Coasters famously sang. I thought I knew how to avoid this noxious plant, which I've spotted in my neighborhood and on nearby hiking trails.
        But as it turns out, misconceptions about getting and treating poison ivy are common. Below, two Harvard dermatologists share the facts to help you avoid poison ivy — or manage it if you get it.
        How can you be exposed to poison ivy?
        ""When I was growing up, my parents told me you could only get poison ivy if you touched the leaves when they were red and shiny,"" says Dr. Abigail Waldman, a dermatologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. That is not true, she emphasizes. Urushiol, the oily resin that triggers an allergic reaction, is found throughout the year in all parts of the plant: the leaves, stems, bark, fruit, and roots.
        Brushing against any part of the plant or touching anything that's been in contact with the plant — your clothes, shoes, garden tools, or your pet — can cause an allergic reaction. I didn't recall having been near any poison ivy, but it's possible my dog wandered near a patch and I got the oil on my hands and arms while removing her harness when we got home from a walk.
        Wash up quickly to avoid a case of poison ivy
        If you're exposed to urushiol, wash the area with soap and water (dish soap is best) as soon as possible, ideally within an hour. ""You also need to wash anything that might have been contaminated — not just your clothes but other things you don't normally wash, like your jacket and shoes,"" says Dr. Waldman. Once my rash erupted and I realized I had poison ivy, I scrubbed down my dog and washed her leash and harness, along with the running shoes I wear on walks.
        A rash may not develop right away
        You can develop symptoms — a red, itchy rash that sometimes features blisters — from four hours to four days after you're exposed to urushiol. Why the long lag time? The rash caused by poison ivy is a form of allergic contact dermatitis. It's mediated by T cells, the immune cells that recognize and attack foreign substances — in this case, skin proteins that react with urushiol.
        ""T cells take 24 to 96 hours to ramp up in the body, which is why this is also known as a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction,"" says Dr. Jeff Yu, assistant professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School. Symptoms take longer to show up after your first exposure to poison ivy. ""But once your body has been exposed and reacted several times, it tends to show up faster because your body 'remembers' the rashes and has T cells ready to go,"" he explains.
        This reaction differs from more familiar allergies, such as those to cats, dogs, or mold, which are immediate hypersensitivity reactions. These occur within minutes and are mediated by histamine, a chemical that plays a role in reactions such as a runny nose and watery eyes.
        Because I didn't realize I'd been exposed to urushiol, I had unwittingly transferred the oil to other parts of my body, including my torso. Fortunately, once the oil is washed away, the rash is not contagious — you can't spread it to other parts of your body or to other people, says Dr. Waldman.
        Treating poison ivy: Start with over-the-counter remedies
        For milder cases of poison ivy, simple remedies may suffice, says Dr. Yu, who treats patients at the Contact Dermatitis and Occupational Dermatology Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital. A thin layer of topical 1% hydrocortisone cream on the affected area may help, if you have a very mild case limited to one area on an arm or leg, says Dr. Yu. You also can try topical anti-itch products, such as calamine lotion or Sarna lotion with menthol, he suggests.
        For me, hydrocortisone cream didn't help. ""Once poison ivy spreads, topical hydrocortisone is like sprinkling water on a wildfire,"" says Dr. Yu. A friend dropped off a rash-relief spray that provided soothing but short-lived relief. Another suggested I try taking the antihistamine diphenhydramine (Benadryl), an over-the-counter allergy drug. That's not helpful because histamine doesn't have a prominent role in poison ivy, says Dr. Yu. ""The only benefit you might get from Benadryl is feeling sleepy,"" he says. And in fact, it did make me sleepy, but I was still itchy and very uncomfortable.
        So, what works if over-the-counter treatments don't help and symptoms are interfering with your life? A health care provider may prescribe oral steroids. Indeed, soon after I visited an urgent care clinic and began taking the oral steroids a doctor prescribed for me, I felt much better. Be sure to follow the dosing instructions carefully: Oral steroids must be tapered, which means gradually taking lower doses over a period of three weeks to avoid a possible flare-up. And always consult a doctor if a poison ivy rash involves sensitive parts of the body like the face or groin.",Julie Corliss,"August 17, 2022",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-hidden-dangers-of-protein-powders,The hidden dangers of protein powders,"Adding protein powder to a glass of milk or a smoothie may seem like a simple way to boost your health. After, all, protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle, bone strength, and numerous body functions. And many older adults don't consume enough protein because of a reduced appetite.
        But be careful: a scoop of chocolate or vanilla protein powder can harbor health risks. ""I don't recommend using protein powders except in a few instances, and only with supervision,"" says registered dietitian Kathy McManus, director of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
        What is protein powder?
        Protein powders are powdered forms of protein that come from plants (soybeans, peas, rice, potatoes, or hemp), eggs, or milk (casein or whey protein). The powders may include other ingredients such as added sugars, artificial flavoring, thickeners, vitamins, and minerals. The amount of protein per scoop can vary from 10 to 30 grams. Supplements used for building muscle contain relatively more protein, and supplements used for weight loss contain relatively less.
        What are the risks?
        There are numerous risks to consider when using a protein powder. Among them:
        
          A protein powder is a dietary supplement. The FDA leaves it up to manufacturers to evaluate the safety and labeling of products. So, there's no way to know if a protein powder contains what manufacturers claim.
          We don't know the long-term effects. ""There are limited data on the possible side effects of high protein intake from supplements,"" McManus says.
          It may cause digestive distress. ""People with dairy allergies or trouble digesting lactose [milk sugar] can experience gastrointestinal discomfort if they use a milk-based protein powder,"" McManus points out.
          It may be high in added sugars and calories. Some protein powders have little added sugar, and others have a lot (as much as 23 grams per scoop). Some protein powders wind up turning a glass of milk into a drink with more than 1,200 calories. The risk: weight gain and an unhealthy spike in blood sugar. The American Heart Association recommends a limit of 24 grams of added sugar per day for women and 36 grams for men.
        
        A new risk revealed
        Earlier this year, a nonprofit group called the Clean Label Project released a report about toxins in protein powders. Researchers screened 134 products for 130 types of toxins and found that many protein powders contained heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury), bisphenol-A (BPA, which is used to make plastic), pesticides, or other contaminants with links to cancer and other health conditions. Some toxins were present in significant quantities. For example, one protein powder contained 25 times the allowed limit of BPA.
        How could protein powder contain so many contaminants? The Clean Label Project points to manufacturing processes or the existence of toxins in soil (absorbed by plants that are made into protein powders).
        Not all of the protein powders that were tested contained elevated levels of toxins. You can see the results at the Clean Label Project's website (www.cleanlabelproject.org).
        
          
            
              
                Daily protein goals
                Aim for the Recommended Dietary Allowance for protein intake: 46 grams per day for women and 56 grams for men. For example:
                
                  an egg for breakfast (6 grams)
                  6 ounces of plain Greek yogurt at lunch (18 grams)
                  a handful of nuts for a snack (4–7 grams)
                  a cup of milk (8 grams) and 2 ounces of cooked chicken for dinner (14 grams).
                
              
            
          
        
        What you should do
        McManus says that in certain cases, chemical-free protein powders may be helpful—but only with medical supervision. Such cases could include
        
          difficulty eating or an impaired appetite (as a result of cancer treatment or frailty from older age)
          a surgical incision or a pressure wound that is not healing well (your body needs protein to repair cells and make new ones)
          a serious condition requiring additional calories and protein in order for you to get better (such as burns).
        
        Otherwise, get protein from whole foods: nuts, seeds, low-fat dairy products (yogurt, milk, cheese), legumes (beans, lentils), fish, poultry, eggs, and lean meat. ""You'll find,"" McManus says, ""that there are many ways to get protein without turning to a powder.""

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/struggling-to-sleep-your-heart-may-pay-the-price-202203092701,Addressing poor sleep may help heart health,"Growing evidence suggests that poor sleep is linked to a host of health problems, including a higher risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. Now, a recent study on people in midlife finds that having a combination of sleep problems — such as trouble falling asleep, waking up in the wee hours, or sleeping less than six hours a night — may nearly triple a person's risk of heart disease.
        ""These new findings highlight the importance of getting sufficient sleep,"" says sleep specialist Dr. Lawrence Epstein, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Many things can contribute to a sleep shortfall, he adds. Some people simply don't set aside enough time to sleep. Others have habits that disrupt or interfere with sleep. And some people have a medical condition or a sleep disorder that disrupts the quality or quantity of their sleep.
        Who was in the study?
        The researchers drew data from 7,483 adults in the Midlife in the United States Study who reported information about their sleep habits and heart disease history. A subset of the participants (663 people) also used a wrist-worn device that recorded their sleep activity (actigraphy). Slightly more than half of participants were women. Three-quarters reported their race as white and 16% as Black. The average age was 53.
        Researchers chose to focus on people during midlife, because that's when adults usually experience diverse and stressful life experiences in both their work and family life. It's also when clogged heart arteries or atherosclerosis (an early sign of heart disease) and age-related sleep issues start to show up.
        How did researchers assess sleep issues?
        Sleep health was measured using a composite of multiple aspects of sleep, including
        
          regularity (whether participants slept longer on work days versus nonwork days)
          satisfaction (whether they had trouble falling asleep; woke up in the night or early morning and couldn't get back to sleep; or felt sleepy during the day)
          alertness (how often they napped for more than five minutes)
          efficiency (how long it took them to fall asleep at bedtime)
          duration (how many hours they typically slept each night).
        
        To assess heart-related problems, researchers asked participants ""Have you ever had heart trouble suspected or confirmed by a doctor?"" and ""Have you ever had a severe pain across the front of your chest lasting half an hour or more?""
        A ""yes"" answer to either question prompted follow-up questions about the diagnosis, which included problems such as angina (chest pain due to lack of blood flow to the heart muscle), heart attack, heart valve disease, an irregular or fast heartbeat, and heart failure.
        Poor sleep linked to higher heart risk
        The researchers controlled for factors that might affect the results, including a family history of heart disease, smoking, physical activity, as well as sex and race. They found that each additional increase in self-reported sleep problems was linked to a 54% increased risk of heart disease compared to people with normal sleep patterns. However, the increase in risk was much higher — 141% — among people providing both self-reported and wrist-worn device actigraphy data, which together are considered more accurate.
        Although women reported more sleep problems, men were more likely to suffer from heart disease. But overall, sex did not affect the correlations between sleep and heart health.
        Black participants reported more sleep and heart-related problems than white participants. But in both groups, more sleep problems raised the risk for heart disease.
        This study is observational, so it cannot firmly prove the links reported. Regardless of sleep health problems, the researchers noted, minoritized people have a higher estimated risk for heart disease than white people. The social determinants of health, such as income and conditions where people live and work, play a role in heart health.
        What does this mean for you?
        If you have trouble falling or staying asleep, there are many ways to treat these common problems, from simple tweaks to your daily routine to specialized cognitive behavioral therapy that targets sleep issues. These are well worth trying, because getting a good night's sleep helps in many ways.
        ""Treating sleep disorders that interfere with sleep can make you feel more alert during the day, improve your quality of life, and reduce the health risks related to poor sleep,"" says Dr. Epstein.",Julie Corliss,"August 10, 2022",1

                  What to do if your shoulder hurts
                
                If you do experience shoulder pain, it's not always possible to figure out the cause. Sometimes problems in other parts of the body are actually the source of the pain, which then radiates to your shoulder. This can happen with certain neck problems, including arthritis and disc herniations.
                In general, if you are experiencing a lot of pain or know you injured yourself, it's best to see a doctor right away to have your shoulder condition diagnosed.
                But if you have general, mild shoulder pain, try adjusting your activities, taking acetaminophen or an over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and performing mild stretches to see if the pain improves on its own. However, if the pain is getting worse or doesn't go away after a few weeks, you should consult your doctor.
              
            
          
        
        Rotator cuff injuries and irritations
        Your rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that help tether your shoulder into the socket and allow you to move it in a circular motion. Some two million people visit a doctor each year for rotator cuff–related issues, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgery (AAOS). Most problems with the rotator cuff fall into two categories: tears or inflammation. Suspect a rotator cuff problem if you have pain or stiffness in your shoulder when you lift your arm above your head to brush your hair or when you reach behind your back. You won't be able to do a lot of things you want to do, such as put dishes in an upper cabinet, play tennis, or do garden pruning.
        Rotator cuff impingement. A rotator cuff impingement happens when there is irritation, inflammation, or compression of the tendons or bursa (the fluid-filled sac that sits between bones) in the shoulder. An impingement can be caused by an injury, but it can also just result from general wear and tear from daily life.
        Rotator cuff tears. A tear in the rotator cuff will produce pain that is similar to an impingement but has one additional differentiating feature. If the pain is associated with weakness, it is likely caused by a tear, and if you just have pain, it may only be a rotator cuff impingement.
        A tear can be partial, whereby only part of the tendon is ripped away from the bone it is attached to. Or there can be a full tear, causing the tendon to completely separate from the bone. Although younger people can have rotator cuff tears, they become more common as people age, possibly because the interface between the tendon and the bone weakens and becomes more susceptible to injury. The prevalence rises with each decade of life.

Compared with impingement, a tear is more likely to be caused by an injury. Common causes include falling on the ice, getting pulled by a dog on a leash, or tripping and landing on your shoulder. In other cases, problems crop up seemingly without cause. You might suddenly notice pain when lifting something over your head.
        If you suspect a tear or are experiencing sudden pain from an injury, see a doctor right away, because you may need surgery to fix the problem. But if you aren't experiencing weakness and the pain is not severe, rest and anti-inflammatory medications may be enough to ease your discomfort.
        Calcific tendinitis. With calcific tendinitis, calcium deposits get embedded within the rotator cuff tendons. While it's unclear exactly what causes these deposits to form, some experts believe they may result from a healing process in the ligament gone awry. The condition can cause severe pain that often starts in the morning. It's more common in middle-aged and older adults and those who have diabetes.
        Treatment is aimed at relieving pain and preserving range of motion of the shoulder. Options include anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy. If the pain is severe or persistent, your doctor may suggest surgery to remove the deposits.
        Adhesive capsulitis. Commonly referred to as frozen shoulder, adhesive capsulitis is caused by a thickening and stiffening of the tissues around the shoulder joint. It typically develops in people ages 40 to 60. Frozen shoulder is more common in women than in men and in people with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or thyroid disorders.

    Living Well with Osteoarthritis: A guide to relieving the pain and caring for your joints


                
                    This report focuses primarily on osteoarthritis — the most common type of arthritis — which affects 27 million Americans. Many people believe it’s a crippling and inevitable part of growing old. But things are changing. Treatments are better, and plenty of people age well without much arthritis. If you have osteoarthritis, you can take steps to protect your joints, reduce discomfort, and improve mobility — all of which are detailed in this Special Health Report, Living Well with Osteoarthritis: A guide to keeping your joints healthy. If you don't have osteoarthritis, the report offers strategies for preventing it.

Frozen shoulder can occur after a rotator cuff impingement, a tendon tear, or even minor injury. But why some people go on to develop a frozen shoulder is not clear. Someone with shoulder pain may hesitate to move the arm as a result of those problems, which then leads to additional pain and stiffness. As a result, it may become virtually impossible to move the shoulder for weeks or months. The problem often goes away after a period of time — but that can take up to three years, according to the AAOS. Physical therapy is sometimes recommended for frozen shoulder. Other interventions include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, or, in some cases, surgery. But in most cases, it responds well to nonoperative treatment.
        Osteoarthritis. When people think of osteoarthritis, they may think of the knee and the hip, which are common sites for arthritis pain. But while osteoarthritis affects the shoulder less often, it's not uncommon. The condition develops when cartilage cushions between the bones in the shoulder erode, causing the bones to rub against one another. There are numerous treatments for osteoarthritis, including rest, modifications to activities, anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, and surgery in some cases.
        While you may be tempted to stop moving when you experience pain from osteoarthritis, doing so can actually make the problem worse because it allows the muscles to stiffen and shorten. This may ultimately make it even harder for you to move the way you want to.
        Performing simple stretches two to three days a week (see ""Simple shoulder stretch exercises"") can help keep your muscles flexible and reduce pain, provided your doctor approves.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/ketogenic-diet-is-the-ultimate-low-carb-diet-good-for-you-2017072712089,Ketogenic diet: Is the ultimate low-carb diet good for you?,"By Harvard Health Publishing Staff
        Recently, many of my patients have been asking about a ketogenic diet. Is a ketogenic diet safe? Would you recommend it? Despite the recent hype, a ketogenic diet is not something new. In medicine, we have been using it for almost 100 years to treat drug-resistant epilepsy, especially in children. In the 1970s, Dr. Atkins popularized his very-low-carbohydrate diet for weight loss that began with a very strict two-week ketogenic phase. Over the years, other fad diets incorporated a similar approach for weight loss.
        What is a ketogenic (keto) diet?
        In essence, it is a diet that causes the body to release ketones into the bloodstream. Most cells prefer to use blood sugar, which comes from carbohydrates, as the body's main source of energy. In the absence of circulating blood sugar from food, we start breaking down stored fat into molecules called ketone bodies (the process is called ketosis). Once you reach ketosis, most cells will use ketone bodies to generate energy until we start eating carbohydrates again. The shift, from using circulating glucose to breaking down stored fat as a source of energy, usually happens over two to four days of eating fewer than 20 to 50 grams of carbohydrates per day. Keep in mind that this is a highly individualized process, and some people need a more restricted diet to start producing enough ketones.
        Because it lacks carbohydrates, a ketogenic diet is rich in proteins and fats. It typically includes plenty of meats, eggs, processed meats, sausages, cheeses, fish, nuts, butter, oils, seeds, and fibrous vegetables. Because it is so restrictive, it is really hard to follow over the long run. Carbohydrates normally account for at least 50% of the typical American diet. One of the main criticisms of this diet is that many people tend to eat too much protein and poor-quality fats from processed foods, with very few fruits and vegetables. Patients with kidney disease need to be cautious because this diet could worsen their condition. Additionally, some patients may feel a little tired in the beginning, while some may have bad breath, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and sleep problems.
        Is a ketogenic diet healthy?
        We have solid evidence showing that a ketogenic diet reduces seizures in children, sometimes as effectively as medication. Because of these neuroprotective effects, questions have been raised about the possible benefits for other brain disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, sleep disorders, autism, and even brain cancer. However, there are no human studies to support recommending ketosis to treat these conditions.
        Weight loss is the primary reason my patients use the ketogenic diet. Previous research shows good evidence of a faster weight loss when patients go on a ketogenic or very low carbohydrate diet compared to participants on a more traditional low-fat diet, or even a Mediterranean diet. However, that difference in weight loss seems to disappear over time.
        A ketogenic diet also has been shown to improve blood sugar control for patients with type 2 diabetes, at least in the short term. There is even more controversy when we consider the effect on cholesterol levels. A few studies show some patients have increase in cholesterol levels in the beginning, only to see cholesterol fall a few months later. However, there is no long-term research analyzing its effects over time on diabetes and high cholesterol.
        Key takeaways from a ketogenic diet review?
        A ketogenic diet could be an interesting alternative to treat certain conditions and may accelerate weight loss. But it is hard to follow, and it can be heavy on red meat and other fatty, processed, and salty foods that are notoriously unhealthy. We also do not know much about its long-term effects, probably because it's so hard to stick with that people can't eat this way for a long time. It is also important to remember that ""yo-yo diets"" that lead to rapid weight loss fluctuation are associated with increased mortality. Instead of engaging in the next popular diet that would last only a few weeks to months (for most people that includes a ketogenic diet), try to embrace change that is sustainable over the long term. A balanced, unprocessed diet, rich in very colorful fruits and vegetables, lean meats, fish, whole grains, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and lots of water seems to have the best evidence for a long, healthier, vibrant life.

Some estimates suggest that 75% of us expect to travel domestically during the summer, and recent figures show that international travel from the United States more than doubled in May 2022 compared with last year.
        But when you pack your bags, keep digestive health in mind. Tummy problems like diarrhea, constipation, and indigestion are all-too-common travel companions.
        ""Travel disrupts many of the body's natural rhythms, including digestion says Dr. Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist with Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Time changes, altered eating schedules, and impaired sleep are all likely culprits, especially in those who already have sensitive guts.""
        Here is a closer look at three common digestive upsets, how to prevent them, and how to manage them.
        Travel tummy: Diarrhea
        Diarrhea is the most common travel-related illness. Typically, people experience loose, watery stools with cramping and urgency. Diarrhea may arise from an infection caused by consuming food or water contaminated by bacterium or intestinal parasites, or be triggered by a change in environment or stress in people who have intermittent diarrhea.
        How to prevent diarrhea: Avoiding contaminated food and water and practicing good hygiene by washing hands often are the best ways to avoid travel diarrhea.
        
          Stay well-hydrated. In developing countries, factory-sealed bottled water is the safest option. (And always use bottled water for brushing your teeth.) Avoid ice because it may come from unclean water.
          Choose food and drinks carefully. Eat only foods that are cooked and served hot; avoid food that has been sitting on a buffet. Eat raw fruits and vegetables only after washing or peeling them in clean water.
          Wash your hands. Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water, especially after using the bathroom and before eating. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer as a backup.
        
        How to cope with diarrhea: Most episodes of diarrhea resolve on their own after a couple of days and are over within five days. However, see a doctor if you experience bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, and/or a fever, or if your diarrhea lasts for longer than a week or two.
        Otherwise, take these steps to help your recovery process:
        
          Replace lost fluids. Avoid dehydration by drinking bottled water and low-sugar sports drinks that contain electrolytes.
          Use over-the-counter products. Digestion relief medication that contains the active ingredients loperamide (Imodium) or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate) helps reduce the frequency of loose, watery stools and ease cramping. Take as directed.
        
        Travel tummy: Constipation
        Travel constipation happens when you don't keep to your regular schedule. Sitting for hours, like during a long flight and train or bus rides, and having your usual diet interrupted are two possible culprits. Constipation can last for a day or two or longer.
        How to prevent constipation: There are some pre-travel steps to help you avoid constipation, especially if you are prone to it.
        
          Increase fiber and fluids. Make sure your pre-travel diet includes plenty of fiber, which makes stools softer and more comfortable to pass. Foods high in fiber include many fruits, like apples (with the skin), raspberries, and pears; beans; and whole-grain foods such as bran cereal. You can also use fiber supplements like methylcellulose (Citrucel) and psyllium (Metamucil). Do not load up on too much fiber at once because this can lead to bloating and gas. You also need to drink enough water along with increased fiber intake.
        
        How to cope with constipation: Over-the-counter oral laxatives can help move everything along.
        
          Bulk-forming agents. These include calcium polycarbophil (FiberCon), methylcellulose (Citrucel), and psyllium (Metamucil). They take a day or so to work, but can be used indefinitely. Be sure to take them with plenty of liquids as directed on the label.
          Stool softeners. These medicines merge with stool and soften its consistency for easier passage. Look for products that contain docusate sodium (Colace, Surfak).
        
        Travel tummy: Indigestion
        Some things just don't agree with your body. Whether it's trying the local cuisines or eating more than usual, your stomach can get upset just like it might at home and trigger indigestion — stomach pain, bloating, and heartburn.
        How to prevent indigestion: Traveling can disrupt our usual dietary habits, so try to keep eating and drinking in check. For instance:
        
          Watch the drinking. Some people find that even occasional alcoholic beverages can trigger an episode, so do not overdo it.
          Avoid trigger foods. Many people with IBS have trouble tolerating foods high in carbohydrates known as FODMAPs (short for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). Common FODMAP foods are milk products, broccoli, beans and lentils, wheat, garlic, onions, apples, and fruit juices.
          Monitor portions. Overeating can raise the risk of indigestion. Focus on eating smaller servings and more frequent, smaller meals; for instance, small meals four times a day instead of three times.
          Slow down. Excess gas also can arise if you swallow too much air by eating too fast or talking while eating.
        
        How to cope with indigestion: Indigestion usually passes in a short time on its own, but there are ways to ease the process.
        
          Use over-the-counter remedies. Depending on your symptoms, you can benefit from

	antacid pills or liquidsupset-stomach medicine like bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate)an acid blocker for heartburn relief, such as a proton-pump inhibitor like omeprazole (Prilosec) or lansoprazole (Prevacid), or an H2 blocker like famotidine (Pepcid, Pepcid AC)An anti-gas remedy like Gas-X that contains simethicone.
        
        If you need to use these remedies regularly for more than a couple of weeks, contact your doctor.",Matthew Solan,"August 4, 2022",1
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/easy-delicious-summer-veggie-meals-will-help-stretch-your-food-budget-196912312795,"Easy, delicious summer veggie meals will help stretch your food budget","Meatless Mondays, meet summer's bounty: a wide variety of colorful, fresh summer vegetables now available in grocery stores, backyard gardens, and farmer's markets. We're talking sunshiny golden corn on the cob, deep purple eggplant, red beets, peppers of all hues, not to mention tomatoes, zucchini, green beans, cucumbers, and more. With a bit of simple prep, they're ready to take center stage on your plate, reinforcing the joy of summer.
        ""Vegetables in our diet provide many benefits. And when you create a meal centered around them, you're taking steps to improve and maximize your health,"" says Liz Moore, the author of a heart-healthy cookbook and a registered dietitian at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
        Centering healthy vegetables on your plate
        Making vegetables the stars of a meal is part of the ""veg-centric"" movement, which teaches people how to elevate even average vegetables to creative entrées and side dishes. The trend gives vegetables bold flavors by grilling, layering, caramelizing, or roasting them — steps you can take with a backyard grill or stovetop skillet.
        Summer veggie meals have lots of important health perks. ""Vegetables such as eggplant and beets of all colors are rich in fiber, Moore says. ""Eating a high-fiber diet helps lower cholesterol and is linked to heart health, digestive health, and helping to maintain stable blood sugar levels. For those trying to lose weight, vegetables are low in calories and provide volume, which helps keep you full.""
        Summer vegetables also have a wide variety of essential vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals (beneficial plant chemicals) like flavonoids. ""For example, carotenoids in cooked tomatoes are rich in lycopene, which is associated with inhibiting cancer growth and boosting the immune system. And beets are a good source of folate and potassium,"" Moore says.
        Three easy summer vegetable meals
        Wondering what to do with the colorful harvest available to you? Moore suggests keeping it simple by making a meal of vegetables paired with whole grains or legumes (beans or lentils). Here are three meals that fill the bill.
        
          Grilled eggplant steak with cucumber, tomato, onion, chickpea, and feta salad
        
        
          Slice an eggplant (from root to stem) into three-inch thick ""steaks."" On each side, drizzle olive oil and a little black pepper. Grill on both sides until tender.
          Dice two tomatoes, one cucumber, and half a red onion. Add a can of rinsed, drained chickpeas. Toss with a dressing of olive oil, a little red wine vinegar, and oregano to taste.
          Serve the salad over the eggplant steak. Top with some diced feta cheese, if you like.
        
        
          Veggie pita pocket with gazpacho
        
        
          Put a couple of tomatoes, a cucumber, a green pepper, half a red onion, some bread crusts, and a little olive oil into a blender. Blend until chunky or finer, as you prefer. Add salt, pepper, and cumin to taste, blending for a few more seconds. Chill for 30 minutes.
          Open a whole-wheat pita and spread a tablespoon of hummus inside. Add slices of zucchini and carrots, and some arugula, salad greens, or other vegetables that appeal to you.
          Serve the pita with half a cup of the gazpacho.
        
        
          Quinoa-stuffed red peppers
        
        
          Based on a recipe from BIDMC's CardioVascular Institute's Hungry Heart Cookbook by Liz Moore, RD, LDN
        
        
          Cut peppers in half, remove seeds, and lay them open side up on a dish.
          Mix cooked quinoa, diced tomatoes, and corn off the cob (you can grill the corn first and cut off the kernels for a special summer flair). Add low-fat grated cheddar cheese, canned (rinsed) black beans, one egg, and some spices to taste, such as a bit of cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper.
          Use the mixture to stuff the peppers evenly, and then cook them on the grill in a grilling basket for about 30 minutes. You can also cook them in the oven at 350° F on a cookie sheet or in a roasting pan, checking at 30 minutes to see if they are done.
        
        Other ideas include
        
          grilled veggie kebabs with chunks of eggplant, zucchini, cherry tomatoes, and mushrooms. Serve on a bed of lettuce and add a little goat cheese.
          whole-wheat pasta with a mix of sautéed vegetables that appeal to you.
          salad with green leaf lettuce, raw green beans, cherry tomatoes, Kalamata or black olives, and half a hard-boiled egg. Top with a dressing you enjoy.
        
        Which combinations of summer vegetables you choose can depend on cost, taste preferences, and how much time you want to spend cooking. If you're in a hurry, go with a salad. If you have more time, try grilling or sautéing vegetables.
        Finally, be open to inspiration from the bounty you see at the market. ""Focus on getting a variety of colors in the vegetables you choose. The more colors there are on the plate, the more nutrients you'll be consuming,"" Moore says. ""And try something new. Explore vegetables you've never tried before or new methods of cooking. Think of it as one of summer's glorious adventures.""",Heidi Godman,"August 3, 2022",1
